Honestly Shocked,"I'm honestly shocked this has a 6.8 on IMDb.A bunch of people used to a 'twist'?A bunch of people who think all alien movies must contain explosions?A combination of both?Great casting.Great acting.Great writing.Lots of tension.One of the most serious explorations of faith in cinema.Just an all around really good movie.Joaquin Phoenix steals the show.I will say, it does have a very morose vibe - being the back drop is everyone being sad because the mom had died. I wonder if that is what turned people off. The subject of aliens plays second fiddle to it.Yeah, if I had to put my finger on it, I'd bet that's it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
underrated film,"I don't think this film deserved the poor reviews that some gave it. I've only seen 3 of Night Shylaman's films (6th Sense, Unbreakable) and this one is the most sophisticated in my mind in terms of the director manipulating the viewers into seeing and believing what he wants you to believe.This is not Gibson's worst film by any means. If anything he gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character and I think he soft-sells it very well. Joaquin Phoenix also has a similar character to play and he too soft-sells it well. That was probably not an accident as their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in.If you haven't already, see it - and keep an open mind.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Now then, swing away Merill, again.","Signs is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.Still reeling from the death of his wife, former man of the cloth Graham Hess (Gibson) lives and works on his farm with his two young children and younger brother. When the family awakes one morning to find a huge crop circle in their plantation, it is asked if it's a prank or the sign of alien contact?I don't know if M. Night Shyamalan discouraged the marketing of Signs? Where evidence very much pointed to it being an alien invasion movie for all the family to enjoy? But Signs is anything but a family alien invasion movie. The trailers were deliberately vague, there was a mystery element hanging over the picture and with the Shyamalan CV already boasting the phenomenally successful The Sixth Sense and the divisive, but very moody, Unbreakable, hopes were pitched somewhere between excited and intrigued. Gibson on board, and Phoenix as well, good selling points without a doubt. However, Signs is a grower, a film that pays better dividends on further viewings once armed with the knowledge of what sort of theme drives it on. Yet it still frustrates greatly and you can see why it proved so divisive.Shyamalan's movie is primarily about faith, the loss of such, the alien visitors are merely a component of this theme, they act as the catalyst that takes Graham to the pinnacle of his voyage of discovery. The meditations on faith and grief are subtle initially but they drive the picture forward, but then Manoj Shyamalan slips into sermonising and his picture strives for a huge ending to justify it, which unfortunately never arrives, this after having been tickled and baited by the mystery of what the aliens want, friend or foe? Questions leap out such as will the Hess family come through this latest crisis in one piece? And will this ""invasion"" marry up with the director's thematics that he is so keen for us to open our hearts to? The answers to these questions are mixed, and take further viewings to digest fully. That is if you can forgive the downright idiocy of the alien visitors in the first place?The last third has killed the film for many, which is a shame given the excellence on offer in the first hour. Shyamalan's camera is wonderfully fluid, his mise en scène is ace and he garners wonderfully low-key performances from his cast. While as much as his critics hate to acknowledge it, the director has a brilliant knack for building suspense, the ability to draw the viewer into his world, playing on our basic inquisitive nature. That he hasn't delivered on his promise, both here with the finale to the film and later in his overall directing career (though this writer personally loves The Village), is hard to argue against, but there is major talent there buried in his egocentric/confused make up. Elsewhere, James Newton Howard's score is channelling Herrmann and Fujimoto's photography is sublime, this really is a beautiful movie to look at.Definitely not a family film, and not really an alien invasion film, with it showcasing both the good and bad aspects of its director. Yet still compelling and pretty enough to warrant a second viewing me thinks. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unspeakably brilliant,"In last week's issue of Newsweek, M. Night Shyamalan is quoted as saying to his accomplices in crime, ""If I did 'Pokemon 5,' would you come? Come on! I could turn it into a metaphor for the human condition!"" The scary thing about that comment is not only that he probably *could* do it if afforded the opportunity, but also that he pulls off a similar trick in ""Signs,"" which from an artistic standpoint is easily the best film he's ever done.The greater picture of the film is the crop signs that suddenly and quickly start appearing worldwide - and the question of whether they mean anything for mankind as a whole. But once the greater picture is laid out in the first twenty minutes, it takes a complete backseat to Shyamalan's happy & pained family of four, and focuses on their feelings, their worries, their doubts; as the horror of what's transpiring in the greater picture creeps closer to them.When Merrill says, ""It's like War of the Worlds,"" it's NOT hyperbole, even though we never see what transpires in the greater picture. Instead, Shyamalan focuses on the subtle nuances of the fear of the individual. Instead of seeing hundreds of soldiers fighting in hand-to-hand combat with gigantic bugs, we gain an appreciation of what it's like for those who aren't blessed with such courage - or, in Graham Hess' case, being able to find it again.This is the first horror movie I've ever seen that both genuinely scared me - because you sympathize with the family's plight, even without seeing it - and made me laugh at the same time, because the family's reaction to the terror unfolding in the world is a sign itself of a strength that most don't have - the ability to be levelheaded and always keep things in perspective, no matter how scary or ""out-there"" the situation is.As usual, Shyamalan gets excellent performances out of all of his actors, especially Willis & Breslin as Graham & Bo. As usual, everything you see means something - the trick, like with ""Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable, is whether or not you can put them all together. I'd be shocked, though, if this film doesn't get nominated for its sound - the soundtrack is Hitchcockian-creepy, and Shyamalan is a master at using sound effects to create the terror that the visual effects normally do.Don't go to ""Signs"" expecting a monster movie, or a shock ending, but definitely see it before the summer's out, and be prepared to be moved in ways that you previously couldn't have imagined from a horror or suspense film. It's been said that a genius of film is one who knows how to transcend or reinvent a genre - and with this film, M. Night Shyamalan is decidedly on his way there, if he hasn't already reached it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Moody , Atmospheric But Far From A Masterpiece","!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!There's a lot to commend M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS for . It's not often we see such a moody atmospheric thriller about an alien invasion and I will praise this movie later . However Shyamalan shots himself in the foot by the way the story is toldCrop circles appear outside the home of the Hess family and after Graham Hess and his brother Merril find out that it wasn't caused by local pranksters Graham's son Morgan comes up with the answer - It was done by aliens . He knows this because he read a book on the subject . Obviously everyone else in the world has read only one book - The same one as Morgan - because as soon as crop circles appear round the world it's the leading story and can mean only one thing: The aliens are coming . And sure enough just like everyone has predicted lights appear over Planet Earth's cities which herald the start of little green men come to wipe us outIf someone told you crop circles were signs on an alien invasion how would you react ? Exactly but at no point does anyone question a possible invasion because it's taken as read by all the characters in the story which starts to become ridiculous when the world's broadcasters start interrupting programmes showing the world wide phenomenon of crop circles . Let's be honest here jet liners crashing into sky scrapers is a good reason to interrupt TV shows with 24 hour news reports but people finding crop circles all over the world is notThere's one other thing : Ten year old Morgan seems to be channeling the minds of Newton , Darwin and Einstien . Listen to this kid's dialogue "" Everything people have written about in science books is about to change "" and there's several more instances of this . You can't take this child seriously or believe in him as a three dimensional characterMake that two things : Why would aliens invade a planet whose surface is composed of 70% water ? Isn't the human body two thirds water anyway. Oh and how does Graham's neighbour know that the aliens don't like water anyway ?Better make that three things because if the subtext is about rediscovering ones faith then why is everyone certain of an approaching invasion ? Surely for this theme to work then Graham should have been shouting from the roof tops that aliens don't exist only to be proved wrong . If he's wrong about aliens then surely he's wrong about the non existence of the lord right ?It's a great pity that Shyamalan didn't think these things through a bit further because despite not ruining the movie these things stop SIGNS becoming a masterpiece of genre cinema which it certainly had the potential to be . Even a critical viewer like myself who noticed the flaws couldn't help being terrified by the climax in the cellar where for one heart stopping moment it looked like a couple of the characters had been abducted . As for the scene Graham sees the reflection in the TV .... I certainly can't fault the good bits and I will recommend this movie even to those who don't like SF/Horror very much . Certainly it's a radical change to watch a film like this that doesn't have tens of millions spent on special effects and the film works better for it . You reading this Mr Spielberg ?Shyamalan will best be remembered for THE SIXTH SENSE , a film that I found somewhat overrated while his follow up UNBREAKABLE was a masterpiece in my opinion . SIGNS is slightly different because it doesn't have one of those shock twist endings and when you consider what a poor film THE VILLAGE is one can't help thinking that Shyamalan would be better off abandoning clever endings and concentrating on terrifying audiences and I would wonder if he could get away with directing a Hollywood version of Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT . Now that would be worth queuing at the cinema forUpdate 30 dec : Some have mentioned that the concept of predestination is very important to understanding the movie ie the plot holes aren't actually plot holes viewed this way and while this makes absolute sense in a metaphysical way it still misses out on logic",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Probably, one of the best alien movies","The plot of the movie was very interesting and so mysterious. The storyline was very well written, totally different than any other alien movies. The filming location of the movie was basic, just an old farmhouse, but I really liked it! The characters were very interesting, so likeable and well-developed. The casting was really good and the acting was nice. The opening scene of the movie was kinda intense and totally unexpected. Overall, it was an unexpected movie that didn't had many plot twists nor jumpscares. But, it was very intense and so creepy (especially, the scenes that the aliens were shown in the screen). Alien's design was just fine, not very realistic but they were terrifying. In my opinion, it's probably one of the best alien movies I have ever seen! It was so good and I would definitely, recommend it to anyone. Last but not least, the ending scene was totally unexpected and kinda shocking.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Seeing The Small Picture,"During the course of the film Joaquin Phoenix's character remarks that the situation they're in seems like The War Of The Worlds. It certainly is, but the small picture of it.Whereas H.G. Wells wrote on the grand scale about what nations and governments were doing to fight an alien invasion, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs concerns itself with the small picture, what is happening in one tiny corner of the world, to be precise Bucks County, Pennsylvania and very specifically Mel Gibson and his family.One day farmer Gibson who used to be a minister woke up and found that his cornfield had been systematically decimated and a precise geographical pattern was laid out that could be seen from the air. He concluded it was some kind of prank which would have been the normal reaction of anyone. But when reports of the world wide similar crop defilings and then sitings of shadowy alien figures than the world is in a crisis mode.But the world is on the back-burner for Gibson. He was a clergyman but gave it up after the death of his wife who was hit by a drunk driver. He's got his own issues to deal with if he can get himself, his children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin and brother Joaquin Phoenix through the ordeal. All this without knowing how the world in general is coping. Gibson and the family can only speculate and that's where imaginations run wild.I have to say that Mel Gibson does a thoroughly good job as an everyman caught up in a global crisis. When War Of The Words was made by George Pal in the Fifties, the leads Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were scientists who had vital information for the survival of the world. The globe is still at risk in Signs, but Mel and his family can't worry about that, just in keeping themselves alive.Signs is thinking science fiction ranking up there with the best work of Ray Bradbury and John Heinlein. It's both entertaining and engrossing, you can't ask for more from a film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Much To Enjoy, But Somehow Short of the Mark","In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style. Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield. He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities. But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.The small cast is extremely, extremely good. I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown a bit since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well. Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.What isn't flawless is the story. The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick. I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed. There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark. Entertaining nonetheless.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually terrific,"M. Night Shyamalan has done it again, and this time, better.   If 'Unbreakable' left skepticism about the young director, `Signs' will make you a believer again.Mel Gibson and his family, one boy, one girl, and Gibson's younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) take residence in the small town of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Gibson's wife is not a member of this household (we find out why, later).  Shot over and around a 'Walton's-style' house and surrounded by crops, we get the eerie feeling that we are to be entangled here for the next two hours.  Immediately, the children notice gigantic perfect circular shapes or signs as we like to call them, appearing within the crops.  Is this a hoax or War of the Worlds?  And, that's all you need to know.  The rest of film will dazzle you with style, suspense, and downright scariness.The key ingredients to this recipe for storytelling is one half Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a dash of Stephen King, sprinkled with Orson Wells.  Shyamalan also uses Hitchcock like close ups, wicked camera angles, and a blasting score.  You are locked in as soon as the movie begins.  You will tilt your head in wonder and confusion, as characters in the film do. There is a deep desire to figure this all out, while your stuck in the middle of nowhere, nowhere being Bucks County.The picture gives us two ultimate dilemmas to wrestle with.  Two basic questions we must ask ourselves.  Are our daily occurrences and the paths we choose Coincidence?  Or, are is it just plain Luck? Shyamalan weaves these posing questions into a subplot, with trickery until the end.  From scene to scene, he leaves no fades to black. As one scene ends the other smartly begins.  That's what keeps the audience watching as if we were tucked tightly into our beds and rapidly turning pages of a good book.  Each page is significant.  This movie isn't just about crops.  That's what makes Shyamalan such a keen filmmaker.  He has the talent and ability to fog up the film, and distract you with different propositions.Shyamalan uses technique to peak his story, rather than dialogue.  His masterful and favorite formula is the usage of flashbacks, which gives the audience a chance to catch up on what they might have missed.  He emphasizes his points by re-occurring scenes and replaying them for the grand effect, the 11th hour, until he hits you with the finale.  Whether you believe the outcome or not, you cannot deny his aptitude for storytelling.This nervous and paranoid feature film with a heart-pounding ending is terrific.  I was still thinking about it when I left the theater.  You too, will enjoy the ride.  But, when it's over, say your prayers, get into bed, pull the sheets over your head, breathe a sigh of relief, and close the book!",,Anonymous,Mystery

Lower Expectations Helped A Lot,"I had the advantage of hearing nothing but bad things about this film before I saw it, so my expectations were low.

That is, until, the strange turn of events at the end of the movie.Hey, it's an entertaining movie, with good suspense and very little offensive material. This is the typical M.

"A big commercial package, engrossing and sometimes hugely entertaining","A widowed ex-minister in Pennsylvania, living on a farm with his kids and his ex-ball player brother, believes the crop circles on his land (as well as the ones profiled on the news) may be indicative of something other-worldly. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, who understands commercial movie-making these days as well as any other filmmaker, tends to get bogged down in pretensions, but where his dialogue is sometimes gummy, his characters are complicated and relatable. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are wonderfully convincing as the brothers unexpectedly caught up in the supernatural, never letting their lived-in relationship hit a false note. Shyamalan is terrific at staging a big scary moment, and any of the sequences involving Gibson and his family are enjoyable, but the more intimate, two-character scenes stall the momentum (particularly one involving Shyamalan himself as a co-star). Still, with all its faults--and a too-literal final act--""Signs"" knows how to get reactions from its audience, and it is clever and canny if not quite hair-raising. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

2) People who get it and are deeply moved because they have experienced it in their own lives (not the aliens, but the real topic of the movie) - and for them, this movie is one of the most brilliant movies ever.That said, whatever group you belong in, there aren't many movies with such moving acting chemistry, believable dialogue and emotional buildup.And in the end, even if you don't get it, I'd recommend you keep the idea of the movie in the back of your mind.

This means something.,"Most of the people that comment on this movie are going to relate the fact that they were disappointed. And that's okay- your opinion of a movie should always include your pre-showing as well as post-showing emotions. But to those people I just have to say, ""You just don't get it."" Everyone is going into this movie thinking it is some kind of chilling horror, or blood-and-gore slasher flick. Shyamalan doesn't do those tired genres, thankfully. Instead, he gives us a warm, funny, emotionally-charged, and yes, suspenseful thriller which manages to compact an entire list of genres into one whole film.I have seen the movie twice already- the first time for myself, and the second time just for crowd reactions.

Mad Mel's Mrs DiesAgain! (This is not a spoiler),"You know, you'd have to be seriously worried if you were Mel's wife in film. Black men in 1970s action flicks have a more tenacious grip on life. At least they generally cark it at the end of the film, gallantly laying down their lives when victory is at hand so the goody-goody white boy can ride off into the white-only sunset with a tasty bit of crumpet.Mel's wives/girlfriends/love interests rarely make it past the opening credits.Yep, Mad Mel has lost his Mrs and is mean as hell. But this time its god he's p* ssed with. Can even Mad Mel mess with the messiah? Sure he can.Oh, and there are some aliens as well Ho Hum.Signs is the third of the almost invariably enjoyable M Night Shyamalan films. It is a long way from being his best.This is not, as many have said, because the film contains little in the way of ""twist"". Last time I checked, many great films had no twist at all and were still great. And Shyamalan's style is far more dependent on building suspense than pulling an unusually coloured rabbit out of the hat at the end of the last real. But such is the joy of Hollywood. Make one film with a great twist, and be forced to repeat it.Shyamalan once again does a great job with suspense. Once again, family is integral to the plot. But the real core of this film is faith. Mel, you see, has a dead Mrs, and he knows who's responsible. Apparently, it's none other than god. Phwewee, somebody's gonna get hurt. Reeeal Bad!Okay, this is mildly diverting for a while. Mystic Mel does a pretty good job of the whole ""I'm not wasting another moment of my life on prayer"" thing. Possibly the pain of him having to say these lines happily coincided with the pain of the character. Or am I being cynical? Mel can certainly act when he can be bothered, as he frequently showed  sometime south of 1986.The supporting cast is also superb. Joachim Phoenix is excellent, as are the two kids. Cherry Jones does an excellent job as the benevolent, Fargo-esquire local copper shorn of all the Coenisms.There was some great comedy. Mel walking into his living room to find Joachim and the two kids on the sofa with two boxes of bacofoil on their heads was a fantastic touch. And, dare I say it, Mel's personal leitmotif  the untimely demise of his better half  left a genuine lump in my throat.But there are two fundamental problems with the film.The first is the aliens. They just get in the way. Okay, they provide the basis for the suspense. Okay, there are some interesting parallels to be drawn between faith in god and the nutters out looking for aliens in prairie country. And I suppose the fact that the nutters are right in Signs adds some significance to Mel's own character development. But I can't help thinking that it is attempting to juxtapose the essentially frivolous with the deadly serious - and not very well  The Village does it much better. So, in M Night's film the nutters are right. But we all know (don't we?) that in reality, they're just nutters. So is it an apt metaphor or just all hogwash? The second problem is the finale. I'm biased possibly but to me it just didn't make sense. ""The Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh Away  seemingly on the basis of his own personal whimsy"". I'm not convinced that this is a good basis for the massive character shift undergone by Melvine the Terrible, and you're left with the conclusion that either he's not a very clear thinker at all, or he's been throwing a rather childish tantrum for most of the rest of the film. Neither lend the script credibility.Watch the Village is my recommendation. It's a massively under-estimated film (possibly Shyamalan's best). In many respects it is a half-remake of Signs, and is somehow less trite.A minor work of a very good filmmaker. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic Movie,"This is definitely one of the best movies that I have seen in years.  The dialogue is smart, the camera work is perfect and the information and background setting are divulged to the audience at precisely the right pace and exactly the right moment.  Mel Gibson turns in his best performance that I can remember and so does Pheonix, who is extremely funny and plays a very real and well defined character.  The movie is coincidently the scariest movie that I can remember seeing in theatres, and the scary moments are guaranteed to haunt you for a few days afterwards at least, but the movie is so much better than that and its so much more than a movie about aliens.  As everyone knows from reviews, ""Signs"" means more than just crop signs, but ""signs"" are never portrayed in a cheesy way, but in a realistic and honest sense, and capturing such a deep topic without going overboard or making a mockery of it seems very hard these days, so that makes the film all the more impressive.

Great while watching but...,"I had a lot of unanswered questions afterwords. M. Night Shyamalan is a great visual director...there are some beautiful shots here. But with plots...Farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds gigantic, interconnected circles in his cornfield. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and Graham's two children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) think there's something supernatural going on. Graham disagrees...until things start getting real scary. Also Graham keeps having nightmares about his dead wife who died in a car accident and made him give up being a pastor...SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The film is very creepy and eerie in the first half (the first full view of the aliens made me jump and the pantry sequence!) but drops the ball in the second half. For one thing, you think it's an alien invasion story but it turns into a story about faith. The aliens are just there as a plot device!Also giving us long shots of the aliens was not a good idea--it's very clear that they're guys in rubber suits. Still, it did scare me occasionally.MORE SPOILERS!!!! But, afterwords, I had a lot of questions. Why do the aliens (who can be killed by water) attack a planet that is 3/4 water? Why do they attack in the first place (there's something about harvesting people...what does that mean?)? One alien is locked inside a pantry and can't get out???? Also how exactly are they defeated at the end (we're not told)? These are nagging questions that I couldn't shake off.And the film is quiet...way too quiet at times. And the faith story is awkwardly handled.The acting doesn't help. Gibson is blank-faced the entire time and Culkin and Breslin are terrible. Phoenix tries but the slow pace and insistence on quiet drags him down.So, it's worth seeing...if you don't think about it afterwords.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Phoenix 1  Aliens 0,"One wishes Signs to have lived to the potential it shows in the first part, where we are engrossed in what's going on, scared at times and amused by this mysterious film.M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful in his previous features. This, unfortunately, falls flat just when a very strong ending is needed. Like many other fans, I felt manipulated and let down by this movie.It's very easy to see what's going on in the Mel Gibson's character. His loss of faith, his grief for a lost wife, his fears of confronting reality and moving on with his life. Those things are deeper than what we are let to know, because on the surface it is one thing, but deep down it has nothing to do with the obvious 'signs' of the title. The fact that he's a religious figure is even more confusing. Obviously, he must be a protestant minister, what with the family and all, but there are moments that are puzzling because of this ambiguity.Had this script been brought to the screen with a lesser known director, it probably would have had a more satisfactory resolution, because the ending, with Joaquin at the bat, is very hard to swallow.Let's hope Mr. Night Shyamalan finds his way for the next time out.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As the storyline behind the crop circles unfolds so does the backstory of the family. This movie is directed by and stars M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and the cast also includes Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator), Rory Culkin (Scream 4) and Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine).

Gibson was perfect portraying a man battling his inner demons after the passing of his wife. This may be his all time best performance. Joaquin Phoenix is a super star. Period. When Culkin looks at him and says ""I wish you were my father,"" and Phoenix ripped that line, ""Don't you ever say that again."" Masterpiece. The chemistry between the cast top to bottom was so good. The pace of the alien invasion is well done and allowed time for the passing of the mother storyline, which was so good.

Riveting and clever scarefest reinvents the modern horror film,"I have been a horror film fan for 30 years.  While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life.  I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the ""system"", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film;  I genuinely disagree.  If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre.  I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room  whose source he won't reveal .  This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures.  And those pictures can be the most frightening of all.  Stay the course Shyamalan.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Attempt at Hitchcockian suspense,"Decent acting from the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. M. Night Shyamalan played a small part himself, and did well. I can see why this film interested Mel Gibson, with the aspects of his character's faith journey. River Phoenix and the minor cast were all adequate. Despite plot holes, which most science-fiction films have, this film is largely Hitchcockian. Rather than concerning itself with explicit exposition, the main point, aside from the faith journey mentioned earlier, was the building of suspense, which requires things to be imagined, rather than shown. Some of this build-up was truly creepy. Overall it was okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing horror to watch here,"Signs is a M. Night Shyamalan written and directed movie starring Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin. This was the second time watching this movie and it was not any better. The slow melodramatic storyline did not help the uncharacteristically horror like filming. Gibson played a reverend and a farmer who had lost his wife in a car accident that Shyamalan played as the driver who fell asleep at the wheel. The family dealt with crop circles on their farm and experienced signals from aliens. War of the World is much better than this flick. I watched it to see if there was something I missed the first time around. Great actors, compelling story but would not watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb movie from golden age movies of Mr. M. Night Shyamalan,"Greetings from Lithuania.I have seen Signs (2002) back upon its release 20 years ago. Time flies fast if you think. I really liked this movie back then, i enjoyed it now in 2022 upon re-watching it for a second time. It is a really good movie with mystery, great acting, superb writing and directing by the biggest star of this movie in my opinion -
M. Night Shyamalan. His movies were events 20 years ago. Not so much today, although I still going to a movie theater when his movie come out. Sadly there is nothing near as good as Signs were. And this movie, despite some questionable ending with aliens - i guess there are no spoilers to a movie 20 year old, still holds up very well because it main theme is not about invasion - its about fate and hope, because even most horrible thing in our life can lied to a good things, like everything has a meaning, despite how horrible it might look.Overall, Signs is very good movie. Superbly paces, superbly acted, written and directed it hold up and it is still of the
M. Night Shyamalan's best movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An underrated film which will scare you to the core,"""Signs"" is directed by ""M. Night Shyamalan.It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Abigail Breslin, Rory Culkin, Cherry Jones and the director himself.This sci-fi horror film follows a former Pasteur named ""Graham Hess"" who is living a peaceful life with his brother, son and daughter after his wife died in a car collision. But when strange large symbols appear in his cornfield and ones across the world. Him and his family find out aliens are invading the earth. ""Graham"" must protect his family while the aliens attack the planet.I'm not a massive fan of ""Shyamalan's films. He's made some fantastic movies and some of the worst. He's had a weird career. I think this film is in the good category. This is one of his best films.The positivesThe acting in this film from the majority of actors is brilliant. ""Mel Gibson"" is fantastic as always. He steals the show for me. ""Joaquin Phoenix"" is one of my favourite actors and he proves himself worthy even more in this film. Even the director himself is really good when he has his scene. Overall the acting was brilliant and the actors had a lot of chemistry. The story and characters are well written in this film as-well. ""Shyamalan"" takes what could be a boring and predictable story concept and takes it to the next level. This film explores themes such as faith and loss. The character of ""Graham"" is interesting and likeable. His backstory is gut wrenching and you understand why he left his role as the ""father"" in his church. I won't spoil the ending but it's such a great final shot. Not only is it done well emotionally but you feel a great sense of accomplishment. The character of ""Merrill"" is well written. He gets a lot of development. By the end he finally understands what his mother meant when she said ""swing away"". He is one of if not the main hero of the film by the end and once again it's satisfying and emotionally compelling. This film is also incredibly scary. The scene where we see the camera footage of the alien made me shiver as you get no warning. The way the creature walked and how it looked was just so scary. When the family is in the basement, there is so much tension. Seeing the little boy ""Morgan"" have an asthma attack after an alien grabbed him is so tense and scary. The stakes are high in this film that you struggle to watch sometimes. The camerawork is great in this film too. So many shots are elongated and are filmed in single shots. The actors also do spectacular to act and remember their lines for those scenes. The editing is great as-well. When a tense scene happens, there's not much editing as it makes you have a feeling your in the moment with the family. This builds more tension in the scenes. Now this is where I get into heavy spoilers as it involves the ending. The twist with the water is understandable. We know that the girl ""Bo"" is having dreams about the aliens taking damage to water so that makes sense. I see that people hate the twist because the aliens should know the planet is mostly covered in water. So why are they invading it? The fact is they're not really invading it. In a scene near the end, there's a radio broadcast saying a vital piece of information on why the aliens came here. I won't say what is said but if you listen to it and remember it then the film will make more sense. Finally, I just want to say that the cornfield symbols are not CGi. They are actually cut by real people for the film. Why can't we do this more today instead of overusing CGI? It adds more realism.The negativesWhile I do like the design of the aliens, I do not like the CGI. It's very dated. The aliens look plastic when they're fully shown. But I'm glad that they are in shadow for most of the film so you don't realise it as much. The child actors at the time were not great. It's strange. Sometimes they're good then sometimes they're not. It took me out of the film sometimes unfortunately. Finally, the twist does have flaws. I understand the aliens came to harvest humans but you think they may have a little bit of knowledge about the water hurting them. But for me that's only a small nitpick.ConclusionI really like signs. In my opinion, it's underrated. The only flaws is some CGI and the child actors performances. Apart from that, the film is scary and full of tension, the acting is great, the characters and story are well written. The twist makes sense for the most part, the camerawork and editing is fantastic and it's emotionally driving. If you didn't like this film when you watched it, I'd watch it again and listen to the radio broadcast. The film may satisfy you more in the end.I'm going to give ""Signs"" a:8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"This is a bad, bad movie.","Went with a friend last night to see Signs.It is one of the worst films I have ever endured in my life.Not just ""Oh my, that was a waste of $9"" bad (like I found The Grinch and Death To Smoochy to be).  More ""I cannot believe that anyone in their worst, most deluded, crack-addled moments would think this had the merest potential of being a good movie."" bad.Fairly dull throughout, but the ending had me & me partner slack-jawed with incredularity, as master storyteller M.

I can watch brain-dead and/or bad movies, and enjoy them.

"There are those who believe and those who do not, what are you?","My thoughts on M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNSRated: PG (Canada), PG-13 (U.S.)Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Kulkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and M Night Shayamalan""Daddy there's a monster beside my bed, can I have a glass of water?""When Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) discover 50 ft circle and square shapes carved in their crops, the two try and find out the truth behind what is going on. However, what Graham learns soon is that the battle he will soon be facing is not that of extra terrestrial beings but that within his own self.In facing a universal theme of life on other planets, Shyamalan's handling is different from your ordinary type of supernatural movie. This is because the underlying theme of this movie is not aliens, but in fact, it is faith. Faith in something larger, faith of miracles, faith that nothing in this life is coincidental and everything happens for a reason. The theme of this movie is not survival of outer forces rather than survival of internal and seemingly more powerful than what is even happening outside.There is not a single movie that is out there which scares the viewer on a level of things they are NOT seeing rather than what they do see. It does not deserve to be classified in any category because this film is in a league of its own. The base of supernatural and extra terrestrial beings in this case forms the base for human self exploration and finding who they truly are.PERFORMANCESIn all sequences, Shyamalan concentrates on character development and even from the first scene, we seemingly have a look into the world of a man, who is emotionally wounded, and yet silent and powerful. Shyamalan has gone with Mel Gibson to play the title role, which some fans of M. Night would have rather gone with Bruce Willis who has played the quiter type role in Sixth Sense and even starred in Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"". However, from the very first frame, you can see that Gibson becomes the role and lives through the role. In terms of his performance, the transformation he goes through the entire frame of the movie really is a true testament to the powerful skill that this actor embodies. In many scenes, his eyes do the talking, and it takes a powerful director to really capitalize on what Gibson does in this type of role.Joaquin Phoenix, playing Graham's brother Merill, is a powerful support in the movie. His character gains a lot of sympathy. Even as he is trying to find his place in the world, his support for his family is unwavering, making this role one of the most sympathetic and yet powerful roles the talented actor has ever faced.Once again, Shyamalan gets unbelievably powerful performances from his child artistes in this movie. Rory Culkin, playing Graham's son in the movie, as well as Abigial Breslin, give such emotion filled performances that it really surprises us that Shyamalan can extract performances of this calibre from them.Even Cherry Jones, who plays the local police officer, puts in a realistic and heartfelt performance as the local police officer in Graham's community.Finally, Shyamalan himself makes a mark in the film. His role is an essential one and yet does not require many scenes. Shyamalan pulls them off with full ease and power.DIRECTION/SCREENPLAYIf you try and compare ""Signs"" to any previous movies you may be able to find some ground from this movie in Shyamalan's first movie, ""The Sixth Sense"". However, in terms of comparisons, this is where they end. Shyamalan knows how to create and move in terms of environment, which is very important for all his movies. Shyamalan's direction is powerful and really gets under the skin of the characters.Being a thriller, Shyamalan has used an older technique, where he uses comedy to offset a particular mood, even in the gravest of scenes. Shyamalan pulls this off extremely well, even as the screenplay pulls into frightening moments. It takes a brilliant filmmaker to do something like this even when the mood of the scene is totally contrasting to that of what the audience is experiencing.Its something refreshing to see a brand new director like Shyamalan using the rules of filmmaking that have been forgotten by many of the newer filmmakers these days into making something so powerful and so refreshingly different for the summer. While many new filmmakers base their movies on subjects that really don't take any risks, Shyamalan has made a seemingly new genre, one of self exploration and discovery while in the face of fear or adversity. There is no other film like this one, as it takes two genres and really powers itself into making a seemingly hard hitting combination.Even the title of the film has a meaning, as the signs are everywhere. There are subtle and hidden messages everywhere, from the scene where Merill is in the Army office and the Recruiter is speaking, or the flashback sequences which Mel Gibson has of a particular incident in his life.OVERALL EFFECTThis film is unlike any other film to have ever come out in the genre of supernatural thriller or drama. Its something that lets you leave the cinema thinking truly that in this life there are no coincidences and things happen for a reason. As Gibson said in the film, there are two kinds of people. There are those who believe that everything happens for a reason and that we are not alone; and there are those who believe that we live in metaphysical solitude. There are people with faith and without it. He now has to figure out which group he belongs to, and so he does in the chilling climax.The film is one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I have witnessed and simply put is a much watch.Rating: 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Stop ""Signs""","We watched this movie Saturday night. While the pace is much like watching grass, or corn, grow, you eventually get sucked into the whole, silly plot which is about aliens landing in a corn field in Kansas and, instead of taking over the state capitol, or a 7-11, they concentrate all their energy on taking over a farm house where 4 people live. I have some questions! Why is it that aliens, who have the technology that allows them to travel 100's of thousand's of light years, can't open a door? Maybe the aliens aren't from ""out there."" Maybe they are by products of genetically altered corn. Maybe water makes them swell up and pop. And, why is corn a symbol of evil, or creepiness? I realize that it is a recyclable food, but evil? I just don't get it. Also, what does Mel Gibson do for a living now that he is unfathered; what does his brother do besides smoke and watch television in a closet? Why don't the kids go to school? Why is no one bothered when the boy murders his dog with a serving fork? What happened to the meat on the barbecue? Where's PETA in all this? Why are there 1252 half empty water glasses all over the farm house. I realize the daughter has a problem with water (hmm, maybe she's part alien), but doesn't any one ever clean a glass? Don't they ever run out of water glasses? Do you have 1252 water glasses in your house? Why does the younger brother hit the water glasses with his baseball bat? Wouldn't it have been easier, and more accurate, just to throw water on the alien? How can you break a bat on a water glass? How come the alien can't get through the wood slats nailed to the windows, but can carve strange patterns in the same wood. It seems to me that he (it?) would just make one of those patterns bigger, and he's (it's) in. Why does Mel Gibson, who is the father who was a Father, lose his faith when his wife is killed, but get it back when an alien is watered to death in his house? Why didn't the aliens bring raincoats, and umbrellas? Why does the boy who has asthma and sucks on his inhaler every 30 seconds throughout the entire movie not have the inhaler when he is in the basement? Why is the boy dead and then not dead? Is it a miracle, or is it Hollywood? Why was this movie made? Did anyone actually read this script before the movie was made? Why did we watch it? Will all these questions be answered in the Director's Cut? Or, will it only get sillier?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
not your typical sci-fi thriller,"If you went to this movie expecting a typical sci-fi thriller, you doubtless left disappointed.  If you went to this movie to see an M. Shamalayan Night film, you probably loved it, as I did.For me, the sci-fi aspects were a device to explore the lost faith of the Mel Gibson character, a man who had abandoned the ministry after a tragedy struck his family.  The film asks the questions, are we alone in the world (and he's not talking about aliens) and is there such a thing as a coincidence?  In one particularly striking scene, as he talks with his brother, Gibson's bitterness comes through.I happen to think there's a place for spirituality in film and I love Night's take on it.  I also like his old-fashioned type of film-making, the way he pays hommage to the greats and the way he surprises us.  Night believes we don't listen enough, and if we do, there are messages abounding for us.

One of the best movies of 2002 so far,"A scary-looking monster is not needed in this movie. Just simply the fear of the unknown is enough. But just in case that's not enough for YOU, you will also get creepy sounds & very frightening situations. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that some of the stuff that is on the news on the TV in the movie is some of the scariest material in the movie. While all the things on the news in this movie are pretty freaky, there is one news clip in particular that I think really scared mostly everyone (maybe everyone) in the audience. So basically, don't go to this movie expecting to see a bunch of man-killing freaky-looking aliens. If you want something like that, rent ""Alien"".All of the actors in this movie do a terrific job. The kids were great, which was unexpected for me. And as for the director...well, M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He is the Alfred Hithcock of our time (note that he is nowhere as even remotely great as Hitchcock, I was just saying for our time). And he is now one of my favorite directors. With ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", he manages to make movies that can truly terrify the audience, and he doesn't use blood & gore, he uses suspense and just simple horror. They are both only rated PG-13, and are both real crowd-scarers, which tells you this guy is really something.To sum it up: This is one of VERY VERY few movies that had me laughing out loud one minute, and then jumping out of my seat in shock the next. Lots of laughs, great acting, awesome directing, truly terrifying material, shock value, all the suspense you can handle and then some, what more do you want from a movie?

The sci-fi elements are at a minimal level, but they are not really necessary in this kind of story, in fact I think that even without the aliens the film would work.

I really liked that, plus I think it's the most realistic presentation of an alien invasion, at least that's how I would see it if it happened in real life.However, towards the end it deflates a bit, I didn't expect a classic M.

Signs,"It's barely over an hour and a half this film, but it seems much longer. Mel Gibson (""Graham"") is a widowed former pastor who lives on a farm with his two kids ""Morgan"" (Rory Culkin) and ""Bo"" (Abigail Breslin) and his brother ""Merrill"" (Joaquin Phoenix). Their lives are all rolling along normally until one morning they discover some crop circles amongst the corn fields. Dismissing them as hoaxes, they are intrigued when television reports suggest a proliferation of these things all around the world. Now add to their now heightened suspicions some late night noises and mysterious happenings, and the family begin to suspect that they are being watched - and that their observer is not exactly benign. The last ten minutes or so redeem this story to a degree, but for the most part it is a terribly slow burn of a film. There isn't really much by way of action; Gibson and Phoenix don't really exude much of a compelling sibling relationship and the kids - usually a crucial conduit for M. Night Shyamalan stories have much less to work with here. This has more of the melodrama to it - the backstory of tragedy and grief all gets in the way of the gradually increasing sense of menace and I found the whole momentum of the story quite staccato.

Feels Like A Sci-Fi Movie From The 1950's,M. Night Shyamalan has the touch for making movies that make you think instead of carrying you through the film by dramatic special effects. The story of an alien invasion and crop circles feels like something from the 1950's film Invaders From Mars. Signs has a good plot but it seems to be missing more of the action and suspense that audiences today demand.

"""Is it possible there are no coincidences?""","There are plenty of movies that use the idea of aliens invading and attacking earth. Some are good, some are incredibly bad. Signs uses that concept but follows through on it in a way I've never seen before. Instead of showing a bunch of stories like what the president is doing about this, the army fighting the aliens, and showing hundreds of people running and screaming, this movie shows how most people would probably be experiencing this: at home, anxiously watching the news for information. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes that are scary not because of what you see, but because of what you don't see, and what you are afraid to see.Many people love this movie for doing this, others hate it for it. If you're a fan of movies full of alien carnage with creatures biting the heads off people and blowing up cities, Signs may not be for you. But like all of M. Night's films, it still makes a pretty good movie without the main concept. It's actually a pretty touching story about family, faith, and the possibility that there are no coincidences and there is a reason behind everything.

Works up some eerie suspense but is ultimately unsatisfying...,"Most of the suspense is well geared to keep you wondering how on earth this plot is going to be unraveled--but when the windup comes it's a disappointment in more ways than one. I was with the story until the last fifteen minutes when the whole thing just fell apart--but along the way there are many things to admire.The performances are all first-rate, although I would have preferred a better, more appealing child actor than Rory Culkin as the son who reads up on aliens. He lacks the distinct personality of his more famous brother. Abigail Breslin, on the other hand, is a sheer delight in her role, reminiscent of Drew Barrymore in ""ET"". Joaquin Phoenix does a standout job as Mel Gibson's brother who can wield a mean baseball bat and Gibson himself is so subdued for a change that it makes you wonder if he really believed in the script. Phoenix and his relationship with the children provides some humorous highlights that are welcome in this kind of intense story. It's nice to see him in a more wholesome role than usual.The suspense is guaranteed to keep you glued to the screen until the letdown of an ending. Just be advised that there are compensations for keeping a sharp eye on the film before the disappointing denouement. M. Night Shyamalan can be praised for an original script and some smart direction--but too bad the religious aspects of the story were so muddled as to seem foolish. James Newton Howard's score is highly effective for this kind of story, especially toward the end.Enjoy at your own risk because along the way the contrivances show.",,Anonymous,Mystery
It's okay,The cinematography has an individual style and maintains foreboding. The CGI looks poorly integrated and dated. The sound design is subtle yet very effective. There are good and bad points about this movie. The fear is constant and menace feels very real. There are some stunning scare and spine-tingling moments. The use of seemingly irrelevant story arcs adds to the interest that is until they become relevant and then we just have a stupid twist that was not needed. The director cannot act and drags down the quality. It is the ending that really drags it down. It could have been handled with so much more subtlety and fear and without the need of a twist ending. Overall though the atmosphere and unnerving suspense is the real winner.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not enough Alien and too much mush!!!!,"They really could have done great things with this movie -- it was so slow... and not enough of the Alien and the Alien Spacecrafts and Alien details.

Don't judge a movie by its rating,"A Sci fiction story that starts strong with aliens theory and maintains the suspense throughout its plotting as it goes on.Performance by each actor and actress along the kid actors, feels strong, silly and serious when it's time to get serious.It has some good unpredictable moments. And these moments come swinging out of nowhere and hits hard most times. Each and every scenes are directed masterfully.What I loved most about the screenplay is it's unintentional comedy which which happens often(I loved that about this movie) but in all of that it still maintain it's thrilling plots. Its definitely intentional most of the times because damn it's hilariously funny, I love it.Whole movie is shot in such a way that gives out both the creepy and unnerving feeling in the air. Also if it wasn't for the explosive music and unexpected audio effects, the scenes wouldn't have hit as intensely they do.8/10.Thank you for reading this :)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Love Everything But the Ending,"Much like The Sixth Sense, it took me probably too long to check out M. Night's faith based thriller, and for the most part, it lived up to the hype. However, the ending and certain plot explanations were laughable and ruined some of the experience for me. But his slow burn approach to this sci-fi thriller is admirable and undoubtedly influential to its core. I almost would have preferred even fewer answers than we got.

A wonderful combination,"The dialog is masterful with well-blended elements of introspection and humor. ""Signs"" is in no way a comedy, but there are deeply humorous images and dialog in this film that contribute much to the film without any detraction at all. Laughing out loud is more than a texting tic with ""Signs.""Characters are developed quite well and so deeply that you forget the actors and become engulfed in their characters. The director and his crew create a very believable, dimensioned world.

"Gibson and Shyamalan Try to Avoid Threats, External and Otherwise","Mel Gibson joins M. Night Shyamalan in hiding away from all sorts of aggressive unpleasantness. The primary threat may be a race of intruding extraterrestrials, but Gibson's lapsed reverend also dodges the memory of his recently-departed wife, the gaze of the guilt-ridden neighbor responsible, and the crisis of faith that event has stirred in his soul. With two young kids and a lethargic brother along for the ride, Gibson sleepwalks through his day-to-day. His emotions are so drastically compartmentalized, he almost seems autistic. In sealing off his feelings, however, he's also pushed his family away, alienating each member of the household just when they need to band together.That heaviness isn't always front and center - in fact, it's often out of mind entirely - but this doesn't mean Signs ever really lightens up. Most of the plot's focus is on the aliens' influence, both at home (where they cut crop circles and rummage through the cornfields) and on the international stage (where the 24-hour news cycle can't get enough of their disappearing armada). That's the more colorful subject, and the one Shyamalan pursues with the most vigor. His take on a global invasion is creepy and curious, a nice blend of looming tension and gradual revelation that's careful about maintaining its veil of mystery, and its smaller perspective makes for a fresh angle. As Gibson comes around to the idea that this thing is for real, and his family (famously) dons a set of tinfoil hats, they experience much of the unfolding situation through TV and radio. This allows their imaginations to run wild, especially when the aliens show up at their little house to kick doors and break windows.The monsters don't look great in full frame, which is why it's so important we catch sight of them in our peripheral or not at all. Signs does well to respect this limitation, to spin it into an advantage, but loses patience and blows it at the very end. The same is true of the religious symbolism that anchors Gibson's character. For ninety-five percent of its running time, the film effectively toes that line, maintaining a delicate balance before tumbling on its side in the climax. Ah well. A flat ending isn't the end of the world, but it is a little disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's Almost There,"I mostly like this movie because the terror is presented in a subtle, weighted way. We learn more about the characters than the threat. Obviously, from the beginning, Mel Gibson's character is carrying around some big guilt and big inertia. So when the threats begin, he can't get off the mark (sort of like the guy in The Patriot). As the signs begin to appear, it is up to him to regain his faith and want to move on. The horrible incident with his wife has made him move away from god. What is missing for me is the uncertainty of what the threat is. It's obvious ""what"" it is but not ""why"" it is. When the movie concludes, we are left wondering where we will go next. It reminded me a little of Hitchock's ""The Birds."" Is there more out there and who are they and what do they want? Why are they evil and why did they decide to threaten us. Still, like most of this director's movies, it is beautiful to look at and works on most levels. Gibson is back and forth with me. I never have doubted his acting ability. At times I'm not sure what he wants out of a film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just keeps getting worse,"The movie was fun in the theaters, it had some good scares.  But whereas the Sixth Sense (and to some extent, Unbreakable) made me want to see them again immediately, this movie could not stand up to a second viewing.  In the 6th Sense, the twin stories of the supernatural and human drama were closely intertwined, making a tight story.  Here, Shyamalan cannot make the separate plots work together.  They become two completely different stories that end up dragging each other down.Aliens are coming... what will happen?  Suspense.They will knock around the house for a few hours and then run away. Stupidity.The more I think back to the movie, the more problems I find.  Too, too many problems to even begin listing them.  Problems that render both stories ineffective.

"A tad exciting, but acting is emotionless.","""Signs"" is a movie about a family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields, which leads to the discovery of an alien invasion.This movie is a little exciting, coupling a classic alien-invasion plot (seen in many sci-fi movies) with a dramatic subplot involving Mel Gibson's character. The story behind his character plus the development of the other cast members are essential to the movie as it does not give this film a typical aliens-on-the-loose story. However, the overall dreary atmosphere and emotionless and bland acting made took away the intrigue intended for the plot. If I've found out a band of outer space aliens are planning to attack the Earth, I would imagine citizens panicking and government officials sounding the alarm. The urgency and commotion of that notion are not depicted here.I believe this is M. Night Shyamalan's style of directing; however, it doesn't click with me, at least. I would like to see a movie where the story's urgency and suspense are depicted by believable and energetic acting. This movie had the potential to be very intriguing and entertaining, but it is average at best.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Moving writer's block,"Shyamalan's star began to fade with this pretty disappointing third film, the style is still as well-executed as in his previous movies, and his special style of dialogues still occasionally have that strange effect on me, but the plot is just way too weak to keep things interesting. It's the subtle horror of an alien invasion, in a typical M. Night fashion we don't really get to take a good look at the supposed villains. All of this really does work, but not for two hours. And the customary twist ending doesn't really deliver either, it just ruins things. If you can even call the ending a twist, things just suddenly stop making sense. I know were supposed to be amazingly intrigued by this oh-so mysterious situation and the foreshadowing of the dead wife, but I just can't get there. And was the hint the wife gave really necessary? It's a pretty basic plan, they could have thought of it all by themselves. Perhaps Shyamalan is just too much of a one-trick pony. Get a basic story, add a little mystery, throw logics out of the window, and there you have it. It worked so well in his first two features though, we'll always have those.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Missing the Signs,"Severely underrated, M. Knight's ability to draw atmospheric, fictionally realistic films from simple premises may go over the heads of casual viewers. His films tend to stick with you, creating ponderously uncomfortable silences during and long after the film. It's tough doing alien or monster films without screwing the pooch (too soon?) but involving deep, unbiased religious introspection? Who can get away with it in Hollywood these days? Original movie-making has been drowned out by high SFX budgets, entertaining though they are.

"Alien invasion yarn told from a personal perspective, with a subtext about keeping one's faith (for those who want it).","There can't be many films which divide the audience more than ""Signs"". Even a cursory glance at the user comments here on the IMDb shows some people rating it highly and singing its praises, while others give it the dreaded 1-out-of-10 verdict. Similarly, many professional critics have been split over this film with Jonathan Ross stating that it left him ""terrifically let down"", while Cosmo Landesman hailed it ""a wonderful sustained slice of American Gothic"". I have a theory about why there are such polar opinions of the film. I believe that many people read the plot summary on the back of the video case, notice that the film features big stars like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and start expecting something along the lines of ""Independence Day"" or ""The War Of The Worlds"". But ""Signs"" is not that kind of film - it is not concerned with laser gun battles and aliens having their guts splattered all over the place, nor is it concerned with the spectacle of entire cities being decimated by gigantic alien spaceships. For that reason, many people who were hoping for explosions and destruction on a grand scale come away feeling cheated.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest living on a very remote farm in Pennsylvania. He lost his faith following the tragic death of his wife in a car accident. Also living on the farm are Graham's children Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin), and Graham's younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Merrill was once a minor league baseball player, famous for hitting the longest ever shot but, paradoxically, famous for suffering the most strike-outs in the history of the sport. One morning, the Hess family discover a huge crop circle in their field. Their initial bewilderment gradually gives way to paranoia and fear as they learn from the TV news that such crop circles have been appearing all over the world. Before long, UFOs are sighted above cities and scaly alien creatures are filmed sneaking around on Earth. The Hess family fear that an invasion is imminent, with the crop circles like the one in the field adjacent to their house used as landing points. They board up their farmhouse and take refuge inside, hoping to survive the night against whatever it is that is trying to get in.All the way through the film, Shyamalan refuses to get carried away with the bigger picture of the alien invasion. We only see and hear of the destruction caused by the invaders via the Hess's TV and radio set. Instead, the story is approached directly from the perspective of the Hess family, making it much more intimate and personal than the usual alien invasion entries. Shyamalan uses seemingly insignificant little details and overlapping flashbacks to build up his story, and makes his main themes those of the power of fate and the need for faith. In fact, the whole alien-invasion aspect of the plot is relegated in terms of significance and used merely as a backcloth for the story of Graham's regaining of faith. We are being told here that EVERYTHING happens for a reason and that even the most innocuous of events or conversations has a bearing on the future. This preachy approach - almost religious, in a discreet kind of way - is likely to irritate some viewers, though the more spiritual among us might find it absorbing and affirming. ""Signs"" is very slow-paced and intricate, certainly not the kind of film that encourages repeat viewings, but in the end I think it delivers. I certainly didn't come away feeling ""terrifically let down"", as Mr Ross complained. I've seen many better films, but I've seen a heck of a lot worse too. ""Signs"" is good, suspenseful stuff, with thought-provoking themes for those who can be bothered to pursue them.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is America Insane?,"This was the epitome of Hollywood run amuck.  This was a very boring, very pretentious film.  I can not understand why American audiences are going to this film in droves.  This could have been a $1 million low-budget film. In fact, minus the huge salaries of Gibson, Night and the rest of the Above-the-line talent, it looks like that's all they spent.I felt watching this film that Night has started to believe his own hype that he's the next Speilberg.  This is not the same craftsman that made the wonderful ""6th Sense.""  It felt like he made decisions because he could, rather than what was best for the film.  Example: why bother bringing in the best VFX Producer in Hollywood (Erik Brevig) to design and supervise the alien when you never get to see the alien for more than seconds at a time? The same affect could have been done better and cheaper with a Stan Winston or Rik Baker monster creation.This is a tremendously disappointing effort.

Eerie and mysterious film about a family who discovers a crop circle at his farm with unexpected consequences,"Strange and eerie storytelling about an isolated , quiet farm in Pennsylvania stalked by mysterious creatures . It is set on the Bucks County, Pennsylvania farm of Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) . At first glance, this family seems happy , but this close-knit family lives with a tragedy . After his wife's death in a freak accident , Hess and his family try to figure out what the sign means and how its message incorporates into their faith . Later on , they discover a gigantic crop circle in his yard and they have frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding and subsequently at home . As they get the feeling that they aren't alone in the fields behind their house .

Believe .Another paranormal entry for writer-director Shyamalan , this is an eerie and mysterious movie depicting the tale of an isolated home , confronting the surprising mystery that lies just outside its farm , as a family lives under the control of some bizarre beings , until a revelatory twist . It explores the strange implications of a 500-foot crop circle that mysteriously appears at the location . M. Night toys with religion and other thoughtful ideas , but at times , he buries them under an illogical and rather unpredictable tale . Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan got a good feel for the intriguing as well as terrifying , at times , story . Focusing here is on security , self-preservation , frightening to unknown and conservatism , as revealed in the tale of a rural location . M. Night delivers a nice filmmaking and , as usual , he shows an important scene set in a basement , such as : in this Signs (2002) : The family is in the basement when the aliens attack , the same as : The sixth Sense (1999) : Malcolm is in the basement when discovering important plot information; Unbreakable (2000): David discovers his strength in a basement ; In The Village (2004), when they are in the cellar or basement Ivy discovers that Lucius really does care for her . Similarly , Car crashes play pivotal roles in all his films : Cole reveals his gift to his mother during a traffic jam in The six sense (1999), David ""loses"" his football abilities in a car accident in The unbreakable (2000), and a sad death in a bizarre car accident in Signs (2002 ). Here Mel Gibson as Reverend Graham Hess who questions his faith and even leaves the church gives a very good acting . Main cast and support cast are pretty well , full of young and veteran players such as : Cherry Jones, Patricia Kalember , and of course , Joaquin Phoenix and M. Night Shyamalan himself . A main draw is the cast as newcomers : Rory Culkin , Abigail Breslin ; all of them put in great performances .Rousing and thrilling soundtrack by James Newton Howard who frequently works with Shyamalan for the musical score . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Tak Fujimoto . Well written/produced and directed by Night Shyamalan . The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving . M. Night delivers his first period piece putting the entire cast through a creepy story of extraterrestrial invasion , retelling with several surprises . Competently produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night usually puts in a scene from one of his childhood films that marks his first attempt at the same kind of movie. The Sixth Sense (1999) includes the ghost story Nightmare on Old Gulf, The unbreakable (2000) includes the action movie Millionaire, Signs (2002) includes the monster movie Pictures , and The Village includes an untitled period piece. Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : ¨Signs¨ , ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in water¨ , ¨The Incident¨ , ¨The sixth sense¨ , with exception for an extreme flop as critical as boxoffice : ¨Airbender¨. Shyalaman usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location . Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable"" , ¨Multiple¨and ""Glass"" belong to the top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. And this ¨Signs¨that forms a trilogy of three supernatural thrillers, The sixth Sense (1999), Theunbreakable (2000), and Signs (2002), all of them grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide.

A pleasant surprise,"Granted the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film--but upon seeing it, I will say that every negative review was blown out of the water.However, I am of the opinion that the simultaneous gasps (and one scream, might I add) coming from around the theatre was worth the price of admission in and of itself.With a suspenseful score appropriate for any thriller, I was hooked by the time the opening credits were finished--and it didn't end there. I was given no time whatsoever between the fade of the last words and the first striking image before the horror began.I was extremely impressed with all of the performances, but particularly with the emotional range of Rory Culkin (Morgan) and Abagail Breslin (Bo), and also by the comic timing of Joaquin Phoenix (Merrill)--something new for him, as he rarely gets a chance to flex his comedic muscles in the other films he has done. It is rare to see such talent all in one movie--and Mel Gibson (Graham) is stellar, as always, with his emotional portrayal of the reverend who has lost his faith.The overall humor of the movie, in fact, is absolutely sparkling, with witty one-liners and visual gags that will have you laughing for hours afterward. (And may I say, I think I'll make my own tinfoil hat.)My opinion? This film is a force to be reckoned with. Impressive soundtrack, impressive camera shots, impressive acting, and pretty impressive storyline. I've not been scared so badly in a long while--10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Had a Good Balance of Humor, Mystery and Suspense","Six months after a fatal accident involving his wife ""Reverend Graham Hess"" (Mel Gibson) has lost his faith and given up his calling to become a farmer instead.

Didn't like the message or the style,"The lone highlight of this film was the one spot I expected to deliver the least: Mel Gibson.  Though nearly every character was fairly superficial and flat, Gibson's Graham Hess was well-developed, deep, engaging and likeable, despite the writer's lame attempts at trite humor. The rest of the film seemed to remain on the surface, with poor acting and worse character-development in most of the supporting roles, especially Officer Paski. Most of all, I was turned-off by the over-riding message of the film.  I have never been a fan of those who subscribe to the ideology that there are no coincidences.  There are countless millions of opportunities for wild coincidences every second, and to believe that when you are lucky, it is because God planned it that way, and when others are unlucky, it is, likewise, supposed to be that way.  God simply does not wish to protect them? If God wanted to protect this family, he could've done it simply by having the aliens land in another field, as opposed to setting up this elaborate scheme of endless coincidences that contributed to their survival.At least he Shyamalan has a message, which is more than I can say for 99% of the film-makers out there today.

The most retarded aliens to ever cross space.This movie is so very flawed it's hard to find the right words to describe it. All I can say is if you see some kind of deep message that you find awe inspiring then you're grasping at straws. Stop praising this worthless lump of a movie and go join a local church group.

Is it really about aliens?,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" (2002) is about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in their cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: (1) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And (2) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give-in to the former.This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the ""father of lies"".There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called ""the prince of the power of the air"" in the bible). The ""aliens"" look decidedly demonic and have cloven hoofs. The ""primitive method"" of repelling the aliens is discovered in ""three cities the Middle East"" and is holy water, which is ordinarily used by Catholic & Episcopal exorcists against demonic manifestations (Shyamalan, by the way, attended Catholic & Episcopal schools). The daughter, Bo, was said to be a ""gift from God"" who is sensitive to impure (unholy) water. Her name in Old Norse means ""to live"" and she was able to discern the weapon of life needed to defeat the demonic menace. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. The crop circle in the Hess cornfield resembles a pitchfork. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God in order to converse. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the ""aliens"" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet after the death of the minister's wife.Keep in mind that when the film debuted, Shyamalan was known as the king of the plot twist, yet the revelation that the aliens' weakness is water wasn't exactly a mind-blowing turn seeing as how the earth is 71% water and technologically advanced aliens who can travel the galaxy would know this. Moreover, the aliens curiously have no physical weapons and are easily trapped by a pantry door. It stands to reason that Shyamalan hid the twist in the movie. That twist is that the aliens are really demonic in nature.I'm not saying you can't view the movie as a literal extra-terrestrial invasion flick, but rather that the underlying demonic reading is a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together and links to the story arc of the disillusioned ex-minister finding redemption. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.BOTTOM LINE: This is a quality Shyamalan film and is about on par with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village.""The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I can get no... satisfaction...Yea yea yea,"There is a check well done besides all film - art criteria when Signs"" is put on the test. And that is not a surprising fact, as we well know that its creator is a man with natural talent in this respect. However ""Signs"" lacks on the imagination side, imagination was focused on delivering brilliant visual scenery rather than intrigue. The plot was too closed in itself, the ""topography"" of suspense did not manage to tingle the viewer. Action built up then suddenly faded into dramatic moments that left suspense aside. This usually would not be a big deal but when one goes to see a movie with the thematic nature of ""Signs"" he not only wants to see good acting, camera work and brilliant images but also wants to leave the theater in owe, shocked and by that satisfied. That is what the movie lacks.Apart from that this is a very decent film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They forgot their raincoats!,"Good grief what a groaner! Aliens smart enough to travel across space all the way to earth need to communicate using crop circles. Uhh, yeah right.A few suspenseful moments cannot begin to make up for the incredibly inane resolution. Aliens who die when they get wet don't bother to wear a raincoat and galoshes to say nothing of a space suit. And you would think that since they communicate with crop circles they might have run into some irrigation lines and realized their plight. Alas no.And the subplot involving the restoration of Gibson's faith is so incredibly ham handed and ludicrous that it drains all the spirit out of the movie - no pun intended. I mean if god really wanted little Morgan to live why would he let the alien get a hold of him in the first place?

There is a peculiar tinge to the reactions and personalities in the key roles that makes them seem to be off the beaten track of humanity. I am not sure who the aliens are.

"Let down, but hilarious misunderstanding!","This movie was a similar let down to me as Unbreakable.  I am just a little tired of movies where all the details in the story combine in the finale. It was fine in John Irvine's book ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" (from which the construction of the plot and concept is stolen) but just seems so lazy in films today, unless some real surprise comes out of it, like in Fight Club or the Sixth Sense.  Like Unbreakable, we are asked to care about character traits and history of poorly constructed and dull characters.  The ""surprise"" ending, the ""twist"", is so weak as to be a disapointment.What is more, Shyamalan continues down his ""tribute"" to Hitchcock with a pointless cameo appearance again, and the rather blatant shots framed by foreground objects.  When is he going to find his own voice?  Don't claim Shyamalan is a genius until he does something original!However, what saved this cinema experience for me was the misunderstanding that ripped through the entire audience of the cinema I was in during the asthma attack scene where Mel Gibson tries to resuscitate his son.  The combination of the dialogue and action in this scene immediately suggested itself to the South London audience that Gibson was in fact sexually molesting his son, and no one could believe this was in a movie.  The whole place erupted with laughter at the double entendré of it all.  I am talking about over 100 people simultaneously experiencing the same thing, and finding it more entertaining than the intention of the film maker. Certainly a more disturbing twist than Shyamalan's intention.  I can't believe no one else has noticed this...The film was terrible, but hurrah for audiences that can rethink a dull movie into something amusing...",,Anonymous,Mystery
How can ANY intelligent person have enjoyed this MOVIE!?!?,"I just have to add a second review.  I can't believe the rave reviews for what I think was a stupid movie.  How in the world could you like this movie?  ITS FULL OF FLAWS!  I could list them, but just click on my username and read my other review for the details.Anyone, who reviews this movie and thinks its a great piece of work hasn't gone past a basic knee-jerk reaction.  ""What a cool looking Alien.  WOW! This is a great movie!""  And its not even that scarey.  Its not scary at all.  I was FAR more frightened in the Blair Witch Project than in this piece of garbage.  The movie gets worse and worse in my mind as I think about it.  It was extremely irresponsible for Shyamalan to make a movie without giving any thought at all to its credibility and believability.I am sorry to say this, but anyone who likes this movie isn't very intelligent or they don't watch very many movies and are overimpressed with some of the cheap thrills Shyamalan throws in there to ""WOW"" the crowd.  I have had more suspense watching the Fear Factor and I find the Animaniacs to be more believable than this total waste of film.Shyamalan has changed his film-making direction (with this movie) from ""Braveheart"" to ""Scream"".  His only goal now seems to be to shock people in quick-and-dirty scenes with little or no plot at all. If you liked this movie, then you are going to LOVE the Halloween series.

"""Signs"" and Wonders: A Thought-Provoking Exploration of Faith and Fate","""Signs,"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is a film that leaves a lasting impression on its audience, much like the classic ""Citizen Kane."" Just as Orson Welles' masterpiece revolutionized the art of filmmaking, Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is a game-changer in its own right.The film follows the story of a family living in rural Pennsylvania, whose lives are turned upside down when mysterious crop circles begin to appear in their fields. As tension builds and the signs become more ominous, the family must confront their deepest fears and grapple with questions of faith and fate.What sets ""Signs"" apart from other science-fiction thrillers is its emotional depth and nuanced characters. Mel Gibson gives a remarkable performance as a former priest struggling with his faith, while Joaquin Phoenix delivers a breakout turn as his troubled brother. Together, they anchor a film that is equal parts suspenseful and poignant.Shyamalan's direction is also masterful, as he employs a slow-burn approach that steadily builds tension and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. His use of sound and visual effects is particularly effective, creating an eerie atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.In short, ""Signs"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking, deserving of a place among the greats. Like ""Citizen Kane,"" it leaves an indelible mark on its viewers and cements Shyamalan's place as a visionary director.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Such promise.,"The ideas and premise behind 'Signs' are really intriguing but having now watched several of MNS films I have concluded that; unless there's an intriguing twist he's not actually that good a storyteller. Or, he has a good idea and fails to pack it out into a full-length feature.The two child actors were great in this; their performances and Mel Gibson's to a degree, were what held it all together. Plenty of genuinely funny moments (I'd love to watch a comedy by MNS) but Joaquin Phoenix was hopelessly mis-cast as the down-and-out baseball-star-to-be and the final scene where he takes up the baseball bat was excruciatingly bad.The aliens suffered from that age old cinematic trope where they have menace the less you see them but as soon as they are fully revealed they lose all there menace and horror. Also, the aliens are pathetically weak and dumb.All in all, a decidedly average mystery/horror with a great premise, some good acting talent but an awful script and screenplay.

M Night Charlatan's sci-fi disaster,"Signs is hands down the worst movie I have ever paid money to see at a cinema. Basically it's the story of a minister who has lost his faith but manages to regain it with the arrival of some aliens.This isn't a terrible plot but the way it's presented is beyond parody. There are a few tense moments early on but then the aliens start landing, though this would be expensive to show you so instead you get to see five light bulbs against a black backdrop, in much the same way that bad sci-fi has always represented alien invasions when a bit strapped for cash. When they start running around the ministers roof like a pack of squirrels and show they are unable to open doors I was just stunned. It's only the first of a long line of really badly judged bits that just keep the comedy flowing.What really stinks this awful movie up is the nonsensical ending. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and by the time the film had been rolling for an hour most of the audience had departed. Those that stayed mostly did so to jeer the movie and laugh at it's mawkish script and pathetic attempt to make the whole thing seem grand and meaningful.I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has so insulted my intelligence. My tiny local cinema only seats 250 people and was forced to stop showing it because in the words of the cinema manager ""too many people were walking out and demanding a refund and the audience waiting to see it were put off by the laughter of people already viewing it.""I laughed too until I heard Shoddyhands had announced he was the new Hitchcock on the basis of this movie, and then I found out that some viewers actually agree with him and think this is a profound and clever film!

M. Night Shyamalan is the man!,"Now, we've arrived to M. Night Shyamalan's Signs (2002). This is a movie that was initially received upon its release, but now it's started to receive a lot of criticism about certain elements in its plot, but I love this movie.Positives for Signs (2002):
First of all, I love the cast in this movie. Mel Gibson does great in a role that is definitely not one that you wouldn't expect from this guy. I also liked Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. I also loved the grounded approach to this alien invasion storyline in this movie and honestly it's one of the most terrifying tales on an alien invasion. I even liked some of the humorous scenes with the family where it's actually supposed to be funny unlike The Happening (2008). And finally, I appreciate that Shyamalan has this theme of faith that comes full circle with the plot twist in this movie. Now let's talk about that plot twist, people have criticized this twist about the aliens being allergic to water and that it makes no sense for the aliens to do this. First of all, it's established that these aliens are very hostile and desperate. Second, maybe they didn't know that they're allergic to the material in our water, so all of you need to calm down because this movie is awesome.Overall, Signs (2002) is yet another banger from M. Night Shyamalan's filmography and it's a shame that his later movies did certain things that I'm looking forward to talking about.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan at his very best,"This is a terrific story that has elements of family, faith, tragedy, horror, suspense, and sci-fi. The sorry is a slow burn but once it picks up speed, about halfway through the tension and the action builds to a fantastic climactic ending. The four primary actors are all wonderfully played. Gibson is terrific as the former preacher turned anti-deity. Abigail Breslin is absolutely endearing and believable as the young daughter. Her performance, given her age, is just remarkable. The horror is mostly implied as we don't even see an antagonist until almost the very end. But when you do see it it's an amazing reveal that fits with the film perfectly. As we near the end the family tragedy is also revealed and the story comes together with perfect flair.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wasn't intended to be science fiction,"A lot of reviewers are missing the fact, that Signs wasn't intended to be sci-fi. Just because aliens are involved, coming from space? That's kinda weak explanation from a sci-fi fan. You can't judge Spartacus upon the base it's a comedy. Taken as a comedy it's a bad comedy, because it's not funny. The same way Signs is of course a bad sci-fi, because it's isn't sci-fi at all... And it was not even intended to be sci-fi. So it's a fantasy/horror movie with some drama, as it is with all Shyamalan movies, you should have noticed that by now. A very likable fantasy/horror movie with much suspense and atmosphere, and also with a feel for drama and for actual human psychological themes. But it's all metaphoric, and of course, if you don't like or don't get metaphors, obviously this movie isn't for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wooden and hollow, sort of like the door the aliens can't pass","M. Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window. There is a scene where Graham and the man (played by Shyamalan himself) have an awkward discussion by the side of the road. It is an incredibly insensitive, strangely written scene, with the Shyamalan character reciting some of the worst written dialog in a scene supposed to occupy emotional importance. But that is only one of countless details the film neglects to build on or explain.The film tries to erect credible, memorable suspense by giving us close to an hour of buildup. I normally commend a film when this happens because I believe it provides the writer's talent to come forth, is one of the biggest and strongest building blocks to a great thriller, and is too often traded for things of a lesser breed. Here, the dialog is painfully slow, which leads to scenes progressing at a staggeringly incompetent pace, and every line of dialog is recited in a hushed, melodramatic sort of whisper that it becomes dreary and impotent abnormally fast.When we are finally met with the unworldly lifeforms (and trust me, they're not too exciting and their presence is kept at a minimum) we are greeted with one of the most colossal curveballs (not in a good way) and insulting miscalculations I have yet to see in a thriller. The aliens are said to have traveled light years through space and time, built ships of strong stature (which can be assumed since they can perfectly smash a healthy section of corn), and have successfully created a plan, they hope, will allow them to take over our planet. And they're allergic to water. I hate to build on this complaint, seeing as so many other people this side of the IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes forums have voiced criticisms have done so, but it truly not only strikes me as odd but incredibly unbelievable - even for a sci-fi film, where the suspension of disbelief is almost required for every film in the genre.How are the aliens supposed to survive on a planet that is two-thirds water? Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens ""seem to have trouble with pantry doors."" Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door? It baffles me the negligence towards logic this movie partook in. Signs is a maddening affront to thriller and science-fiction films that try to create characters, atmosphere, and an original storyline, that are left to wallow in exhaust from the unexpected take off of other films of the same genre. I will say the film provides us with good cinematography, but completely disregards it so we can see more of the film's attempts at needless style and inconsistencies more noticeable than a perfect circle in your crops. I've always thought it would be virtually impossible to round up four or more capable performers in a picture and find almost nothing interesting to do with them, or even make an attempt to note their presence, but Signs has definitely proved me wrong.Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin.

A slow paced thriller,"The movie is about a reverend who loses his faith following the death of his wife in a car accident. All the actions happening in the foreground, i.e. aliens invading the earth, the family's fight against the invaders in their farm house, etc. are indeed a ruse that serve to mask the main theme which is about the reverend regaining his faith. Although the plot involving the depiction of the alien invasion and its aftermath is sketchy and plain silly, the movie gets away with it because the action is pushed to background at the end. The cast and acting are pretty good. The pace is somewhat slow at the beginning but the film gains tempo towards the finale. Its theme is certainly deeper than a pure thriller but its handling of the action falls short of satisfying the fans of that genre. On the other hand, the plot holes in the foreground events weaken the drama and leave unsatisfied those who'd like to see beyond the action, too.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of those movies you can watch every time it's on.,"This is one of MNS's best movies. On the surface it's an ""Alien Movie"", but it doesn't follow the typical formula. This movie explores aliens, conjecture, conspiracy, faith, remorse and faith. I know I listed faith twice, as there's the subplot of how people react to situations that challenge their belief systems.Gibson's character has lost his faith and no longer believes in God. Gibson has resigned as the town's priest and deals with his struggles as well as some of the townspeople's struggles to adapt to the new reality of him no longer holding that position. TI won't get into why. As someone who's been in a similar situation, it's understandable.The film also deals with guilt and forgiveness in a way that will have you choking up along with Mel Gibson's character.The main plot is aliens harassment on Gibson's farm and family and what's happening around the world with this invasion. It's definitely got its spooky moments.There's also some comedy gold in the film. Gibson and Phoenix give great performances, although Gibson can sometimes deliver his lines a little too slow and robotic, but perhaps that's the movie's intention for a priest or at least as the proverbial 'straight man' to Phoenix's descent into obsession. However, their comedy and fear timing is spot on. Phoenix's closet alien reveal scene is perfect. The actor who portrays the Army recruiter does a great job and could be a character out of the X-Files.There is a powerful scene that must be highlighted and that's Gibson and Phoenix's couch scene and the discussion about whether each other believes in miracles. Phoenix's story is hilarious, Gibson's, not so much. In fact it's sobering and gut wrenching, but it's not to be missed and extremely important to the movie.All the actors in this movie do a great job.Everything comes full circle at the end.

Beware: major pitfall ahead!,"Minor spoilers below. But you probably read through 20 spoiler comments anyway to reach this one.It's surprising that the highest rated comments on this movie are all ""hated it"" comments. Or maybe it's not that surprising after all. As you can see, all these comments tell the same thing (which makes me wonder why even the 10th one is still rated 'useful'). The conclusion: ""this is a very bad sci-fi movie about incredibly stupid aliens (and a stupid dog too).""They're right, as a sci-fi movie this is not quite it. The plot holes are bigger than the crop circles. However, all these people are somehow missing the point, but they can't be blamed. Why is this? Well, the problem with this movie is that from the time it was announced on, people thought it would be a sci-fi movie revolving about an alien invasion and nothing else. It isn't, but this is never obvious enough.Some reviewers get it right: this movie is actually about belief. The alien story is just a vehicle. This is why everyone expecting an alien movie will be heavily disappointed at the end. It's a typical Shyamalan film in that it tries to set you on the wrong track, but it's atypical in that it's poorly executed.I think Shyamalan's biggest mistake was to eventually resort to showing more of the aliens than just some shadows and indirect hints, or even making it so obvious that there were aliens after all, and what their intentions were. There's no better way to ruin a whole suspenseful build-up based on concealment, than to show the evil in all its CGI glory and having a TV set telling what its plans are. The fact that at some point in this movie an alien is shown in its entirety, has helped to feed the misunderstanding that it's just a bad alien movie. For the conclusion of the story as it is, showing the alien was almost inevitable. But the same kind of story could have been told without having to lift the veil of mystery around the aliens. All the gigantic plot holes that so many people have fallen into, would have been avoided if we never knew what -- and who -- exactly was behind those crop circles. People could have made up their own explanations, and as everyone knows, in the absence of ready-made (CGI) answers, people come up with much more captivating ideas on their own. People would have left the theater, still wondering about the mysteries. But instead, we are spoon-fed with a pretty weak sci-fi story which at some point made me remember the movie ""Independence Day"". That's IMHO not a bad movie, but this one being associated with it, is.My conclusion: the first part is really good. The build-up of suspense works well and there are some truly scary moments. But soon, the first holes in this build-up begin to appear, and eventually it all crumbles. The finale is embarrassing.Considering Shyamalan's track record, it probably was intentional to make people believe they're watching an alien movie, and then shatter this belief and reveal the true identity of the movie. But the belief is never shattered because it _is_ an alien movie after all, and not a good one at that. All that remains, is disbelief why it was such a bad alien movie, and the actual point of the story is forgotten. Compared to the rest of the movie, the parts about the actual story even seem (pun intended)... alien.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too many problems to be good.,Uggg what to say about this movie...First off I will say it was a huge let down mainly because it started off so well and then there was problem after problem....plot hole after plot hole that it just made the movie almost unbearable to watch. Yes the acting was good by the main cast starring Mel Gibson And Jouqin Pheonix but the side cast were terrible. This movie had a high budget but it was shot in about 3 small different places? I have no idea where all the money went.This movie is about an ex reverend who owns a farm. One day after his children were screaming in the fields he runs out to discover crop cirlces. Then they turn on the news and see that something very strange is happening as crop cirlces start to pop up all over the world. He tries to keep his family safe and calm as the invaders come.This movie started off really good and it really did have a creepy atmosphere but why too many plot holes ruined it for me.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wow....,"I saw ""Signs"" on Saturday and I was absolutely amazed!  It was BETTER than""Unbreakable"", and I thought that was going to be hard to beat.  Previouscomments have said that it's not laden with special effects and that would be correct, but that is what makes the movie so suspenseful and slightly disturbing. This is a thinking person's movie, and shouldn't be seen by people who want to be fed every important detail. M. Night Shamaylan is absolutely brilliant, and following in his previous movies, he casts himself, only this time, he has a MUCH bigger role than he had in either of his two previous movies.  His acting is impressive as is his directing. The rest of the cast is brilliant, except for maybe Rory Culkin, who I thought played a pretty two-dimensional character, who at times was two melodramatic andruined some scenes.  Abigail Breslin is so cute and the turmoil that she feels doesn't feel fake.  Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful and brought a great sense of youth to the movie, a factor that ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" werelacking.  And Mel Gibson as a former pastor is incredible.Perhaps the best part about this film is that the director keep building andbuilding the suspense, so you expect  a big-fallout-finale, and instead heexposes something quiet and subdued, and yet it moved me much more thanany bunch of special effects could, because it isn't until the end that youunderstand the whole movie.Go see ""Signs"" if you're a fan of M. Night Shamaylan and/or if you willing to expand you're mind and see the greater meaning behind the film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not Spielbergian magic, but Shyamalan spookiness","Audiences who go into this movie anticipating the kind of spellbinding magic of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will come away disappointed.  What you WILL experience is a creepy, spooky story that mixes in nice doses of humor along the way.And those who see this film expecting surprise twists at the end will also be disappointed.  Shyamalan has a long career as a filmmaker ahead of him, so let's not get on his case every time he makes a movie that doesn't give you a cheap thrill at the end.The first thing you'll notice is the music on the opening credits.  Very scary, very Hitchcock.  It sets the tone for what's to come.  The plot will leave a number of open-ended questions for those who are really paying attention.  To list them here would be to spoil too many elements of the film for those who haven't seen it.  Suffice it to say that many will be scratching their heads and thinking, ""But whatever happened to...?"" or ""Why did they...?""As for Shyamalan himself, there was probably no need to fill the screen with ""A Film by M. Night Shyamalan"" at the end.  After all, the opening credits told us that (also filling the entire screen), and he cast himself into a key role in the movie.  Add to that the fact that he's appearing on major magazine and newspaper covers worldwide, and I think we're on the verge of Shyamalan overdose.  Here's the antidote:  M. Night, make your next film smaller, less grandiose, less self-indulgent, and a nice, small, classy credit saying ""Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.""  That's right, let someone else write your next movie.  It'll make for a more diverse resume.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Almost, but not quite","There's quite a stigma surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's directorial style. At this point, he's made more bad movies than good, and for many people, it was Signs where he went off the rails.That is definitely true.But here's the deal, okay: for the first, say, 90 minutes of its 106 minute run time, Signs is actually a really, legitimately good movie. It very slowly builds a fantastic sense of dread. You feel intimately connected with these characters. The small, tiny glimpses you get of creatures are genuinely frightening.If all you ever saw was the first 90 minutes of Signs, you'd be convinced that M. Night is an under-appreciated genius. I unabashedly LOVE those 90 minutes.But then you get to the last 10 minutes. The movie goes to pull the brakes, and the lever snaps off. What follows, obviously, is a trainwreck. The movie gets to its ""message,"" the trademark M. Night ""big twist,"" and it is absurd and convenient to an almost offensive degree. Every shred of good will built up by this movie is obliterated. There are no survivors. The last 10 minutes almost feel like they fell out of a different movie.But it's not from a different movie. Signs alludes to its forthcoming narrative suicide all over the place. It might ""make sense"" in the context of what the movie is obviously trying to say, but that doesn't mean it is any less ridiculous.I want to love Signs. I almost kind of do, still. But it is really hard to pretend that those last 10 minutes do not exist.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thrilling,"This is a very scary movie. The way M. Night Shyamalan makes it scary is an amazing achievement. Most of the time there is nothing to be scared of, but you will be. His direction and a great cinematography make this film a unique experience.If you don't like movies about aliens and supernatural things you can still like Signs. It goes much further. It is about faith and about the questions if everything happens for a reason or not, if everything is meant to be or everything is just coincidence.Mel Gibson has a very strong performance. Joaquin Phoenix and the kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are great. The kids did remind me a little of Haley Joel Osment and his strong performance.Overall this is a great movie. The climax is a great one. If you really think of it not much has decided in the end, but it doesn't matter, it is perfect the way it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not very good,"Out of the three films Shyamalan has made, this is the worst.  He's a little young to be throwing his name up on every movie he makes now.  It's not like he's Spielburg. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but he simply doesn't have the credit to be trying to use his name to throw up on every film in order to express how good it is.  Since the Sixth Sense his films have been progressively getting worse.  ""Unbreakable"" was decent, but nowhere near as intelligent as his first film.  And casting himself in the movie, albeit in a small part, was a mistake.  He's acting like he's Hitchcock all of a sudden.Signs was entertaining, but not something I would have enjoyed in the theater, and not something I'd be interested in seeing again.  The plot was a bit broken up, and you couldn't really understand the central theme.  Was this a film about a man who loses his faith, or aliens taking over the world?  I was looking forward to this film because of the director, and because of my fascination with crop circles, which didn't really have much to do with the actual movie.I suppose it's a decent film if you're bored and want to rent it one night, but don't expect any of the great plot twists like you see in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  Hopefully, Shyamalan will get back on track with his next project.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Everything happens for a reason,"I get some of the people not liking this movie and I gather it grates against them maybe because it's an alien movie but doesn't dive deep into the science because it's more about the story and the characters and the narrative. I gather that the non religious might find this move grates against because it's narrative flows around a man and his faith and that all things happen for a reason. But I have always found this movie refreshing, funny, dramatic, scary and perfect at telling a story that is outside of the usual boring Hollywood script. It's it's on thing, the cinematography is perfect, the characters and casting is perfect and a simple fact for me when I find myself watching the same movie again once or twice a year is that's the purest form of good story telling. It makes you come back again and again.

"Good at first, but worse upon reflection","Before I begin, some of the details of this may spoil to movie for you.  So I will add a line saying to READ NO FURTHER when details may give some stuff away.  You are safe until then.This is an enjoyable movie.  Try not to analyse it too much.  If you spend a lot of time thinking about it afterwards then you will come up with some impossibilities that will bother you.  M Night Shyamalan always spends a lot of time building.  That isn't necessarily a flaw, (obviously since he is being called the next Spielberg), but I don't think building and building always works for action movies.  He did this in Unbreakable (which I really liked) but that movie really needed more movement and more action sequences to work better.In Signs, M Night spends a lot of time building Mel Gibsons character and showing the inner conflicts his family has suffered after a recent tragedy. Then he spends a lot of time building suspense in preparation for the climax.  That just might be too much building.  I read reviews and have heard DJs say this movie was so scary that people were screaming in the theatres and etc.  It never affected me that way.  I never felt ""scared"" one single time.  I don't think that was what M Night was going for.  There are plenty of tense filled scenes in the dark that keep you on the edge of your seat, but I didn't feel the suspense as well as I have in other movies however.  You have to go see this one if you're an M Night Shyamalan fan. If you aren't a fan of his, but are just looking for a cool movie to watch then toss a coin.  Every other person will like it and every other person may be slightly disappointed.----------------------------------------------------------DO NOT READ FURTHER UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE. DETAILS ARE INCLUDED HERE THAT WILL SPOIL IT FOR YOU!!----------------------------------------------------------OK.  I found a couple of flaws in the movie that really bother me.  First of all, Mel Gibson keeps important information about the weaknesses of the aliens from the world.  He could have saved millions of people if he had just made a phone call to the authorities telling them about the alien in the pantry.  It seems far fetched, but scientists could have taken him and performed tests on him and may have discovered their weakness in time to broadcast it all over the globe before communication black out.  And Mel was a PRIEST?  He is an ex-priest with no concern for anyone but himself.  What church was he ordained in?  The Church of the Selfish Mind?  Also I have a problem with a priest who blames God for the death of his wife.  A priest would not do this.  Priests know that death is a part of life and when one dies they go to Heaven.  At least according to the Catholic Church. So there is nothing to blame God for.  His wife is in a better place.  Also priests console grieving family members all of the time on a regular basis.  After assuming the role again at the end, he would have lost all credibility as a priest.  Who wants to be consoled by a priest who blamed God the first time he lost a loved one?  I wouldn't!  I wouldn't trust his advice at all.Also, explain to me again why the aliens can't use their superior technology to bust down a door?  Because we might use nuclear weapons?  A farmer doesn't have a nuke!  Even a child could pick up an axe and get through a door.  Not to mention a race of beings with the technology to travel between galaxies.  A box of nails and a hammer rendered this superior technology powerless.  I have a serious problem with that.Are you ready for the BIG ONE?  Their weakness is water right?  Our planet is about 75% water.  Would you try to conquer a world that was 75% sulfuric acid?  Would you attack a race of beings whose physical bodies were 80% sulfuric acid and who could spit it out of their mouths?  And if you did attack them, then wouldn't you wear some kind of suit to protect yourself? These aliens are stupid yet they have mastered technology.  This is an impossible combination.  They are walking around naked and attacking people without protection or weapons when even the simplest reconnaisance would reveal that the acid that eats through their alien skin is found in abundance in every house in America.  We are composed of the element that kills them and they fight us hand-to-hand without any protection at all?I enjoyed the movie, but after thinking about it now I wish I hadn't seen it.  Its hard to believe that the same director wrote Sixth Sense which seemed to contain no major flaws at all.  This movie is just chock full of them.Try again Shyamalan.  You can do much better buddy!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
People who believe and the ones who don't believe,"""Signs"" is a movie that divided people even more than great and underrated ""Unbreakable"". It isn't a ""War of the worlds "" or ""Independence day"" type of movie . It isn't really about alien invasion. It's about faith and losing it . The aliens are only catalyst for that theme. It's a movie about human condition.The idea of making a serious movie about faith based on aliens and crop circle in plantation is very risky . I think that while not everything worked in the end , Shyamalan actually comes victorious . ""Signs"" does fall apart in the end . The logical questions about aliens that audience have aren't answered and the final twist is rather laughable. Still as a drama it succeeds. Shyamalan leads his heroes masterfully. We really care about them and can imagine ourselves in their situation. Shyamalan never fails to create suspense too. There is a great tension here and some of the scenes are really scary . Why ? Because Shyamalan wonderfully plays with viewers imagination and he knows that what you don't see is what scares the most.James Newton Howard's score is great , while Tak Fujimoto's photography is sublime. Good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.I'm hoping that Shyamalan will be able to make once again a good movie. It would be shame for such good director to end his career too soon. I'm still waiting and hoping for his comeback. I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspense!,"This movie excels at a somewhat lost movie art: suspense.  The director and story teller does a good and unique job of engaging the viewer so we're on the edge of our sets wondering what is going to happen next and what is around the next corner and in the director's usual style, there's a hidden story secret that's revealed at the climax.  This is not just a story about scary things that frighten us, but a story about people and their relationships and beliefs.  I'm not religious, but found the lead characters conflict compelling.Also, I saw ""Unbreakable"" (same writer/director) and didn't think that movie was engaging as compared to this one.  And I thought this was a little better than that ""I see dead people"" movie (completely forgot name!) perhaps because I'm not sure that Bruce Willis is the best choice for this sort of role.However, I'm definitely glad to have this writer/director out there creating movies (won't attempt to butcher the spelling of his name from memory) and I think he's one of the top movie-makers these days.Don't forget to see his home-videos on the DVD version(s)--- it's a reminder that it takes a lot of work and commitment to achieve what he has, but that it all starts with a desire/vision/dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very good until the ending.,"This latest thriller is from director M. Night Shyalmanan and has many of his trademark touches. This story is basicaly ""Independance Day"" old from the perspective of an isolated farmhouse.. you get all the old standby alien invasion angles, but you are so cut off from the main story and forced to focus on this one family that it gets scarier by implication. The atmospheric touches and the total absence of underscore for much of the film add to the fear and suspense factor that ratchets up till the end of the world scenerio plays itself out. Mel Gibson as an emotionaly damaged former preacher and father of two young children is good in an underplayed role as is Joaquin Phoenix as his former minor-league ballplayer brother.

Next time will not just be a short visit.,"Excellent in respect to keeping me attentive. M.

When crop circles show up in his corn fields as well as multiple sites around the world, shattered faith is put to the test. His brother(Joaquin Phoenix) a down on his luck minor league home run champion comes to live with his recently widowed brother and two children. There is the little boy with asthma and a daughter that has a phobia concerning drinking water. Screen time for the alien visitor is not much, but down right creepy. The budget must have been spent on Gibson because the E.T. was mainly in the shadows and looking like a Halloween costume contestant.

Pretentious Garbage,"As I felt when I walked out of Unbreakable, I want to find M. Night Shaymalan, and hurt him. We're talking baseball-bat-to-the-knees hurt. This is because I: 1) wasted ANOTHER 2 good hours of my life under the false feeling that this one would be good, 2) the film is long and boring, and the pay-off is non-existent, unless you buy into the director's empty pretensions, and 3) the suspense is very cheaply manipulated and manufactured. The only small consolation is that he seems to only have 2 more films in him before he's run out of his bag of tricks. This one already show serious ""signs"" of creative fatigue.This film is unbearably pretentious, though not quite as bad as Unbreakable. I was surprised for the first hour that things actually HAPPEN at a quick clip, unlike in Unbreakable, but he makes up for it by slowing the pace in the second hour. Is there an alien clawing at the door? What better time for a 45-second shot of a stationary flashlight! Are spaceships landing outside? Then how about showing a blank wall for a full minute? Is your house being invaded by aliens? That's the right time for a long, lugubrious flashback, or a Hallmark-level family reminescence! That'd be GREAT! It is a CHEAP suspense tactic to simply NOT SHOW something that is happening, or have your actors take 10 times longer to react to something. That's not skill, it's pretentious manipulation, it's the main reason Shymalan better stay away from me when I've got a weapon in my hand. This film would be 1/2 hour shorter if we didn't have to endure such maddeningly long takes. They may generate suspense, but not honorably. Compared to Hitchcock my ass. Most reviews say ""Shymalan knows that what's not shown is scarier than what is."" Well, in this case, that's because, shown or not shown, NOTHING IS HAPPENING.The entire story is truly non-existent. Basically, something is ABOUT to happen, ABOUT to happen, ABOUT to happen (this is the ""suspense"" part), then, oops, it doesn't happen. The end. The entire story utterly flies apart at the end, makes ZERO sense, and is VERY unsatisfying. What we get instead is a extremely flimsy, sub-Oprah-level meditation of ""faith."" Well guess what, M. Night? When you tie your ""message"" into a story that ultimately turns out to be a big flat deflated balloon, your ""message"" is invalidated as well. There was an article in the 8/4/2002 NYTimes about ""nonmovies."" Movies that SEEM to have emotion, style, and substance, but it's all recycled, and only REFERS to emotion and substance. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""Signs.""I do think Shymalan can be compared to George Lucas... a filmmaker who thinks that everyone should spend great amounts of attention and thought to his work, but doesn't think you should have any incentive to do so, and doesn't think they should be rewarded for their effort, because the SIMPLE JOY OF WATCHING A FILM BY M. NIGHT SHYMALAN SHOULD BE REWARD ENOUGH!!!!  This is called ""Narcissim.""The increasingly hysterical opening credits offer a clue of what is to come. There IS one effective moment, later, the newscast of the birthday party. But, let me ask you, how many newscasts will include the preceeding 45-seconds of birthday party video footage before the thing we're waiting for happens? Only M. Night Shymalan's newscast. I can see a parody of him on Saturday Night Live: as Mel Gibson is grappling with an alien, Shymalan points his camera at a stationary paper cup. ""Okay,"" he says, ""the alien breaks in--cut to the cup! The cup is NOT MOVING!! The cup is ABSOLUTELY STILL! There is NO MOVEMENT from the cup!""",,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting take on crop circles.,"I laughed a lot when I watched this movie. It has lots and lots of hilarious scenes and lots of unintentionally funny stuff in it. And, if you were wondering, it doesn't have any really scary scenes in it.But then again, it's more about the faith and family of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Graham is this priest, who has lost his faith after his wife had died in a car accident. Now he's living with his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One day huge crop circles appear on their field. Then they notice that strange things start to happen all around the world.Signs relies much on slow narration and it's own quirky atmosphere. There are TV reports shown all over the movie, which work as testimonials of the truthfulness of the situation, it's not in their imagination.Well, in all, I cannot recommend this movie, if you want fast scares or lots of action.

Good... but not in the way you might expect,"The first M. Night Shyamalan picture I saw was ""the sixth sense"", it was excellently directed and managed to be scary using both strong visual images, psychological horror and of course, a great twist.when it came to watching this, I was hoping for more of the same, however I must say that this is a league away from the Sixth sense, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film kind of feels like a mainstream scary movie, and as a result of this isn't actually scary at all (the part with the alien holding the kid was just laughable), however Shyamalan makes the story compelling and there are several moments of tension, for example when Mel Gibson is in the crop field or when the family are arguing at dinner.It's although worth mentioning that the movie is quite funny at times, for example Joaquin Phoenix explaining (his delivery of this line is great) that ""crop circles are made by a bunch of geeky guys with no girlfriends and too much spare time"".Overall, it's relatively entertaining and probably worth seeing, just don't expect anything earth shattering",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Breath-takingly beautiful film.,"I saw this when it first came out at the cinema and was struck by how inteligent a film it was. I saw it again tonight on a pay-per-view channel, and I see it more clearly now. This film goes straight into my personal favourite top three films of all-time.Basically it's about a family trying to come to terms with grief. They have lost their mother, and Mel Gibsons charactor has lost a wife he obviously loved deeply.Whilst they are trying to get back to some sort of normality, they discover a huge crop circle in their backyard. Strange occurrances happen, and it turns out to be an alien invasion!What makes this film unique is that the action revovles around this one family and how things effect them.

Passion of the Aliens,"Mel Gibson plays a rural Pennsilvaniya farmer. A rural Pennsilvaniya farmer who doesn't do a single second of farming during the entire movie.It gets worse.Mel's mundane celibate existence is rudely interrupted when 7 foot furry green aliens, who fart at the wrists, decide to invade the planet...but more specifically, have set their nefarious EXTRA TERRESTRIAL sights on seeking ""THAT"" global strategic position that every nation on Earth is vying for...yup, that's right...RURAL ""P-e-n-n-s-i-l-v-a-n-i-y-a"". (sarcasm laden heavy sigh~~~~~~)However these are no ordinary aliens. No sir! They've managed to travel billions of light-years through space, only to be stymied by the uber-complex technology of boards and nails that Mel has erected around his home.Yes, a race of beings for whom water is as caustic as INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH ACID select as the target of their invasion a planet whose surface is no less than 70% covered by water, inhabited by beings whose bodies contain more than 90% water.(Just how did they traverse through Mel's dew laden cornfields at night without being burned to a f**king crisp?!?!?)The humans are no Einsteins either, the radio communications used by the aliens, easily picked up by a common baby monitor, somehow escape the higher tech scrutiny that you'd expect from the scientific community or the military. And where is the military? At no time are there big explosions from the usual response to a threat, oh, say invisible hostile alien spaceships hovering over major cities all around the world.Nope, it's a ""wait and see"" approach here (maybe they were praying for rain). And what were the aliens going to do with the planet or us after we'd been conquered? A planet covered mostly by water,which is hardly an ideal vacation paradise for them is it? Perhaps they were going to tow it away and Ebay it. I dunno....and neither does M. Night Shymalan I bet.Furthermore, keep in mind that human beings are made of mostly water, so these invaders can't exactly devour us, nor can they enjoy the pleasures of sex with us. So maybe they'll burn us as fuel. Or Ebay us. Given these aliens observed level of technical sophistication, you could suppose their spaceships might have been of the steam powered variety.Of course, the Shymalan-fans-deep-in-denial are going to come back with howls of outrage that I ""DON'T GET IT!"". I can hear them now... ""Dumbass! It's not about sci-fi or horror, it's about family, faith and spirituality!"".Nah....It's a pathetically crap drawn-out hack written / directed drama pretending to be Sci-Fi. Both this movies alien attack plot and themes of faith and religion fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny (and I ain't even trying). SIGNS is another overly self important film by the most overrated HACKS of his time.

"Not your typical sci-fi feature l, it's more than that!","""There is no one watching out for us, Merrill. We are all on our own""Let me put this straight, this is not your regular Science fiction flick; I think it would be rather unfair to label it as a film about Alien Invasion. Yes, Aliens are making an effort to invade, and yes they have cruel intentions in their minds, but they are merely used as a backdrop for the primary plot which is about a bereaved family who is presently coping with the loss of a loved one and pushing hard to reconcile amidst their screaming solitariness.Now, I believe many viewers went in expecting a full-blown Alien feature and I cannot blame them, the trailer did make deceitful promises and I do get it if they were frustrated, or were disappointed with the outcome! Anyways, we must also not blatantly disregard the qualities that have been showcased.Whilst, Shyamalan did take his time to build up the narrative, he did a tremendous job in doing so! He carefully unfolded various pieces of the drama and made sure we stay engaged. He took it to a certain juncture where the tension became palpable, the characters turned into familiar people you seem to care a lot about and then you suddenly start realizing the fear they felt, the kind of grief they were suffering from, the sort of seclusion these characters were put into!And that my friend is an indication of a great direction!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Signs Without Wonder,"""The world is informed by some kind of universal intelligence of scarcely conceivable power, complexity, and aesthetic subtlety, yet one to which the human intelligence is akin, and in which it can participate"" -- philosopher Richard Tarnas.Signs, the latest thriller from the director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, is about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who leaves his ministry after a car accident renders him widowed and devoid of faith. Strange things start happening: crop circles mysteriously appear in his backyard, the family pet's suddenly strikes at his children, and strange static emanates from a baby monitor. In addition, unidentified flying objects and hostile aliens start turning up around the world. I won't say any more than that about the plot, but you get the idea.Signs had me on the edge of my seat. ready to tear for the exit.I thought I would give this film a try, since I have been deeply interested in the crop circle phenomenon for many years. I figured if I could make it through the seven or eight trailers, I might have a fighting chance of surviving the multiplex experience. Once again, I succumbed to the hype, thinking that Signs was going to be a thoughtful treatment of a serious issue. What I found was just another recycling of all the shopworn thriller cliches and ""hostile alien"" stereotypes that permeate the studios.Signs does not attempt to even try to understand the complexity of the UFO phenomenon or the unearthly beauty and mystery of the crop circles, even though a prominent crop circle expert, Colin Andrews was an adviser. What seems to have escaped the Signsmakers is the realization that the universe truly is full of magic and wonder, different from the frightening images in which we have been carefully taught to believe.Repeating clichés about hostile alien invasions as is done in Signs trivializes unexplained phenomena that has great dramatic potential. M. Night Shyamalan, to me, seems interested only in exploiting the burgeoning interest in the paranormal to market his thoroughly pedestrian and unimaginative commercial product.Signs doesn't even deliver on its own terms. I found it to be neither entertaining nor suspenseful, and the ending to be laughably melodramatic.All signs point to a bad day at the multiplex.",,Anonymous,Mystery

What was with the crop flattening?,"If the aliens were so intent on offing the ex-priest and his brood why not just smoke them and go back to Planet X?

How could these beings come here from 900 zillion lights years away and be unable to work a simple door latch? Couldn't they point a laser beam and cut the hinges? Just wondering. I actually enjoyed the film after putting off watching it for months, figuring it to be another ""Alien"", a movie I detested. I especially appreciated the finale as the ex-priest comes face to face with his lack of spiritual principles.

Not much awe or mystery here,"""The man who invented the telescope found out more about heaven than the closed eyes of prayer ever discovered."" -- Robert G. Ingersoll.This film reminded me of late 1999, when all the lunatic fringe fundamentalists were preparing for the End of Days. Would a God really schedule Doomsday using something as human and arbitrary as the Gregorian calendar? I wondered what all those boneheads would do when January 1, 2000 rolled around and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED except one more rotation of the Earth. They seem to have crawled back into the woodwork where they belong. That's what this film does: Starts out not with a bang but with a loud whisper and then ends with a pathetic whimper. Roger Ebert gave this film four stars, but he has never been too reliable about films dealing with Christianity, medicine or sci-fi. Never mind starting with a bang and ending with a whimper: Signs starts out small and then fizzles entirely. You think that it is leading up to some truly great ending, but then the film takes refuge in cozy, bland, reassuring religious platitudes that contend that there is a Purpose To It All.The story of extraterrestrial contact has taken many forms: Orgies of outrageous xenophobia like The Invaders from Mars or Independence Day. Cautionary tales such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (philosophically interesting but scientifically awful). Voyages of transcendental wonder like 2001, Contact and Close Encounters. And on and on. Signs tries to take a different approach, but suffers from a massive failure of imagination.Some things about this film I like. For once, a sci-fi film isn't a wretched excess of techno-violence. It takes place on a farm in Pennsylvania. There isn't a computer in sight. You see and hear a lot of wood: Boots and shoes clomping on wooden floors and verandas. Nature is never far away. The house looks like it's really lived in, by people of modest means. There are no damsels in distress or tough-talking Amazon weapons experts. The actors, as in all of Shyamalan's films, try hard for non-acting. Compare Mel Gibson's performance in this film and the Lethal Weapon films and you'll see what I mean.But wait: Was Graham (the Gibson character) both a farmer AND a minister before he lost his faith? His cornfields look awfully lush for being those of a former non-farmer. Not that he seems to take much interest in his fields. Also, where is the barn? Where is the heavy equipment? Where are his workers, if he has any? When the crop circles appear in his fields, no one shows up from the government or the media. Maybe that's not too far-fetched, but after it becomes clear that the crop circles may well be harbingers of an invasion from space, wouldn't you have troops with weapons and federal agents all over your farm? And these aliens: Would an alien who could easily get onto your roof and nimbly elude capture by two men in good physical condition really get caught in a bathroom, unable to get out? Would aliens who can cross space be so baffled by ORDINARY WOODEN DOORS? Why would an alien in your living room just stand there, not trying to get away or strike back, while you swung a baseball bat at him? Would an alien with evil designs on humans, e.g., to kill and eat them or drug and enslave them, really venture out onto an alien planet alone, unarmed, and WITHOUT A SPACE SUIT? Wouldn't they move in groups and carry weapons? Would an alien hungry for human flesh, and able to assimilate terrestrial protein, really find plain old tap water so toxic? Would aliens who found tap water so toxic really have designs on our planet, which is, after all, kind of a wet place? If aliens really wanted to abduct people for their evil purposes, why would any be out in the middle of nowhere in sparsely populated rural Pennsylvania instead of zinging a transporter beam onto a street in Bombay or Bangkok and netting a couple of thousand beggars? Maybe he was an E.T., a lone alien accidentally left behind, but this film neither answers that question nor even asks it. There are probably those who would reply that that isn't the point, that the real story is about the human characters in the film, but as I see it, if the whole plot is absurd, from beginning to end, how can the character studies make any sense?I can imagine how much this film appealed to Mel Gibson because he has extremely primitive religious views. He is a member of a small Catholic sect that rejects the liberalization of the Catholic Church that began with Pope John XXIII and Vatican II. Maybe that explains his massive victim complex. Look at his films: With some exceptions (e.g., What Women Want), he tends to play deeply wronged men who are taking revenge, to wit: the Mad Max films, Payback (!), Conspiracy Theory, The River, Braveheart, Ransom, The Bounty, etc. Few recent films have been better than ""Signs"" at taking the awe, mystery and grandeur of the universe and trying to squeeze it into a little religious box created by superstitious primitives who lived a couple of thousand years ago.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ok maybe not 100% but...I've seen this movie several times now, and each time, even if I know what will happen, I can feel the fear coming.

Suspense over Substance,"""Signs"" is a movie that's mainly interesting because it's genuinely scary (at least in the cinema). The director M. Night Shyamalan proves beyond a doubt that he's very adept at creating suspenseful moments out of basically nothing and uses suggestion and vagueness to build the tension. It works really well.The rest of the movie is so-so. The acting by the adults (Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix) is quite strong but the little kids are once again nearly unbearable to watch, mainly because they say things no kid of their age would normally say. The story is kept intentionally vague since it serves only as a framework for the suspenseful scenes, which I think is excusable. It's not like we needed a new ""Indepedence Day"" anyway.Where the movie does go wrong, however, is in the message, ""Everything happens for a reason"", it's trying to get across. There's way too much quasi-religious talk in this movie for my taste. I don't believe in predestination and this movie certainly didn't make me change my mind about that. The whole alien invasion (including all the lives that it claims) seems to happen simply to give Mel Gibson his faith back, and Mel's son has asthma solely because he wouldn't die of the alien nerve gas that way? Come on...Without the message and the religious angle, I would have loved this movie. As it is, the movie is still pretty good (since it's really scary) but not a classic like ""Sixth Sense"" was.**1/2 out of **** stars",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Well worth it if you're into spooky, eerie films that cover horror and science fiction.","Signs is the third film from Shyamalan and the third that I've seen from him. After an impressive debut with The Sixth Sense and a horrid more recent instalment called Lady in the Water, Signs is actually somewhere in the middle in terms of overall quality. It takes some conventions from both films but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has all the slow, character driven build up revolving around a single setting (like in Lady in the Water) but it also has, at times, that eerie, uncanny feeling The Sixth Sense contained.The mystery surrounding the odd circles found outside is interesting and maintains a healthy amount of suspense and intrigue. Something a little more disturbing and unsettling, however, is a lot more closer to home. The amount of glasses of water that build up inside the house and the way in which the very young little girl claims that 'they're contaminated' or something to that effect is something very simple done in a very eerie way. It's complemented by the lighting and the way nobody in the family ever smiles or seems happy.As the film unfolds, clues are presented to us and the characters but neither of us are entirely sure of what is going on. The baby monitor is a good example. Up to this point, nobody in the world knows who's doing what or what is going on but over this family's baby monitor, there are some eerie, odd sounding noises that one member of the family actually identifies. Some other family members have other ideas and even we; the audience are allowed to make of it what we will which I thought was quite clever.Onto the characters and the children in particular: the kids seem to be too smart for their own good. Where the adults and brothers of Graham Hess (Gibson) and Merrill Hess (Phoenix) are busy suspecting rival neighbour farmers; the children are busy reading up on extra-terrestrials and solving it themselves  this is also hinted at later on in the film when Merrill is watching television (allowing people to tell him what to make of it all) whilst the children are busy predicting what the crop circles mean and what might happen next - they're often correct, as well.As Signs builds and builds, its divulge into past events that explain the undeniable feeling of depression in the house is cleverly revealed as is the tension built up for the film's climax which plays out like Night of the Living Dead or quite possibly any film from the 'Dead' trilogy. I'm not too sure how I'd react in a situation like that involving basements and extra terrestrials but I know for one thing that I'd have some sort of weapon lined up  this is tackled later on but only when the pressure is off to a certain extent and when they're out-numbering the critters.Signs is a good film on the whole, with some impressive tension built up along with good lighting, likable characters that you get a feel for and some clues thrown in at the beginning that add up very simply if thought through.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ""SIGNS""!:","After all the hype, the waiting, the anticipation, etc,....this film simply DOES NOT deliver the goods. I'd give it a 6.9 on the high side as a more than complimentary gesture. My wife gave it a 1.0.The theater was packed and this movie will sucker a lot of people in for a few days (probably $40 mil+ weekend gross), but then the word-of-mouth will make it drop like a rock quickly thereafter. I saw NO ONE who seemed thrilled by the film at the end. No buzz. No chatter. No excitement. Walked kind of limply out of the theater. Most seemed, like me and my wife, to be disappointed and left kind of hanging a bit.Script is often slow, a bit dull and, at times, muddled up. Acting is ""OK"" to good....nothing spectacular. It delivers just a very few suspenseful moments (about 3 or 4 tops) that perhaps 8 people (mostly under 12) in the whole audience screamed at. This hype of it being a ""very scary"", ""edge of your seat"", ""jump out of your seat"" film is just not true except as I've said above. And the claim that M.N.S. is ""the next Spielberg"" is a TOTAL joke!!! M.N.S. has NOTHING in common with Spielberg AT ALL! If anything, M.N.S. is more like Rod Serling or Hitchcock in that he tries to deliver surprise elements (even if getting there is very slowly paced). Even in his best film, ""THE SIXTH SENSE"", the writing gets slow and dull during the first half or so...you know how M.N.S. is....but it paid off BIG TIME in the final resolution, as we all know. ""SIGNS"" has a LOT of the M.N.S. type of dullness and slowness throughout a lot of the film, but you TRUST that he WILL, in fact, lead the film down to another great resolve, etc,.....but it just does not deliver on that trust. And that will be enough to see this rating drop along with its gross. I predict it will end up with about a 6.5-7.0 rating at best and a domestic gross of about $140 mil-$160 mil with a total WW gross of about $250 mil-$275 mil.I wanted to like it...I'm a HUGE fan of ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" (I'd rate it a 10). I like M.N.S. and Mel Gibson a lot. By the way, ""SIGNS"" also seems to be somewhat of a ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" rip-off in a couple of regards as well as a rip-off of other films. To me, it was nothing more than a much better than average flick (most flicks REALLY suck these days!), but I expected a major blockbuster. If you plan on dropping $40-$70 to take your family to this thing, you WILL NOT get your money's worth. Take a smaller group to a matinee or wait for DVD (which I'm sure will add footage and alternate endings), I am VERY sorry to say.__JUGGERNAUT__",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tense and thrilling, but a bit weak at the end","This is another remarkable work by M. Night Shyamalan, at least until the ending.  The ending wasn't bad, but it lacked the uncertainty that marked his other works.  As the end of the movie rolled around there was a point when everything became very obvious and even felt a bit contrived.  Of course that was sort of the point but it was still too heavy handed.The movie as a whole was very beautifully done.  The style is completely Shyamalan, who seems to pay extraordinary attention to the visual details. The effect is somewhat diminished by the funny looking aliens...  Although I think men in costume are better than the inevitably fake look of CGI.There was also a small problem with the casting.  Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are supposed to be brothers, but there is clearly at least 20 years of age between them.  Sure Mel looks good for his age and Joaquin was made to look old for his age, but the gap was still large enough to be confusing, especially because the chemistry feels more like father-son (or maybe uncle-nephew) than older-younger brother.  Incidentally it doesn't become clear until a third of the way through what the relationship is.  Of course they both put in good performances, on par with their best.Aside from the three minor points, too foreshadowed/clean ending, no so good aliens, and the age issue, this movie was very enjoyable.  There were moments of laughter to break the tension (too much tension is after all as bad as not enough).  The children were amazingly cute (how many Caulkin's are there anyway?).  Also it is refreshing to see a large scale problem (aliens) and how it relates to only one specific family, which incidentally prevents the movie from being too preachy.  It is about one man's choice and not saying it is globally the right choice.  I give it 8/10 with a possible upgrade to 9/10 upon further review.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
deep human drama behind the paranormal,"Signs tells the story of Graham, a former pastor who loses his faith after the accidental death of his wife. He lives quietly on a farm with his brother Meryl and their two children. One day, a huge mystery circle appears in a corn field and changes their lives forever. At first, it seems like a prank, but the series of unusual events makes them fearful. Eventually, the aliens appear and the family confronts each other. Shyamalan's unique style shines through in this film.The highlight of this film is the wonderful blend of human drama and paranormal phenomena. Graham's struggle to protect his family is touching. It is wonderful that the alien presence is not just a fear factor, but a catalyst for Graham's restoration of his faith. In particular, the process by which Graham recovers what he has lost is deeply moving. Mel Gibson's performance is stunning, and his inner struggles and struggles are truly conveyed. Joaquin Phoenix also plays the role of his brother, Merrill, as a foil, and you can feel his growth.Personally, I think this film is not just a sci-fi horror film, but a film that makes you think about the meaning of life and faith. In particular, the background that filming began after the 9/11 attacks adds depth to the film. I think the main character's sense of loss and anguish symbolizes that era. I was drawn to the process of Graham recovering himself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great,"I love most of Shyamalan's films. This is one of his best. Not sure if all the flashbacks came when they should, but this is one of the best (and most contained in terms of storytelling) alien invasion movies in history.Oh did I say Spielberg is my favorite director? Sometimes this feels a bit Spielbergian and I'm not only talking about aliens.What I love the most about Shyamalan is that he doesn't care how silly or cringe some moments will look to snobs. He likes to have fun and he knows what is his audience. The way he incorporates unexpected humor in most of his movies is very unique. And here he does it several times.Mel Gibson: What a performance! You can see through his eyes, through his words. This is not only a totally credible performance, he is super relatable for anyone who lost someone close to them.I never felt emotional watching this. Today I felt during the dinner scene. I'm becoming old.Shot composition. Well damn, if you can't see the director's trademark here, don't really know what to say.The main themes are easy to get, but I never thought a lot about how revenge/forgiveness plays a card in this movie.

Okay.It also seemingly implies that Graham's wife dying was done by God so he could get the message across to him that when the aliens attack...beat them up. And...nothing else. Thanks for cruelly taking my loving wife from me God, never would have thought of that!*Spoilers end*There's also early hints of horrendous dialogue that would go on to shine in his later films, the kids act like the girls from The Shining even though they're not supposed to be creepy, so while I did overall enjoy it, as my friend so brilliantly put it, if you're familiar with Shyamalan's later work, watching this is like being a doctor and noticing the first cancer lump on your patient, that by the time The Happening came out, had tragically and irreversibly spread.So seeing as everyone has a different film that they point to as where Shyamalan started to slip up, this is mine.

Signs is a film to be cherished!,"A profound and incredible masterpiece and Shyamalan's best to date in my opinion! Specifically following the Hess family (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) during the build up and event of an alien invasion, it's a very intimate, emotional and scary portrayal of a whole families belief during dark times (drawing slightly on themes of Night's previous film Wide Awake). The theme of faith is perfectly explored here; Graham's internal struggle with accepting past tragedy and previous beliefs being in serious jeopardy are wonderfully realised by Gibson's majestic performance; definately a career best and one of the most moving I've ever seen. I also think it features Phoenix's most underrated performance; he is superb as Merrill! The children are perfectly cast also with a pre-Little Miss Sunshine Breslin and Culkin both being absolutely brilliant. Supporting roles from Cherry Jones and M. Night himself are also beautifully played and add so much to the already full rounded and deeply rich storyline and character development. Words cannot describe my love for this film which is mainly due to it having a massive impact on me as a child; one of the most thrilling and definately the most suspenseful film watching experience I've had! The first time watching is quite unlike anything I've ever seen; the tension building is incredible and the sad or bittersweet scenes are heart wrenching. Beautifully edited by Barbara Tulliver, some of the most effective scares I've seen on screen are captured here from the monster outside Bo's window to the chilling home video broadcast on the news. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is gorgeous and the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is his absolute best work; a theme that has stayed with me ever since first hearing it. A work of genius and I don't say that lightly",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock reborn,"Whether it was his attempt, or not, M. Night Shalaman has recreated Alfred Hitchcock's style, and in essence, made it his own.Structurally, there aren't many differences between this, and a film like Psycho.  The opening credits follow Hitchcock's style of very distinctive music while showing all those associated with the film.  As well, Shalaman's cameo performance in the film, although larger than most of Hitchcock's roles, show the influence that he had on him.  Not to mention, the pure psychological aspect of the film's suspense.  Much of the action is either implied, off screen, or very, very brief, keeping the audience guessing at what is behind the tension, etc.The difference between the two, however, is the brilliance of the story itself.  The dual purpose of the title itself, ""signs,"" is brilliant in its own right.  Firstly, the actual signs, directing extra terrestrial life to various places on the planet, as well as the signs that Mel Gibson is recieving from God, to renew his faith.This outing by Shalaman is comepletely different from his previous exploits, and some may be disappointed with the absence of such a bizarre twist that exist in his previous films.  However, the mere suspense alone, makes this film worthwhile, and worth anyone's $13.50, or however much it costs in your neck of the woods.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie basically would sux the chrome off a trailer hitch.  I was surprised Mel would agree to film such a bedraggled piece of crap.  It can only mean one thing:  They paid him well for his less the spectacular performance.  Every actor has his high's and low's, and this certainly was not his best performance.  Of course with ""contact lens"" character development, you can't expect much.The ""ending"" did NOT resolve the conflict of ""are the aliens going to invade, and are they friendly"" question.

lame & derivative,"On the basis of Shyamalan's 3 major films, I think one can start drawing conclusions about his work.  First of all, he has ""tackled"" the 3 greatest mysteries of life: Death, UFOs, and Comic Books.  His treatment of all 3 is simplistic to say the least.  It would be an insult to the New Age movement to call them that, they seem just lukewarm meditations based on late-night student philosophy ramblings or just too many comic books.  So ""Signs"" was not so much a disappointment for me as a confirmation (and a waste of time.)His trademarks, at this point in his young career, are jarring implausibilities in the stories and unnatural, painfully stilted dialogue. The acting is almost uniformly wooden.  To underscore this, he even had the nerve to ""perform"" in one of the major roles of ""Signs"" and reveal his shortcomings in front of the camera as well.  (These are not flaws for audiences of limited intelligence, so I predict his continued success with the mass market.) In fact, the only thing he seems to have going as a director is a good visual sense.  So I would not be interested in seeing any future films by this director unless he should happen to hire a writer or two to help him reveal the Great Mysteries with a little more intelligence.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Another horror movie -- but this one's good... best picture good.,"I saw this the other night and M. Night Shyamalan has out done himself this time.  He's becoming Alfred Hitchcock - but of the 21st century.Mel Gibson does one thing that most actors do not have the ability of... he becomes the character in the movie.  For once it's fun to actually see an actor just fall into his part so you can just enjoy the movie and not worry about cheesy cliches.  Luckily, none of those exist in this movie.  The director definitely does deserve recognition for his part on making the movie since everything just seems natural, not fake acting, just stuff that you'd say ""now that's how I'd do it.""Now for beyond the acting.  I can honestly say that no movie this year will deserve Best Sound, other than Signs.  And I really do like movies that use original sounds, rather than some sounds that make you go ""that's a cartoon sound!"".

"A HUGE Hit, But Scary Movie Spoof Has Ruined It","Signs (2002)Plot In A Paragraph: A family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields which suggests something more frightening to come.I'll admit from the off, Signs is a silly movie. I enjoyed seeing it in the cinema.  But it's absolutely ridiculous.  And I can't watch it anymore without thinking about the Scary Movie spoof, and asking questions about why an alien race which can travel through space cant figure out how to escape a pantry. Or why, if water is so lethal to them, why would invade a planet that is mostly water. But it has a lot of genuine tension and Shyamalan has made a lot, lot worse. So there is that.I recall in interviews prior to Signs release, Gibson often stated he was no longer interested in being a movie star, . Instead, he would be focusing on producing and directing. I forget what show it was, but I remember him saying his image was not used on the posters, as it was an ensemble movie.Signs was Gibson's biggest hit (in terms of gross) as an actor, grossing $227 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 6th highest grossing movie of 2002.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan has the touch,"Shyamalan is master of orchestrating the buildup of tension and atmosphere. The fact that in the film aliens actually appear just four brief times is a testimony to deft and skilled direction.  The same is true of the 6th sense - all that tension and fear, and you only see dead people about four times in 2 hours.Gibson and Phoenix are an excellent casting choice - they complement each other very well and are thoroughly believable as brothers.  Phoenix has the haunted look down pat - just what the film needs.There's no need to recap the storyline - other reviews have done that already.  But it is necessary just to counter some of the criticisms that have come Signs' way. A lot of people out there were griping about the fact that the aliens were quite primitive  - having to use ground signs to navigate, and being vulnerable to water.  I think this is simplistic - why do people always assume that aliens, if they do exist, are more advanced than we are? Couldn't it be possible that humans are in fact the most advanced life form in the universe?Shyamalan makes his film more believable by not equipping his aliens with every gadget in the book - and at the end of the day its a film about ordinary people, who are emotionally stretched, reacting and coping with extraordinary events.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Signs is a fairy tale that uses the best of suspense to address important subjects like religion and science, making it a unique cinematic experience","The director M. Night Shyamalan, responsible for The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), returns in another production with equally supernatural elements. The story, also produced and written by the multifunctional artist, seeks to explore the mystery of the appearance of huge signs with strange shapes in plantations around the world. The film shows a quiet family of farmers in the interior of Pennsylvania, United States, formed by his father, Graham Hess (Gibson), a former priest in crisis with his faith after the violent death of his wife Collen (Patricia Kalember) in a car accident.; his brother Merrill (Phoenix), a former baseball player; and their young children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin).Signs is M. Night Shyamalan's third Hollywood film and would be marked as his last big hit before the dark phase of his career. Embarking on the science fiction genre, Shyamalan records a large-scale alien invasion, but instead of focusing on arrival and destruction (such as Spielberg's War of the Worlds), the filmmaker's lens turns to a family virtually isolated from the rest of the world; in a formidable exercise in atmosphere. Basically an invasion movie. But as elaborated in the introductory paragraph, it is the point of view adopted by the filmmaker that makes the experience so rich and different from countless other approaches to this genre. It's admirable how Shyamalan initiates a very controlled progression into the sequence of events; showing a shopkeeper watching a TV story about crop circles to count the number of soda commercials, for example, offers a natural, palpable picture to such an intense topic. The director's script also works well in bringing hints and clues to the characters' backgrounds, such as the fact that everyone still calls Graham ""priest"" or Merrill's baseball bat on the living room wall.Anyone who watches Signs thinking about an alien invasion movie in the mold of Independence Day is bound to be disappointed. Shyamalan approaches this situation from a single family perspective and in a very intimate way. He can't deny that the film's main theme is Graham Hess' (Mel Gibson) relationship to faith. He was formerly a reverend and after his wife's violent death he decided not to spend any more time with prayer. M. Night Shyamalan knows how to tell a good story. This theme allowed the director to offer us great doses of suspense and a good portion of humor.Throughout the film, we discover a little of the characters' past - facts that were at first unimportant, but which, throughout the work, prove to be essential for understanding the story. The crafted dichotomy goes far beyond doubt about the existence of God: the various events in the family's past life that prove vital to the family's survival during the extraterrestrial invasion leave questions in the viewer's mind: was it all a welcome coincidence or intervention divine? Shyamalan doesn't hide which of the two theories he embraces from the start. What we want to see is Graham finally discovering what we already know.The construction of characters is concise and well done. There isn't a person we don't care for or disbelieve about. Graham, the good father, upright, exemplary, boxy. Morgan, the eldest son, asthmatic, protective brother, too mature for his age. Bo, the youngest daughter who never finishes a glass of water (""it's contaminated"" or ""tastes like old"") and the ones everywhere, a fan of her brother, who wears it dressed in jeans showing that she is the only representative of the female in the house. And Merril, the clueless brother who decided to live with Graham after his sister-in-law's death, an owlish uncle, a former baseball athlete, the so-called ""glue"" that keeps the family together. Officer Diane Paski (Cherry Jones), family-friendly cop who worries about the Hess. The core is small, simple and yet very interesting.The simple and effective script didn't ask for much: despite having special effects (bad, but that didn't matter as much) and being science fiction, the film had a budget of US$70 million, considered an amount of large independent productions. Most of the plot takes place in the plantation-style house built in the state of Pennsylvania (the director's home state), and the epic proportions reached by the plot were left to the linguistic resources used: we know of the dystopian happening around the world from TV, from comment from people over the radio, but never from chaotic crowds or locations that called for more elaborate computer graphics. That same simplistic script that used basically a big house as a movie set allowed Shyamalan to further explore family relationships and the actors' ability to bring more empathy and charisma to the story. Successful play that made Sinais one of the biggest blockbusters of 2002.In the suspense part, the influence of Hitchcock is notorious. Shyamalan takes advantage of different situations to create an atmosphere of uncontrollable and organic tension. Often subtly, he manages to frighten us efficiently. A quick image of a being on the roof, a leg in the middle of the cornfield, strange noises picked up by a walkie-talkie and a reflection on the television screen are examples of the creativity of this talented Indian. If that wasn't enough, Signals provides moments of fun, which wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the well-written script and performances with excellent chemistry by Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.This quiet and seemingly eventless atmosphere only becomes more exacerbating when the film's major threats actually begin to manifest themselves. In two moments, we see Shyamalan's undisputed talent for building an unbearable suspense until something is revealed; the first of them, undoubtedly the most famous in the film, takes place when Merrill watches on television (again, the presence of the media makes it all the more alarming) a video taken at a birthday party in Brazil, where we see several children screaming and trying to find the creature alien - which is revealed to us in an abrupt and terrifying way for the first time, followed by the striking theme of James Newton Howard. The other moment follows the same principle, with Graham entering the house of Ray Redds (Shyamalan's own character), where he claims to have managed to lock up one of the aliens after a fight. Our anticipation is already high, knowing that the intruder could appear at any moment, and Shyamalan keeps us glued to the armchair as Graham uses the blade of a knife to see the room beyond the locked door; culminating in yet another sudden appearance of the creature, but which impacts - and frightens - precisely because of the long anticipation.Signs is a thriller with science fiction elements that heavily invests in a story full of suggested situations, obscure explanations and a lot of tension, raising interesting questions such as the possibility of alien, friendly or hostile contacts. The enigmatic gigantic circles that appear perfectly and instantly in the middle of plantations spark people's imagination about their real origins and purposes. Is it a very well-produced farce or is it really a sign with an important meaning of a non-human civilization? Shyamalan tends to hide the real plots behind much more complex arguments, but in the end they are mere backgrounds for him to develop his story. In Signs, this feature peaks: an alien invasion is the backdrop for the director to talk about faith, family and destiny. In short: the aliens could even be a McGuffin and not even appear, which would probably give the film an even better treatment of its narrative, incurring, on the other hand, the wrath of millions around the world. Ills, diseases and manias that torment the protagonist prove to be necessary in his greatest trial: proof of God? And it is in this understanding that a closer look at narrative techniques and the use of different elements - framing, mise-en-scène, semiotics - as discursive aspects in a film that suffered from the simplistic vision of a large part of the audience, used to seeing just the story and forget about other elements of language.The grand climax of the projection maintains this exquisite and exquisite handling, with Shyamalan showing us as little of the creatures or violence as possible; hearing the bark of a dog on the other side of the door being interrupted by the sharp sound of a neck snapping is far more shocking. It's also when Signals drives away a large portion of the public, who consider the outcome a great nonsense and contrived for bringing Merrill up against the alien with his baseball bat. And it really would have been, if Shyamalan hadn't prepared an entire game of foreshadowing that culminates brilliantly in this moment, from baseball conversations with his fellow military man, Graham's flashback where his wife says to ""hit it hard"" and even the craze for Good at spreading glasses of water around the house. This culmination of elements, combined with Shyamalan's camera shift (which embraces center shots and wide-angle lenses to mark Graham's catharsis) and Howard's strong music, make this one of the most beautiful and emotional moments in the filmmaker's career.This work is by nature a slow, paused film, with little action when compared to other similar productions, and the events are revealed little by little. With influences like Spielberg, Hitchcock and Kubrick, Signs is a fairy tale that uses the best of suspense to address important subjects like religion and science, making it a unique cinematic experience. The Hess family's somewhat biblical journey will leave you sleepless, looking around every time an insect hums near your ear.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan and immensely enjoyed his other three films. However, I feel that all the things which were great about ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Village"", and ""Unbreakable"" are contrasted by the disappointing and predictable ""Signs"". This film would be considered a dud for an ordinary director, but I am especially disappointed since it was made by a higher caliber of filmmaker in M. Night Shyamalan. Almost all of the elements that make his other films great are missing from ""Signs"". To me, this movie seems like a cheap imitation of Shyamalan's other three films. There is a small number of redeeming factors which I will get to first, however they are few and far between. First of, as in all of his other films Shyamalan does a great job of directing. I really enjoy the way he uses the camera and the abstract angles at which he prefers to shoot some of his scenes. The only other aspect of this movie that I liked was Mel Gibson's performance. There are only a handful of other actors that can bring so much humility and sincerity to a character. Gibson truly is a superb actor and his performance is absolutely top notch. The compliments, however, pretty much end here.One of the most disappointing things about this film is that the plot simply doesn't hold water (no pun intended for those who've seen it). You watch it for two hours and at the end you're left wondering what truly was the point. Shyamalan attempts to convey a message of belief, or the loss of, in God and in other things that human beings have been debating over for thousands of years. Yet it's hard to take away any kind of serious message when you're looking at some alien that belongs in a corny 1950's horror film. Simply put, this message along with the film both miss the mark completely. Unlike the other three Shyamalan films, ""Signs"" left me completely devoid of any true feelings or thoughts. I think that ""Stuart Litte"" (which was written by M. Night) had a more profound message than did ""Signs"". What is most disappointing is that like them or not, Shyamalan's other films at least made you think. ""Signs"", on the other hand, only made me wonder what it was that Shyamalan was thinking when he made this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I just couldn't stop laughing at his performance; he didn't make it believable, as it seems to me he overacted. I've never liked Mel Gibson very much,. He is such an arrogant person and I don't like most of his movies. The little girl made me laugh, when she said ""there is a monster outside my room, can I have glass of water? "" And Mel Gibson looked at her in a dramatic way that was very funny, because it was so unbelievably trite. In addition to that, the little girl just wasn't necessary in this movie, this would have been the same without her.This is a story of a priest who lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Then he is upset with God and doesn't let him be in his life any more. His brother, (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with him and is worried about some signs that the Aliens are making in the corn fields.

Finally Mr. Gibson recovers his faith, isn't that too predictable?I respect everybody's opinion, but I can not understand why many people liked this movie.

"Good, but not a classic.","""Signs"" is a film that intrigues the viewer, but the climax is somewhat of a letdown, and disappoints.The story concerns a series of unexplained crop circles appearing around the world, and fears of an alien invasion follow. However the focus is on one family, made up of good performances from Mel Gibson, as a former Reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix, as his younger brother. Mel Gibson is a widower with two children, and the significance of this family is revealed when they find a pattern in their crop field.As mentioned the acting is decent, and the story tight and contained. The film is somewhat of a slow burner with the tension and suspense slowly building up. The characterisation is effective, as each character is involved in the climax. We see how each character, as well as the other people reacts to the events of the film. Memorable scenes include a claustrophobic basement section, which is particularly effective and frightening.The film is not too dissimilar to Spielberg's recent ""War of the Worlds"", but where that is large scale, and often breathtaking at times, ""Signs"" is small and compact, which often works well, as it keeps the story focused, and personal.In conclusion- ""Signs"" is a good solid movie, but does not offer anything particularly memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Signing Off,"Sometimes writers have only one good story to tell like the Wachowski Brothers who did Matrix and the God-awful double dose of sequences.  That seems to be the case with M.

Then came Unbreakable, a ridiculous comic book creation with cardboard characters at best.  Then came Signs, which I think should have been titled Unwatchable.  This wasn't a movie, it was a slide show, though I admire Shyamalan for being able to cram a 20 minute script into nearly two hours.  Watch the touching moments when characters search for an intelligent line and fail.  Wait for that heartfelt moment when Mel walks in on Joaquin and the kids to find them all wearing hats made of aluminum foil.

A perfect blend,"M. Night definitely knows how to scare us. In the film we see non traditional camera angles and a whole slew of eerie sounds. He manages to get the feeling of complete alien invasion without the overuse of special effects which sometimes ruin movies. On the surface this looks like a scary sci fi alien movie, but after watching it is much much more. I went in to the movie expecting nothing more than the average. A little bit scary with a typical plot. This was far from it. The story is a perfect blend of classic sci-fi elements, religious messages and appropriate comic relief. In the same movie I laughed, cried and froze with fear. The religious message was pretty powerful in the film, but I feel it wasn't too much to handle. The acting was far better than i expected. Gibson stepped away from a typical role and delivered a convincing performance. Joaquin Pheonix was cast in a role perfect for him and did a great job to keep the movie from getting too serious or too comical at any time. He is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The musical score my James Newton Howard was the icing on the cake in my opinion. The unique score presents itself in the opening credits and is found throughout the whole film, giving it a sense of unity. Without the music, the movie would not have the same potent effect.Even though I am not very religious myself, i felt very comfortable with the theme that was presented. We are not alone. We may not know who or what, but there is something else out there. There are no coincidences and even though things may seem bad with a little bit of faith and courage things will be alright. Believe in yourself, trust your family and keep your faith. As I said, it's a powerful message, but trust yourself you can handle it. THis movie come highly recommended by me and i feel almost anyone would enjoy it. Powerful, exciting, scary and completely captivating, there is no reason to not see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Generally a good flick.  Must see at cinema.,"This movie is appropriately titled, but the title does not mean what you think it means.  The title is focused more on signs in the religious sense. Crop signs are just a tool that the director uses in the movie to tell the story which focuses on the main character portrayed by Mel Gibson.  I thought all the actors did a good job.  The movie generates a good deal of suspense and tension with humor intermixed at the appropriate times.  The story was good but a little tough to believe in some parts.  You have to see it in a real cinema to get the most out of the suspense.  Although this movie was good, I would not see it more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A despondent film with monotone dialogue and emotion,"M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is plagued, as was his predecessor, The Sixth Sense with an X-file like mood. Scully and Mulder had to be searching that corn field. Emotions lie low in this despondent film. Let's face it, Shyamalan has a gimmick and it seems to work well with Bourgeois audiences. The film is very goofy on the most part.The film holds our curiosity but fails to deliver any punch.  It seems to be dwelling on some philosophical idea of the human condition in the 21st century. It explores the faith and family of rural America in a quick changing world.  A corn raised family residing in an Andrew Wyeth painting.The directing and lighting in the film fail to inspire any originality.  It leaves one to believe that Shyamalan was under contract to make another film; ""Oh, who cares...give them cheap alien gimmicks and a corn field....we'll get you Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson....it will make millions...""And it did....",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Decent flick, weak plot, suspenseful..","The story of the film combines the traditional ""aliens visiting planet earth"" story-line with a theme overlooked in other films, crop circles.  I was disappointed in the lack of information revealed in the movie's theme. It may have perhaps been the writer's intention to have the viewers' experience the happenings from a rural farmer's family perspective, but nonetheless, the ""realism"" aspect of the story was hard to grasp, mostly because of the lack of revealing the reactions from people on a wider scale. To me, story-line was weak, and it seemed to me the crop circles were the least touched-upon element of the movie.  However, the movie did a good job of grabbing your attention and keeping the suspense going, with many scenes that may make you jump.  The movie is still worth seeing, but it may come as somewhat of a disappointment for a film starring Mel Gibson.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A unique movie,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favourite directors. That because he makes his movies in an unique style. Signs is his first film after the smash-hits The sixth sense and Unbreakable. Evey movie he makes is good, and this is not a exception. The movie is about a preacher named Graham Hess who has lost his wife. He live on a farm with his two kids and his brother Meryll (Joaquin Phoenix).One morning Graham finds a massive crop circle in his back yard. Graham thinks it's jokers fooling around, but when they begin to occur all around the world, he soon finds out that the planet are been invaded by aliens. Night focus more on the scares and suspense rather on the action. And thats not a bad thing. Everything in this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is beautifully composed by James Newton Howard (King Kong, The village). M. Night Shyamalan produced, directed, starred and wrote this peace of art. Signs is truly a work of art, and i recommend it for those who are a big Shyamalan fan or just love good movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Shyamalan, 1  Spielberg, 0","M. Night Shyamalan's Signs feels like a loose retelling of H. G. Well's War of the Worlds because there's something ubiquitous on Earth the pointy, clicking little acrobats can't abide.If that's true, then Signs is a vastly superior--and very, very scary-- version of Well's work. This movie elicited such dread from me that I had to shut off the tape repeatedly and take a breather. It's that good.Compared to Spielberg's 2005 version, Signs looks even better. Spielberg managed to turn his work into a overblown, episodic, and ultimately very frustrating movie that only scared me when I got to see his aliens (and that was too damn little face time for me!).I think Signs was one of the few horror movies I've seen in anything like recent history that makes me shiver when I think of it--and I saw it in the summer of 2007!That's staying power.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The weak end destroyed a lot of the movie,"First of all, i will start with the positive aspects of ""Signs"": The film is well made, it don't need a lot of special effects to cover a weak plot or made the audience scary. It is a silent film, in which the horror of the unknown comes silent and slowly. The movie starts with the crop-circles, and then we realize very slowly whats going on with the aliens, the ships in the sky, the news from all around the world and the big question: Come there in peace or it is a invasion? It was a very good idea to focus almost the complete movie on the farmhouse and its residents. This is the way which most of us will probably witness the first contact (in peace or not). Sitting at home, listen mesmerized to the news on the TV and the radio and discuss about the aliens and what he will probably do or what we shall probably do. At last it clear up, that the aliens are not friendly visitors, and we find our family alone in its home, with almost nothing to defend himself...Until this point it was a very good movie, but at last the stupidity of the aliens is astonishing: Invading a planet, that was covered with approx. 2/3 of water... the stuff, that is deadly for the invaders. After i saw this movie i imagined a ridiculous scene: The aliens runs all over our planet... and it starts to rain... i imagined the Song ""Little April Shower"" from ""Bambi"" during the aliens quoting the Wicked Witch of the West from ""The Wizard of Oz"": ""I'm melting! I'm melting! Ohhhhh...What a world! What a world!""The weak end destroyed a lot of that, what the first 95% very good runtime of the film had build up. In this film M. Night Shyamalan had unfortunately failed with his last surprising twist. ""The sixth sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are both weaker in the beginning, but the end twists are much better than in ""Signs"". So the first very good 95% of the movie deserve a 9, but the last weak 5% only a 3. Overall i give the complete movie a 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Most tedious film of the year,"Perhaps it's because ""Taken"" presented an alien-theme story that kept you on the edge of your seat for most of 20 hours that this film seemed so staggeringly slow and tedious.  ""Taken"" didn't drown in so many cliches, either.  This was ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Field of Dreams.""The story had nothing unique or particularly interesting about it, and I didn't feel the actors were ever in character, not even the kids.  I never felt they were uneasy or scared, and thus, neither was I.  After about 35 endless minutes, I watched most of the movie at double speed with subtitles, didn't miss a thing, and even then, it seemed slow.  I think the day is over when anyone can be spooked by someone taking 5 minutes to walk down a corridor with thumping sounds off screen.Can this have been made by the same director as ""The Sixth Sense""?  It doesn't seem possible.The deleted scenes on the DVD were more interesting than the film itself and they added needed character background.  I can't believe they were cut for time when the movie had so many scenes that contained endless minutes of nothing.Others have mentioned the plot holes, and I totally agree. The entire concept of a race which can be destroyed by water coming to earth is plain silly.  And why, when the TV reports that people in other areas have found ""ancient"" ways of defeating the aliens, do they not report what that method is?

"A Very Interesting Point of View, of UFO's and Alein Encounters.","This was a very enjoyable film, assuming you have an interest in extraterrestrial encounters etc. Although to be fair it does have a very good thriller aspect to it so it may also appeal to the sort of person that enjoys a good jolt. Mel Gibson as per usual was excellent. The story's perspective is clever, as we rarely see this sort of story from the ordinary person's point of view, with regards to Aliens invasion.You know most films seem to have the government, army, etc., in the film somewhere. This does not. Also the clever lack of background music is the reason for the very eyrie atmosphere that the director seems to have strived for and achieved.Although I felt that the charters did some strange things.For example if you where being pursued in your own house by someone or something the natural reaction is to arm your self, even if only with a tennis shoe, to lash out at, no one did. They seemed happy to wait what ever fait would come. When the son is under grave threat, the notion of striking out, at the threat seems to evade the brother, who is portrayed as a bit of a thug come nice guy. The end was also a little lame, but these complaints set aside I would recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A waste of time, a waste of talent...","It is obvious enough to anyone who watches ""Signs"", that as a child, the writer/director, M. Night Shyamalan, absolutely adored Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" and ""E.T"".  And rightfully so.But as a grownup, we could at least expect him to show a little bit of novelty. In ""E.T."" we've already seen someone running through a dark corn field, holding a flashlight, looking for the extra-terrestrial. We've already seen common people preparing for the historical encounter with aliens in ""Close Encounters"" and in many other films.  We've already seen the aliens hover above the world's main cities in ""Independence Day"" and alike.  So why does Shyamalan repeat these scenarios in such a boring fashion???If he want's to show that ""anything Spielberg can do, I can do better"", well, he can't.In ""The Sixth Sense"" he had a great original idea. In ""Unbreakable"" the idea wasn't that great, but at least it was original. ""Signs"" brings the promising director/writer to a sad low-point.It is a conservative, righteous and annoying story about a father and his son. The aliens are just guest stars who drop by from other movies, better movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wouldn't they have expected that?  Especially because Earth is 2/3s made up of water, why the hell would they come here?  And not only do they come here regardless of the water thing, they come here completely naked?  Lame.Besides the fact that it wasn't very well thought out, it was still a trip of a movie.

"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","I loved ""Signs"".....and I hated it.  The basic sci-fi idea is good, the script and direction are bad, and the creature is ugly.  As a homage to ""The Thing"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" and Hitchcock's ""Birds"", this movie is right on.  The scary corn field, the quick glimpses of our alien visitors, the spooky sound effects, the lights going out at just the right moment...all guaranteed to make you spill a little popcorn. And there are some genuinely funny scenes, too. However, M.N.S's script and direction are so slow and ponderous between these high points as to make one feel sleepy and bored.  Watching Mel Gibson trying to act out a crisis of personal faith is like watching paint dry.  This has to be his dullest performance to date.  The rest of the cast is good (check out the creepy performance by the actor playing the recruiting officer talking to Joaquin Phoenix) but the words they are given to speak never sound natural or real. It's almost like watching a bad stage play.  My advice to Night: keep coming up with unique ideas and hooks for the audience, but stay out of directing and acting.  As Stephen King found out, it's best to leave these things to the professionals.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Signs is the most entertaining movie ever made.,"This movie will simply leave you breathless. As an avid fan of movies, and someone who watches reviews and award ceremonies very closely, I can honestly say this is the most entertaining movie ever made. The camera work forces you to follow every detail on the edge of your seat. The movie keeps you on edge from the first scene to the last. As a reviewer from the show Access Hollywood put it, if Alfred Hitchcock made a movie relating to extra terrestrials, this would be it. It is so intense that the viewer is eyes wide open during every scene. Mel Gibson gives a extremely compelling performance as a former reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix shows his versatility by playing a former baseball player who moves in with his older brother, Gibson, after a tragic accident. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are simply amazing. Their performances are heartfelt and cheery at the same time. Cherry Jones provides comfort as a realistic local law enforcement officer. One can only see Signs to understand its deep nature. But this movie is not about aliens, it is about a man finding himself. Everyone thought it was impossible that M. Night Shyamalan could top himself, but he has done it with Signs, a movie which is even more entertaining, compelling and deep than the Sixth Sense.

If Hitchcock had directed Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind,"Newsweek called Shyamalan the next Spielberg. I'll go them one better. He's the next Alfred Hitchcock, a much better fit and a much better director to be compared with. Shyamalan doesn't seem to be the type who would hide a script so that only he could get his hands on it (as with Jaws). Nor would he lie about characters in his film (the origin of Indy's name). Nor would he blame others for the failure of one of his films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Hook, Goonies). Spielberg has done all of these things, and has lost any credibility he ever had, along with his story telling ability. No, Shyamalan will be more like Hitchcock, someone who knows how to weave an excellent tale without smarminess, pretentiousness or pointless screenplays. This is what CE3K should have been, rich in details that mean something. While Encounters was all pretty pictures and hollow characters, every scene in Signs added a layer to the climax, with people we could know. I won't spoil this wonderful film with any details. It covered a lot of different subjects while scaring me into silence during the last half. Like the best of Hitchcock's films, it will leave you a bit disturbed as you walk out of the theater.

Wrong from the very concept or main vehicle used for the story.,"So what's the use in watching the rest of it unless you want to see the stand alone performances of the actors or the camera work.That might be interesting enough to people who would like to see how foolishly vacant the director managed to make Gibson, Phoenix & the rest of the cast look in this movie, which might prepare you for the more extreme states of catatonia of Zooey Deschanel & co. in the later Shymalan offering, The Happening.Obviously those that overlook the water 'thing' in this film only consider water that is humanly visible or water in obvious & copious liquid appearance. Even then, we do sweat & spit & piss water so it's quite unavoidable on this planet in any form. The aliens in this instance cannot even enter the atmosphere without knowing or feeling this. Are they so immeasurably unintellgent as to be capable of space travel & survival across space & not be able to figure the simplest of natural & universal facts out?The air all over on the planet is filled with minute traces of water especially the humid tropical areas. Even people are more than 50%. water. Babies are almost 80% water. When they enter the atmosphere alone, the planet is enveloped in a blanket of dense water moisture that cycles from the ground to the sky. The whole planet would be toxic to their system & they would feel ill or die in no time if water is toxic & fatal to them. They wouldn't stand a chance to even fight a human let alone live long enough.Could they be that desperate & mindless to have had the ability to travel the universe better than humans & not pick the majority of planets available free of water nor figure out that humans are probably intelligent enough to figure out some basic things like water. I mean they are advanced enough in space travel to indicate that they might do without oxygen very well & be smart enough not to carelessly assume they are dealing with totally unintelligent life without noticing a few immediate & obvious telltale signs that humans are not unintelligent & that the existent water on this one planet is absolutely inhospitable to the survival of their kind as compared to so many others that don't pose such an absolute no no...it's a no brainer that those aliens should pass on & stay away from the planet earth as one should pass on & stay away from this movie.Also, if we have to take the circumstances of this film further, it wouldn't take long for any person to notice how these aliens stay away from water of any source, seeing that we have water all around us at anytime, every time, everywhere.Even our inadvertent spit when we speak would hurt or kill them.We can literally & figuritavely piss them off to death too. They wouldn't dare touch us when we sweat. Hell, they can't even breathe or walk without running into walls of water molecules present all over the earth. According to the given rules of this film, their best chance of surviving a single moment on earth might be to wear special protective suits or try the deepest driest deserts like the Sahara.The whole alien concept of this film has gone to a whole new ludicrous & laughable level.Come on now, those who missed this or won't acknowledge this gaping major flaw that this film's whole existence stands on, please show some basic sense.No more excuses for Shymalan on this one please!",,Anonymous,Mystery
An objective view of Signs,"In an age in which movie soundtracks are marketed as separate albums and singles, where soundtracks contribute to the overall ambience and mood of each scene in a film and moviegoers are subconsiously aware of a soundtrack throughout the running lenght of a film, the one thing that strikes anyone when they watch Signs is the spartan soundtrack, which by virtue of its sparseness, heightens many scenes and delivers more feel and tension to scenes in the film. Everything seems unusally loud and moviegoers are transported into the film along with the cast. There is nothing to distract anyone from what unfurls onscreen, nothing. Another aspect of signs is the camera work. The photography is indirect and has a very artistic feel to it. But it is also a letdown.What may have otherwisebeen accomplished with pomp and superb camera work is not. The camera angles and shooting of the concluding sequence in Graham's living room is surprising and lacks what one would expect. It's as if Shyamalan couldn't handle an action sequence. What Shyamalan wins by way of build-up and mystery, he looses in leaving too many loose ends and too much left unexplained. In an era of films like Independence Day and such, Signs leads us to beleive we will see more of some contact between intergalatic races and then when we do not, it is a letdown. A sort of anticlimax. And then, in retrospect, the film is not smooth. Scenes just seem to be put together with no flow and some times even border on ridiculous and cumbersome. What saves the movie and is worth serious moviegoers' time, is a superb performance by Mel Gibson, climaxing in an emotional dinner scene with his family.

Night would live up to the same high standard on this film.  Sadly though, he didn't. The subject matter was juicy, the possibilities were endless, and although I did scream a couple of times in my seat, the movie never gave the payoff that one waits for in a stellar film.  Gibson was great, no fault on his part, as was Joaquin Phoenix and the two kids, but the film seemed to missing something in the equation that took it out of the league of exceptional and into the category of a near miss.  After having looked forward to seeing this film for a month, it was a letdown.  That being said, it's still a better summer movie than most other choices and certainly seemed to satisfy a lot of other audience members -  my advice, see it on a weekend afternoon when you've got some extra time on your hands to kill.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A stinker of epic proportions.,"""Signs"" is undoubtedly the stupidest, most vacuous, inane, pathetic movie that I have ever seen in my 74 years. How any actor would be hard up enough to accept a role in this stinker is beyond me. I really disciplined myself to watch this excruciating effort to its conclusion. I didn't think that I was capable of watching such tripe to its conclusion.The directing, dialog, story, and everything else associated with this fiasco takes the cake in the production of a deplorable asinine movie.Another loser movie which to me is quite similar to the ""Signs"" is ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" I can't wait to see ""Gigli."" After how badly it has been panned I can't imagine how it could be any worse than the aforementioned.Give me the movies that were really movies. These were the movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's. Thank goodness for TCM.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Lightweight psychodrama.,"I like Mel Gibson as an actor, really, but just not in fatherly roles like he plays here or in ""The Patriot.""  His portrayal of a priest who's lost his faith wrapped around a story of alien invasion just didn't strike me as real.  He's much better as a wise-cracking cop, like in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series or the rugged loner in the ""Mad Max"" trilogy.The movie centers around a conversation Mel has with his nephew, in which he postulates that there are two kinds of people in this world - those who believe in miracles and destiny, and those who believe things just happen for no real reason.Mel plays a reverend in a small Pennsylvania farming community who recently lost his wife in a freak auto accident.  He's left the church because of his loss of faith and is now bitter and rudderless in life.  His house is a mess and his family is breaking up.Then one day, crop circles appear in his corn field.  Soon after, strange beings show up on the farm and in the community.His asthmatic son, played by Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Rory, is curious about the aliens, sensing right away that this is a real invasion. Mel's daughter, played by the cute-as-a-button Abigail Breslin, seems more awed by what's happening than frightened.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Mel's nephew, who's helping out around the farm, and he's decidedly in the camp of this is all a miracle of some sort.The ""signs"" from the title refers to events leading to other events in the lives of the characters.  The movie is supposed to make us realize that all things are connected and that we should look for signs in our lives, but the overall effect is a bit clumsy in the movie.A conversion Mel has with his dying wife in which her last words are, ""Hit away,"" ties in with Merrill's (Joaquin Phoenix) skills with a baseball bat, which comes in handy when an alien invades their house and snatches the little boy.  Alot is made of the fact that the boy's asthma actually saves him from the alien's attempt to poison him with some gas.  The asthma is a sign?  God made him asthmatic in order to save him?  That's what Mel thinks.The movie is entertaining and a bit spooky.  Much of the movie feels like you're part of someone's dream, sort of like Shayamalan's ""The Sixth Sense."" But I was expecting something more complex from the appearance of the crop circles, not a straight forward alien invasion complete with boogeymen creatures trying to drag off the children.Mel's dilemma as he deals with his loss of faith and the impending disaster centers the movie, but I had difficulty interpreting his emotions most of the time.  He doesn't play a character in control, which is what you expect of Mel Gibson.  He's confused and angry and drifts through much of the movie with a blank expression, not seeming to know where he's going, which makes for an awkward story since no one else really picks up the slack.  Drama requires a hero, and that element is lacking in this movie.  The final scene where Mel puts his collar back on seems trite.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth a watch but don't expect much,"Watched this at the weekend and it makes for a good family film. There is plenty of horror, suspense and subtle comedy for the surface plot and also a deeper meaning to the story which can be left up to the viewer. It's perfect for kids after some jump scares and it's a clean film.The movie does look quite dated watching it in 2025 and there are plenty of plot holes to turn a blind eye to, but the story is not really about aliens invading the planet so it shouldn't be ripped apart based on that.The biggest criticism is probably not portraying better what's going on in Mel Gibsons mind, the dinner scene and messages would have been more impactful

Signs is a moody masterpiece,"When it comes to M Night Shyamalan movies, they are often heavily criticized for being too absurd. And the critics may have a point when it comes to some of the movies, which holds a very low class. But in this case, the critics are absolutely wrong. I can honestly say that ""Signs"" is one of the greatest Sci-fi movies ever created.The story centers on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). A former priest whose faith in god has been shattered after his wife died in an accident with a drunk driver. After the accident, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) moves into the farmhouse where Graham and his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), live. Months pass and few things happen that are out of the ordinary until Graham discovers an enormous crop circle in his field. Instantly, Graham and Merrill wonders which gang that may have come around to make a big prank but after they see breaking news about crop circles all over the world, they begin to expect an extra-terrestrial interference.This is the plot of the movie, and just reading it can make you anticipate that it is going to be a very exciting film. And it sure is. ""Signs"" really shook me and made me discover a whole new kind of suspense. To create a movie that is tense for 106 minutes, you are going to need class actors. And in this case, M Night Shyamalan, does not disappoint. Mel Gibson, two times Oscar winner, is perfect for the role of Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers both tears, hoorays and a couple of laughs. Even the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are very talented and play their rolls in the best way possible.Do this movie have any flaws or plot holes that may lower the rating? Absolutely. There is a plot hole in the movie which makes viewers want to give it a low grade, and even some flaws that excludes the movie from being one of the smartest ever directed. But people have to remember something; M Night Shyamalan does not aim for being the cleverest director with the smartest plots. He aims for something else that is called sheer suspense, and in that field, he is one of the greats.If you want a film that will knock you over, maybe not in the level of intelligence, but in the level of suspense, look no further. Do yourself a favor and buy a big bag of crisps, sit down in the sofa and watch ""Signs"" and you won't regret it for a single minute. This movie is going to rock you, shock you and especially give you a new experience that you always will carry with you.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Signs unfortunately has no replay value, in fact it has no play value at all. The film is hardly scary at all. The supposedly frightening moments may be scary to a 4 year old, but anyone of age that finds anything in this movie scary is out of their mind. One of the worst things about this film is the horrible cast. Mel Gibson does a good job, but Joaquin Phoenix doesn't fit his role well, Macaulay Culkin's kid brother is an annoying brainiac pest, and the little girl in the movie isn't cute at all - she's way too ""forced"" to act cute.

This time he's done it.... sadly not quite,"I'm delighted to see that Shyamalan is indeed learning, evolving, and seems to have the right kind of ambition.I'm among those who disliked the 6th sense, because I found it too manipulating, full of cliches and contrived acting. And awful Hollywood syrup music (heeewwww!). But I recognized a talent, as the story was great and some of the direction aspects were very interesting and refreshing.I was looking forward his next opus, hoping this guy would improve, but obviously ""Unbreakable"" was mainly an attempt to make another hit, and despite the -once again- great story, it was quite a boring movie.This time we have something really interesting.First, we have the first really frightening movie since a loooong time.I wouldn't watch it alone, and very few movies have this effect on me. And no, the 6th sense was not one of them.Secondly, we have a tuneful, tasty and intelligent direction, that does not insult my intelligence by loudly pinpointing everything that matters. No, one actually has to be patient, observe and think about what's happening. This is meditative direction. I like it so much. Outstanding pace, served by a brilliant visual composition and perfect editing. The narrative is not ""illustrated"" by the movie like in 99% of modern productions, the narrative IS the movie and vice-versa. Aaaaah.This is where Shyamalan's ambition is clear, as this kind of direction is not aimed at the brainless and shallow modern audience. No, he wants to please those who think, who observe, who actually take the time to get into the narration and fill the gaps. Those who read books, or look at decent movies. So he's trying to escape the commercial hype around his first opus. Great.Then there is the acting direction. This is very clever stuff. OK he's been borrowing a lot, mainly from Kubrick (Shining) and the Coens (Fargo). Nevertheless, this work is really impressive. And miracle (;-)), Gibson actually played the game! Thanks God, he did! Maybe he was not really aware of what Shyamalan was doing with him, who cares as the result is here for us to enjoy. Phoenix was a pretty clever choice as he's a natural for this kind of stuff. He does know what it's about, and fills exactly the right space. I'm curious to see what will be Phoenix's next works. I think he should meet Cronenberg sometime.So Shyamalan seems to have made his choice: to be an artistic director, there with the Coens, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch and others. Well he has good chances to succeed. But it seems he still has to gain more independance.Because I can't believe that he actually thinks that the way he uses music is near to adequate (from an artistic point of view). Please. The best parts are the ones without any music, and thankfully there are plenty of them. Good. But when there IS music, a much better one would be needed. We have lots of good movie composers nowadays, just pick one.And I can't believe that this incredible happy ending, with its pedestrian, dull moral subtext, is what he intended with this story that until then was packed with dense, clever, subversive subtext. I HOPE he did not. I HOPE he's going to gain more independance and become a real free artist. Then when he talks about faith, he'll do it HIS way until the very end of the story.I know there are a lot out there who'd love him to keep on making soapy, sweetened, viewer-friendly flicks like ""the Sixth Sense"", but I'm among those who are expecting much more quality, challenging stuff from such a talented person. Would ""Signs"" be... a sign that it's going to happen? Have faith ;-)!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not really scary, but better than some suggest.","I can't really understand why people seem to think this movie was so scary. Yeah theres an intensity to certain scenes, and some scenes have a certain atmosphere that adds to the intensity, but all in all theres nothing really jump out of my seat scary. Alien hands all of the sudden popping out from behind grates and underneath doors aren't scary. Dogs barking aren't scary. The only thing mildly scary (meaning that again something adds to a creepy atmosphere) are the aliens speaking. Besides the fact that the movie wasn't scary, I found most of it so well made it held my attention throughout. I liked the little facts that the writer/director shows us about the family and the affects tragedy that they have suffered from affecting them through the movie. I liked Mel Gibson, a stoic tough guy actor in American movies, reluctance to use profanity to scare off prowlers in the night. I like the adults interaction with the children. And the little things the kids do that make them fun to watch. And I especially like the fact that this is an alien invasion movie seen from one perspective, not some Hollywood sized Independence Day style epic with multiple big names phoning in performances whilst doing battle with aliens in what can only be described as scenes that wish they could be from Star Wars. Thats an interesting side to the story that intrigued me, even though it adds to a possible plot hole in the storyline. Throughout the movie there are no scenes of ruined desicated cities are huge alien armies. The only time we really know the aliens are attacking is when they surround the house and we can hear them instead of seeing them. That scene in particular is one the more intense scenes that the film can muster, and truly involve me as a viewer. One more note though, is the fact of faith in the movie. I know its interesting to have someone examining his faith during a time as portrayed, but doe it have to reach the level of sermonizing that it reaches in this particular film. When these scenes occur it really drags down the proccedings and puts a damper on the fun of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A tribute to Hitchcock,"The best storyteller in the Movie Business.  (Sorry Stephen)IMHO the central theme was the struggle between the two philosophies; that we are lucky plus having (God) watching and jiggling the odds a bit, or we were strictly on our own.  The first philosophy, one which ultimately prevailed, included the coincidences which gave Mel Gibson the clues (signs) to understand the conflict he was in, both with the aliens and himself.  We understand he ultimately won when he put the collar on at the end of the film. All of the clues are spread out: his wife's last message, his daughter's water obsession, his son's asthma, his brother's skill with (and seeming obsession with) a bat and inability to not swing, the clue from M.

A Fun Time At The Theater,"This was a very entertaining, and enjoyable movie for myself and my family. It's obvious that a lot of IMDB users, use Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Schindler's List as their basis for comparison to every movie they review, so they'll always have plenty to complain about. Fortunately, I'm not such a movie geek that I have to expound on each aspect of the film and I can look at it objectively for what it is; an opportunity to escape into the lives of some characters and watch them solve the problems that life throws at them. With that in mind, ""Go see this movie."" It's a good story to take your mind of off whatever problems you might be having and I can guarantee if you go, not expecting 'Gone With The Wind', you won't be disappointed. You should laugh, you may cry, you'll definitely jump out of your seat on occasion, only when you're not sitting on the edge of it. The movie provides some good discussion points, so you can talk about it afterwards over pizza with whomever you saw it with. What more could be expected? The story-line and plot-points have all been beat to death hear so I won't go there, but I would like to make some observations. I think M. Night Shyamalan's main interest is entertaining his audience, ala Spielberg, Hanks, and Eastwood. I'm sure if it was his goal to win a Best Movie oscar he could produce garbage like 'Sakespeare In Love' or 'American Beauty', but I believe it's more important to him that his film 'entertains' rather than 'achieve' and I applaud him for that. Another more selfish comment is that I would've really liked to have seen Bruce Willis in the Mel Gibson role. Not that Mel was bad, I thought he played the part well, but it would've been interesting to see how Bruce would've played it, while shooting the hat-trick with M. Night, after The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. My last point is, don't read more into the story than what it is, 'characters struggling against outside forces of conflict.' If you do that, you'll enjoy the film, but if you do feel compelled to analyze every frame, you may want to stay home and rent Casablanca instead.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't put it up there with those previous two films. There were some nice scenes, though, and he has a way of getting some nice spiritual moments to ring through in a way that feels right. My favorite moment was actually the goofiest, when there was the videocam capture of the alien at the children's birthday party (a nice Bigfoot cop, btw). It was kind of goofy, really, but also gave me the feeling of what it would be like to be seeing that in the situation the characters were in, and therefore the reaction was shocking as intended. I thought the performances were very good, particularly Joachin Phoenix (who I didn't like at all in Gladiator). His reactions to what was going on helped make it believable (for example, when seeing the video of the alien). If anything, the film seemed a bit too short. It took a while to get going, and then once it got going a little, it ended. I like what I saw, but I guess I expected a little more, as opposed to Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, which seemed a little more satisfying as a whole. Still worth seeing, though.

So if you go to see this movie then you should leave the theater 5 minutes before the end, because then it's so dissapointing. A fine example of a typical Hollywood movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Faith,"M. Night Shyamalan directed this understated thriller that stars Mel Gibson as Reverend Graham Hess, who has moved into a country farmhouse with his brother Merrill(played by Joaquin Phoenix), and two children Morgan(played by Rory Calhoun) and Bo(played by Abigail Breslin)after his wife was killed in a car accident, a personal loss that has made him lose his faith. One day, they notice crop circles in their field, which they initially pass off as kid vandalism, but it turns out to be a prelude to alien invasion, that will hit close to their home, and making Graham rethink his anger with God. Well-intentioned film is not as well structured as the directors' first two pictures, with some awkward writing and plot holes, yet the ending is deceptively underwhelming, for it's because of its subtlety(and the sudden realization by Graham about God's reasons) that it retains itself in viewers' memory. Despite the numerous flaws, this is still worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
★★★★,"In the unraveling of a story, people expect a payoff. With Signs, the payoff is the unraveling. We pick up on strange frequencies given by the somber tone of the film. We tell ourselves that nothing is there, our senses desperately scream at us otherwise, and the film builds and builds and builds.The mastery of Signs isn't in its concept, but rather in the way it manages to sustain a certain tone of trepidation, and deliver upon it in progressively suspenseful ways to the very end. Movies like Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" have been wise in the ways they've concealed a crucial element to understanding the true nature of themselves right in plain sight-- the telling felt off, right up until their realities were overturned while leaving audiences frantically working out the logistics of the newly defined truth in their heads. Signs has honed this skill, and uses it to suspend our need for explanation while all around, things have never felt more wrong. The unease inherent in fearing something just beyond our ability to see and hear is something we are more receptive to than any other type of fear; command over this instinct is what separates bad horror movies from good ones, then good ones from great ones.From the opening credits, we are granted insight into how the movie works. At first, the words are introduced with slow fade-ins and the aid of subdued violins. Low-key, before a Hitchcockian score cuts through the repose and the title is introduced like a jump cut to something unfriendly. The title cards are now shown in regular cuts, but then- whoosh!- now they're zooming onto the screen with the score now in full Psycho-mode. This is escalation, and it reflects perfectly the aim of this film and the way it chooses to go about it. The opening shot is just as disseminating: a normal backyard in all respects, and yet... Something is Wrong.The backyard belongs to a farm in rural Pennsylvania, under the ownership of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family of two kids, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Graham is a former priest who seems to have lost his faith ever since an incident that left his family a little emptier. Bo, his daughter, cannot ever seem to finish a glass of water but has discomforting dreams that seem to mean something for the family; the dreams are never brought into the spotlight, cannily remaining in the fringes of the movie's focus for us to interpret. Morgan is the son who suffers from asthma and maintains his faith despite his father. They are accompanied by Hess' brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). They are already a broken family before the crop circles form in their field, and we start seeing things, signs. Of?Terror is quiet. We stare for longer than we should because we think we saw something. We listen intently, and hear nothing, and we listen harder. Skillfully done horror doesn't manifest in the form of tangible scares, but in their absence. You remember the saying by Hitchcock: ""There's two people having breakfast and there's a bomb under the table. If it explodes, that's a surprise. But if it doesn't..."" Dogs bark at nothing, the wind blows strangely, and it's as if what's hidden is right in the characters' faces. Right in the air they breathe. In a scene that has the characters parsing a book on the possibility of extraterrestrials, I thought back to Jaws.Whatever they are, the things we can't see, we perceive them through secondhand means. We see shadows, we hear noises, silhouettes in the night slink in and out of view. When footage of them is captured, the image quality is low and grainy; we see just enough. Fewer things are more disturbing than catching a glimpse of someone's, or something's, head dart behind a wall. Because our terror is inflamed by what we can't sense and justified by the few times we can, their presence extends far past what we can physically make of them and locks the whole movie in a state of omnipresent dread.Our knowledge of the aliens is as sparse as it is beside the point. News reports aren't that informative or knowledgeable-- realistically, they know as little as we do. Although we know the spaceships are there, we can't see them. We know there must be panic brewing down there, but we never see any rioting or commotion; by diverting the focus away from scenes of pandemonium in the streets and in homes, we aren't given a means of climactic catharsis standard to the aftermaths of alien invasion movies. The crop circles explain pretty much nothing and everything. We don't have to know where they come from, just that it's obviously unnatural. Our imaginations take care of the rest. Quite a bit is left up to the viewer's imagination, but Shyamalan gives us the tools to start out. When crickets suddenly stop chirping, he gives us room to consider why.The story is all the more real for keeping its scope limited to the experiences of a few. They live ordinary lives, are surrounded by ordinary things. That these events are transpiring is all the more unnerving because whatever normal is, this isn't. Signs gets under your skin, inside your mind, takes your most primal fears and plays hide-and-seek with them. Don't look in the pantry.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Theist Propaganda,"That's all it is.  Theist propaganda.  I felt cheated that the sci-fi story about aliens and crop circles was just a gimmick in order to tell a tale about a man's revival in his belief in god.  As soon as I found out that Gibson was an ex-reverend who became an atheist after his wife's tragic demise, I immediately knew that the rest of the film would somehow relate to his struggle to regain his relationship with his god through another tragic event, this one being an alien attack.  This was not a movie about aliens. It was not a movie about UFOs or armageddon.  It was a cheap way to ask the question, ""do you believe in god or not?"" and then answers itself at the end with, ""you'd better."" I was disgusted.Other than that chief complaint, I did not find the movie to be terrible. It was suspenseful and often a bit scary, although it did not bring forth many new ideas. I thought the buildup was good because it left everything up to the imagination, that is until the aliens were seen.  I thought the aliens were cheesy looking and not frightening. In Independence Day, the aliens terrified me. In this movie, I thought of a Halloween costume I once wore.5/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Poor ending betrays basically good movie,"Lets do this in reverse order. The ending is laughable. It betrays the whole movie. And the script - The plot holes are amazing. Do people really jump to such implausible conclusions so easily. The boy gets a book (out of the millions of different books available about UFOs - all with different ideas about aliens - and this book is totally 100% accurate about the aliens plans). Mel Gibson seems to have lost a little of his edge with this film (which is a shame, as the majority of the budget must have gone on his salary rather than the script) I may be persuaded to watch it again, if it comes on to cable in a couple of years time, otherwise this is one to miss",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do you read signs?,"The ability to read signs, if I understand the storyline, is inversely proportional to the potential to do something about it. First the dogs, then the kids and finally the adults woke up to the approaching menace. But isn't the ability to read signs what a successful life is all about? That is, reading signs rather than only seeing coincidences.Perhaps I should have read the signs: 1.	An over-promoted movie, 2.	An incredible difficulty in writing a commentary, and 3.	A movie associated with corn.Okay, the 3rd one was a stretch but the first two are real.We've all learned to be skeptical with M. Night Shyamalan 's films after the sleight-of-hand he pulled in ""Sixth Sense."" Midway through this film he reminds us of distractions and to keep our guard up. What comes is more a message to keep the faith, know that everything happens for a reason and ""calm down and eat some fruit.""Periodic infusions of humor break the tension without seeming too forced. The soundtrack builds suspense right from the start as the dogs sense the unknown terror and two cute kids' insight advance the plot (thank god!) But why do I feel like I'm watching an old ""Twilight Zone"" plot?This film is one of the several big father-son relationship films? Here we have a family recovering from the loss of mom with a father dealing with his son in need of support. Gibson's character is in the middle. He's reconciling with God, the Father as well as his wounded son. He's dealing with forces beyond his comprehension - and, obviously, so am I. Add to this ""The Road to Perdition"" and the ""Minority Report,"" all in one summer! What's the message behind this recurring theme? Has it anything to do with Dubyah and George the Elder?  Passing the torch? Burying the hatchet? Forgiving?I think M. Night Shyamalan is riding on his past success. Watch for the signs.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best M. Night Film So Far!,"After the death of his wife in a freak accident, Reverend Graham Hess questions his faith and even leaves the church. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events happen all over the world. Graham's children think it's aliens, his brother thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. However, as more and more strange events occur, he realizes something big is coming, and it's probably not going to be friendly.I would simply love to say this is one of the best science fiction film and one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece. It's brilliant. I loved every minute of it. From one of the best title sequences ever made to the ending. First of all, this is not a CGI blockbuster. I mean, literally, there are a few action scenes in this film, abnormal for an alien invasion film. I love the idea! it's original and the story is more about the family and what they are going through.The film's score is great! This is probably James Newton Howard's best work he has ever done! The music provides something mysterious and obviously give homages to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Psycho. I also love the simplicity of the film. There's nothing too complex right here. Everything is just there in front of the screen while you go in ""awe"".I also liked the camera-work done. Another great thing from this is the use of suspense and tension. The first time I've ever seen this (I've seen this movie many times already), it made me crap my pants and I'm not usually scared in movies. In this movie, less is certainly more. Each information is given off little by little until the big finale.I liked the subtle humor in this film. It's certainly not laugh-out-loud funny but it's great to laugh when you're filled with suspense. Mel Gibson's performance is fantastic as well as Joaquin Phoenix. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin were good too.This film is certainly underrated. Most people didn't like it for the twist ending or the overall conclusion of the movie. It's not that bad, really. It's ridiculous that they don't like the movie for that reason. I even liked this better than The Sixth Sense! This is why people make movies! This film is not just another alien invasion movie. It has many underlying themes to those who want to look deeper into the film.It has a fantastic script, brilliant score, terrific performances, great camera-work, extremely underrated, and is one of the best films ever made! I loved it that much! Do not go into this movie thinking of a CGI-filled film (although it has a $70 million budget) because it's trying to be much more than that.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well my wife knows I have a very wild imagination and guess its not what the filmmakers were counting on. A guy in a green suit pops up and a character freaks out.

Well?,"I'm not sure about this film at all, yes it was well directed, and Gibson and co were fine, but I was disappointed with this film when I left the cinema about an hour ago. To say why I was disappointed would need me to reveal to much of the storyline, and since this film has only been in the country for 3 days I can't do that. What I will say is the trailers on TV for this are in my opinion VERY misleading. I notice in some magazines the director of this film is being compared to Steven Spielberg, well I noticed something he done in this film that was very similar to Spielberg, there is a section in the film when Mel's character is flicking through a book about Aliens, and the audience has the chance to see the pictures in the book, this reminded me of the part in Jaws when Roy Scheider is flicking through a book about sharks, which was a clever way of showing what could be about to happen. This film is a long way short of films of the class of Jaws or Close encounters though... a long way off.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very odd story,"Just saw this on DVD, and wonder about the high rating it's received on IMDB.  Great acting helped very much with this slow moving piece.  But the scares are non-existent, so there really was not much build up in suspense; OK, maybe a bit with the basement scene, but with the slow pacing of the movie, it seemed to take forever to get there.  The story has some very odd twists that in the end just don't work.The most interesting parts of the movie were the religious conclusions.  I didn't expect a religious theme in this movie, and am always pleased when Hollywood chooses to deal straightforwardly with such difficult topics. Introducing aliens and combining a large series of weird character traits and actions are very odd--and certainly not straightforward--ways to surmise that ""God exists.""  I'm still not 100% certain what to think, and perhaps that's a good thing to say about a movie like Signs.  Even so, the movie mainly leaves you with that uncomfortable feeling that it could have been a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When bad things happen to good people,"For the sake of the film, I think all in all it is not a traditional science fiction movie like ""2001"", an action Sci Fi like ""Aliens"", or a Hollywood Sci Fi Like ""Independence day"".Hard Core Science Fiction fans have certain expectations and demands regarding their preferred genre. It would be a mistake to view this movie as science fiction when in fact it is a supernatural drama, similar to Shylaman's other work.Traditionalists will find technical difficulties in signs, action fans may not find the movie nearly menacing enough, and Hollywood movie fans may just not ""get it"".This film is a commentary on bad things happening to good people and how that affects personal beliefs and ideals.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jaded after too many DVD extras?,"I have been digging all those DVD extras for a while now, and have fun learning about Mr. Shyalaman as a moviemaker. But it is nearly impossible now to relive that 'Sixth Sense moment'. Am I Jaded ? Have I become so immersed in the mechanics of movie-making that I can no longer let myself go and be swept away by a seductive movie such as Signs? I pick out the lapses in logic, or the unnecessary soap opera-ish subplots, and I become aware that I am watching a high profile gimmick and hype movie that is trying to hypnotize me. Instead, I found myself groaning about three different times. The minor league hero who couldn't make it in the big time. The father who tries to raise his kids without his mother, 'I want to stay here because this is where Mom used to live'. Then there is Mr. Shyamalan playing the guilt ridden neighbor. Once I saw him, I recognized him from being on TV, or on the DVD extras. I believe many people recognize him by now. So when he was on screen, I am watching the director acting, instead of thinking of him as the character. But then there is the whole 'What does it all mean?' suspense. The more the film paraded all it's quirky characters and their obligatory hang-ups to pass the time, the higher the anticipation for the payoff for all this waiting and near misses. So ultimately I was disappointed due to the high expectations for a big payoff (you know - Close Encounters kind of stuff), that the scant hand or leg here or there just didn't satisfy. Alas, the whole subject matter of who 'they' are and what happens is side-stepped. (You may have heard that some trailers have given it away, which is it true, but not too badly)So I believe the story could have gone through another rewrite. I would've enjoyed less soap opera and more chasing the bogeyman. And a big warning for those who are hooked by the teaser commercials, don't expect to find satisfaction for your curiosity.The few goods things to say are: - Good job to Shyalaman for telling a story in his unique vision, avoiding some clichés. - A ferocious soundtrack that provides most of the special effects. - Decent spooky stuff to give you a chill once in a while.This was no better or worse than Unbreakable. I give it a 6 out of 10.Update: Upon second viewing, I was able to appreciate the terrific acting and cinematography to excuse the over-the-top quirky lines here and there (such as the now infamous ""The Happening""). It is really only the third act that fails to thrill, but it is a good ride up to that point.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classically Understated,"Based on a series of events involving an impending alien invasion, Signs is much more than a typical sci fi thriller. Mel Gibson plays Morgan Hess, a former reverend, struggling to raise two small children after the sudden and tragic death of his wife. Jauquin Phoenix is his younger brother Merrill, desperately trying to help his the get over their loss and keep the family from unraveling. It's a tense time made all the more chaotic when a crop circle mysteriously appears in the cornfield. Soon, it becomes clear the earth is being visited when crop circles begin appearing all over the world.The movie never evolves into a grand us vs them invasion movie. Instead, Shamylan sets the movie in a small Midwest town. Events unravel before the audience and the characters in the film, through tv clips, allowing everyone's fears to fester slowly. It's a movie more about faith, anxiety, and the threat of the unknown than it is about aliens. Shamylan effectively incorporates humor into the story without sacrificing the overall tone of dread. What the viewers are rewarded with is a quiet, emotional film with jarringly unsettling moments. It's well acted, well written, and never tries too hard to wow the audience. It's the type of film that Hollywood rarely makes these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A film about the signs of faith that can heal a family's wounds,"With more than 2000 IMDb viewers' responses, Signs certainly seems to have stirred up film watchers' imaginations. My comment here will be brief because I don't want to add to the general mayhem the movie seems to have generated; but having read even a few opinions, I am convinced some things need to be cleared up.First, Shaymalan, like Spielberg (and many other Hollywood directors who don't admit it,) is by his own description a B movie director; he makes no pretensions towards creating art, except for the masses. Viewers should not necessarily expect subtlety or technical brilliance in films intended to provide large audiences with a campy version of horror. Viewers can enjoy Shaymalan's films for their eccentric views of horror or special effects, films strong on mood and atmosphere but not necessarily on plot or character.Signs, however, surpasses these limitations, and is clearly the director's best effort so far -- despite himself, he has made a good film. No need to mention the masterful building of suspense that he achieves here -- even the film's critics acknowledge it. And the moment much-talked-about -- the ""Brazilian video"" birthday party -- will scare you indeed. Small children may indeed be terrified. I am not a small child, and I was.To view this film with some objectivity, ask yourself not what you as a viewer look for in a film, but what the director intended to achieve in it. A so-called lack of plausibility, for instance (understood as a lack of 'believable plot') actually has the purpose of deflecting us from the real horror of the characters' lives: their inability to come to terms with the death of their mother and spouse. Whether or not an alien race would evolve enough technology to travel through space but not enough to break out of a locked room is irrelevant to the sense of terror that our awareness that there is an alien in that locked room actually causes. Clearly the film is not 'about' an alien invasion or some other preposterous nonsense, but about this family, torn apart by guilt and grief over the death of the mother, and how one singular experience -- I will not reveal it in case there may be someone out there who has yet to see the film, but it involves being locked in a cellar -- changes their lives by bringing them face to face with the unaccountable and mysterious gift that life is -- and that sharing this gift amongst the living demands the defence of the living, and requires sacrifice to protect them -- far worthier than wasting one's life in the doubt and despair that the death of a loved one can cause.Shyalaman thus raises the question of faith and the value, indeed the need, of hope. Family is worth protecting; those we love are worth our sacrifice in defending them. That is the purpose of using the 'macguffin' device of the crop destruction (as this is a basic plot line I do not believe mentioning it counts as a spoiler) for this is what sets in motion the long string of events that ends up bringing the family to its epiphany, or moment of revelation.I find it odd, really, that so many viewers seem to think that only 'pure' horror (which I suspect means gory or bloody) or 'pure' science fiction (which I suspect means science fantasy, as one might find it in Lynch's Dune or one of the Star Wars films) can guarantee a stylish, satisfying entertainment. Cearly films like these can offer an exciting escape from boredom. Signs, on the other hand, eschews the sensationalism of science fiction to focus on what actions are necessary in life to maintain faith and love in a world increasingly disoriented, violent, and destructive.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a film that has re-invented suspence. A Triumph!,"As an independent film maker M. Night Shyamalan has raised the bar for excellence with Signs. He did it with a script that can only be described as a flawless piece of written art, his direction can only be put into words with 'genius', and the performances from the actors is nothing short than frightfully close to real. The profound use of symbolisms is a God-sent to those of us who ACTUALLY enjoy thinking, for those of us who go to the theatre to view a film, not just see a movie. In fact I say that the only way anyone can even begin to call this film anything short of amazing is by using the excuse that it's symbolisms and excellence flew directly over their heads. This film was never a sci-fi knock off of Alien or any other sci-fi movie, it is completely unique, and by all rights should be given it's own genre - my girl friend said it best by pointing out that Shyamalan put every single emotion into this film. It can grip you in a hundred ways and take you from emotion to emotion in a matter of a scene change.There is no comparing Shyamalan to Hitchcock or anyone else for that matter. While I'm sure Night looks at Hitchcock as master of suspense in no way is this a rip off of one of his films like other users had said. M. Night Shyamalan is the Renaissance Man of the film world, he flies well beyond ordinary standards of 'good'. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and now with Signs he has made three marks in history and will most likely never be over passed.And furthermore none of us have any right to judge his thoughts or visions, for they are his and when all of you users out there who write things like ""for shame"" and use words that are demeaning, I don't think any of you have a right to unless you have even come close to doing what he has.-My congradulations to M. Night Shyamalan for doing what most could not. -Colin",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Spellbinding.,"In this movie I went in simply looking for M. Night Shamylan to prove himself to me a third time.  The Sixth Sense was absolutely amazing, and Unbreakable, although not nearly as good, wasn't as bad as critics made it out to me.  Yet with Signs, Shamylan has really written a screenplay that proves he can do great things.  His direction is extraordinary.  Once again he has made children, not ordinarily great actors, shine...and he has mixed comic relief in with masterful suspense.  The film is thorougly entertaining, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Well-written parts include a film laced with the question of faith, of the existence of God...and the movie is layered with an element of hope even in its darkest moments, something I believe to be symbolic of God. Extra terrestrials are seen only a few times in the film, but when they come they make you jump and they come at exactly the right times.  Also, hand it to the people behind the scenes who worked on the sound.  This film's sound is among the best of the year, and the music score, which is composed of mainly three notes played in a haunting and beautiful way is great and makes the film terrifying in a way that movies like Scream and Halloween couldn't do with their violent predictible moments blotched all over.  While I am glorifying this film and making it out to sound perfect, there are still plot incositincies and moments that aren't quite as great as others.  Still, this movie, while not as good as Sixth Sense, has proven Shamylan can tell a story as well as anyone in Hollywood. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What was the point?,"I think I missed something.  I credit myself as having brains.  What was the point of the movie?  If it was to show us what brilliant little actors the kids were, yes I understand that.   Mel gets totally overshone in this movie, he doesn't shine at all (never does these days, give me him in Gallipoli).  And yes there was a scary build up, the green men being seen bit by bit, but PLEASE!!! beating one to death at the end of the movie? C'mon, there had to be more but I must be missing something.  If its to do with faith then it was a lame result.  I just expected so much more, something with oomph to take your breath away, but to have Mel say ""Swing away"" and then the alien be beaten by a baseball bat and glasses of water, very poor ending.  Its like he had a great story, the build up, end of the world stuff and then he lost it.  All the flashbacks to his wife.  No I'm sorry this was a very overrated and disappointing movie.  The kids (and Joaquin) were the stars, oh yeah and the dogs!  C'mon director, we expect better from you!",,Anonymous,Mystery
A good film,"I have seen this film. On the whole it is a good film, nothing special but a film that I recommend to see. I have read a previous comment and would like to comment on the comment. It goes on about the title being stupid because if aliens could find their way to earth from a distant planet then they would be able to find their way around our home planet. Summed up in a couple of words this is sheer Cr*p. We can see bodies such as Mars and Venus through telescopes. But we needed to send robots, satellites etc. to scale the terrain. They send other beings to find out for the rest of them.Anyway, what effect does the title have on the film? Well you don't seem the brightest chap so I'll tell you.IT DOESN'TCould I please ask people to comment on the film instead of the title. Thank-you",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well made, but was it satisfying?","It's now a couple of days since I watched Signs, and I still can't make up my mind about it. It is an extremely well made film with excellent cinematography and sound. The suspense is maintained throughout the whole film, but the outcome is disappointing. About two thirds of the way through, I found myself no longer expecting to jump out of my seat at the climax of any specific scene because most did not have a climax. Any tension that was built, just dissipated and fizzled out. With the exception of Mel Gibson's character, the acting was very good and believable. Mel's character, ""Father"", didn't seem real. At the very start he seemed overly suspicious, but totally unemotional, about the crop circle, but then didn't seem to react ""normally"" to the unexpected demise of a family pet. Most people would freak out whereas he took it all in his stride, with little or no emotion. This film was played using an old 50's method, where all the horror happens off camera, leaving you to your own imagination. If it wasn't for the inclusion of the relatively recent phenomenon of crop-circles, the film might actually have benefited from being shot in black and white. I'll be pondering this one for a while, or may have to go see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best film ever,"This movie is the perfect Alien movie, theres no spaceship explosions and gun battles, its a down to earth story and most ways a realistic version of a alien invasion.The feeling you get from this movie is the same feeling you get when reading a none-fiction alien book.
In my eyes not only is it M.Nights best movie but also the best movie ever made.Alot of people tear it apart due to the water story line, i say it just adds to the mystery.If M.Night ever made a Signs 2, i hope its the same premise and down to earth story.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This was a great, inspirational film!","I went to this movie full of anticipation based on the fact that I enjoy most Mel Gibson films. Unfortunately, it ended up not being what it was advertised as being about. The crop circles, which I thought that the movie was about, were definitely not one of the central ideas to the movie. It dealt more with losing faith, and then trying to regain it. The character development was one of the stronger points of the movie, and the audience seemed to connect with the family in the movie. While the ending was unfulfilling, I felt that the movie in all was definitely worth ones time and money to check it out. In the end I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10.

Signs...I recommend it!,"First off, I heard two stories...some said they loved it, others absolutely hated it...so I was confused but figured since I liked ""The Sixth Sense"", M. Night Shyamalan would please me yet again with cinematic excellence...and let me just say this...HE DID IT AGAIN! I really loved this film; because as the director M. Night said in an interview...and i'm para-phrasing...it is truely one of the most original films this summer has to offer...I mean it had some big names to contend with, MIB 2, Austin Powers, however they cannot compete...they can't...some of you may think they were great, but they were not completely new ideas...they were building off of the first, or the sequel...this however...""Signs"", was something that looked ok, seemed different, but turned out to be great.I love the way the story evolves, and how it has a meaning to it, you really gain an understanding for the characters in it and it's not just a horror film. It has the feel of a kind of anxieity, you want to see what's going to happen next, it keeps leading you...and when you finally understand what it's all about it has a depth that most horror/sci-fi films don't.So, It's good to finally get out of the muck of stupid, mindless, films that leave you feeling nothing...and hit the jackpot with a movie that has heart, humor, and horror! The cast was great, the setting, everything, just great...and it is the kind of movie that I go home thinking about. I'm going to see it again tonight, which I hardly ever do...but I think I might like it even more than the first time. :)So...if you haven't allready seen this movie, go out tonight...and see it...you'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Inspired Filmmaking,"As with his previous films, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Signs is the ultimate one-man show, written, produced and directed by its creator, M. Night Shyamalan. It's a great, creep-fest of a film and easily the best film of 2002 (that I've seen) to date. Shyamalan proves himself again with an incredibly taut script and innovative direction. Focusing on a very small group of people, the family unit, while still retaining some diversity of characters is inspired. The slow and deliberate pacing makes you feel like we're never out of touch with the characters, except for a few minutes here or there, during the few days we spend with them. He allows bits and piece of characterization to reveal themselves as the plot plays out and to relieve the tension, which is ratcheted higher, in this movie, then most thrillers ever dream of reaching, he uses copious amounts of well-timed humor. Probably more than anything I came away from the film thinking how funny it was. I'll also give him extra kudos for having the presence of mind to cast himself as an (ultimately?) unlikeable character in a movie filled with real, likeable and honest people. Choices like that are real gutsy ones and, when you pair them with the zeal that he shows for innovative filmmaking, you can see why his continued success seems boundless. I think it's safe to say that Hollywood needs a few more filmmakers like him.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Their is no review I can write that can justify how how well done this movie was. I am an avid movie watcher and am very critical of the movies I watch.

Great but could have been more twist effected,"Signs sees Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a former preacher turned farmer who wakes up one day to find that someone, or something, has carved an intricate pattern of circles and signs into his crops. Turning on the news he discovers that similar symbols are appearing across the globe, prompting fears that the end of the world could be just around the corner. Where one would go bad enough, Graham is trying to raise his two young children while coping with a crippling crisis of faith brought about by his wife's death in a car accident. Paranoia and grief make a dangerous combination, and as further unexplained happenings occur, Hess must take extreme measures to protect his family.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining But Flawed,"Signs is watchable and entertaining, but has quite a few plot holes to the point of being cheesy. If the intent of the movie was to simply be a fun ""popcorn movie"" diversion, it succeeds on that level. It appears, though, the intent was to approach philosophical insights, or to convince the audience of the authenticity of crop circles as alien-authored. On such issues, it self-destructs.The main problem with the film seems to be this schizophrenic confusion about which direction it wants to go, thus dooming it to fail on the serious side of the ledger. There's plenty of involving action with ""things that go bump in the night,"" but the story forgets to pursue the deep issues it brought up. The story careens madly back and forth between serious overtones and sublimely ridiculous nonsense.For example, there is a scene of an auto accident victim talking to someone: A dying person who has been chopped in half does not wax prophetic--they scream in pain, or lose consciousness. Due to the odd premise of a mutilated person standing there to give a message, this scene, which apparently seeks extreme pathos, simply ends up looking like cheap, contrived exploitation. The scene with the baby-monitor intercepting transmissions from beyond Earth? Must be a joke, right? But if this was supposed to be a joke, it was played too straight to be recognizable as one. In places, therefore, the movie takes itself way too seriously.More inanities: The stupidity of the aliens, who have mastered interplanetary travel, but are ignorant to a toxic aspect of our environment? Plot holes this preposterous should not be escaping the eyes of directors of big budget flicks. Also, why are they leaving messages in cornfields for everyone to see, if they're plotting a raid on the planet? Why don't they just radio each other as they coordinate their attack? Oops, forgot: We have baby-monitors to spy on them with; consequently, they are limited to hacking up cornfields in order to communicate. The baseball bat silliness was almost too foolish to endure.Still, the movie has its moments. I particularly love the scene with the aluminum foil hats. The plot, albeit silly, moves along. Plenty of stuff happens up there on the screen, and you can suspend disbelief enough to have a good time. The acting is actually quite good, especially Mel Gibson, who breaks from his ""Mad Max"" persona. Here he plays a despondent man struggling through an emotional crisis, and he plays this vulnerable character with sincerity.For some mindless fun, this film provides with gusto. Just don't expect this movie to be a convincing argument about the supernatural. It has far too many obvious goofs in its execution to accomplish that.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Night misunderstood,"I get aggravated at people who automatically bash Night's movies. Granted, Signs wasn't his BEST work but it was good. One thing I love about Night that you can ALWAYS count on with him is that he puts so much thought into his films. Your never gonna sit down to a Night movie and predict everything that will happen after the first 10 minutes. He will always keep you guessing and you will NEVER guess right. I give complete props to a writer/director who is not afraid to do something different.I didn't catch on to him until after I saw the Sixth Sense, then I went back and watched Unbreakable. I loved them both. Later when The Village came out I was surprised by how much bashing it took. I loved it. I love it because it was original and it made you think. Signs does the same thing. It's not just a alien movie. It has a huge story other then the aliens. You are brought into the lives of the father and his family and you understand them and why they feel they way they do. As always Nights movies stay with you long after you first see them!!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Message,Yes this movie has got a more or less clear message in religious terms therefore it will be viewed from different angles depending on if you are a believer or an unbeliever. The former will find it a great movie while the latter will think it's a complete nonsense. For agnostics like myself the message will be disregarded and we'll prefer to concentrate our attention on the filmic discourse. Well it's a sci-fi thriller as you probably already know and a just passable one I mean it has no special flaws to be denounced but no special inventive or original features either. The story unfolds itself in somewhat predictable developments and the acting is neither bad nor particularly good maybe with the exception of the 2 kids who deserve a special mark though the boy seems to be a little too gifted for his age but we are used to that already in children roles. Well summing it up if the night is too cold and if you are an unbeliever or an agnostic stay comfortably at home and don't lose your time going out to see this movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wow, what a Sign!","This was a great film.  I saw it on Aug. 6, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was entertaining, it was scary, it was funny, and excellent the whole way through.  It was a good story with some good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.  I must say (concidering I love Joaquin Phoenix), that I liked Merill's character the best.  He was extremely funny and plays a very real and well defined character, and you just love him in this movie. A good example of him being funny is watching the news going ""Move children!"" (If you see the film you'll get it).The comedic lines and the suspense of the film are balanced so well, the movie just flows.  I got scared in this film (at some parts the whole audience jumped), I laughed, and I cried.  The whole emotional thing going on in the family really added a lot to the story.  It showed how it really would be, and how the fear was getting to them.  The kid actors were awesome.  I loved both Morgan and Bo, and their closeness to both their father and their uncle really added to the reality of the movie.  I agree that the few that didn't like the movie missed the whole point.  It was a family movie.  It was about a family.  (I bawled during the dinner scene). Being a Christian, I also enjoyed the spiritual part of the movie, showing that everything happens for a reason.  It show's God's hand in everything.This is the scariest movie I ever saw in theatres.  I saw it yesterday and was scared last night and this morning.  I recommend you see it.

I'm oh so very confused...,"I, like many other people, waited anxiously for this film's release. However, after watching a screening of it I was left somewhat confused.The sci-fi element of the film left much to be desired as it was practically non-existant until the last 10 minutes. In fact, it seems to be thrown in there for the sake of adding some special fx and getting interest from the public eye.The films director (M Night Shyamalan) got himself off to a great start with The 6th sense, then met with mixed reviews over Unbreakable; a film which took a great deal of time to get to it's point but payed off in the end with one of Shyamalan's surprise thought provoking endings. I was half expecting the same thing from this film about half way through(a long subtle trail to a great finish) but this was not the case.Instead, the film drags on and on in a slow build up fashion which leads to a great deal of nothing. If that thought provoking ending is in there, I must have missed it. I suppose it was left forgotten, boarded up the house with the many glasses of water, a baseball bat, and a a holy man whose lost his faith.Signs does give a good performance from Gibson and fair performances from the rest of the cast, including Shyamalan himself (who actually played an important plot character). But alas, unlike Gibson's character, I did not regain my faith in the end, however it is diminishing in Shyamalan with each passing film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suspenseful slow burn thriller.,"I've held off watching this movie for a very long time every since I was really young and not at all into horror/scary movies. Today finally came the day and well, what was young me scared for?!That aside, in general I liked the film, It really takes its time though, the directing, the acting, the dialog, its all slow and methodical. It really is a slow burn. But doesn't peak as much as I had hoped.The sound design is great, loved it and would've been a treat to see in theaters. Performances are fantastic all over the board, Joaquin doing some incredible things.The story in itself and the invasion are what lack for me, the invasion is very much downplayed and somehow boring in a way, oversimplified. The story really contains itself in that house and doesn't really tread any further which makes the outside world feel a little distant. The story I find a bit hard to believe (pun intended) and I don't really see why the main character came to the conclusion he did.One of the biggest negatives of this movie though is the fact it has 2002 CGI, they tried to hide it, aka making it all blurry. But 99% of the shots in this movie could've have been done with practical effects and makeup which would make it sooooo much more effective. Right now its too noticeable and definitely took me out of the moment.In the end, I expected a bit more out of the movie. So for me its ends up being a 6/10.

(THE SIXTH SENSE + UNBREAKABLE)/2 = SIGNS,"SIGNS is yet another strong movie from M. Night Shyamalan that follows the formulas he has presented in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. This time a Pennsylvania farmhouse provides the setting and a widowed reverend (Mel Gibson), his two kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin), and his less conservative brother (Joaquin Phoenix) are the main characters. The ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances after some crop circles appear in their fields. Strange occurrences follow and numerous contradictory speculations within the family are inevitable. Soon the situation turns far more serious with an appearance of several UFOs around the world, including near the family's house. Are these really aliens and are they friendly or hostile?Like the other two Shyamalan films, SIGNS becomes a character study. We learn of the preacher's struggle with his faith and Phoenix's character becomes a tough guy gone scared. Both men reveal important elements from their past as the movie progresses and they become fully developed characters rather than horror film victims running around screaming. The two kids embrace the arrival of the aliens in a hopeful and innocently childlike way. The acting by all is very good and the kids are an improvement over the boy from UNBREAKABLE. The story unfolds patiently and builds up in suspense. Shyamalan again shows great control over pacing. He combines Spielberg's early sci-fi storytelling techniques with Hitchcock-like direction, understanding that less is more. SIGNS utilizes the sound of the wind, the movement in the fields, the distant dog barks, the creepy shadows, the eerie music, and the characters' scared reactions all at once effortlessly. The cinematography, lighting, and use of color are all superb again like in the previous two Shyamalan films. As I was watching the movie I realized how much I was enjoying everything that was up on the screen. I could see the effort and the careful attention to detail. This is no INDEPENDENCE DAY or GODZILLA as there is no numbing explosions and corny dialogue. With SIGNS you get a true build up of suspense and uncertainty before Shyamalan wraps it all up in his typically exciting fashion.I do have one problem with the film. It is a major problem and a minor one at the same time. The entire film is constructed in such a familiar fashion that some of the surprises and developments feel a little predictable. The following can all be found in THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, and SIGNS: the immature (ghosts, super heroes, and now aliens) story directed in a very mature manner, similar uses of color and shadow, similar pacing and character development, similar relationships between adults and kids (the kids usually guide the less open minded adults toward the correct state of mind), the sub-par appearance of the director, the really toned down acting (no real objection here, but one scream once in a may actually be a little more realistic), the Pennsylvania settings, and the big revelations in the climax (small one in SIGNS). I know that some of those are trivial. More can probably be found, but that is not important. What I am trying to say is that I am disappointed that Shyamalan has not grown much as a director since THE SIXTH SENSE. All the things I have listed above are positives (except for Shyamalan's cameos), but I'm not being surprised by anything new. The stories are all different, but the framework is just the same. I still did not see some of the ideas or twists coming during SIGNS, but I was expecting them to show up. I wasn't too shocked to see them appear like clockwork. Everything felt so calculated. I liked UNBREAKABLE the most and now I find SIGNS to be the weakest of the three. If SIGNS came out before the other two movies and UNBREAKABLE were released third, possibly I would have found UNBREAKABLE to be the weakest. And maybe SIGNS would have taken the country by storm the way THE SIXTH SENSE did if it were released earlier. I don't know. As long as Shyamalan will follow these structures, he will not grow as a director. On the other hand, if he continues to follow these formulas in all of his films then probably every single one of them will be good. I'm already waiting with curiosity for his next one. For now, SIGNS gets an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ruined by an unfeasibly poor Mel Gibson ""performance""","Right, lets get this straight; M Night Shyamalan is a fantastic film maker. He is subtle, clearly has respect for his audience, and tells stories that are always deeply rooted in exploring the potential realism of the work of a fantastical imagination. There is nobody like him currently working in the business. His work deserves to be celebrated.'Signs' is no different. But, it is kept back from greatness by perhaps its greatest (financial) asset; Mel Gibson. While Joaquin Phoenix is truly excellent in the film, Gibson is overwhelmingly poor. And therein lies the problem. Phoenix is an actor and Gibson is a movie star. His performance (as a priest struggling with his faith no less) was abominable. He still walked, talked and acted as if he was supposed to be a hero. Not a man trying to come to terms with his ethical and religious decisions. He merely toned himself down. And left us with far too many pregnant silences which hinted at a pretension that simply wasn't there. The man cannot act. Its that simple.And this was truly a shame, because there was so much to admire about this film. The ending was overly hokey, but as far as flaws go, thats it. The film was expertly crafted, fascinating, and all of the performances shone brightly. Bar you know who.Such a shame!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Creepy, symbolic and well done, but it's message has problems","I sort of like this movie. Taken as a horror or science fiction movie, it might not live up to many of its peers, but if one takes the plot as a symbolic exploration of the struggle with faith, it has some value. This is a spiritual movie.Visually it's well done in an old fashioned style, and at times really scary. Sudden violin bursts and reveals makes for brief tachycardia episodes with good effect. The entire presentation gives a sense of isolation of it's characters, and the house where the main plot happens, which plays on the feelings of the protagonist. The suspense is good too, and the viewer is left wondering what will happen. Also, the gradual reveal of the past is well done, and not too overstated.But for me, the ""punchline"" of the movie, as it is revealed, is oversimplified and overstated. Without spoiling, I can say that things come together well - too well. Also, the final message of this movie looses itself in the mistake that the same message has when provided elsewhere by people of faith: it ignores the massive suffering outside of the single event that is valued and taken as a sign.All in all, worth a watch for the suspense and occasional thrill, but be critical of its message - this movie adds nothing in that respect.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan's Best-- A Masterpiece,"Signs is one of the most touching, thought-provoking films I have seen in years. It is Mel Gibson's best movie since Lethal Weapon, and an amazing piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. What Shyamalan does with his films is so much more intelligent and awe-inspiring than the dreadfully meaningless films we see today, that filmmakers like Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis should be embarrassed to say they work in the same business as him.To call Signs a thriller is wrong. Watch it with your kids, your entire family. It is on of those movies where you don't just watch it, you experience it. And after it is finished, you will want to see it again. Signs is about a former pastor who now lives on his farm with his children and brother, whom is helping him out after a family tragedy. One morning, they wake up to find an enormous crop circle in their corn field. Once these begin popping up across the globe, strange things begin happening. Signs is the story of one family who face their fears, their past, and the terrifying present as the world is being invaded No you might have read that thinking ""Oh boy another alien flick"". This is NOT an alien flick. I wont even say if aliens appear in the movie--because it doesn't matter. What this film plays on is not special effects, loud explosions or extreme-action sequences; it is something entirely different. Quiet. Never has there been a film where silence is more scary. M. Night Shyamalan is one masterful director. He can get an audience to cry so brilliantly--I have never seen so many people cry in one theater Please, do yourself a favor, and see this movie.

The problem is two things...first, the girl has a magical premonition and there is this whole ""prophesy"" thing going on which is NEVER done well in any movie let alone this one and second, the movie's central message is to have a certain amount of faith and believe in hope and humanity...but then they just have this goofy resolution to the alien invasion that fails to live up to the message.HOWEVER, the idea of showing a worldwide horror from the perspective of an individual family was absolutely BRILLIANT and truly terrifying in many ways.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Signs screener review,"I found this movie to be entertaining, suspenseful, and well worth seeing. Its kind of an homage to Close Encounters and Night of the Living Dead. However, it really doesn't stack up to Sixth Sense, or even Unbreakable for that matter.  You might think it unfair to compare his films this way, citing the fact that they are all about very different subjects, but I think they're going to be compared this way until Shyamalan matures as a screenwriter, and does something new.  All three of his films have used a very similar formula so far, the most important element being the shocking revelation at the end.  I think he really needs to stop relying so heavily on this element, because his revelations are becoming much less shocking with each successive film.  There's just no way he's going to top 'Sense', and I really think he should just stop trying, and move on.Just something else I noticed, it seems to that Shyamalan really wants to act, his cameos just keep getting bigger in each of his films.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Has garnered very unnecessary hate.,"As an alien invasion film, it fails. I just couldn't really get on board with the fact that they went into their basement, fell asleep, woke up the next day and it was all over among other things. However, as a character story of a man regaining his faith, it succeeds quite well. I'm not a religious person by any means, but I admired it nonetheless. In some aspects I did really enjoy seeing an epic alien invasion as portrayed through the eyes of a simple family with no huge explosions or battles or anything like that. It made it much more suspenseful and terrifying knowing that if the aliens actually did get to them they wouldn't have a shot of fighting their way out. As Joaquin Phoenix's Merrill says ""It's war of the worlds."" but instead of epic shots of explosions and alien technology, we see the fear and hopelessness of a single family.I love how slow-burning it was as well. It takes a while to get into the actual invasion, and all of the chaos on the news channels that we see just makes it a very exciting and suspenseful journey. I thought Shyamalan handled that very well. For instance, when Merrill sees the Brazilian video with the brief shot of one of the aliens, it shocked and intrigued myself just as it did him. However in bringing up the aliens, I have to say that they looked pretty ridiculous and just far too fake. It looked like something out of a playstation one game. I also wasn't too impressed by Shyamalan's attempts at humor in the film, aside from Joaquin Phoenix. It felt too cheesy and out of place. Some of the dialogue didn't go over so well with me, but most of it was good enough. Performance-wise, Phoenix is superb and Gibson falls pretty short for the most part. The kids are fine but nothing to write home about, and Shyamalan's brief appearance is laughable just like it is in all of his films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you don't like this movie, you are wrong :)","Some of my friends really hate this movie. Some of my friends are dumb. Me, I like this movie, not matter what people say. This is a kind of scary thriller drama made by the same guy that made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I don't know how to spell his name so I will just call him the guy I will try to not give away anything from the movie so let me just say this; Mel Gibson plays a farmer and he lives on that farm with his family. One day there is some strange formations in his crop field, and this is where the story begins. Mr M. Night `something or another' has made a powerful and entertaining movie in `Signs'. The characters are well played and likable. Maybe there is too much drama for some people, but I really think that builds and holds the movie the entire time. So in my opinion, if you like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Amazing movie!...till the last 30 minutes.,"Don't you just hate it when an ending totally ruins a good movie? ""Signs"" unfortunately is a movie like that.The movie starts of extremely well, with original opening credits and some nice character building. The characters are extremely well portrayed by the entire cast and very realistic and likable. M. Night Shyamalan perfectly knows how to build up a nice atmosphere and tension in a very original way like he did before in his previous well known movies ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". The movie stays original till the last 30 minutes, after that the movie turns into some standard Sci-Fi movie with all the clichés you can expect. A shame because ""Signs"" could have very well been the best movie of 2002 and the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" of the 21st century.But needless to say the movie is not a complete disaster, how could a movie with some many talent (cast as well as crew) involved be. It still has some genius moments that show the amazing talent of M. Night Shyamalan.The use of sound and light makes the movie very tense and yes also really scary at times! Next to ""Das Boot"" easily the best movie with the use of sound. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is over the top at times but a good job nevertheless! And James Newton Howard finally delivers a good score for a M. Night Shyamalan movie (never felt much for ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" score).All in all still a movie very well worth watching, with some scene's that you will never forget. It just a shame about the last 30 minutes...Let's hope we will get to see many more M. Night Shyamalan projects with endings that will do more justice to the rest of the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"sub-Spielberg, but worth a viewing","This movie certainly owes a debt to Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but the director is skilled enough to make it his own.One of the best decisions Shyamalan made was to show as little as possible of the aliens. And he is very good at setting up his scares. A good example is the scene where Phoenix is watching the first videotaped footage of an alien sighting - very creepy.Tak Fujimoto (Twin Peaks, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense) is becoming one of my favourite cinematographers. His camera work is extremely effective at creating moods, usually without drawing attention to itself.The cast is uniformly good (except for cop Cherry Jones, whose backwoods act is not believable). Mel Gibson is limited as an actor, but this is his best work to date.However, there are some things Shyamalan is not so clever at setting up. He was on the right track in wanting the sci-fi elements to be grafted onto a solid dramatic story, but his script veers from intelligent to heavy-handed.The biggest eye-rollers are the daughter's conspicuous glasses-of-water neurosis, and the phrase ""swing away"", which is ridiculously built up to be an earth-shattering revelation. I don't think Mel needed to remember his wife's last words to come up with the brilliant idea that helps save his son's life.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
i don't know the English word for it.,"This film should have been called 'plot holes' in stead of 'signs'.I am not very easily offended, but this time Mr. Gibson succeeds at that with no problem at all. He clearly thinks the viewers are dumb as 'you name something'. I really do not feel taken seriously as a viewer. This movie is a gross insult to every self-respecting moviefan.Spending such an amount of money to get to this kind of result is making me doubt whether i should cry my eyes out or relapse into oblivious laughter.Maybe the first one of the two options is the best, it would save me from ever seeing such an incredible piece of crap ever again.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Creates a palpable, foreboding sense of mystery but feels fragmented and fairly weak.","What 'Signs (2002)' does really well is create a palpably foreboding sense of mystery, especially in its opening moments and in a handful of suspenseful sequences wherein members of the focal family almost come face to face with the extraterrestrial threat, but it often fails to connect the dots in particularly meaningful ways leading to a piece that feels fragmented and ultimately fairly weak on the story side of things. The locked-in perspective is refreshing, with events feeling all the more real since they're experienced as we'd experience them if they were to occur, and at times the screenplay is nuanced enough that the audience is allowed to fill in the blanks, though bizarrely there are often jarringly poor lines and even worse line-readings often representing clunky and wholly unnecessary exposition. The religious themes end up coming across as heavy-handed, however, even though it is interesting to tackle the subject of faith using a science-fiction language, and the final act's revelation is simply an excuse for the many coincidences of the finale. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

6 out of 10,"Sixth Sense brought an original spin to the Ghost genre.  Unbreakable brought an original spin to the Superhero genre.  Clearly M. Night Shyamalan likes to bring original spins to his films, since, with his third major feature, he tries to bring an original spin to the Alien Invasion genre.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest, who has lost his faith in God and himself.  Following the pointless death of his wife, Hess throws in the collar and struggles to raise his children with the help of his brother, failed baseballer Merill (Joaquin Phoenix).  When crop circles inexplicably appear at his farm, Hess blames local pranksters.  But, as local and world-wide news begin to reveal, these signs may come from an otherworldly source whose intentions are decidedly ambiguous.Shyamalan once again demonstrates where both his strengths and weaknesses are.  The acting is uniformly terrific, and Shyamalan coaxes exceptionally naturalistic performances from both Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as Graham's children.  Shyamalan, himself, is effective in a scene that reveals the truth behind Graham's loss of faith.Long scenes and slow, lingering shots crank the tension up to maximum for most of the film.  This tension is utterly deflated, however, by a couple of lengthy flashbacks that interrupt the grand finale.  Shyamalan has a tendency to undo a lot of his good work by over-explaining the clues (or signs, if you prefer) that are laid before us.  It's a shame that he falls back on this again, because, unlike his previous two films, there is no real twist for us to figure out.Stylistically, Signs is very similar to both Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, and many of the characters feel overly familiar.  Indeed Mel Gibson is directly interchangable with Bruce Willis, as a morbid hero who denies the truth behind his identity.  The mood and lighting also make Signs feel derivative of Shyamalan's other efforts.  However, it's a credit to the quality of this style that it still works to such an extent.  The distinctly personal view of a world under invasion makes you feel more for the characters than should be possible given the hokey subject matter, and will linger in your mind longer than most films this summer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Signs"" Movie Review","""Signs"" is a 2002 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The story focuses on a former Episcopal priest named Graham Hess who discovers a series of crop circles in his cornfield. Hess slowly becomes convinced that the phenomena are a result of extraterrestrial life. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.I was eager to return to ""Signs"" after seeing the film a good number of years back. One, because I remember liking the film for being a well made thriller with a great sense of dread. And two, because of how the film has divided people in recent years, mostly due to the film's logic at the ending. Form where I stand, ""Signs"" is a masterfully told thriller, that contain real human emotions that makes the film both terrifying, and heartfelt.First off, I love how the story is told from this family point of view. It makes ""Signs"" feel realistic, and let us see the events taking place as they are seeing it. Also making the film seem real is the buildup. Instead on using it big guns at the beginning and ruin the suspense, it shows us information slowly, and grows the sense of dread in a chilling manner. The film lack of CGI unless needed is highly appreciated. Shyamalan's direction makes the story feel small scale, which works with the events that takes place, and wonderfully maximizes the tension throughout the film. To avoid repetition in my points, ""Signs"" less is more approach makes the film feel fresh, and not overly relied on cheap scares. Instead, the film builds it scares through the details given, and greatly done buildup. Simply put, I'm going to have trouble sleeping tonight, and I have to applaud the movie for being to able to do that.The family themselves I found very engaging. They are going through a major conflict that is easy to relate to, and care for. I was interested to see how bad things would go for them in this rather chaotic situation. Plus they seem like real people, as while for most of the film they are completely terrified, they add a few funny lines to lighten the situation. ""Signs"" is not a comedy, but a nice dose of humor gives the film levity to make it feel more human. The performances are great, with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix especially giving subtle, but emotionally powerful performances, that again, make the characters feel human.And that word is likely, among with the scares, is what I think is the best part of ""Signs"", form the storytelling, to the characters, and from how the film is told from a visual point of view, it all feels human, and heartfelt. It a story about faith, losing it, and regaining it. Truth to be told, I had tears. Not man-tears, just tears of joy and happiness. For a director that has not been on the top of his game of as of late, M. Night Shyamalan had a great love, and even still, for the work he does. Even with his recent films, I feel that at the very least, that he is still trying. In my opinion, I feel he should stick to making films that are on a smaller scale, as he seems more comfortable working with films that are on a small budget. If I have any complain about ""Signs"", it's that even though the films' themes of coincidence and faith are effectively handled overall, I felt at a few points that seem to go a little bit too beyond than where they should have stay.As for the lack of logic with the ending, I have to say that this is a story told from one's family perspective. and ""Signs"" is going for a less is more approach. It not aliens going to Earth, but how one family handles that aliens arriving to Earth. If you want a more in depth look at ""Signs"", watch YouTube movie reviewer, Chris Stuckmann fantastic analysis on the film. What I would have say, he says that in a much more detailed and organized fashion better than what I could hope to do.Link to Chris Stuckmann video on ""Signs"" www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ju05PuiyQ",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign","Mel Gibson stars as a former pastor who has lost his faith in thelatest effort by M. Night Shyamalan. ""Signs"" is a return to form forthe writer/director of ""The Sixth Sense "" who stumbled a bit with hislast outing, ""Unbreakable"". While this is no ""Sixth Sense "" it isgood, compelling storytelling.When mysterious unexplained crop circles appear overnight in hisPennsylvania cornfield, Gibson and the local authorities figure itsthe work of local pranksters. But soon the patterns appear in fieldsall over the world. It becomes obvious something global is aboutto happen.Convinced by his wife's accidental death several months ago thatthere is no God watching over people, Gibson decides he and hisfamily can only depend on themselves, whatever happens. Sojoined by his brother, a failed minor league ballplayer (JoaquinPhoneix) Gibson's son (Rory Culkin) (yes, ANOTHER Culkin) andhis irrestibly cute daughter (Abigal Breslin) the family prepares forwhatever might happen.A lot happens, but I won't ruin it for you. You should go see foryourself.A suspense thriller, ""Signs"" is never gory or gross and bloody.Instead, director Shyamalan masterfully builds up the tension inHitchcockian fashion. There's no nudity, but there's nobody in thisfilm you want to see naked anyway. Shyamalan must learn that inaddition to making films suspenseful, Hitchcock never forgot tothrow in a Grace Kelly or a Kim Novak or Janet Leigh. I must tellhim this next time I see him at the club.Another weakness is Shyamalan's Tarantino-like decision to casthimself in a key role. It's not that he's bad in it, he's not; but hispresence in the picture and the way he is introduced totallydistracts from the film's central story. M. (a Fritz Lang homage?)would be better off limiting his acting to a brief Hitchcock likecameo and hiring real actors to act.Some people have complained a bit about the film's ending notliving up to the rest of the picture, and I can see their point.However, I enjoyed the storytelling enough to give that a pass.Besides I rather like campy 1950's sci-fi films, so I had no problemwith the ending.What I had a problem with is Rory Culkin.  Are these kids beingcloned now or what? There seems to be a never ending supply ofthese Culkin kids. When one grows up and is no longer cute, twomore spring up to take its place. This is perhaps the real invasionwe have to worry about: the attack of the Culkins. Now that bigbrother MacCaulay ""Home Alone"" (with his 22 brothers andsisters--Christian, Kieran, Quinn, Shane, Rory, etc. etc.) Culkin is21, I expect he'll be pumping out more replacement Culkin kidsbefore too long. And then his brothers and sisters will be oldenough to have kids, and then his kids will have kids and beforeyou know it, we'll be running in the streets screaming like that guyin ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".""Help! Wait! Stop. Stop and listen to me!...These Culkins who'recoming after me are not human. Look, you fools. You're in danger.Can't you see? They're after you. They're after all of us. Our wives,our children, everyone. They're here already!""Now that's scary.http://go.to/senor_sock",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Worst Movie of 2002,"This movie was so boring and had so many holes in the plot it was painful to watch. The aliens spent decades scouting and never realize that 75% of the planet is poison to them. If they had realized this, why did they not protect themselves from water? Not even a rain coat? Don't they know it rains on this planet? What if they attack someone who just got out of the shower? Or trip and fall into a swimming pool at night? And yet they run through fields of corn at night, somehow avoiding the dew. Have you ever been in a field at night? Obviously M. Night hasn't. Otherwise the aliens would have ran screaming back to their spaceships, looking for their first aid kits.And after they showed Gibson's wife dying, some guy in the audience said ""I bet his brother hits a home run on an aliens head!"". That was just too obvious, and yet this was supposed to be part of what gave Gibson his faith back.(And yes, we were at the very first screening of the film in our city)I know the aliens were just a plot device to enable Gibson to regain his faith, but M. Night just got lazy on this story. That or he's just out of ideas. I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was pretty good in spite of some plot holes. ""Unbreakable"" was good but too long. Maybe he should try to do a movie without a gimmick ending.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan flails for another twist ending,"Signs revolves around a tragic family living an isolated life on a farm, headed by Mel Gibson's lapsed cleric. Mel plasters on his brooding face, pretty much he does in the Lethal Weapon films whenever something bad has happened, only here it's on for over an hour and a half. In tow are a slightly annoying Joaquin Phoenix as the odd younger brother, plus a brace of very annoying kids in the form of Abigail Breslin and a Culkin (it almost doesn't matter which one) who spends most of the film going out of his way to do exactly the opposite of what a normal kid would do in any given situation. Farm life plays out against the background of an 'is it/isn't it?' alien invasion scenario, cleverly played out via new reports on their TV to emphasise their isolation.Things plod on in relatively suspenseful fashion for a while; a backstory element explaining the reason for Gibson's character ditching the cloth crops up in flashback (the sections of the film which are most satisfactory), but suddenly Shyamalan does the unthinkable and repeats his error from Unbreakable in delivering a staggeringly botched ending.Wisely refraining from SFX for most of the film, heightening tension with suggested threats as opposed to onscreen violence, the aliens suddenly show themselves and the film stinks up the screen until the credits roll. All trace of claustrophobic thriller is suddenly jettisoned in favour of a final act which comes across as the unwise marriage of Day Of The Triffids and Bull Durham. The final twist in particular borrows wholesale from...Triffids and smacks of a lack of imagination to carry through what was a fairly intriguing vision.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting...,"""Signs"" is a Thriller - Sci-Fi movie in which we follow a former priest and his family as they cope with the mysterious appearance of crop circles in their farm and the possibility of an alien invasion.I enjoyed this movie because it had an interesting plot and excelled in building suspense while its eerie atmosphere with clever use of sound and visuals heightened the tension, making every strange occurrence feel significant. The interpretation of Mel Gibson who played as Graham Hess was outstanding. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Joaquin Phoenix's who played as Merrill Hess and brought warmth and vulnerability in the movie. Something that set ""Signs"" apart from other alien invasion movies is its emotional depth. The direction which was made by M. Night Shyamalan was simply amazing and he effectively uses the science fiction backdrop to explore personal themes like grief, redemption, and the search for meaning. The movie also keeps the aliens largely in the shadows, which heightens their menace and allows for a more character-driven narrative. Some of the plot twists, while intriguing, may feel contrived to certain viewers, especially some moments which leaves some questions unanswered. Additionally, the pacing, especially in the middle section, can drag at times, leaving room for more intensity. Lastly, I have to say that ""Signs"" is a tense, emotionally resonant thriller that stands out for its thought-provoking exploration of faith and family amidst an alien threat and it offers a unique and suspenseful experience so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great thriller!,"The newest film in the legacy of M. Night Shyamalan, SIGNS manages to pull off some very effective creepiness in the very beginning and also holds your interesting throughout the course of the film. Mel Gibson is great, aswell as Joaquin Phoenix. The film was very creepy and contains steadily mounting terror. Vaguely similar to Mark Pellington's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.The film is scary and in some cases, disturbing. The aliens are very well designed. The film actually surprised me. I was not expecting Shyamalan to stick with the story so very closely throughout the entire film almost. With his earlier works, THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, he focuses on the relationships between family members very closely to create a lot of drama that has a payoff. But, most of this film is taken up by fast-moving situations that involve alien activity and crop circles. My only complaint, and I mean 'only', is that the film tries way too hard to be funny. It tries much harder than Shyamalan's earlier works and is the type of humor that is not 'laugh-out-loud', but it is funny because you were not expecting it in a sci-fi suspense thriller. The sequences of the film that are scary, ARE scary. They could have been a little more effectively done, but otherwise, they were very well-crafted.

A sci-fi thriller... I think,"I voted a six for this movie for a reason.  It's been two days since I have seen it yet I am still not sure what my exact opinion is.  It's not a bad movie, don't get me wrong, but I haven't decided whether it's a great movie. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked #176 of 250, as it currently is.Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Rory Culkin are all incredible in the film. The young Abigail Breslin is fine but a little too quiet for the movie.As has come to be public knowledge of M. Night Shyamalan, sound plays an extraordinary role in this film.  The sound from the baby monitor, the haunting hiss/click noises from the supernatural beings, and the whirring wind and shaking corn husks that make you feel a cool breeze as Gibson rushes through a corn field.  Even silence is a major character in the movie.The only reservation that I have for Signs is the ill-timed, often inappropriate humor that Shyamalan feels the need to inject just as the tension is building to a break.  The ""quirky"" if not sometimes ""stupid"" humor that is sandwiched in with the startle scares often times takes away from the thriller genre this movie should be trying harder to achieve.I could not give a decisive thumbs up or thumbs down to this movie.

Very overrated and stupid,"This movie is really bad. Nothing makes sense, the people make stupid decisions, and the aliens are absolutely brainless. The child actors, while they can cry on screen, are terrible. Any time they're not crying is atrocious. At one point, something pretty scarring happens to the children, and there is NO EMOTION. Given context, you would agree with me in saying that the kids should AT LEAST act a LITTLE shocked. And then there's the camera-work. The camera-work for the most part is alright, but those shots where the camera swoops across during a conversation or something mundane drives me crazy. There's nothing in this movie that you can't find anywhere else. The aliens look generic, the setting is cliché, and most importantly, the main twist makes NO SENSE. I'm not going to spoil it here, but it is literally the most BACKWARDS THING you could imagine. Like once you see it you'll be wanting to beat up M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly don't see why so many people like this movie. The only redeeming qualities are Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's performances, those are actually pretty good. But other than that, there's next to nothing good here. I mean, some of the camera-work is alright (aside from the aforementioned swooping thing,) but sometimes alright camera-work doesn't make a good movie. Everything is overdone, overlong, and too predictable for my liking. Avoid this at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
low budget???,"I thought this movie seemed a bit low budget as there only a few different scenes, also the credits were really lame. It attempted to deal with a few concepts e.g. everything happens for a reason, but the way the movie presented them was fairly obvious.Although, it was quite scary and the actors did a really good job in showing real fear, but the seriousness was often alleviated by humorous youthful stories from the younger brother. There was little confrontation, so if you are up for an ID4 alien killing fest this is definitely not the movie to see.Overall 7/10 worth seeing if you want a chill down the spine",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Preacher Mel? No Way!,Disappointing. Miscast and mostly dull and uninvolving. I had great expectations after The Sixth Sense but this is mighty boring and downright laughable in the last 15 minutes. The script is one almighty snoozefest. Phoenix is lost in this movie and Mel tries hard but never cuts it as the preacher who has lost his faith. Predictable movie that is trying to be worthy and philosophical at the same time but really goes belly-up early on and never recovers. Those responsible for this  should have known better. Not reccomended.,,Anonymous,Mystery
A little too much corn in those fields?,"While not as breathtaking as The Sixth Sense (with its goosebump-inducing-no-matter-how-many-times-I-see-it surprise ending) nor as majestic as Unbreakable (with its unique believe-it-if-you-dare reality), Signs is still an M. Night Shyamalan film, which means it will not bore you, at least.  There are great performances as well: Mel Gibson conveys profound sadness with incredible subtlety, Joaquin Phoenix permeates his every scene with complexity, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin  have no false moves, thanks to Shyamalan's superb direction, particularly with children.So we have a potentially brilliant film that doesn't quite pay off at the end (which in any other filmmaker's hands would most likely have been downright corny).  I do, however,  appreciate Shyamalan's attempt to depict a very tricky subject - the 'mysterious ways' of divine guidance, the lack of coincidence in events that seemingly appear disconnected, which come together when they're meant to, in order to make what is supposed to happen occur.  For that alone, I give him the thumbs-up sign.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

After giving an adequate dosage of the aliens hiding in the house bulls***, we are conveniently informed that some primitive method somewhere scared them off. You know what that was? Water, stupid!

A simple and mostly very good alien invasion movie,"I think this is the second best film that M. Night Shyamalan has made to date (2024). It's one of his very simplest narratives without any kind of ""twist"" that has so often muddled things up in his films. It is also filled with a lot of terrific humor.That I like this as much as I do is sort of an oddity for me. I do love sci-fi, but I've little interest in faith based movies and this is mighty close to one. However, the sci-fi elements are the standouts here for me in a film that looks at an alien invasion through a small lens and even the religious aspects serve a purpose.The other oddity here for me is that I don't care for Mel Gibson in most things. I don't think he is generally all that good an actor, but I do like him in this. I actually think it's one of his finest performances. Everyone else is equally good. A young Joaquin Phoenix is a delight as is Rory Culkin and Cherry Jones in a small role shows yet again just how ignored this wonderful actress has been in the film industry. The cinematography is fine, the direction right on and the score is exciting. Despite the religious aspect, I really enjoyed this.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A pretty decent flick...,"With an increasing fan base and a seemingly inherent penchant for making pictures that arouse discussion (whether it be positive or negative), M.Night Shyamalan seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Hollywood sphere and is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest directors in history. Not to say he's there yet, but in ten years or so, I truly believe that this man's soft directorial style will be considered genius and his uniqueness for suspense will be rated and compared to that of the master himself - Alfred Hitchcock.""Signs"" is a story about a fractured family's reponse to a bunch of mysterious crop circles that begin to enclose their small farm-house in a remote village on the outskirts of Philadelphia. The film progresses as crop circles begin to appear all across the world, spreading mass panic amongst the populations and indicating an extra-terrestrial threat who's intentions are anything but benevolent. Mel Gibson is excellent in his title role, and Joaquin Pheonix's brilliance shines through as always. Further credit goes to the two main children in the movie - one of whom is a future klidden Rory Culkin - who provide a sense of fear throughout the picture and allow a constant reminder of stakes.The film itself is pretty decent, serving up the suspense that we've grown to accept as the trademark style of Shyamalan himself, in his soft and elegant directorial style that has garnered critical acclaim for both this film and, especially, the Sixth Sense. And in its direction, Signs never falls short. For a fairly inexperienced mainstream director, Shyamalan has an immensely strong grasp over the medium and portrays this through his ability to direct both the actors and the action on screen. Once again, his choice of elegance in the most suspenseful and shocking of scenes is brilliant and strikes many different chords at once - surely a quality that raises him above many other directors who have attempted the genre.The cinematography and the editing also serve their purposes in the ultimate aim also - suspense - however, it is within a slightly patchy script that this film falls short. To be honest, it seems that Shyamalan's enthusiasm for directing the film was for more substantial than the enthusiasm he exuberated when writing the screenplay. For one, everything happens too fast. Whereas his other films have allowed it to play out a little longer, and let the crux of the story take as much time as the characters demand, the crucial parts of this film remain a bit too rushed. Perhaps more alien encounters would have dampened the suspense of the ""what's gonna happen now"" factor, however I still feel that despite all the film's other allusions to faith, fate and God (which were tied in rather nicely), we wanted to see just a little bit more of some of the good stuff - not the sappy stuff. That would have made the film perfect, but in the end we are left with what could have been as good as the Sixth Sense or any Hitchcockian thriller, but its in its steadfast simplicity in alien encounters that the film falls short. And don't misinterpret it, as I am fully aware that at certain points the alien aspect is deliberately overshadowed by the theological elements of Gibson's loss of faith and his hatred of God, but I still feel we could have been shown more.And I wish we were...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A brilliant thriller that falls apart at the two-thirds mark...,"M. Night Shyamalan's third major picture is a tough film to review. The acting is great, the visuals get a thumbs up, and it's guided to its final destination by a deft filmmaker with a knack for creating suspense. Mel Gibson stars as former reverend Graham Hess, who has given up the faith after a freak accident takes his wife (ironic, as Gibson's next major film would be The Passion). Living on the family farm with his brother Merrill (the always excellent Joaquin Phoenix), they're scraping by and raising Graham's kids (Rory Culkin, the most talented of the Culkin clan, and Abigail Breslin). Unlike Harvery Keitel's character in From Dusk Till Dawn (""Do you still believe in God, Daddy?"" ""Yes. I'm just not happy with him."") however, Gibson's Hess has given up the faith completely. ""There's no one watching over us,"" he tells Merrill.Soon, crop circles are showing up in his cornfields. His animals are going haywire. We know what's coming next, but what works about the film is the sense of claustrophobia the setting creates. A massive invasion is being launched across the globe, and not once do we ever leave the perspective of the Hesses, in their small farmhouse entrenched by cornstalks. Shyamalan understands that an audiences imagination will always scare them more than anything concrete, and teases us with shadowy figures. It works. The first half of the film is beautifully suspenseful. The first straight on shot of an alien is pure goosebumps.And then things kind of fall apart. Actually seeing the aliens, they look a lot less intimidating than we previously imagined. The level of tension drops. It's not gone, but it's nowhere near intense. Then Shyamalan goes for one of his patented switch-endings, which worked so well The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Here, not so much. In a way, it's good storytelling in that the movie begins planting the seeds of its ending from the very beginning. In the end, the pieces are all in the rearview mirror and it is exciting to watch it come to fruition. The problem is a logistic one; it makes no sense. For aliens with such a weakness to even attempt an invasion of Earth seems downright hilarious. Still, while this stretch seems far-fetched, at least the movie works (for the most part). Unfortunately, we can't say the same for The Village. Good call, M. Night. Way to follow up a dud with a stinker.OVERALL SCORE: 7.0 = C+The score is inflated by an excellent first half and terrific acting that makes it worth watching. This is a movie that your senses will love, but your mind will reject. Still, if you can get past the ""twist"", you will have a good time. It's not nearly as good a film as the grossly underrated Unbreakable, but it is good. It just could have been great.PLEASE, M. NIGHT. NO MORE TWISTS!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

sells out at the end,This was a very enjoyable movie full of suspense and in the begining you really are interested in what is going to happen next and the film does begin to give you a sense of fear and forboding and you wonder exactly what is going on.  But unfortunately the film for me sold out big time in the end.The Sixth Sense and The Others work because they keep you wondering all the way through the film and the Mothman Prophecy also worked for me because you leave the cinema still wondering who or what is the Mothman.   In Signs as in Jeepers Creepers you are eventually shown an unbelievable alien creature and the storyline just loses the plot completely.For a film to work it has to be believable.  But I think an intelligent Alien race that can travel across the galaxy but can't open doors and are afraid of water just dose'nt make sense to me.I think if Signs had left us wondering just exactly who did make the crop circles and what exactly where they and what did they want then it would have made for a much more interesting film also if the storyline had remained a local phenomonon and not gone to world wide one it would have been more believable.  I think leaving a piece of the supernatural in this movie would have added to its suspense.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

2/3 of the movie is worthless,"This movie has it's charm, and certainly has some suspenseful moments. However, without giving anything away, it falls very short in the reality department. I accept that with Sci-Fi movies set way in the future, but this movie tries to make certain things seem plausible, yet no one would deal with the situation like the main characters would. Upon reflection some reviewers say they saw these flaws, but I'm surprised more didn't see them while watching how absurd the scenario's were. I'll try to give two examples without giving away too much info. At one point the family headed by Mel Gibson determines that the Aliens are going to be hostile. They correctly deduce that based on their location, they will be subject to that hostility, yet decide to stay. Secondly, when the danger is immanent, instead of preparing to defend themselves, Gibson starts relaying stories to his kids about their births. This movie is strong in the beginning, but loses most of it's credibility towards the time you should really be enjoying it. The end is also very weak, but I can't explain it without giving too much away. If you like Mel Gibson, and go in with low expectations, you might enjoy some of this film.

"Frail rehash of ""War of the Worlds""","There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted writer and director. ""The Sixth Sense"" was ample proof.  Therefore it is a mystery why he bothered with ""Signs"".  While he may be good at creating suspense and will no doubt create great movies in the future, this was nothing but a pale remake of ""The War of the Worlds"".Good actors and interesting cinematography did not disguise the horrid stereotypes.  For example, the aliens turned out to be little green men. Gee, how imaginative.  Why hasn't anyone else thought of that?  At least H.G. Wells (who wrote ""The War of the Worlds"" in 1898, for those who haven't read many books) used some imagination in creating his aliens.  Then, as the aliens were running amok and destroying all humans, it turned out they were killed by something as simple and common as water.  Another bit of pale copying.  Wells created aliens that also ran amok across the earth and then were wiped out by common bacteria (with no human intervention).  Can anyone else see the obvious copying?  Mr Shyamalan is a fine writer but he should rediscover his orginality.Some suggest that ""Signs"" attempts to make us think about predestination and ""are we alone?"".  Maybe.  But the attempts are farcical in this context. As soon as the movie opened with images of shapes cut into corn fields, there was a collective groan. This was a news story some years ago, and a trashy one at that.  The audience knew full well that speculation about alien activity was bogus and that these cornfield ""phenomena"" were man-made hoaxes.  Suspending one's disbelief was rather tricky after this reference to an issue that belongs on moronic, overhyped, third-rate TV shows, like ""Believe It Or Not"".""Signs"" was entirely predictable and unimaginative, especially for a talented writer and director.  He must have needed the money, as must Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, who must cringe when looking back at what they helped create.

"Even when you aren't very interested in UFO's and aliens, this movie is worth watching","Manoj Night Shyamalan seems to have a special bond with all that is mystical and mysterious. Almost all his movies have something special. Think of ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and the ""The Village"". You can never really call them a normal drama or thriller. And it's exactly the same with ""Signs"", which is about the Hess family who seems to live a normal live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.After the death of his wife in an awful accident, Reverend Graham Hess questioned his faith and even left the church. All seems to be normal now, but when he finds a giant crop circle in the middle of his corn fields and several similar events happen all over the world, he really doesn't know what to think anymore. His children believe it is the work of extra-terrestrials, but his brother Merill is convinced that some local pranksters did it. But soon they realize that this is a lot bigger than they could ever imagine and all that is really sure is that something bad is about to happen...Some people pointed out that the end of the movie was so bad that it spoiled all the rest. Well, I can't really find myself in that opinion. It's true that the end could have been better, but in my opinion it still contributes to the whole of the movie. Still, it was one of the weakest parts of the entire movie, which most of the time offered plenty of suspense and thrills and some decent acting.Certainly worth noticing is the young Abigail Breslin who is nice to watch and who did a terrific job despite her young age. All the others like Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin did a pretty good job as well, but she was the one that I really noticed.Overall this is a decent movie that will please all people who are interested in phenomenons like aliens and UFO's, but even when you aren't a big fan of such stories (I'm one of them), this movie is worth a watch because it is a lot better than the average Sci-Fi film.

Spectacular!!!,"M. Night Shyamalan has created another masterpiece of a movie. Signs, being his third consecutive block-buster hit, exceeded my expectations. After reading some of the other reviews that said Signs is not a good movie I had to see it, knowing that these people are the same people that can not watch a movie without gross-out humor and dazzling special effects. Signs is a brilliantly crafted movie which managed to keep me enthralled to the very last minute. Instead of using explosions, special effects and hundreds of CGI aliens, which are used in most movies to distract the viewer from the weak storyline, Shyamalan keeps the effects to a bare minimum and instead uses images and a feeling of isolation to keep viewers in suspense. Signs is NOT your typical Science Fiction movie because it goes much deeper by evaluating religion and instead of seeing the whole world in turmoil we see the whole invasion through the experiences of a family isolated on a farm. The performances are excellent. The story amazing and the movie SPECTACULAR. But be warned if you are narrow-minded and you are not stimulated by movies which make you think this isn't for you. If you are on the other hand one of those people who enjoys an amazing experience in a movie, see it now. Definitely a contender for the Oscars in 2003. Undoubtedly one of this years best movies.

Interesting Thematic Ideas but leaky plot and performances,"Signs is the latest offering of the very talented M. Night Shyamalan. It is set in the ""rural"" area of Bucks County just outside of Philadelphia. Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, a former Priest of no stated church who is angry with God and has lost his faith after the accidental death of his wife. For some odd reason he also has a large farm that has acres of corn fields that he appears to tend with no farm hands or help. Suddenly geometric signs appear in his field and Hess is determined to get to the bottom of this while protecting his family. His crises of faith in God or a guiding force in the Universe is supposed to be the concept that drives the film but weak plotting undermines the idea. Mel Gibson is not entirely successful in conveying Father Hess's confusion and sorrow after the death of his wife. One thinks as a middle age Reverend he must have counseled people on how to deal with the loss of a loved one. Sometime, he must have figured out that times like that are what test your true faith and conviction: but right now he ""hates God."" The Aliens have traveled here for dubious reasons and are ill-equipped to deal with earthlings; though they did have the technology to get here from wherever and make cool patterns in grass and crops. Primitive means are most successful in dealing with them. Perhaps had Mr. Shyamalan formally collaborated with someone the plot could have supported his lofty questions of faith.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great bold film making.,"Great cinematic experience. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shyamalan's way of story telling is quite special. He gives hope to a lot of beginners. Hey you dont need to spend megabucks on big studio sets or exotic locations or use special effects to create an effective movie. You need story telling skills, a good script and good acting. And of course some boldness to be different. Check out all his latest 3 movies. Bulk of the shots happen indoors. Cast is very minimal too.From reading some of the reviews here people are still expecting shyamalan to 'rise up' to matrix and independence day style of film making. Hey if you want eye candy, go watch starwars and mib. But if you want something with more substance, here is a guy that gives you stuff to think about. All of Shyamalan's movies had me thinking about his movie making even days after I saw it.On a side note, all his movies combined probably contains just one 'R' rated sentence. (Unbreakable: the crude sexual reference in the comic book store.). Aspiring filmmakers, take a deep breath. You dont need to fill your movie with 4 letter words and references. Here is your example. (Half the shorts in atomfilms.com or ifilm.com are r rated).Was signs scary? Oh yes. Good acting? defenitely. Very touching at some points. I have no complaints about the plot. Its irrelevent. Its the way he approached the subject that matters.Signs is a good movie. Just ignore the negative comments. Most people havent gotten out of the sixth sense hangover yet. Its probably the same people who compained about not able to see the CGI train crash in Unbreakable.Will Signs make money? You bet. Like his older movies, Signs also was made on a budget of around 60 million! He must be a dream filmmaker for studios.Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I think people missed the point here..,"...all I heard after this movie came out was how incredible it was. It was only years later that people started picking apart the logic of it. They missed the point though.. this movie wasn't really about aliens.. it was about ""God""... I put that in quotes for a reason because I'm not speaking to any one religion. The whole point of the movie was about good watching out for us over evil. ""Signs"" has nothing to do with the aliens themselves.. ""signs"" refers to those watching over us giving us hints they're there.Brilliant film. Brilliant execution. Stop focusing on water so much and appreciate it for the overall message.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
not what expected but good,"Watching the previews, I figured this would be a movie full of suspense andfrightening moments.  Well, only a few of those and sometimes I wondered ifcertain scenes are to frighten audiences, but did not.  It has a good plot but I feel that there could have been a lot more in ""Signs.""  Frankly, the aliens were not that frightening in my opinion and I am still a little disappointed that I never fully understood what the purpose of the aliens in ""Signs"" was.

I'm also not averted to Mel Gibson as an actor.However, this movie simply is too stupid, too unfrightening, contains too much bad acting as well as logical fallacies big enough to pass a transatlantic liner trough and in addition is too laughable to be taken as anything but a really sad joke. I don't think I've been as disappointed since the ending of ""The Abyss"".I will not repeat all the detailed complaints others have already mentioned however.

M. Night's best movie,"This is a great movie. A little creepy at times but still great. Up until this point M Night was an okay at best director. I pleasantly enjoyed sixth sense and I thought Unbreakable was okay. But this is easily his best film. It isn't caught up in getting to the twist like most of his other films. And it doesn't even have one. I think that is what makes this so good. It isn't like M. Night. It feels original. The story is really well written. It does such a good job of tying everything together in the end and will probably make you cheer. It also does a lot of the aloen clichés really well in my opinion. And this thing can get scary. I'm not one to watch horror movies so I was freaked out in some points in this movie. The Characters ate also really enjoyable. I think Mrl Gibson does a really good job and his character is extremely well written. He has an incredible character arc in this movie and a specific scene near the end with him I think he has one of his best performances out of any movie. The two kid characters were ok. They felt more like plot points than actual characters. And Joaquin Phoenix's character is really good in my opinion. I love Joaquin as an actor and he delivers a good performance in this. He is definitely needed as comedic reilf in this otherwise dark movie. The ending with his character is really awesome and he does a great job acting. I like that they try to keep the aliens as mysterious as possible by never showing one's face. It is also super realistic. You can picture earth getting attacked and that makes it even more scary I think. Over all this us incredible and really underrate in my personal opinion. If you have a chance give it a watch.

70% Tosh,"As a passionate cinephile I get intensely annoyed when modern directors steal the ideas, situations etc., from great, and even not so great films from the past. 'Signs' is, in effect, little more than 'War of the Worlds' re-couched in a family environment that is reminiscent of 'The Birds' with a splash of 'The Wizard of Oz' thrown in. One has the idea that M Night Shymalan might claim that is film is some kind of homage to these films, but that is nonsense. It is a load of tosh (English slang for rubbish), that is interesting, up to a point, all the time it is 'about' crop circles, and disintegrates into ridicule when it becomes an apocalyptic vision. 'The Sixth Sense' was clever, well-constructed and thoughtful. This film is none of those.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent B movie,"I quite enjoyed Signs.Judging by the money spent on special effects I presume it wasn't supposed to be a science fiction movie. (one rubber catsuit, a field of rustling corn and a $20 baby alarm)The priest loses his faith when his wife dies. As a priest, we might have expected him to understand that people do die and not to throw his dummy out of the pram so readily. Presumably had the priest been Catholic he wouldn't have had a wife and there wouldn't have been a film.Anyway, Mel makes the most of things and gets the message across that bug eyed greys shouldn't mess with us because we've got the holy water.Mel puts in a typically enthusiastic performance to raise the story above the corn. There is a good blend of suspense and sentiment. Little Abigail Breslin as Bo, is used to good effect to charm us and take our minds off being unnecessarily critical of the storyline.Point to note. Do not advise that priest, carrying large kitchen knife, be used as emissary to possible future alien landing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Clever dialogue,  well shot, shaky plot.","Did somebody forget that water makes up part of the earth's atmosphere? Water vapour is present in the air, we breathe it in AND out. So, I find it somewhat incredible that an alien whose Achille's heel is H2O a)would choose to land on Earth which has vast quantities of the substance -have they never seen the blue planet from above? b)are unaffected by water unless it is thrown on them or preferably smashed onto them by a sentimental swing of a baseball bat. However, despite these obviously huge discrepancies due to an idea which seemed - hey,like a pretty good idea, but wasn't really thought through (I blame this on the director) I think this film is visually brilliant. You weren't expecting that were you? Shymalan directs with startling self-confidence and this film is uncannily good for a paper thin plot. Mel Gibson produces a sterling performance as the Reverend and any film with Phoenix has to be a winner. So, ignore the flaws and enjoy the acting. Enjoy the dialogue, enjoy the suspense and enjoy the camera work. Enjoy the set, enjoy the shiver down your spine as you too feel the fear that the characters do. All I ask, is don't even try to think about the plot realism. Enjoy the film for what it is. It is excellent but oh so fatally flawed. It is disappointing compared to Sixth Sense but still worth watching. Perhaps you are left longing for a little more, oomph but watch it, just not twice.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Finally, a frightening movie!","This has to be one of the first movies in years to realize that the less you see of the monster - the scarier the experience. Although Spielberg's 'Jaws' employed this technique so well, most films these days took the other route - showing us the evil in it's full glory instead. As a result, in these films the fear factor is lost under mountains of animatronics or cgi.In Signs, we are kept in complete suspense for the majority of the movie - An inhuman leg here... a flitting shadow there...Our minds do the rest for us. And it works fantastically.Signs takes the alien invasion plotline and examines it from a whole new angle. M. Night knew that he didn't need to show us huge ufo's blowing up the white house. Instead, he stays with one small family in one small town throughout. Our only link to the outside world is the occasional tv report. Yet still you get the sense that something terrible is happening in the world outside - all over the planet. And you feel closer to the action than you ever will in event movies of the same theme. When Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are trapped in the middle of their own house - with shadows of creatures moving past the windows looking for a way in - you are right there beside them.Because Signs depends so much on the emotional intellect of its audience, those with little sense of imagination will probably be dissapointed with its underplayed manner. But those who can't walk past an open doorway at night without conjuring some skeletal creature in the darkness beyond will probably find it the most frightening experience they have ever had.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another M. Night triumph...,"""Signs,"" starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who helmed ""The Sixth Sense,"" could possibly be one of the best films of 2002, so far. Yet again, Shyamalan treats his viewers with some Hitchcockian-style camera angles, which provide enhanced suspense for an already suspenseful picture.Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a former reverend-farmer who recently lost his faith in God over the death of his wife. His younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a former Minor League Baseball player, helps support Graham's children Morgan and Bo Hess (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Before long, the family soon discovers crop circles in the farm's corn fields. Could they be signs of an alien invasion, or just an elaborate prank played by people with too much time on their hands?M. Night Shyamalan proves yet again that he's a very gifted director. (Although some call him the next Spielberg, I consider him to be the next Robert Zemeckis, as he utilizes more subtle special effects rather than the in-your-face eye-candy sort.) Previously helming ""Unbreakable,"" and before that, ""The Sixth Sense,"" M. Night takes elements from both of those movies to create ""Signs."" He successfully utilizes the frightening and intense moments borrowed from ""The Sixth Sense,"" as well as the simple, yet somehow, fancy camerawork from ""Unbreakable.""Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as the widower who loses his faith over the death of his wife. He acts as if he desperately cares for his kids, and even his brother. Although some may disagree, I believe Gibson yet again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he acts like a second father to Graham's children, who give a stunning performance, as well.Although some believed that ""Signs"" would be a typical invasion movie and special effects extravaganza, I found it to be something more than that. It's about faith, and the film constantly asks us questions, such as: Are there miracles in the world, or is it just luck? Shyamalan directs and writes ""Signs"" with such intelligence that many will think that it was slow and needed to be cut down a bit. I don't believe this; if you are following along with the story, you'll see that almost every scene is needed somehow in the movie.As a special-effects movie freak, I could say that ""Signs,"" which does in fact have some special effects, intelligently provides us with a more subtle view that focuses more on the characters rather than what's going on outside. (There is very little second unit photography in this film.) Most of the effects will go unnoticed, and what this says is that the special effects team has done their job.""Signs"" is yet again a unique piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. Though it's more predictable than the director's previous movies, it's still very entertaining, and often frightening at times. Shyamalan knows how to make a movie that literally forces you to care about the characters, and not the eye candy. I can't wait to hear what M. Night's up to next.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So much more than just the scares.....,"This feels like a smaller budget story but done with high production values, I say smaller budget because the majority of the film takes place in one location and there only about 7 characters. Some bits are very tense, other parts provide welcome comic relief so the script does a good job of handling this. The special effects are starting to look dated though. Signs also has some interesting themes. The casting was also very good. The themes of faith and recovery and family though were extremely moving and they really come to the front of the film as things progress. The earlier scenes in the crop circles with the haunting music score were just perfect. A shame about the CGI which hasn't aged well.

"Rewarding film, suffers from misdirected marketing","This film is a suspense-drama about faith, family and personal philosophy. Let me repeat that. This film is a suspense-drama.The greatest difficulty that many will have with ""Signs"" is their own expectations for a science fiction story or simple action move. Those who expect an ""Independence Day"" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will be disappointed. And they will lose out on a wonderful movie.""Signs"" is tightly focused on the Gibson's character. The heart of the movie revolves around how he chooses to view life. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is steady with a deep appreciation for and sympathy with the struggles of people struggling to lead and guide others. The tautly built sense of apprehension is structured around the mysterious and threatening events, but is more deeply focused on the internal confrontation of Gibson's character with himself and his own conception of the world.James Newton Howard's score transforms from an oddly sappy 50's style piece at the intro to a haunting, dissonant and simply disconcerting theme as the movie builds. It's a work of genius, not in the sense that you'll want to listen the soundtrack many times, but in the sense that it perfectly supports the film. Likewise the sound work richly provides a depth that captures well the unease within its commonplace setting. Shyamalan continues to pull great performances from children and both Rory Caulkin and Abibail Bensen are solid. They pull at your heart in believable ways and provide substance to the family.Bottom line:  Go for the thoughtful drama of human struggles with personal and family faith. Look elsewhere for the Sci-Fi and action kicks.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stupid Ending for Marginal Movie,"Well, the honeymoon for Shayamalan since ""Sixth Sense"" is over.Forget the boxoffice numbers -- this is a big Shayamalan buildup that leads to a moronic conclusion.The 'scary things' in this flick came off as tragic and pathetic. Teletubbies would give these creatures a run for their money.  Incredibly lopsided, with nothing more than a hint of alien danger.  No kidding -- by the end of the movie, I was rooting for the 'bad guys'.And you will cringe in your seat as badly as I did when you find out what the big-deal, ""Swing for the fences"" message was all about.  The ending was so utterly idiotic that I was embarrassed to have spent money to see it.M. Night Shayamalan better watch more ""Alien"" and less ""Crossing Over"". Because a little more s*** like this, and I will be ""crossing over"" to watch some other director's movies.Final verdict:  Marginal, occasionally suspenseful fare -- but wait for the video, or you'll be kicking yourself.  (You won't see it at the Oscars unless they've been taking stupid pills - guaranteed.

I don't understand...,"...why this film got so many bad reviews. I'm not a fan of aliens or horror films so perhaps these people are judging it by those standards. Maybe they came in expecting ""Alien"" or ""Nightmare on Elem Street"", so if that's what you're into you definitely skip this film. But if you're looking for a soulful, delicate and powerful film that makes you think about the bigger questions (God, coincidences, faith and hope) and offers some actual ANSWERS (something films have little of these days) you'll enjoy this film even if you aren't into aliens or horror.Basically, it's about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), an Episcopalian priest who has just suffered a horrible tragedy that has made him lose his faith in God. He lives on a little farm with his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin)and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix).One morning he wakes up and discovers crop signs in his corn field. He at first thinks its just some neighborhood boys horsing around but soon it is discovered that there is a full-scale alien invasion underway all over the world.The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's respond to this emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, slightly anxious and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide in the cellars or pack up the car and drive as far away from the trouble as they could go.Most alien films move right to the aliens wreaking carnage after the first ten minutes and therefore they lose something, they become a simple fight/flight ride that we never really required to think about. This film for the most part never showing the aliens, only in glimpses, and therefore our imaginations are allowed to enhance the fear and tension. This makes it a slow-moving film, but it never loses that sense of anxiety, the feeling that somewhere out-there, something is watching you and waiting to pounce...The message of the film is a universal one: at one point Graham asks his brother what kind of person is he, one who believes in blind luck and happy chance, that you are all alone in this world, or are you a person who believes that there are no coincidences and that there is Someone up there, watching and taking care of things? I myself am a Christian, but I think no matter what your religion, you will be able to take something comforting away from this film. I have seen many Christian films that do not give such a powerful display of faith as this one and I respect Shyamalan for being able to pull this off without it once seeming cheesy.The acting in this film is wonderful; the performances or subtle and quiet, these are everyday people still fragile after a tragedy, yet powerful and genuine. I know Gibson has been criticized and judged these past years, but he is without a doubt one of the best actors out there and his performance is the linchpin of this film, he character is so obviously damaged and insecure, yet when called upon he gives such strength and power. Phoenix is a great supporting role, he is quirky and rather simple, but no less strong or deep than his brother. The children are great, Culkin and Breslin work to together seamlessly and exude genuine love and tenderness for one another. Cherry Jones has a small part in this film but she is excellent in her scenes and even Shyamalan himself has a small scene, a very emotional one and he is actually very good.When I first saw this film I was unsure if I would enjoy it, the slow pace and the subtly of the performances, but by the end all this payed off: I knew each character deeply and I was invested in their story, and the ending was one of the most moving experiences I have ever seen in film. Go see this film, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Signs of Spielberg - Is Your Sixth Sense Unbreakable ?,"It was a moment of joy for me. For an indian like me to witness a loud applause from the audience for a hollywood movie in an american theatre directed by an indian. And it was truly breathtaking. Yes, Manoj Night Shyamalan does it again. First by sixth sense he swept us near the oscars then he dusted the childhood heroes inside us through his unbreakable . Now he comes back to touch the spiritual and human side of us with a backdrop of UFOs in his signs.Signs is a movie to relish quietly in a corner of the theatre without catcalls and whispers. It really impacts you with a melodramatic and an eerie mood. Make you rethink your beliefs. Only condition - Listen to the dialogues carefully, else you might be lost in this complex screenplay.Shyamalan love for philadelphia, where he was brought up is evident and this one is set there too. The greenish farm which is the heart of the movie increases the suspense. Amazing location.This movie is ceratinly Mel gibson's career high. Shyamalan's builds Mel Gibson's character slowly yet strongly. He is such a cool actor that his character builds up in you. Thats what he did to me in ' What Women Want' . You become him after some point of time in signs and you get involved in the during the course of the movie and try to save you and your children from the UFOs and aliens.The twist which you would expect in shyamalan's movie is certainly missing but that is the wish of a creative writer which cannot be questioned. To the given story and characters, shyamalan gives rationale and ends it great. Some might think that it was an abrupt ending but that again depends on your taste of movies. Night doesn't spoon feed you. Just makes you realize the need of using your brain and co-relate events. Thats why you so feel special while you see such movies. You feel elevated to the heights of thinking and you certainly do. Your sixth sense would not be unbreakable and you suddenly rise up from your seats in fear. Especially in a scene while the dog which is silently eating and suddenly barks the nerve out of you.A Spielberg is on the making and we are witnessing one of the to-be-legends of all time. Is that so? Your catch on this is welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite brilliant sequences and some terrific performances, the story doesn't hang together","One is aware watching this film that it is the work of an independently minded artist who has been given relatively free reign.  In the realm of committee-created summer garbage, that's breathtaking!  Unfortunately, despite many brilliant sequences and some terrific performances (the two children, Joaquin Phoenix, and Cherry Jones), the story of a minister's struggle with faith in the midst of an alien invasion, though intermittently powerful, just doesn't hang together.  You're left with too many questions that linger and grow in number in the days following -- and not good ones, but rather questions like what were they doing with all that crop since no one seemed to really be farming it?  The comparisons of Shyamalan to Hitchcock and Spielberg are apt, however, and the framing of almost every shot, the choice to keep most of the horror off-screen, shows an all too rare insight, taste, and intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M. Night's finest hour,"This film left me wanting more, and more, and more of M. Night Shyamalan's films. It truly is his finest hour in film-making, with his suspense-thriller 'The Sixth Sense' coming in a close second.The film surrounds the plight of the Hess family, that is, Graham (Mel Gibson) the father, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) the brother of Graham, and the two children Morgan and Bo. They discover a series of crop signs in their corn fields, and as the movie unfolds the Hess family and the entire world is faced with a potential invasion from extra-terrestrials.Shyamalan truly is a brilliant storyteller. He uses brilliant setting, camera angles and lighting to leave you breathless. The casting is also brilliant, with Gibson doing a fine job as Graham Hess, Phoenix enchanting as Merrill, and the two children do a thoroughly capable job of portraying Graham's sometimes quirky children. Another fine feature of Signs is the musical score. Perfectly timed, the music is haunting and windy, helping the watcher's imagination to follow its path.This movie is worth a watch. Then another. And another. I've seen it 5 times, and it gets better every time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Out of 3½ of 5 rating,"I´ve seen this movie and I was satisfied about the plot and the way the director drive his actings, performances and other elements. I don´t think the movie is awful, but for the likeness we made the colors, in other words I was a little skeptical about the movie cause I don´t believe in aliens, they are too liers, but I think It worth the time and money go to see it.M. Night Shyamalan was superb in his cameras movement, and his score is unique, the way how tell us his story is very effective and Mel Gibson´s acting is, believe me, very convincing. He shows a kind of man whose faith is devasting about his recent murder wife. At all, the film has a rare atmosphere of creepy and this is one of the most powerful details about.But I understand who´s not agree with me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stupidity is it's own reward,"Or so it seems.How Mr Night Shyamalan got away with insulting our intelligence in this way is beyond me. But he did, and he is handsomely rewarded with a rating of seven, four points more than this film deserves.Signs attempts to mix science fiction with religious motifs, and fails miserably. The first half hour of the film is bearable as you can still maintain the illusion that it will actually lead somewhere. After that it rapidly goes downhill and becomes unwatchable for anyone with even a remote understanding of either physics, biology, combat or navigation. I've watched many bad films, but this one made me feel so violated that I had to write my very first review.To be fair, this film isn't a total loss. It is worth watching if you are very religious, preferably the Gibson variety, and neither logic nor common sense interest you.For all others: stay clear of this film or you will feel cheated afterward.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's about Priest's family,"The movie Signs was released in August second of 2002. This movie was directed and produced by M. Night Shyamalan. The genre of this movie is science fiction thriller. The major actors in this movie are Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin. In the movie, Rory and Abigail are kids, but they are grown up to adults now. The story is about Episcopal Priest's family and aliens coming to the earth. There are conflicts between an alien and the main character's family, and the story is about it. I really enjoyed this movie, because there was a final reversal and the ending was different with what I expected. I personally really liked this movie because the symbolism in this movie was kind of touching. Everything in the movie was all connecting, so I think the plot of the overall movie was good. One unique thing about director M. Night Shyamalan is that he always comes out as an actor in his movie. Whenever I watch his movie, I am always trying to find him out while watching the movie. Another unique thing about his movie is that when he is filming the movie, he uses lots of long shots other than short shots. I think these long shots make watchers to fall into the movie, because short shots make people hard to concentrate. I personally recommend this movie to Christians, because this movie's message is related to the religious thing. This movie shows and talks about faith in Christianity, but it can also be related to other religions. I just watched this movie once, so if I have a chance to watch it again, I will definitely watch it. I am sure that if I watch this movie again, I will catch more details from the movie and enjoy more.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I expected more!!,"Yes, I expected more and I am disappointed. I`m asking how could this movie total an amount of more than 200 Mio. US$ at the theatres? Well, the plot is alright but it is not well packed as a convincing and really chilling blockbuster. During two thirds of the story nothing goes on and you wait and wait till something happens. The rest is all déjà vu. It is a low budget movie with no special effects. Okay I've got the message having hope in God but this I know since I am a little boy. I think this time the director failed completely after his last average movie ""Unbreakable"". Some critics I read on imbd said it seems Hitchcocks ""The Birds"". I don´t think so. ""The Birds"" is better, has more suspense and is a real edge-of-your-seat-thriller and it is still actual.I continue to believe that director Night Shymalan has great potential of turning better thrillers than this one. If you want to watch it I highly recommend you to rent it before you buy. You will appreciate my advice.Too overrated. Maximal 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Oh God! This film destroyed my faith in cinema.,"Okay, I waited a few years to see this film. I'd heard that the director was excellent. But boy, was I in for a surprise. This is one of the biggest pieces of cinema garbage I've ever seen.Mel Gibson just can't seem to prevent himself from preaching these days. He gets his chance here, but that's about all that happens. Bad things happen, and he loses is faith. Then some coincidences happen and he regains it. Jeez, buy a lottery ticket, Mel.As for the 7.1/10 rating this film is currently sporting on this site, I'd like to know how since almost all of the reviews I read are scathingly bad. No way is this piece of sappy non-sci-fi worth anywhere near that sort of rating.I must be missing the point. However reading the scant handful of reviews that had positive things to say didn't help much. All I got was comments about the wonderful cinematography, which I honestly didn't notice. God, this film is so boringly shot that you could do it on a domestic video camera with 10 minutes training. But nobody has bothered to explain what was going on. Was there a good reason to use water as the aliens' weak spot, since it's been acknowledged by almost everyone that water is one of the most abundant chemical compounds on the planet, not to mention plenty of other planets in the solar system? Someone please explain.God, why am I wasting time even asking? This thing is a turkey, plain and simple. Religious stupidity from Mel the Saviour, cutesy child actors, and aliens that melt. It's downright painful.And that 7.1 must be from rigged voting. There's no other answer.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Mixed feelings,"Although I enjoyed the movie in general, I was a bit disappointed too. But that could be attributed to my expectations maybe. I'd hoped, wished the director would have had an new, original view on crop circles. Alas, it was the aliens again. There were other cliché's: the 'psychic' kid that gets messages from 'beyond'; we've seen that in Poltergeist and other movies. And the storyline of aliens at first being almost invincible and than suddenly dying of something stupid, ordinary, onnozels (well, look it up); that has been used before: In War of the Worlds it were germs that finished the aliens and in Mars Attacks! country music. Another thing I noticed. Although at some point in the story it became quite clear the aliens were here (crop circles, giant spaceships hoovering in the sky), when the aliens got down to the surface they moved around almost undetected.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film in two parts,"This film started very promisingly with some clear nods to some of the masters of suspense (very Hitchcockian opening). It develops some interesting tension and gets pretty creepy - but then it seems to lose its way. It goes from a chilling thriller to little more than a vehicle to get Mel to come around. (I also thought M Night Shyamalan's cameo was a bit too substantial to really be a directorial cameo but that's neither here nor there.) Still, in all not a bad movie - it just took the route too easy rather than the one less travelled. That's Hollywood I guess. My vote 7/10 (and a bit surprised to see this film currently in the top 250 of all time!).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie deserves much more!!!,"There are tons of horror movies and not all of them can make you this much scary. This movie is a great suspense. I love the script... Especially when I saw the new horror movies that came in this year, I really can understand the value of this movie much more. Signs is one of the best of its kind. I really can not understand that how this magnificent story doesn't deserve better. I think Signs must have been earned at least 7,5 points. 6,7 is too low for this piece of art. I really liked the alien concept but not all of the alien movies can make you this much scary. Signs is scary, and suspenseful at the same time. And how many movies you know that M. Gibson and J. Phoenix are both playing at the same project. They both are a legend! And you can see why when you are watching the movie. Signs is a classic, this movie is one of the few of its kind. They don't make horror movies like this anymore. M. Night Shyamalan was a genius director back in those days, but it is sad that he is not making horror movies like this anymore. But Signs will be a classic forever. And we will understand the quality of this movie much more when we will see the upcoming new generation horror movies. Making a classic horror movie is a hard thing. But Mr. Shyamalan achieve that by making Signs and The Sixth Sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
some nice work dampened by a holey plot,"The other reviews are right on the money: this film looks really good and has that Twilight Zone-like Shyamalan feel to it, but there really are some plot holes that will have you shaking your head and smiling when you stop to think about it -- which, in my case, was _during_ my first (and probably only) viewing.  One review I saw said the acting was terrible; I don't think so.  Another comment mentioned that the movie was a confusion between different genres of movie and the makers weren't sure what sort of movie they were ultimately trying for, and I think that says it best, and explains why the acting may have seemed poor, at least to some people or in certain places.There were some great shots in Signs, such as Graham's (Mel's) first initial glimpse of one of the aliens -- really spooky!  Great job.  I will also say the wife's death scene was dramatically compelling and I appreciated the emotional presentation of that event, including the faltering words of the female cop who gets the unenviable duty of explaining the situation to Graham when he arrives on the scene; she almost flubs her line, but that's exactly how real people would be in such a horrible situation: faltering and shaky.  Thanks to the editors/directors for putting that take in the final film.Buuuuuut... the best review of all put it simply: can't wait for the sequel when the aliens return with raincoats and crowbars.  LOL!  My thoughts exactly.  Nothing like having to trek alllllllll the way back to Arcturus IV (or wherever -- please no hate mail from astronerds that there is no Arcturus IV) for those little interplanetary raid materials that SOMEONE forgot to put in the ship, huh?  Considering there were hundreds of ships, that's a rather serious case of mass forgetfulness.Good try; needed another pass on the plot to be really great.  I give it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What a turkey!,"Watching this movie in expectation but with growing alarm, it was hard to believe it was made by the same director of 'The Sixth Sense'. What on earth was he thinking of? In 'Signs' we have every modern film cliche thrown in - the asthmatic child, the dysfunctional family, the husband tortured by his wife's death in a car accident on which he keeps having flashbacks.The sci-fi element was just ridiculous and laughable. Are we to believe aliens had the technology to travel millions of light years to Earth but yet couldn't get past a pantry door?

"Suspenseful, creepy and entertaining movie","I have quite mixed feelings about M Night Shyamalan. He always has great ideas but the execution is usually lacking, particularly in the final third. However with Signs I think the idea is relatively simple but the execution is pretty solid throughout.The simplicity of the premise isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a movie devoid of any action or big set pieces, but that is quite a refreshing approach. It's an alien invasion story told on a very small scale from the perspective of one family, which does make the whole thing feel quite intimate.I think the atmosphere that is created is really good. It feels almost like a horror movie at times with the gloomy setting and the camera work, and the subtle ways the aliens are introduced and seen.What does let this film down for me however is the characters. I think if you are making a film like this that focuses on the characters and not necessarily any action, they have to be compelling and I just didn't find that to be the case. The performances were all quite good, but I just think the writing needed to be a little better.Overall though I think this is definitely one of M Nights better films. He doesn't overextend himself with the premise and manages to stick the landing, making for a pretty engaging movie well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No Signs of life,"One of the most unfortunate films events of recent years was the unexpected success of a little-trailed Bruce Willis ghost story movie. Mr Moonlighting's career had been in long, slow decline apart from the blip-boost of his Pulp Fiction cameo, but 'The Sixth Sense' put him back in the big league, temporarily at least.For many of us seduced by the hype of TSS, and especially the write-up for its emerging writing talent - the exotically named 'M Night Shyamalan' actually sitting and watching the movie was a bit of an anticlimax. Fairly leaden performances, portentous script and a fairly hackeneyed and well trailed twist at the end.However it seemed to seal M Night's reputation as a screenwriter of note, I guess based on box office alone, a reputation his two subsequent films have not borne out. But where Unbreakable was merely dull, Signs is basically appalling.The idea has taken shape that this guy is a genius and up to handling the challenge of being director, writer and producer of a single project. He acquits none of these well in Signs. Despite having two of the great action-event movie producers riding shotgun; Marshall/Kennedy, Signs is so unbelievably leaden for the first hour-and-a-half that my finger hovered tantalisingly over the stop button.Most infuriating is the artifical and non-naturalistic 'style' that someone (I suspect M. Night) has directed the actors to use. This combines an utter lack of emotional range with non-normal response to situations, interspered with sickly outpourings of inner belief or the characters acting as mouthpieces for cod philosophy.Two horrendous moments spring to mind in the film: the first, where Gibson and Phoenix sit watching television coverage of the alien encounters, Gibson launches it a 'there are two types of people speech'. This rambling, inelegant and absolutely unprofound observation of whether people have faith or not to see them through is treated as a brimming eyed revelation by Phoenix's character while the audience thinks 'huh?'.What is even more cringeworthy is that you can feel that the writer thinks - wow this is really great writing. This is so far above the crappy naturalistic speech of most Hollywood movies. No, it's not: it's turgid, badly written, inconsistent and vacuous pandering to your fanbase and the constructed image of yourself as a 'great writer'.The second occasion is the 'when your were born' speeches that Gibson regales his children with as the aliens are breaking into the house with the intention of eating everyone for breakfast. Pointless, artifical 'moments' of profundity when any honest and naturalistic attempt to capture that moment, that emotion would get its true fear and horror.Actually, let me change my mind. The most truly awful moment of this film is when Gibson gets to exchange some final words with his wife who happens to have been cut in half by a car but is still totally aware and communicative seconds before slipping softly into death. This is not how people die, let alone how they live.It needs not me to add to the chorus of derision about the basic plot of the film and its alien invasion theme. It's not so much as picking holes in the plot as attempting to create something coherent and logical out of it. Naked aliens that cannot stand WATER? Better sack the alien commander responsible for researching the invasion then. The idea that they might travel 500 million light years to be defeated by a garden hose is totally risible.Of course M Night devotees will say the story is actually a PARABLE which mundane viewers expecting a story and real characters are missing. The water can be viewed as baptismal, the aliens as our internal demons, the house as the isolation of the soul, the whole event as a proof of faith. Yawn. There is more insight into the human condition in 5 minutes of Scorsese or Alan Parker than in hours of this simulated, meretricious garbage which is intended to appeal to our vague spiritual yearnings and need for pasteurised morality.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Mel Gibsons character is a former priest who lost his belief when his wife died. He lives with his two kids and his younger brother in a farmhouse. One day they see some strange patterns in the corn field, and there the story begins. Joaquin Phoenix who plays the brother is as good as always. The eerie and creepy atmosphere is more and more significant the further in you come. The negative things about Signs is that in some points its quite excessive.

An Honest Review,"Most of the negative criticism are based on two things, the first is that the director cast himself in a minor role and the second his how the aliens are defeated.Once more it illustrates the pathological hatred for a director that doesn't cut and past the same old stories.The haters fail to realize that a lot of the directors they praise sneak themselves into films. It's just a given. It happens all the time.And then the ending, how the aliens were defeated. Here we have Shyamalan attempting to give the audience something original, a plot twist that they haven't seen before. A reason for life to go on after the alien invasion, a way out to keep them from totally conquering the planet.And instead of praising the originality, the fact that it may even be a subtle nod to War of the World's without blatantly ripping off the book, they once more nail the director to the cross for not delivering the same old thing they see every day.Ignore all the hate.What you have is a moving story about faith, family, redemption, and...aliens.It is clever, moving, suspenseful, and funny all at the same time and, that is not something you get in every movie.It's not the typical alien invasion movie where earth is triumphant through force of arms and guerilla warfare.

Poorly written and goes nowhere,"This movie was another movie about a religious man who lost his faith because of something that happened to his family. The tragedy is slowly and excruciatingly revealed, even though it was easy to guess. Writers who dont know anything about sports should not try to include them in their movies. Homerun records are not measured in distance, there arent five homerun records to be set in a season. The way this was revealed was unbelievable by some guy in the army office that we never see again but seems to hate joaquin phoenix because he struck out a lot. They hit you over the head with the metaphor of striking out being related to his life as a loser, mentioning it a few more times in case you dont get it at first. Mel Gibson is an ex-religious man who they call father and dresses like a priest, yet he is married with kids, I guess the writer didn't research religion either. The aliens are such a small part of this brutal story that they aren't worth mentioning, except the way they are defeated is very easy. Although CNN couldn't figure it out even after they had been defeated all over the world. If this were written by anyone other than the writer of the Sixth Sense it would be dismissed as a hackneyed thrown together redone story.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great suspense marred by preachy overtones and awful finale,"Shyamalan please don't preach at me! - That's one of the first things that I think of when I reflect on `Signs'. I hate preachy movies.`Signs' is a good flick. In the year of 2002 when a good flick is virtually non existent, it was a nice and welcoming relief. It's the story of an ex-preacher, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lives out in the cornfields with his son and daughter, grieving over his dead wife. Suddenly crop circles begin to appear in his corn and strange goings on happen. It's a `sign' of stuff happening. But what is happening? What are the crop circles appearing everywhere indicating? Is it some other worldly force? And can Hess pull himself out of his despair and fight them? Hmmm.. Well - can he?!Acting here is all solid. Gibson isn't called to stretch himself - look angry here, look sad there, shoulder a burden of grief, question his faith, and so on. He's still well cast in his role though and never really lets the side down. The two kids are quite good. One is the Cute Girl #3 act going for, but we can expect that. It's Hollywood. Rory Culkin, as the young son Morgan, is actually one of the best surprises of the movie. He has a remarkable maturity to his acting, and is very believable as a quiet, introverted son. Hope he gets more work for himself, unlike his brother. Speaking of brothers, Joaquin Pheonix plays Gibson's brother, Merrill. He's there to provide the more light-hearted elements later on, but also as a foil to Gibson's taciturn nature. Pheonix is good, but not remarkable, failing to get into the role the way he could in, for example, `Gladiator'.Script wise? Well there's not much of one. It's `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' meets `Night of the Living Dead'. There is some ham fisted dialogue, principally when Shyamalan (writer and director here) gets all preachy and tries to teach us A Big Lesson. It's mostly when Gibson starts moralising and pondering aloud in the tired old `why me? Why this?' routine. The moments aren't quite too far and few between to be erased from my memory and it does detract from the enjoyment at time. I can watch a movie without being talked down to. Oh and that little bit with Pheonix's character? Too heavily fore-shadowed and sign posted. Subtlety is lacking in this script.That subtlety is lacking in the script is strange because it's certainly not lacking in the directing. It's what makes `Signs' move from an average movie to a sharp little thriller. Shyamalan uses a nice slow build up, that's ever increasing the paranoia and the tension. Wisely he eschews ever taking the camera much further than the farm land, creating a sense of isolation to the viewer. The jumps are not obviously sign posted, and dramatical music cues are minimalist to score maximum effect. The camera work is tight and focused, building up the eerie tension, and the lighting is spot on, with just the right level of creeping darkness. The sound work - sharp, crisp - is also very good. I don't think I've ever jumped so much at a cinema screening and it's a credit to the movie that it made me do that. It's only let down at the end with the weak ending and incredulous plot device. Still fair dues to Shyamalan for using his director's chair well.`Signs' is one of the best movies of 2002. Now that's not saying a whole lot as there's been little good (I'm pinning all my hopes on `The Two Towers') but this is certainly a movie worth seeing with the lights turned down. It can't be a classic due to some hammy writing on Shayamalan's part, and its obvious roots, but it's a  very effective little thriller (in the scare sense) and worth your time. 8.0/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
It's time for your close-up Mr. Gibson,"Greetings again from the darkness.  OK can we hold off for awhile with the ""genius"" label for M. Night Shyamalan?  Is he talented?  Definitely.  Can he put together a beautifully made film?  Definitely.  Is he the most creative story teller of our time?  Hardly.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a very well crafted, twisted, almost mystical film.  The surprise of ""Unbreakable"" was obvious from the first half hour, but still enjoyable.  ""Signs"" brings us another well told story, only this one appears to be a rejected X-Files script - very simplistic.  A couple of nice scares thrown in for fun, but overall this one is a bit boring.  Could Mel have underplayed his character anymore?  Two awfully cute kids help cover-up the straight forward story.  I would also encourage Mr. Shayamalan to not succumb to the Clint Eastwood school of becoming the star in your own movie - it is a distraction and direction will suffer.  If you wish to act, go act in someone else's movie. It is a big jump from cameos to critical roles.  Another outstanding score from James Newton Howard - our best film scorer working today (including John Williams and the caught-in-a-rut Danny Elfman).  Mr. Shayamalan, you are obviously a movie fan who gets paid to make movies.  This is a life many of us only dream of.  We are depending upon you bring something new to the screen every time.  You are set financially - don't let that stagnate you creatively.  The next one is important.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not M. Night Shyamalan's finest, but good.","On the surface, Signs is an alien movie where the human race comes to contact with a foreign life form. Signs might have had a rather large budget, but it doesn't make it a big Hollywood spectacle. This means that there isn't a lot of scenes with the aliens nor does the scenery change much from the farmhouse that the family of Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess lives in. This is intentional.The reason for this is simple: Signs is really about family, faith and coincidence. It is clear that M. Night Shyamalan is a man of vision and good taste. As scenes with aliens are scarce, every glimpse of the invaders has a bigger impact. Signs isn't about cheap shots with well placed stingers or visual horror, but relies on its haunting atmosphere that is created by the uncertainty regarding the aliens. Not until the very end does the viewer begin to learn the first things about the invaders. For me, this worked very well and kept me interested throughout the film. However, some viewers will find Signs boring for this very reason.If the film hadn't been directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I doubt that Sign's would have turned out as good as it did. As the film contains a few dramatic scenes, it comes very close to being corny or cheesy, but Shyamalan manages to pull it off.So why only 7 points? Well, to tell you the truth I can't think of a reason why I didn't like it more. Sixth Sense totally blew me away, so expectations were naturally high on this one. 7 points is definitely not bad and there certainly isn't anything wrong with the film. Signs is just one of those movies that are ""OK"" and you can't really explain it. I found a lot of good in it, but maybe that just wasn't good enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent film,"This is a great movie. Mr. Phoenix performance was outstanding. Mel Gibson did a fine job as a the over protective figure and proves he still had it going. M Night Shamalym did a great job with his suspense, foreshadowing and mysterious delivery. It was a nice touch how the water is what is the antidote to destroy the alien invaders. Very metaphoric I suppose. Also the film delivers in its hero portrayal. I especially liked how they came together as a family to try and stop how the aliens were taking over the society at large. They banded together worked hard and were able to defeat the enemy. Very patriotic story indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Intense, but not quite as atmospheric and thrilling as Shyamalan's other works.","SignsGraham Hess is a former priest, who has lost all his faith in god when his wife died. Now he is living with his 2 children and his brother, they're living outside a small town running a farm. One day ""Signs"" starts to appear in their crop fields, at first they think it's made my local people playing a joke on the, but as they watch the television similar ""Signs"" starts to appear all the world. While this is going on Graham Hess is continues to struggle with the death of his wife and her last words ""Tell Merril to swing"" and ""Tell Graham to see"".I am a keen admirer of Shyamalan's amazing talent to build up an intense atmosphere in his movies, especially ""The Sixth Sense"" gives a fantastic view into his perfectionistic feeling for movies. And while this movie is still an admirable effort, it has more flaws than the other Shyamalan movies i have viewed, it's not nearly as thrilling and the awaited twist is a bit sloopy, but the movie is still very intense most of the way. And it does have a lot of Shyamalan's trademarks, i just think that the story itself is not nearly as engaging and interesting as the others, i think Shyamalans twist is also more predictable and expected than in his other movies, there are simply revealed too much for it to really shock. You see some of it coming most of the way, but there are still some things in the end that does indeed make other things in the movie make more sense, but it's nowhere near as powerful and outstanding done as in his earlier movies, but this is still a highly original movie that brings what one expects.I am sure that this is also one of the movies that will divide the general public opinion, the movie can really be understood two ways. Are they all living in some sort of dream? Or is the movie about faith in god and the fact that everything one way or the other, does indeed happen for a reason. I believe in the 2nd. My primary reason for this is that the movie just doesn't make sense if you understand it as a dream, too many things are revealed and too many things wouldn't make sense. If there were only 4 characters in the movie it would make sense, but there are many more, and it would all be too realistic for it all to be a dream. However the 2nd thing is what seems more real, and also what makes most sense, and i have a strong confidence that it is what Shyamalan wanted to say with this movie. ""Never lose faith, everything does happen for a reason"".The directing is definitely strong here, i think Shyamalan have once again proven that he is one of the most talented and interesting new directors, and i do look forward to seeing his new project as i find his style very engaging and interesting. Also i think he has his own style which is good, you can feel that its Shyamalan that have made the movie, and the original feeling he brings adds up for a good experience in watching his movies, he is really good at creating an intense atmosphere in the movie itself, even if it doesn't work out as well here as it have done in his other movies. But who can blame him, Sixth Sense was almost a definition of a perfect thriller.Another thing i have admired Shyamalan for earlier is his apparent skill to make child actors seem so reliable and realistic in their way, a place where many fails because children naturally aren't very experienced and generally also more immature and nervous, but this is the 3rd movie in a row where Shyamalan makes all of his cast play some very convincing roles and there is hardly ever a flaw here. Especially Joaquin Phoneis is fantastic, and i will always have the image of him with the helmet on burnt inside my eyes.To sum it all up a bit, i am as said a big admirer and fan of Shyamalans special style, for me he is one of the best directors i have seen since Carpenters early days in building up an intense atmosphere, and even though this movie doesn't come close to the perfection of The Sixth Sense, it's still a solid and thrilling movie that will surprise you, even if you think you have the ending predicted.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good creepy film,"I have been a horror film fan for 30 years. While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life. I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the ""system"", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film; I genuinely disagree. If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre. I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room whose source he won't reveal . This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures. And those pictures can be the most frightening of all. Stay the course Shyamalan.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a bit heavy on the religious...,"M. Night Shyamalan has again delivered a very watchable movie.  The actors performances were well done.  What did bother me was the bold assertion that superstitious people (IE: people who believe in miracles) are better prepared to handle adversity than rational people.  The movie is a good, old-fashioned, return to the horror movies of the fifties, portraying off-world aliens as monsters.  And the movie is fun on that level.  I just did not appreciate the heavy-handed religious message.  I get enough of that in the newspaper and on the radio every day.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Starts out great but ends up really bad!,"Really I had high hopes for this movie, and it was so good for the first hour or so. It was real Hitchcock movie, but then the director shows you the object of terror. You actually see it walking down the street and close up in a house. And then the movie fell from a perfect 10 to a horrible 1! It lost all credibility and I was laughing through the last part of the movie. This is a shame because the director really has caught this ""there is something out there vibe"" it was really intense.

"Great Movie, Christawful Finish","This film has been wrongfully promoted as being a full-blown alien invasion movie.  The actual invasion turns out to be a lot less prominent than you expect.  The film focuses, instead, on the family of Father Graham Hess (Gibson), a priest who leaves the church after the death of his wife.  It also has a strong message about faith, which some might find too preachy. Another part which goes uncommented on is the light-hearted comedy that is on display (`I am insane with anger!', `It was very dark.').  Perhaps disappointingly, the aliens end up being a mere vehicle for the true meat of the film; the emotional responses of the characters to the deadly situation they are put in.  Nonetheless, suspense is masterfully built up throughout the film, with excellent usage of light and particularly sound.  I can't say much more without spoiling the plot.  However, I will say that the conclusion is extremely disappointing, and ends what was a very good, suspenseful production on a slightly low key.  Also, you may soil yourself at the scary parts, or just laugh, depending on your disposition.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A laid back Independence Day,"There were SIGNS that this was going to be good. Shyamalan's last few films (especially Unbreakable) were SIGNS that this would be good.

A SIGN that I was actually going to see it was when I was buying my ticket in the cinema lobby.After it started, I began to notice some SIGNS that it wasn't that good. The first half of the movie is pretty slow. Then the aliens start to appear (first rule of filmmaking, don't show the alien!!!!), which was a SIGN that it was pretty bad. The ridiculous denoument was another SIGN of a not very well thought out film. Perhaps I'm seeing too many SIGNS, but that appears to be common with respect to this movie.I do have to say that everyone acted well (the kids were terrific, and I don't think that often), the direction was slick (but possibly a little too laid back), but it was all let down by a very poor story.

Why can't they make more movies like this?,"Date: 13 April-Re-watched-After re-watching 'Signs' I still firmly believe it's one of the greatest movies ever. Ever since my parents first showed me this movie last October, I've been in love with. The entire cast is spectacular and the storyline was amazing. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances, after 'Braveheart' of course, as Graham Hess, a washed up reverend who tries to stay calm during unusual events. Joaquin Phoenix plays the hilarious yet trying to be serious brother Merrill. It's really hard to believe Phoenix did this movie almost right after 'Gladiator' since the characters are the exact opposite. Then there are the kids, Morgan and Bo, who give us extra humor and seriousness. The movie is amazing and I really wish I was part of that family. Awesome movie. Watch it!

"Quite simply perfect, a tale of faith regained beautifully told","I have seen this film many times and I feel it is that rare thing: A perfect film. Shyamalan manages to combine the touching story of a good man's lost faith with a gripping and atmospheric tale of alien invasion. I have been exasperated by it's critics who seemed to have missed the point completely and pick holes in this movie. For me from the very first scene to the last the direction is sublime. Every shot, camera angle and scene works, and it's a delight to marvel at the work of such a great director, whilst enjoying the story build and grip you. The cast is excellent, Mel portrays his character with depth and honesty, Joaquin is intense and mesmerising, the children are a delight, and every one of the side characters are memorable, another ""sign"" of a great director. James Newton Howard's music enhances the movie utterly, with the basic melody building along with the story to a crescendo, building our tension and emotions to their peak. There are some truly beautiful scenes in this movie and the story is ultimately a human one, the ""Signs"" are many and profound and they lead us beautifully to the film's conclusion.

"Mediocre science fiction movie, good suspense movie, great family drama","You've seen the previews so you know the setup: Mel Gibson defends his family farm from the occupying British soldiers. No wait, that was The Patriot. Aliens -- it's aliens this time.That's part of the movie's point -- it's not really *about* an alien invasion. ""The aliens were a Macguffin,"" my wife pronounced as we left the theater. Like he did in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, MNS uses the supernatural as an occasion to examine the human condition.One of the early shots in the farmhouse shows a blank spot on the wall where a crucifix once was. Hess (Gibson's character) is an ex-minister who has suffered tragedy in his family and turned his back on God. The appearance of crop circles in his backyard, the signs of the coming alien invasion -- they're occasions for Hess to ask himself, ""does everything happen for a reason?"" Anyone who's had someone close to them die has asked the same question. They've probably also had people tell them that everything, including death, does happen for a reason. That gives some people comfort, and makes other people angry. Hess is angry at God. (""I hate you!"" he yells at one point when another family member's life is threatened, and it's clear Whom he's addressing). While the Test of Faith movie has been made many times, Signs is about Hess's Test of Faithlessness.(Incidentally, we saw this right after renting ""Serendipity"", which asks the same question in romantic-comedy mode. Coincidence? I don't think so....)The acting, by the way, is great. There are a couple of moments where Gibson breaks out of the strong-silent-suffering mask -- one where he confronts MNS's character, another at a family dinner  -- that are really powerful. Cherry Jones deserves a Two Minute Oscar for her role as the local cop. And the kids are really quite good. (Abigail Breslin as the daughter reminded me of Drew Barrymore in ET and Heather O'Rourke in Poltergeist.)Don't go into this movie expecting Independence Day. Or even expecting The Sixth Sense. (Everyone seems to expect that all of MNS's movies will now have a Big Twist at the end). It's a mediocre science fiction movie, a good suspense movie, and a great family drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie lacks a message (it could have had an interesting one considering the priest and alien life) But nothing happens that makes me wonder about these aliens and why they have come to this world and hang around in cornfields.It's as dull as a Mc Donalds hamburger, no particular taste so it appeals to more people.

"Um, The Emperor Has No Clothes","Every time I see one of M. Night's films, I find myself admiring the technical aspects -- the framing, the attention to detail, the deliberate pacing -- more than I admire the end result.In other words, he succeeds as a technician, but really fails to entertain. This one is no exception.  I WANT to like this movie, but despite some genuinely creepy moments, I could not.  He and Spielberg suffer from a similar problem -- both are spoiled rich kids who never grew up.  This is reflected in their work, by the complete lack of maturity and true depth. They both have a very adolescent view of adulthood and the world, not the adult view of adulthood and the world.  Spielberg is finally maturing a bit, but Manoj has some growing up to do.  Admittedly, I still like his work better than most of the Hollywood crap out today, and he shows some promise. That is what makes it even more frustrating -- promise that has not yet been fulfilled.  If Hollywood had more like him, and fewer hacks like Michael Bay and his ilk, then I would be a little more hopeful about the future of American film, but not much.Check it out, enjoy it (or not, you brainless MTV types), and understand that movies don't have to be fast paced to be entertaining, but that this one could have been much better with some more time spent on the script.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Signs is the ultimate movie,"This film is one of my all time favorites.First off, I think it deserves more credit then what people have been giving it. Its called willingly suspending your disbelief. The elements in this film are Shyamalan's, which he imaginatively wrote and put together as he saw fit. So forget what most sci-fi resources would say in terms of what would be more likely to happen if aliens made contact with humans.Most of the entire story and events are revolved around the Hess family on their country property. The television and radio are the only things that even remotely show what is happening to other places around the world. This is extremely effective. It allows the audience to be more engaged and attached to the Hess family.The acting is phenomenal, absolutely pristine. This is my favorite Mel Gibson movie. His performance as a beloved father struggling to cope with the loss of his wife with abandoned faith is outstanding. The dinner scene and the ending is where he really works his magic.Joaguin Phoenix is a perfect addition to the cast, as a charming, yet still caring younger brother living with Mel Gibson.You couldn't ask for better child acting from Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin as the kids of Mel Gibson's character (Graham) The film is surprisingly funny. Quite frequently there are golden touches of humour in the first 3/4 of the movie.It is perfectly suspenseful. Not showing the audience everything at once, but little bits at a time is the perfect trick. Then when the ending comes around, Bam! ""Oh jeez this is intense!"" And lastly, it is tear-your-heart-out emotional. Deep down it is quite a sad story, as this family is struggling to survive, and Mel Gibson is barely holding his family together from everything that is being thrown his way. His battle with faith and God is one of the key elements, and I think it is spectacular how this conflict is finally resolved at the end.Amazing movie, perfect in every way. It is funny, suspenseful, emotional (I will admit to tearing up every time) The acting, the story, just everything is top notch. I recommend this to everyone.

"The Worst Movie of the Year, and one of the biggest Clunkers of All Time","I normally don't post reviews of movies I hate, but when so many people seemed to have loved this film and fallen victim to Shyamalan's shyster film making tactics, I feel I need to voice my opinion.Yes, I understand that this was in actuality a film about faith and family. I also understand that the ""crop circle/alien"" aspect of the film was simply a tool to simultaneously get people in the seats and test the faith of the story's characters.  But does that mean that all of the gaping plot holes involving the aliens (which I will not list here because so many other posts already have pointed them out) should be forgiven?  Of course not. Regardless of the director's motives regarding the aliens, this is still bad movie making.  There are also many plot holes involving the family (which have also been listed ad nauseum).Plot holes aside, it's still just a flat out lousy movie.  Shyamalan takes himself and his stories way too seriously.  He thinks way too highly of himself.  He wants to be the greatest director of this generation, a hybrid master somewhere between Spielbergian sentimentality and Hitchcockian thrills.  He also seems to be repeating himself already with his past three films in trying to perfect a new genre--the tear-jerk thriller.  I think Shyamalan is capable of making good movies.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose. He can also make interesting films.  ""Unbreakable"" was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour.  ""Signs"" could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors.  Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned.  Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral).  ""Sixth Sense"" had a good and appropriate twist. ""Unbreakable"" had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and ""Signs"" has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all.  In fact, this really wasn't a movie at all.  This movie was neither scary nor touching, nor well made nor well intentioned.

The message behind the story in a parable is much more important and focused on than whether the story is realistic. Many people choose to look at this movie and compare what happens to the way they view reality.

Shyamalan is the creator and thus does not need to finish his movies. they are not about what they say they are about , anyway. they are about something else. they will tell you what they are about at the end, and then they aren't even about that. they are about whatever makes us as humans like them, and like them we shall , for we are proud to be sheep in the herd of the master. thank you, M. Night Shyamalan, for showing us all that nothing makes sense but you.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rotten movie - should be skipped!,"This makes my list of worst movies of all time.  Viewers comments here who gave it thumbs up, must simply be too young to have seen some of the greatest of all horror films, e.g., Dracula with Bela Lugosi, the original Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and many others that truly draw you into the film, making you feel you genuinely involved and hence a really scary experience. ""Signs"" was simply stupid, totally failed to create a ""suspension of disbelief"", and on the contrary made you skeptical of most of what you were seeing.  The veterinarian (played by Shymalan himself) is sitting in his SUV, appears to have been shot in the belly, yet carries on a calm conversation with Mel Gibson, formerly the Reverend Hess, makes it clear he is driving to the lake (for self-preservation or for suicide?), yet the good Reverend says not a word to dissaude him, nor do we learn if he was shot, or injured in some other way, how, and by whom (aliens?).  Perhaps the film did explain it, but I might have fallen asleep.Some gave the actors raves.  Mel Gibson of course is a professional.  The sweet little girl could rarely be understood, maybe one word in ten - yes I got the ""I want a glass of water"" line, but missed what her problem with the water was, and why only she could detect it.  Probably dozed off again. Lost interest just about from the opening scene,  would have walked out, but wanted very much to see what explanation the script would come up with for crop circles.  These are a REAL phenomenon and have been the subject of attention by numerous respected scientists including physicists, agricultural experts, etc.  No explanation has been found in the real world, and none at all is offered by the film.  One of its great disapppointments. Clearly formed by aliens from space, but how or why or what they are supposed to indicate is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer (which is where I was before I entered the theater).I add my agreement to those who said the signs they were looking for were the red one saying EXIT, or the one saying ""Refunds Available at the Box Office"".

"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jump","For the people confused about the ""priest"" having a family, he was an Episcopal priest.I have to say, I didn't find the ending to be a surprise twist, and I would have preferred the menace not to be seen in close-up, but the rest of the film really worked for me. Yes, it had shades of ""Blair Witch,"" but so what. What other movie has used silence and darkness to such effect? No, you don't see Mel or Joaquin tilling the land. So what? I laughed, I cried, sometimes in the same instant, and I definitely jumped in my seat a few times.I wasn't totally sure about the meaning behind Mel's telling his children about their mother at their births, or if it was just his way of reconnecting with them.M. Night's role in the film didn't seem self-indulgent to me. If I made a film, I'd want to be in it, too. No, he didn't make eye contact with Mel's character, and yes, he was a little monotone; he was totally freaked out.True, the ending sort of just ended, and I was hoping for more ""twist,"" but I think that was just my expectations. I had the ending figured out early on and would have enjoyed it more had I not been trying so hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unbelievably far-fetched ""drama"" - Gibson's worst!","Using the long exposed crop circles hoax as a back drop, this story offers signs of alien visitors simultaneously terrorising various parts of the world. Focusing on unusual (if not completely incredible) circumstances of one family, we learn of a chain of events culminating in the acceptance of ""everything happens for a reason"". Aside from the extremely slow movement (several scenes are needlessly drawn out, as though to ""stretch"" the plot) and the shoe string budget (Mel Gibson is the only major expenditure, as all 6 or 7 others appearing are unknowns), the ""coincidences"" presented are just a bit much to swallow. Each of at least 5 major story elements have odds of 10,000 to 1. Add them up, and every family member should have been struck by lightning AND won the State lottery! The ""aliens"" are less imaginative than anything ever shown on Star Trek. A skinny person in a green rubber suit, that's how far 21st century sci-fi has come? Embarrassing!The unsatisfactory conclusion leaves only one though: Was this film necessary? What a waste of everyone's time. Do yourselves a favor and find something better to do with an hour and a half of life. Mel Gibson has definitely picked the wrong script this time.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A downward spiral for Shyamalan,"Night's movies have gone from excellent (6th Sense), to mediocre (Unbreakable), to this. This was by far the SLOWEST most incomplete film i've ever seen. If u're going to have an ""alien invasion"" film, then have it. If u're going to have a ""spiritual enlightenment and restoration-of-faith"" film, then have that. What you DON'T do *film students take note* is p****foot around those two genres, bounce them off each other (2 themes that have NOTHING in common, by the way), never really come to full terms with either one, and leave an incoherent mess in your wake.Night's gotta do better, or he'll need to go back to Now You're Unemployed Film School...",,Anonymous,Mystery
Scaaaary,"Let me say i have seen a lot of ""horror"" ""thriller"" or otherwise shocking movies, but i never found myself grabbing my seat like that.Just very few movie scenes really gave me the creeps. Let me list them:""The Cell"": First meeting with the boy in the desert - ""Lord of the Rings"": Galadriel's trial on the ring - Some Stephen King short story movie which i can't remember its title: A monster crushing an airplane's turbineAnd ""Signs"" has loads of scenes that really gave me the creeps. More than once i found myself grabbing the seat or jumping off it.The most shocking parts were not things you see but rather things hinted by shadows, noises and movement from the corner of the eye.For sure one of the best movies in 2002.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best of Shamyalan,"This is one of those films that you never forget. The creep factor is just right... until the end, but that is somewhat inevitable. I believe that the best horror has to touch something deeper in us rather than just providing cheap thrills, and ""Signs"" does that nearly to perfection. We grow to love these characters and to sympathize with them. Child actors are always tough, but these kids put in nuanced and believable performances. It's also a film with a deeper message, that nothing is ever by chance and everything in our lives, even the smallest quirks, has a purpose. That's probably why some people don't like it. They prefer that their horror doesn't have an uplifting ending.
Sadly, I don't think Shamyalan ever made anything better. His recent films disappointed me because I keep hoping for another ""Signs.""",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A dodgy plot and too many hollywoodisms weaken the movie,"As soon as you've seen the first 30 minutes of this film, you know how it's going to end. There are several annoying things about the plot of this film, which can be attributed to either laziness or to make it as sellable as possible. One example is when the policewoman automatically attributes the crop circles that have been appearing to extra-terrestrial life. Hoaxers, or any other reason, are quickly dispelled, dispute them being the most likely cause. The plot is unlikely, the writing is lazy, most of the acting is more wooden than a post and there are too many coincidences which are too easily explained away just to propel the movie along. The final nail in the coffin was the design of the alien itself-It's nothing more than a man in a cheap Halloween costume!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece!,"Signs is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, and it stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix in a science fiction thriller about a family that sees a bunch of crop circles in their cornfield, and that there's a creature of some kind that lurks around their house, making them slowly realize that they are not alone.When an M. Night Shyamalan film works, it really works: Signs is a pure example of it. Previously I talked about ""The Guest"" and it's crazy rating. The same thing happened with Signs again. I am honestly shocked by the 6.7 rating. I gave this movie 8.5 as more of a statement, anything less than an 8 is criminal. I have absolutely no idea about why it is highly underappreciated and misunderstood by critics and audiences. I've only seen the film twice, and I can say that Signs is one of the most suspenseful, well written, and well-acted alien movies ever made. This film has everything, even better, in terms of what I'd ever wanted in a movie. This film has suspense, intensity, emotions, great acting, and the message on fate all in one.The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's response to the emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, moderately anxious, and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide or pack up and go as far away from the trouble as they could go.This movie is the reason why I like this director. M. Night Shyamalan is just best when it comes to depth and details in a film. His ability to create so much chilling, hair-raising tension is monumental. He can create tension from the simplest of scenes and creates characters that you truly care about. The movie has a great set up with sounds and visuals which makes it quite mysterious, leaving me on edge throughout the whole movie. It's a misfortune that he isn't making movies like this anymore nowadays.Signs is M. Night's BEST film (yes, even better than ""The Sixth Sense"" for me). I'm glad M. Night Shyamalan went for a more minimalistic approach to an alien film, instead of having overblown CGI explosions and chases (not that I don't have any problem with that, but it's nice to see something different). If you think, that this will be another one of those alien movies, you'd be very mistaken and also, it's not an alien movie just for sci-fi fans, it's a high-stakes drama for anyone. It's a fascinating personal story being told, while the world around them has changed in a heartbeat and challenges them to face their fears and regrets. I think Signs was one of the few sci-fi thrillers I've seen that makes me terrified because of its realism when I think of it.PS: Highly Recommended!

Signs (2002),This is a great movie. Not as scary as I first expected but still a great movie. This movie has great actors and amazing camera shots. The movie will keep you on your toes and saving your breath to the last minute. A fantastic film to watch!! If you are a Joaquin Phoenix fan it will make you an even more of a fan. I think this because I was not a big fan of his in till I saw the movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Signs are all bad,"YechI've seen complaints that Signs is bad because it is a bait-and-switch, the trailers and previews and ads selling one movie only to learn that it's another.  True.I've seen complaints that this turkey has all the pacing of Unbreakable on Valium.  True.  Very, very true.I've seen complaints that Signs is selling a particularly stupid religious message.  Hoo boy, is THAT true.Add to that list the fact that Signs also has a movie atheist delivering a slur on all nonbelievers and you've got a good example of what happens when people keep telling a film maker how talented he is.  In case you have no idea what a 'movie atheist' is, it's a bigoted stereotype that's all too common in movies and television - a character, usually a devout believer of one sort or another - who suffers a loss or trauma, usually the death of a spouse or child, and who then declares that they no longer believe because they hate God.  The point of the stereotype is to allow the audience to knowingly smile at the foolishness of hating something you supposedly don't believe in.  The foolishness is that such a straw man character is so common.So we have the nonbeliever's version of a steppinfetchit character as the protagonist of Signs and early in the movie he announces that people in the world shake out into two categories - those who believe and so have hope and those who don't and so live in fear and hopelessness.  Imagine my surprise that a character who supposedly represents my point of view announces that I am of a group that is inherently fearful and hopeless.Things like that make a movie a little hard to take.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful to see this kind of movie again,This movie is done in a truly wonderful style. If you like Hitchcock's or those kind of films this is for you.

One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This movie was such a delusion for me. After ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" I expected something good from Shyamalan, but this picture is booooring, without any original idea, no surprises, and it has a very bad script. I feel lucky that I didn't go to see in cinema when it came out.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Subtlety: Don't expect an  over-exaggerated special-effects feast..,"This is a film (much like Shyamalan's other films)that requires a viewers full focus, and heightened sense of awareness. Other movies of this genre tend to go too far over the top with the ""creep factor"" in the place of a good storyline. Because there was no dead girl slithering out of a well and ""the creatures"" fail to tear the Hess family limb from bloody limb. The concept of this movie can easily be lost on those of a..shall we say...simple minded nature.Shayamalan's characters (Gibson and Phoenix, mainly) each have their own separate issues coming into this story. Creating ""sub-plots"" here and there that cause the viewer shift his/her focus away from the aliens, to the human characters. Thus, enhancing the element of surprise when, such creatures, make an appearance. The fact that as a viewer, you are not bombarded with special effects, or CGI creatures at every turn, creates frightening circumstances, and causes the viewer to constantly expect something (anything) to happen at any given moment. The way Shyamalan limits the viewer's sightings of the ""beings"" is cause for praise.In the every last scene of this movie, everything, every element, every piece of dialogue fits together like a complete jigsaw puzzle. Even things that appear to be most insignificant suddenly have this profound meaning. A fact which is no cause for surprise given the writer. However for those who fail to see this fact should either re-watch this film, or watch something ""a little deeper""...hmm, perhaps ""Saw I&II"" should do the trick.No other film out there has ever evoked the feeling of shear terror in the pit of the stomach of the viewer on the level in which Signs does.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
