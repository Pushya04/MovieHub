"Heads Edward Wins, Tails You're Jacob...","There's an army, at least ten, being gathered in a pen, to wage war against the Cullens, though it's mainly full of dullens, as Victoria plots falls, of the vamps and animals, Isabella gets quite cold, and the arguments unfold, it's a pretty poor part three, piling up lots of debris, little method to the madness, there are plains that have less flatness.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It doesn't have enough bite!!,"It's been billed as the biggest film of the year and perhaps it will be, but it has some stiff competition from the likes of Harry Potter coming this winter, so let's see if Eclipse really deserves that prestigious title.The vampire and werewolf love saga has been bitterly disappointing so far with a dull first instalment and a hideously depressing second. Add to this some excruciatingly painful running times of over two hours and you have death by celluloid.But perhaps I'm being a little unfair; this third instalment has been based on perhaps the most exciting book of the four in the series so it already has a good starting point and some convincing performances from the actors really do make this film a huge leap ahead of what preceded it.The storyline to this film is pretty much non-existent but director David Slade does a good job of turning zilch into another depressing, but well made two hour love fest. Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen), Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Taylor Lautner (Jacob) return as the three main leads and their love triangle becomes even more confusing this time around, with frowning faces and awkward kisses galore. Add to this an army of newborn vampires ready to rip the very flesh of Bella Swan's bones and it's getting pretty tense down in Forks.Sadly, even with a whole army of vampires and werewolves fighting in the finale, this small increase in action doesn't take away from the fact that the film drags in more than one place with blocks of dialogue that feel as if they're going to last a lifetime. It's unfortunate as the action pieces look excellent and the CGI, especially in the werewolves has improved leaps and bounds between New Moon and Eclipse. This shamefully vain dialogue with unnecessary close-ups of Robert Pattinson's face, Kristen Stewart's eyelashes and Taylor Lautner's chest are surely there just to appeal to the female fans and do nothing to progress the story.It is these main three characters that hinder the film; their stilted dialogue and mediocre acting overshadow the rest of the cast who are all superb. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard playing red head vampire Victoria is seriously underused along with the whole Cullen flock who are not given enough room to breathe between the heavy central dialogue. Their acting is fantastic, why not use them more? Thankfully, it isn't all tears before bedtime with some well-timed comic humour from Bella's dad, Charlie. Played by Billy Burke, he is the only character of the used variety that leaps off the screen and he does so well, playing to his strengths as an actor.Overall, Eclipse moves the game on but only very slowly. David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces; but it still remains dull as ditch water because of bland performances from the lead cast and chunky dialogue. It's bound to please fans but biggest film of the year? I think we'll be seeing a certain boy wizard holding that honour for 2010.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipse,"Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""I'm hotter than you"" - Eclipse to New Moon","Sweet lord almighty it did not disappoint. To me at least, this was easily the funniest film of the series so far, because while Bella and Edward in the first film was funny, and Bella and Jacob in the second was much less so, somehow all three of them together are absolute fireworks.Not because they suddenly have chemistry or anything, Bella is still dryer than the corpses of the whole Cullen family, Edward is still awkward and looks like he never wants to be there, and Jacob is now looking at a restraining order and a few years behind bars.And yet again nothing happens for the first half of it...and yet, these two things are it's greatest strengths. The first half of the film desperately trying to come up with any reason it can to make some people think Bella will ever get with Jacob is hysterical, and when all three of them are in a scene together, hoo boy. Some of the most glorious casting ever, methinks.Other than that, there is also some baffling directing and sound effects, the kind where you really have to wonder how it was even possible for something to be intentionally directed like that, the CGI is atrocious, the dialogue is as horrendous as ever, and basically, it's more Twilight. If that's what you want after the first two, then great.And believe me, I did want more, cause I am genuinely having a blast with these abominations. Bring on Breaking Dawn.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Complete movie was predictable ....and Kristen's acting sucks,"movie was full predictable, you can tell the end after 30 min of viewing. i watched it at night and literally i was about to sleep ... i was hoping to see some good vampire/werewolf vs. vampire fight in the end but all i got was max. 15 secs of crap (trailer almost have all the imp scenes).and most SUCKing thing in the movie was Kristen Stewart's acting, her face remain emotionless in the entire movie ... widening eyes and opening mouth cant make you a good actor.WATCH TRAILER INSTEAD OF MOVIE .... its free and you can have more fun because they have added all the thrilling action in trailer.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
love the book  but the movie stinks,im not a twihard fan im not a twilight hater either but i enjoyed the series and i thought the first and the second movies were OK but the third one really is awful the script was really bad the acting was bad the fight scenes were comical the score was so corny i wanted to cover my ears but the worst part was how they have changed the characters bella is not a selfish heartless bi#% edward is not a cry baby jacob is not whiny kid and charlie would not get a kick out of having sex talk with his daughter ....and fore the acting r.p and k.s are literally the worst actores ever r.p mumbles his lines without any interest and k.s is trying her best to look hot and about her facial expression....she does not have any she wrinkels her nose like someone has just passed gas around her and her mouth hanging open...... is that part of hottness?bella is supposed to be sweet and lovely k.s is lanky sour faced and to much make up does not make her look any better. the only one who gave a reasonable acting was t.l if only his lines weren't that cheesy...,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not awful but poorly acted and overlong,"Eclipse isn't excellent but neither terrible. This adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's book falls somewhere in the middle, between the 2008's Twilight and the emotional oasis of 2009's New Moon. The Twilight series is often too much melodramatic but gets usually to arouse amorous emotions and thrills. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg and new series director David Slade (Hard Candy) try to use the whole teenage material into a coherent shape, with decent results. The inconsistency comes from tone results that end up being even lethargic at a point, so the forth installment will really have to be different otherwise fans will start getting tired of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favorite of them all,"To my mind, this was the best one. Also realized how surprised and proud I was at this movie for having an actual plot. A real plot (more or less), where something happens! This was really astonishing to me after watching the Fifty Shades movies. I think it also contains the most scenes of Taylor Launter shirtless out of all the other ones, so if you're planning on watching for such purposes it is recommended to skip the two previous ones and jump straight into this.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm team Charlie,"I was dragged to this by my girlfriend and was thoroughly dreading it. I'd seen the first one and really didn't like it. I gave it ago, and really didn't like it. I haven't seen the second one but i was filled in on what i've missed. Eclipse wasn't very good. It was what i was expecting and to be honest i really did give this one a go since my girlfriend really wanted me to like it. I don't like the authors conception of Vampires and Werewolfs. Werewolfs are like in American Werewolf in London but in this its just really soppy and not scary. And vampires are like From Dusk till Dawn but once again in this are really soppy and tamed. They could of made the villain vampires a lot more fearsome. I'll give this film one thing though, it had some great action scenes! The big fight was thoroughly enjoyable and did make me say 'Yeah! Go Edward!' If you really enjoyed the series, then i recommend but if you just fancy seeing this film, don't have high expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Greatest motion picture since Caravaggio's ""Crucifixion of St Peter""","Oh god, Edward Cullen, you're so damn hot. Take my virginity, take it, take it now! But wait, no, I'm so conflicted.

I want to lose it with someone special, with someone I love. It's not like I can lose my virginity twice, Edward. It's not like my virginity can grow back. Unless....no.

"Predictable, without reading the books.","I read up to the first 4 chapters in the original Twilight book before I sat it down and decided it was trash. My sisters said otherwise and I have taken them to Twilight and New Moon at the midnight premiers, so I held to the tradition and brought them to Eclipse.Not having much faith in the movie as I had seen the first two and was not impressed at ALL, I got ready to take a nap. Instead after the first few boring scenes it kicked up (unlike in the other two) and we actually got more than 2 minutes of action.The acting was better, but Bella and Edward both returned to their comatose state on screen while Jacob and the wolf tribe keep the life in the movie. I have to hand it to Rathbone for another good performance and wondered why he couldn't have played Edward, instead of listening to the wooden voice of Pattinson.It had its good moments, ridiculous moments, points where the script sounded as if it were written for a nickelodeon kid's show, and scenes where you just want to scream at the characters. I would have liked to see Alice do more than just stand and have a premonition, and what happened with Esme? She was on screen for 10 seconds.It was enjoyable, to say the least and probably the best of the series (so far). But then again, that's not saying very much. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much Ado about Nothing,"So much ado in the world mass media about ""Eclipse""! And - much ado about nothing.""Summit Entertainment"", please call back either Catherine Hardwicke or at least Chris Weitz! The franchise is getting from bad to worse. You're in danger of losing millions of viewers for ""Breaking Dawn"" if the trend begun by David Slade continues! If you don't care about quality movies, care at least about your profits. ""Eclipse"" is a cheap hack-work whose only aim is to make some easy money. It won't work twice.David Slade has done the impossible - he managed to butcher the ""Eclipse"" novel altogether! Instead of the most dynamic book of the saga, which – though possessing no literary qualities of big literature - is at least a page-turner, he produced an incredibly cheesy hash-dish of disconnected episodes, none of which is charged and coherent enough for the viewer to evaluate its meaning for the plot and character development. The film has no magic of Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" which concentrated on the phenomenon of first love with all shades of emotion, its tenderness and blunders. The colour gamut of ""Twilight"", the dialogues, the motivation of the characters, the pacing varying from slow to lightning speed – everything was there to contribute to the magic. Chris Weitz, on the other hand, concentrated on the character of Jacob and on the film gathering momentum in the very end, when Bella goes to Italy. This break from the slow pacing of the time tedious for Bella to break-neck speed of the Italian part does the film credit. Though in comparison with ""Twilight"", Chris Weitz almost botches up Edward's character to save it at the last moment in the episode with the Volturi, both films have an atmosphere of their own. Not so the ""Eclipse"".Slade and Rosenberg seem to have been intensely hating the book while filming it. How otherwise could they have created this  this product (euphemism)? No coherent and consistent dialogue, no dialogue meaningful enough to give the actors at least SOME room for displaying their acting skills, no character motivation, no chemistry between the characters. The flashbacks with Rosalie and Jasper held some promise, but no, David Slade was very consistent in destroying their appeal, too. Both the stories lack some essential parts absolutely necessary for understanding the characters. On the whole, all the actors have to mumble through some nonsense lines which have to pass for dialogue. ALL of them seem to be there just because the franchise must plod on. Edward's repeated bleating about Bella marrying him obviously gets even on his own nerves. Action? Don't make my cat laugh. If this tiny part of vampires' training and a tiny fragment of real fighting lacking any gusto can be called action, then I'll eat my hat. I bet people expected much more than that bit of morning exercise, waving hands and raising legs. The only credits in this field go to Jasper and Emmett.Acting? Godawful. It seems the main characters are suffering from various diseases and need medication real quick.Edward is hanging about with the facial expression of one having chronic dyspepsia. It seems that each and every Bella's appearance on the set is nauseating for him and he's manly fighting this emotion to conceal it. Motilium and sickness medications, quick! It's not a progress in acting, but a step back. Edward was best in ""Twilight"", in ""New Moon"" it was slow deterioration, now it's a catastrophe. Edward must be changing, but - so? Edward seems to be turning into a willing slave of Bella and effacing himself completely. It's obvious that, on the one hand, the actor was left with no choices of his own and with not much of a role to play, on the other hand, he's tired of the franchise whatever he may be saying in public (and anyone would be tired of this film 'very DIFFERENT from the previous two'). By the way, we should do Mr. Pattinson credit, for he's honest – he said that he feared nobody would come to see the film. He has definitely seen the pre-release copy. Next time I'll be more attentive to the messages he sends.Bella. She's lost all the appeal of a young inexperienced girl caring for everybody, eager not to hurt, to bring together, a heart bleeding for everyone. Now we see an egoistic scheming wench not caring a fig about anybody, her only aim, as we learn in the end, was to sift through her motives and to make the RIGHT choice, and that's becoming a vampire, love is secondary here. Is she doing it for her shrink? Next time fetch your pocket calculator to draw up the balance, Bella. Bella's attempt to seduce Edward looks nauseating, so pre-planned it is. Where's love, where's sincerity, where's youthful impetuousness? Gone to the dogs. On the whole, judging by Bella's facial expression it's evident that the girl was dropped head down more than once in her infancy and now has difficulty comprehending what is being said around her. Acetazolamide may have helped, had it been taken earlier. Bella's also obviously a mouth-breather. Remove your adenoids, Bells. Before it's too late and you're too far gone.Jacob. No progress in comparison with ""New Moon"", too few and too bad lines given, too little screen time.Victoria. Rachelle Lefevre was voluptuous, lascivious, dangerous. Bryce Dallas Howard is emaciated, pitiful, heavily painted and timid. She can't touch Rachelle Lefevre. A very bad choice. The wig alone doesn't make the character. A bad mistake of ""Summit"".Was there ANYTHING good? My thumbs up to Jasper, Alice, Emmett, Carlisle, Charlie, Riley (though Riley's part could have been made more dramatic and consistent, but not with the current wonder script, alas). Oh, yes, the landscapes were impressive.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As a guy pseudo interested... I was EXTREMELY disappointed.,"I actually liked the 2nd one. I dunno maybe cuz it had motorcycles and werewolves.My girlfriend loved the books and even forced me to read them. I have to say they were... READABLE. and the movies I actually liked.Until this one. I was actually hoping it would be cool and that I would like it more then part 2...However, this was the most boring, clichéd... actually nooo... NOT cliché at all.. Just boring...Maybe I expect my vampires to be a bit more bad ass. But wtfLets just clothesline each other at 100 mph until someone goes down...The battles epicly failed... the love story was completely downplayed....and the overall plot was just... not there.Very very boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mildly entertaining Vampire Drama without Vampires,"This the third in the Twilight movie series I found strangely entertaining but it does not mean it is a good movie. It is ONLY a two hour movie (thank God!) but it was noticeable how many people made toilet trips 'during' the movie. It entertained me because I managed to stay awake for the whole two hours in expectation that something interesting would happen.If I recall from the second movie New Moon, didn't Edward promise to marry Bella at the end of the movie? This latest movie wastes too much time exploring the delinquent emotions of a confused teenage girl called Bella who cant make up her mind whether she wants to spend her life with a vampire called Edward or a werewolf called Jacob, we cant blame her Father for wanting to protect her (he is a police officer after all) and for her Mother wanting to keep a distance (far away in Florida the story would have us believe).The special effects of Jacob in particular as a werewolf is compelling if only for that but let us then remind ourself that this is not 'chronicles of narnia' or indeed 'incredible hulk' and I was particularly amused with the lack of clothing worn by all when they were all up at the top of a snow-capped mountain, gosh it must have been cold mustn't it? The Voltari offered the only real story to the movie and this was not exploited enough in the movie for an adult audience. An opportunity was missed. Clearly within the story there was 'a vampire outbreak' in Seattle and the Voltari were called upon to settle it - but of course the rivalry between the Vampires and the Werewolfs created a decision conflict with the Voltari which focused around Bella as a woman for revenge because Edward had killed the boyfriend of the 'red haired woman) in the first Twilight movie.This was just a movie for teenagers to 'woon and swoon' and not more. I concur that the young lady playing Bella and the guy playing Jacob have limited acting ability. I disagree with the negativity about Robert Pattinson whom I feel gave a genuine acting performance. He has definitely improved and you should compare his performance here with that in the delightful 'Remember Me' where the triangle with a mysterious woman and a father who is law enforcement is relative.Watch it at your peril! Mums and Dads, be prepared with your popcorn and soft drinks and don't miss the 'funny bits' like the snow scene which make this movie even remotely watchable as an adult. Kids, its 'comic entertainment' transferred to the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow. What a Ripoff. This movie is just plain bad. Bad. Bad.,"I wanted to try to like this movie, but it was so slow, and boring. My wife is a huge fan of this series and dragged me to see it. I wanted to give it a chance, but even she wanted her money back. She even said it was awful and was wildly disappointed.. And it was. I could barely watch the awful acting and even the teen girls who sat next to us and cheered the opening were half asleep and booing at the end. Everyone was lulled into a zombie sleep watching this trash. Bad script, bad acting, slow editing, bad music. All around 1 out of 10.Giving credit where it was do, some of the visual effects were watchable, although you could tell that the wolves were not real. The director of photography did a good job with the color and composition, but the acting was so bad it and the pacing was so slow that the pretty pictures were just covering the crap.Sorry fans, but you will be disappointed. It's time to stop going to these crap movies. If you like vampire dramas, I suggest True Blood.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga - Eclipse: It's All Love Triangles,"Keep it in mind when you're watching this, the main thing in this movie is all about the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob. So, that's already eaten much of the movie itself.First things first, ""Eclipse"" (in almost every scene) relates to the love triangle. Even the battle parts still have a connection between the love triangle. Everything (except scenes not in her perspective).""Eclipse"" is also a kind of slow movie because of too many dramatic scenes which were pretty boring. Even though they had a brutal killing villain, tension wasn't even there as drama overthrew it on the screen.There were some laughable moments too (and they were related to the love triangle). They were just not-so-funny moments but still can entertain you.Another thing you have to remember watching this movie is to remember that ""Eclipse"" has tons of kissing scenes (and they are so long e.g. 10 minutes). It was so boring. It's just like watching some person watering the plants while whistling. And, when I saw it, I feel like it's going to be a very boring film which deserves a one-star rating.The acting was bad. There were almost no emotions even for Bella. I say Robert Pattinson's acting on Edward was the worst of all. Bryce Dallas Howard on Victoria was not bad. Xavier Samuel on Riley was the best of all. But, the three main characters' acting were almost emotionless. Of the three leads, Taylor Lautner was the best.The action scenes were not satisfying. It was short and kind of brutal. Speaking of brutal, I say ""Eclipse"" has the deadliest, most brutal scenes in ""The Twilight Saga"".By the way, a contributing factor to this movie is that it has many flashbacks or memories of the characters that also skip the fighting parts of it. The flashbacks were too long that it made me sleepy when I watched it.I'm kind of shocked with the vampires in this movie. They look like crystals or something as there were scenes showing hands or heads decapitated and they look like shiny crystals.""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is another slow movie which always and always focuses on that love triangle. There were no really exciting moments in the movie and if they had shortened the kissing scenes, this film would have been shorter than two hours. I think this film just deserves a 5-star rating. But, believe it or not, it's currently the best Twilight film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was okay,"Bella (Stewart) has a decision to make and things become complicated with the emergence of new Vampires who want to destroy the Cullens.Well, here we are again. The last one in the Twilight Saga trilogy. Are we having fun yet? I suppose the answer to the question 'which way will Bella go' is uppermost on most inquiring minds.So that was one plot, the other was the new Vampires and their plans to defeat the Cullens.This was more like a soap opera (weren't they all?) and the only action this time we saw was the big battle in the open field between the New Vampires and the Cullens with help from the Wolves. The CGI was again terrific and the battle seemed very real. Hey, I cringed at times.This was somewhat hard keeping up with the story line in the beginning because of the great length of time between this movie and the last one and I had forgotten what some of the other characters were involved with. But, no matter as I just concentrated on the Bella decision and I knew a battle would be waged between the New Vamps and the Cullens. That is all you really need to know.There were some good lines in the beginning. Perhaps the best one was when in the Student Union the talk was about the upcoming graduation celebration. One girl said they should make it extremely good as ""how often do we graduate from High School?' The camera then pans to Edward, who has that wry knowing smile on his lips. And, the Valedictorian speech at the graduation ceremony was perhaps one of the best I have ever heard. Very good. Too long to recount here.This was okay and we now have closure. But, I cannot help thinking that every time I will see Robert Pattinson in future movies I will still think of him as a Vampire and will keep waiting for him to show off those Vampire powers. A long wait, I know. I have to get over it.As for Ms Stewart, I have seen her in other movies where she actually showed more than two facial expressions. I have to give her more credit in here than I have in the past. To do this one has to believe in Vampires and Werewolves. Her character believes so for her this is a very serious situation and there really isn't much to smile about when you have Vampires and Werewolves running loose. See? Maybe a part of the problem is that many in the audience don't understand her plight. See? Give her a break.All in all, this was okay. We are done with this now, aren't we?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best in the series, this is a darker, more complex and mature film BUT not for everyone and undoubtedly flawed","Twilight,Twilight,Twilight.. who would have guessed this story of vampires, werwolf's and teen love would become such a phenomenon. My theatre was packed with giggling girls sighing and gasping every time Jacob appeared topless, clapping at every kiss, every brooding glance between Edward and Bella. I for one am not one of the those girls, i don't buy into this whole twilight mania....i watch this series simply out of curiosity, I'm yet to be gripped, I'm yet to ""understand"" or really ""get it"" but Twilight does have a certain charm and this latest entry is closest I've gotten to ""getting it"". I was entertained, I was moved (in certain scenes) and i was thrilled.....certain times i was also bored, let down and cringing. It's a mixed bag with this one but overall i left impressed: it seems everyone stepped up their game.Im gonna start with The Actors simply because this is main aspect that for me was weak/sub-par in the first 2: The good news? Everyone has improved The bad news?: It's still often not enoughMain Leads: Kristen Stewart: I've never had any major issues with Stewarts performance it's more her character that annoys me. Here Stewart does a passable job, it's nothing we have not seen before from her and at times i felt she could have pushed herself further or even shown a bit more emotion...much like Pattison her performance is saved by actual, deep chemistry with her ""true-love"" Edward...at least it looks like she wants him.Robert Pattinson: For ONCE he was tolerable. He was less wooden and stiff, there were a few moments where Pattinson showed at least some emotion and believability. However his performance is still dull,wooden and devoid of any real intensity...A tolerable, so-so performance helped by strong chemistry with Stewart.Taylor Lautner: Of the three leads only Lautner has any kind of charm, he is the only one to seem natural and show any kind of emotional conflict. Saying that it's still not a ""good"" performance....Lautner hits the emotions well enough: desire,regret,anger,desperation but he never really goes for it, he never pushes himself to a level where i can say ""ok this kid is a good actor"". The best performance of the leads Lautner has acting potential for sure but at the moment its obvious his chest is taking centre stage.The best acting/performance: Hands down goes to Jackson Rathbone as ""Jasper"", he steals every scene he appears in, bringing an intensity which most of the other actors lack...for me he is one of those ""i cant look away"" actors..he dominates the screen. Xavier Samuel also deserves a mention as Riley....even though he is only a minor (yet vital) player i put him in the same bracket as Rathbone, there is something going on there that makes you want to keep watching.The positives: This film is darker, the tone is more menacing and the romance works better because of that. Because the film chooses to play down the romance somewhat and up the action and violence it makes for a more balanced, mature movie. The love triangle is actually pretty entertaining and at times dramatic and even intense. The cheesy,mushy horrible lines/dialogue of the Book are still there but less so than the previous films which is a massive blessing in my mind (i can only take so much cheese). Scenes with Jacob and Bella prove to be the most interesting and natural. There were some funny scenes, ill admit i did laugh...i left impressed that a twilight film could actually be funny in a good way. Some of the romance scenes really worked (Bella and Jacobs scene on the cliff top for example, moments during the ""proposal"" with Edward/Bella) Background on the rest of the Cullen family was maybe the highlight for me, very interestingThe negatives: The score was a big let down, usually the only really impressive thing about twilight is it's choice of music but here it just felt lazy. The usual CRINGE moments, Bella and Edward have some very cringe-Worthy romantic exchanges....i blame the book for this, the film cant help being faithful and it literally lifts these lines from the book's pages. During the ""action chase"" moments the director went over-bored with the shaky cam making it very hard to follow what was happening. The final battle could have been more epic and Bella's final scene with Jacob should have lasted longer. At times it dragged on and ill be honest 2 hours seemed to drag on and onThis film and indeed this series is not the epic, deep romance it claims or trys so hard to be, this is no ""titanic"" or ""gone with the wind"".....here is a film of pure entertainment and it is enjoyable...the love triangle is fun to watch, the romance is at times touching, the action is at times very thrilling. This is not a great film or even that good of a movie But its a great way to waste away a dull evening or a rainy day. Aside from the frustrating fact its PAINFULLY obvious Bella should be with the only half decent character in the film: Jacob....This is a flawed, forgettable yet enjoyable film...MUCH better than the previous two and a more improved film in nearly all aspects,I would say give it a chance you may like it...just don't expect anything great.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly worth watching!,"New moon; as we all know, was one hell of a let down. Eclipse is most certainly a turn for the better. The acting is better, and the plot was a better fit towards the book storyline. I don't understand why the reviews are so bad... This movie is hands down much better then New Moon. And other then being pretty slow it was still very enjoyable. If your a Twyhard you will love it. If you are a critic you won't. And if your an average Joe, you will enjoy the movie. Every important detain in the book was covered in this movie, and it sets Braking Dawn up well when it comes to a continuation. I regretted seeing New Moon but I loved watching this adaptation. it would be a wise choice to read the short life of brew turner before you watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bland and boring.,"When the movie finished, there was some cheering. I was confused. Was it relief that the movie was over? Or did a few seriously enjoy it? I could only shake my head and say ""wow"" (as in, ""I can't believe they made that into a movie"").There's action. You've seen the preview? Well, that's it.It's a love story. You've seen Kristen and Robert's fumblings in real life? Well, that's about as passionate as it gets! Awkward, confusing, and strange.Vampires should be SEXY? And EXCITING? I can imagine myself living in Eclipse as a vampire, and yes, being immortal would be hell.The highlight of the movie was perhaps the werewolves. They were good. Lautner delivered, even with the poor script. I guess I'm now cheering for the werewolves. If you decide to see this movie, check out his body language.

Wholly Justified Disbelief Successfully Suspended for 2 Hours,"The Twilight Saga [3]: Eclipse (2:04, PG-13, Imax) — Other: Romance; biggie; sequel; OSIT romanticsSuppose you are a young German lad named Riley, and you're returning late one rainy 1937 night from your Hitlerjugend meeting when you're repeatedly bowled over by some unseen entity. You run, but to no avail. Eventually you wake up confronted by a rabbi who informs you that, without even asking you, he's turned you into a Jew and that you're now heir to centuries of tradition. This means that, from now on, you will have to live in a ghetto, you can't go out for a good chunk of the week, your career choices are very limited, you must obey severe dietary restrictions (like no chocolate or dairy products), you'll have to lie to your family and friends about your condition, and you have just acquired a load of obscure obligations. Oh, yeah, and most of your countrymen would regretlessly kill you without a 2nd thot. Your question, Riley, is why you would even think twice about showing this rabbi undying devotion and obedience.Suppose it's Renaissance Verona and you're a young peasant lass named Bella. You're nice looking but not a raving beauty. You're also possessed of no noticeable smarts, ambition, initiative, talent, wit, passion, athletic ability, sexual desire (let alone skill), connections, wealth, or prospects. You are, however, an acknowledged world-class gold medalist at mooning and pining. You come to the attention of the leading scions of the noble but feuding Houses of Capulet and Montague, and each of them professes to be deeply, truly, eternally in love with you to the point of being willing to die for you and enlist their entire clan in your protection. Your questions, Bella, are (a) why the hell do you want to get mixed up with these obsessive and possibly homicidal maniacs and (b) what in hell do those guys see in YOU?Suppose you're in a supermarket check-out line and your eyes stray to the ""newspapers"" on display there. YOUR question is whether any of these people have family names or are you simply expected to recognize every reference that uses only a first name?Well, none of these questions gets answered in the 3rd Twilight movie, but at least the pace picks up from the draggy 2nd installment enuf for me to move it up a couple of notches to the same score I gave the 1st movie.Bella (Kristen Stewart) finally shows some initiative other than reluctance. The camera gives us the occasional super-close-up but doesn't just park there. There's less of Edward (Robert Pattinson) twinkling (about which one of my friends commented ""that's why they make Clearasil"") despite what seems to be more sunshine. And also less of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) taking off his shirt (since it STAYS off for pretty much the entire picture). There are plenty of werewolves (BIG suckers) but almost no transformation scenes. We depart from the central love triangle long enuf to get some interesting history told as flashbacks by the supporting characters. While there's still too much standing around, posing, and pointless chit-chat, nonetheless tension builds believably toward the big battle at the end between the united occult tribes of Forks, Washington, and a platoon of ""newborns"" — vampires recently created by Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) to avenge herself on Bella for last movie's destruction of her lover James. And, blessedly, there's some humor, such as the double entendre when Jacob informs Edward ""I am hotter than you"" and the fumbling efforts of dad Charlie (Billy Burke) to have a way belated sex talk with Bella.More to the point, unlike the similar vampires vs. werewolves theme of the parallel Underworld series, the Twilight saga features characters whom we are invited to care about. It's some measure of the saga's success that we are able to suspend our wholly justified disbelief long enuf to actually do so.For some unknown reason, as of this morning (June 30), with 3,761 user votes tallied on IMDb, this film got only 3.2 out of 10 stars and is pulling a dead mediocre 50% at RottenTomatoes. C'mon, people, it wasn't THAT bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sadly this was a let down,"I was so excited for this moving and left feeling less than satisfied. After a great deal of thought, I've realized why: Generally, I thought this particular movie lacked passion and intensity. I felt NOTHING. In the book, Bella was truly conflicted when she discovered her feelings for Jacob...I felt her pain. I didn't feel that in the movie. Also as adorable as I think Taylor Lautner is, I just didn't feel the sincerity of his feelings for Bella. His feelings have grown more intense with every movie but while his feelings have matured, Lautner as an actor has not. Kristen Stewart also has not grown as an actress enough to convey the feelings of a tortured Bella. Robert Pattinson is a more mature actor and it showed.A few more picky details...Eclipse had a different director and it was really obvious. They definitely should have stuck with the first director. Also, it was definitely a mistake to replace the first Victoria with Ron Howard's daughter. I didn't believe her as this evil, blood-thirsty vampire. She's a cute girl but that's it...cute",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wait for the DVD, not worth the hype!","Wow, I was just utterly disappointed when I left the theaters. I thought that Eclipse was a great book, and like the book the movie would follow in some of that greatness, so didn't. The movie simply was just off. Yes Bella and Edward love each other, we got that hello! The movie's plot was fast but so slow at the same time it was just weird everything jumped, details from the book was missing like why Rosalie changed Emmett, including baby henry or anything, not needed but would of been nice, jaspers retelling of the newborns felt off, it was crazy. I know the movies/books are different but geez this was just totally off new moon and twilight I can at least identify with this was just really weird and hopefully breaking dawn does it justice and i hope that they can all step up their game because the conclusion is dramatic and deep. Im not look forward to two parts.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic love,As a huge fan of the books I have to admit that I've hated the movies. The first was really bad and the second was average. The acting wasn't really the best thing and the story was changed to much. Not to mention the bad make up. With this movie they've stepped up and followed the story while doing a great job acting wise and again the make up part. The combat effects was way over my expectations so I loved every minuet of it. I must admit I was entertained to the fullest and I highly recommend Eclipse. On the other side I would never recommend Twilight. To sum this movie up they finally got the point of this epic love story. There are many ways to love. It's not a stupid drama. It's true love.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipse **Spoiler**,"This movie by far was the worst of the three. If you've read the book Eclipse you'd better understand the story and progression that each character makes as well as the overall decision between Jake & Edward.It seems like they cut & pasted parts together without any real flow and called it a movie. It was extremely choppy. The story was rushed. They didn't have enough time to explain it fully so they just pulled out some major points and stuck them together.They jumped around so much in the beginning that if you didn't read the book you wouldn't understand the underlining story and the growing love triangle between Jake, Edward, & Bella. They just scratched the surface.Here's hoping for Breaking Dawn. Maybe they'll actually go in depth with what the novels are bringing to the table. Overall, this time they are depending on Twihards to carry this movie to success.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weakest part of the franchise?,"I'll start (again), by saying that the acting is good to very good throughout. That does exclude Pattinson and Samuel - both very good actors I'm sure - who seem both at a loss as to what their characters' motivations are. For Pattinson, it is evident throughout the franchise that he cannot find access to Edwards weird inner self. But in my opinion it is never more visibly obvious than in this third film. This is usually not really the fault of the actor - writers and/or directors are to blame for that. In Edward's case, I think it is fair to say that he is a rather badly written character. And Samuel seems to be at a similar problem with his character (Riley), though I am tempted to put the blame more on the directing than the writing in this case.As for the plot, there isn't much. It is all just one long preparation for the final battle scene. And the love triangle subplot is just a continuation from the second film. A judgement which one might extent to the whole film: it does at times seem a bit like an addendum to ""New Moon"".Although the film contains the most hilarious line of the whole franchise (""Doesn't he own a shirt?""), it also features the infamous ""I'm Switzerland""-line, a line so bad and so incongruous in that very scene that it even seems to throw Stewart of her game, as it is one of the very rare scenes in all of the films in which her acting seems to be sub-par.On the whole, I'd probably struggle to give this one more that a 5.5 out of 10. However, it does make a difference whether you view it as a stand-alone film, or whether you watch it in close succession with the other films (which is preferable).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad acting,"This film is not let down by bad acting as some people would have you believe. If you think the acting is bad then please re-read the books. Kristen Stewart captures Bella's lacklustre teenage angst perfect and this is probably the only film in which Edward is actually like Edward in the books. Personally, I found the wigs awful - especially Kristen's wig which is really obvious. However the film is really let down simply by how the vampires die and if you want to know how bad that is then you are going to have to watch the film. Someone responsible for the making of the film has played this far too cautious in trying to keep the rating down for children. The final battle scene is what turns this from a teenage movie into a children's movie and as such this is a big let down.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you're a Twi-Fan, you'll LOVE IT! If not - don't see it. Simple as that.","First and foremost, what I don't think most of the critics understand, is that this movie was designed for 1 population - Twilight Fans. This movie was not designed to be a cinematic masterpiece that would appeal to the Hollywood Foreign Press, The Academy, or these ""hard-core"" movie critics. Frankly, I'm not sure why they bother going to the Twilight films, when they already know they're going to trash it.This movie was designed for 1 purpose - to translate our favorite modern love story onto the silver screen; to visually fulfill our Twilight fantastical indulgent desires. So with that in mind, there's a few simple answers/reviews without spoiling the movie.Do we get to see lots of Jacob and Edward: YES! (and the tent scene) Do we get the passion and the love story: YES! Do we get Jasper's & Rosalie's awesome back-stories: YES! (though brief) Do we get the back story of the Quileute Tribe?: YES! (though brief) Do we get to see the big ""fight"" scenes (Edward & The Meadow): YES YES!!! (I actually think the movie did a better job with this than the book did, I love Stephanie Meyer, by writing action sequences is not her forte) Does the movie do Eclipse's plot (the book) justice: YES! Granted some things get simplified or left out for the sake of running time.Overall, I LOVED Eclipse, it was by far my favorite movie of the series (and book). My only complaint was that it was only 2 hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"first one is crap, second is a bit crappy, third time is a charm","i have given comments on the first and second, and i decide to continue this task ~ i am a die-hard fan of the books and can't help seeing the movie adaptations, no matter how crappy they are ~ honestly, twilight was sooooo crappy that while watching it, i got a feeling of killing someone in the production crew, perhaps the whole crew, cast included. new moon got a bit better than the first one, but still, missed out a lot and obviously lacked of acting, i mean professional, not amateurs.however, this time, i must admit, third time is a charm ~ RobPat improves, finally, thank goodness ~ although he is not-so-edward and less-almighty-edward, in comparison with the previous two, he is ""a lot livelier"" ~ the only thing i dislike is the scene that he confronted Jake about the i-kissed-bella-thing, i am not saying the acting is bad, but hey, in the book, Bella is the most important thing in the world to Edward, his first priority is to check on her broken hand ~ i hate the core of the character has been changed, especially it comes to EDWARD ~ Melissa Rosenberg, do you hear me? Dexter is great, without doubt, you are an amazing screenwriter, so please stop ""downsizing"" Edward ~ Jasper and Rosalie did good, perhaps because they got a bigger part to play ~ actually, everyone ACTS this time, including Royce's gang ~ i have a theory, don't go into the cinema with great expectations and then somehow, you may be able to get some surprises ~",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sort of pretentious,"It was predictable that they would make this movie, but it probably will not go down in horror film history as anything special because it is a fairly run of the mill horror film. It was watchable but not all that interesting to me. I think I have a good open mind for new film experiences but I think this saga is sort of pretentious. Like a copy of the Underworld saga but more easy on the eyes, it doesn't really add anything interesting to the genre of werewolf films or the genre of vampire films. Kind of a ho hum movie to me, oh well, there are other things to watch. One of the problems that I can see with this series is that they have to many young characters in an area that would not be so dominated by young people-as in the area of the occult. There would be visibly older people as much as there would be visibly younger people. Maybe it is like saying 'we were left out by you and now we are leaving you out' type of thing, in terms of the film being a reaction against so little acting work often being given to younger actors in general for serious parts. Maybe. It is sort of like a Peanuts cartoon where adults are portrayed as fuzzy indistinct nuisances.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
disappointing,"Even compared with the previous two, which were rubbish, this one is disappointing. There were many young girls in the cinema watching it yet even they found reasons to giggle and snare at some stupidity and bloated-ness of the script and the entire premise. This is one stupid, ridiculous film which in addition takes itself seriously. The main actress is pretty attractive, but she does not act well, comes across as wooden. Her vampire partner is downright ridiculous and the wolf admirer is unintentionally funny too, sporting a naked torso for the girl audience even when snow is falling. The action scenes are unconvincingly mellow, the script is rubbish and soundtrack poor. I do not know what Dakota F. is doing here, her role is just a few lines recited standing, without acting skills necessary. How sad that this stupid and poor film-making takes the box office in a stride.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipse disappointing,"I eagerly awaited Eclipse only to be very disappointed. It has lost the essence of the book and vampires. The love between Bella and Edward is watered down. She chooses Edward over Jacob because she loves him more and can't live without him. Thats why she wants to become a vampire. This does not come across in the film. We get the impression she wants to marry Edward so she can become a vampire. Kristen Stewart does not seem able to portray the emotional journey of Bella. The new Vctoria looks like a refugee from 'Bewitched' with a bad wig. The fight scenes are bloodless and gutless (vampires breaking like marble figures). This might just as well have been a Disney film it was so 'child friendly'! The only things worth watching were Robert Pattinson, the CGI wolves, and the scenery! I hope the next film in the series does better.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It all begins ... With a choice,"Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger as Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob — knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella is confronted with the most important decision of her life. (Summit Entertainment)Once the opening scene is over and the title appears with Howard Shore's epic soundtrack playing in the background, you know that ECLIPSE is going to be good. Unlike NEW MOON, there's actually SOMETHING happening in here! There are characters DOING things, which is something more I can say for the previous sequel. And because the film has a very interesting plot akin to a horror film, ECLIPSE is easily the most exciting and cinematic film in the series!But just because there is a body count doesn't rule it out as a romance. Yes, the romance is still here. Yes, there is still the love triangle. Yes, Bella still has to choose between Edward and Jacob. But all of this is not as bad and tedious as you might think mostly due to Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay. This time around, she decides to add clever lines and something called humor into the romance. For example, in one scene, Edward asks Bella about Jacob, ""Doesn't he have a shirt?"" It's little scenes like these that make the love story a lot less cheesy and more welcoming compared to the first two films which everything was so serious they could pass for soap operas.Like the HARRY POTTER series, it's interesting to see different styles from the many directors that are attached for each film. With David Slade now on the directing chair, the film is improved with a much tighter direction and a faster pace. With experience from the horror genre, Slade knows how to create exciting action sequences. In fact, Slade pulls no punches in the climatic battle scene(s). Honestly, you get your money's worth. Who knew a TWILIGHT film would have the most beheadings in a PG-13 film? Honestly, there were some really brutal scenes.The cast is still good but more mature in their roles. Kristen Stewart gives a wonderful performance as always. I also liked Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, especially in one scene where they get to spew out clever dialogue at one another about how they're the better man for Bella. Anna Kendrick, who had her rise of fame in UP IN THE AIR last year, doesn't appear much in the film, unfortunately, but it's always great to see her when she does, including one important scene. Billy Burke is still the same great father we saw him in the previous two films.Most of the Cullen clan have considerably more to do in this sequel, most notably Jackson Rathbone. There are even origin stories on two of them, both of which are very interesting while one of them is eerily similar to Bill Compton's in TRUE BLOOD. Xavier Samuel plays the new villain and he gives a menacing performance. Bryce Dallas Howard replaces Rachelle Lefevre as the new Victoria and she does a good job as well, although she's underused.Even the visual effects are improved! I didn't know how they did it, but the sparkling skin on Edward is suddenly not laughable anymore. I also liked the look of the CGI wolves and their interactions with the actors. There's one scene with Bella petting Jacob in his transformation and it looked believable. Oh, and it's great to listen to Howard Shore's soundtrack along with seeing the sweeping cinematography.While it won't bring newcomers to the franchise, ECLIPSE is an improvement over NEW MOON. The romance is less cheesy, the action scenes are a lot bigger, the plot is a lot more interesting, and the film finally has a sense of humor. If you're not a fan of the TWILIGHT saga, you know what to do without me telling you. However, for the fans of the series, you'll be completely satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved the book... movie not so much,"I devour Twilight books and had to go to the midnight feature opening night of Eclipse. I was so disappointed by this movie. I wanted to love it, but can't even say that I liked it. It just didn't work for me.The magic of Twilight was missing, as was the suspense and angst of New Moon. Gone were the lingering glances between Bella and Edward. The music that was practically a character in previous movies was absent. Eclipse relied far too much on dialog to tell the story, which with these books, is just not strong enough to completely carry a movie. It's the love story itself that draws us in, not Meyer's actual writing.The movie itself was bright and clear, which I didn't like; my husband, however, did enjoy this movie better than the others in the saga, with the caveat, ""if it didn't have all that talking."" This is not saying very much; he didn't really like the other movies. He always commented everything was blue in Twilight or in a fog in New Moon. Eclipse was extremely action heavy, which could be why he enjoyed this movie more than the others.To me, without the hazy dream-like setting, it was obviously fake. The wolves were cartoony looking and my vampires, oh, my beautiful vampires... their haircuts were horrid. I couldn't fall into this story, as I have in the past. Whatever the vision was that they were trying to create, it was a failure. The powdered skin was obvious and distracting. I wasn't left with a magical feeling.Eclipse was not without high points, however... Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) was a completely different actor...thank you, thank you, thank you! He was smooth and believable in Eclipse, much improvement over his painful-to-watch performances in the previous movies. Jackson's performance was the highlight of this movie. Ashley Green's(Alice) performance was also spot on. She was light and airy, just as I expect of Alice. Jodelle Ferland, who played the fledgling Bree, was amazing in the few minutes that she was on screen. If I purchase this movie, it will be to re-watch these performances again.The movie has humor and works the comedic timing. That part was well done for me, but remember that I do love the books. As a whole, I felt like I sat through a high school production. If you are in love with the saga, you are going to see this movie no matter what anyone else says. If you aren't a huge Twilight fan, don't waste your time or money.I so hope they take their time to create a solid movie and go in a different completely different direction with Breaking Dawn. I would be greatly disappointed if that movie turns out like this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
what movie did these people see?,"I was pretty confused last night when I got home from a midnight premiere of this film to see many comments on it from people who very obviously hadn't actually seen the movie. People calling it a romantic comedy? Either they're just trying to find a 'totally hilarious' way to be condescending towards a twilight movie, or they obviously didn't see the correct movie.I thought Eclipse was easily the best installment in the saga so far. I've read the books, and seen all the movies, and this movie definitely had it's differences from the book, but David Slade's portrayal of everything in the book was magnificent. This book, the darkest in the series, was easily seen in Slade's dark direction and great usage of Riley as a more intriguing character.I also don't understand everyone's hatred for Robert Pattinson. He does amazing work as Edward. His facial expressions to his body movements compliment the character from the book very well. Kristen Stewart does a great job as Bella, better in this one than the rest. In New Moon she had a lot of makeup, which I didn't agree with, and luckily they fixed that in this one.The soundtrack to this film was incredible and I'm glad to see they did away with the dreary soap opera piano from New Moon.Another thing people keep crying about is Taylor Lautner, and one commenter said that he didn't like how angry he was every time. I understand watching the movie without reading the book, but I thought the story itself would help a viewer understand that Jacob's character should be angry. One, he's doing something against his will (stated in New Moon and in this film) and he's dealing with Bella being with Edward and not him. It's pretty obvious to me this character would be conflicted, and Taylor does a great job showing it. And that guy is definitely still working out because it looked like he added another half-inch to his arms. Bravo to that guy.This movie was great, 10/10 for direction, acting, soundtrack, and even the cinematography. It was all great and I enjoyed every second of this film.-also, Taylor and Robert's anger towards each other in the movie is incredible. They did a great job working with each other in this one. Much better than New Moon's.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An honest, unbiased, and most importantly MATURE review","OK, as of now this film has just under 6,000 votes here on IMDb and nearly half of those are 1 star. What does that tell you? I'm sure you can probably guess that virtually all of these come from those who spend their time hating Twilight and want to rate it bad because.....well I don't know why. They hate everything associated with it, including the actors, and not least of all Twilight fans. Seems a waste of time to me. Why would you spend valuable time with something that you don't like? Wouldn't your time be better spent IMDb'ing movies you actually enjoy? Why some people are so hell bent on ridiculing Twilight fans, I'll never know. Does it somehow hurt their quality of life if people are in love with the Twilight series? I doubt it. They need to get over it and move on.Anyhow the film: From a technical standpoint it's far superior to the 1st and 2nd installment. But then that's to be expected. The kinks have been worked out by this point, and the mass popularity of the franchise has enabled the creators to get the best crew members. I was delighted to see how the special fx have grown since the first film; like night and day. As far as the storyline I don't think it would be fair to give all the credit to the director and screenwriters and director of cinematography. I mean after all, the Eclipse plot is the most exciting of the 4 so it's almost inevitable that the film will be more entertaining than the others.As far as acting goes, the principle players have gotten marginally better. Kristin Stewarts constipated stuttering leaves a lot to be desired. I've seen her in other films where she's a perfectly decent actress so I'm guessing she interpreted this aspect literally from the book. I don't hold it against her. Robert Pattinson hasn't gotten a lot to work with in any of the films, but after having seen his other film Remember Me, I know that he's got some good acting skills in there; it's just the material at fault here.I've read all 4 installments of Stephenie Meyers' saga, and I truly enjoyed the books. Compared to them the films are definitely subpar but not altogether unenjoyable. Twilight was pretty good, New Moon wasn't good at all, but then again the book was sort of slow as well. Eclipse is better than both of them.If you're a fan of either, I predict Eclipse will be your favorite one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"3 bad points:(1) there are too much details left behind. I expected there would be more specific scenes (especially Edward-Bella-Jacob scenes). unfortunately, they didn't make it as good as the novel.(2) their acting ain't good at all. it's too bad, they didn't FEEL it (is it possible to re-make the eclipse before releasing breaking dawn???).(3) Edward is more fat. can a vampire get more fat? aren't they frozen? but I like Jasper, he looks stronger.I think the novel is much better than the movie, but I love it anyway. the first and the second twilight saga movies are better. hope the next movies (breaking dawn part 1 & 2) are gonna be much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well, it's getting worse and worse.","I can't believe with all the money they are making they keep on choosing bad productions for these movies. Eclipse is worse than New Moon in acting, soundtrack, special effects AND plot! (I didn't think it was gonna be possible, but I actually changed my opinion on New Moon and now I find it MUCH too good compared to this). The movie isn't awful, but it's totally emotionless and saves nothing of the Twilight atmosphere and the characters' personality. The only good scenes are DIRECTLY QUOTED from the book, so it's not even the director doing a good job. The book is my favorite of the saga, thus the movie was a huge disappointment. The plot is fractioned, there are these beautiful scenes from the book, but they aren't connected between each other. All that happens in-between is insignificant or just emptied of its emotional tension or value. The characters' personality is totally bent to fit in the plot less movie, Edward even appears as a villain in some scenes while in the book it's the absolute opposite. He's noble and always thinking of what's best for her, not a tyrant that tries to have it all and make it bad for Jacob. Once again this movie is UNWATCHABLE for one who hasn't read the book. I find the actors great, but the director wasn't even able to direct their performance to be as good as it can get. The only scenes that deserve to be watched are those with actual EMOTIONS in them, like in the tent, in the bedroom and in the meadow. The reason I give 5 to this movie is because it's not really BAD. Nothing is really awful in it. It's just NOT good. Plain and dull at times! What I appreciated was the humor that was finally let in, which didn't happen in the previous movies. In the books of the saga there are multiple jokes but only this time they seem to play a decent role, finally! The acting was inferior than the previous but still I find the cast brilliant, so I can't say it's a bad product overall. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner are simply perfect. But for them, we have to thank the first director, certainly not this one!I would recommend this only to people who love the books and aren't expecting too much, to all other people, save money and get yourself the books if you really want to give them a shot.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
bella disappoints me.,"OK after watching the first 2 twilights, although not brilliant but worth watching i thought may asell watch the 3rd one in the pipeline and I've gotta say really disappointed.In these movies i really like the character edward cullen but in this sequel i cant help but feel sorry for him, i mean come on in the 1st twilight bella claims too be totally in love with edward then in new moon spends all her time with jacob and managing too hold herself for edward then in number 3 after going through all the torture of edward leaving her an eventually coming back she starts then falling inlove with jacob its like 1 minute shes with edward and then for the next 10 minutes shes with jacob what the hell if i was edward i kick this chick too the curb and fro her too the wolves as it were.but the most disappointing line in this film was by bella when she kisses jacob then says too edward you saw, edward replies you love him, then the cheesy bit comes from bella, but i love you more mmmmmm is that school girl stuff or what bella managed to disappoint me at this stage.That aside the most interesting part about this film is the last 10 minutes although not great at that.This 3rd part really ruined the journey off twilight for me but then again im not in too love triangles",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was very disappointed with this one.... (coming from a Twilight fan),"Everything just was so rushed. After the last two (which I happened to really like), I felt this one just was not cared enough about and thrown together. I'm so disappointed with this one and wish that this was more thought out. I'd rather have Eclipse coming out in November like the last two- but better instead of a early Eclipse movie with rushed scenes and a cheesy beginning.It felt like New Moon set a bar for Eclipse that Eclipse (in the end) didn't reach. I wish I really liked this movie more, but I am having a hard time finding the good in this movie. It felt like Summit and David Slade didn't put enough care into this movie at all. New Moon was so much better, even with it's depressing mood. It felt like some of the Cullens- like Alice, Carlisle, and Esme hardly had any character development in this movie and the wolfpack/Jacobs side was hardly shown after it's in-depth tell-all in New Moon. Everything was just too too rushed.On the upside I thought the proposal scene, leg hitch scene, and the Cullen/Werewolf/Jasper training scene was well done. Robert Pattinson delivered a few lines a little wooden, but overall he and Taylor Lautner really delivered their lines and characters well. Kristen Stewert didn't do very well at all when it came to her acting and character. She did better in New Moon, however she delivered confusion between the two men very well.All in all, I rate this a 6. It was a little better than average, but not as moving as New Moon and not as romantic as Twilight.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Had the potential to be something special,"I loved the Twilight Saga as soon as I started reading the first few pages of the first book. Eclipse was one of, if not the strongest book in the saga, with plenty of suspense and action to satisfy the reader. I had extremely high hopes for this film.One thing I can't fault is the special effects. The fight scenes were great, the acting within these scenes was very good. What let this down was the boring first half of the film, and I felt that the ending was quite poor. I felt that there was too much kissing (yes I know it is a love story, I appreciate that, but it was almost every five minutes they we're sucking each other's faces off).I also feel they focused a bit too much on the novella that was recently released, rather than the actual Eclipse novel. I liked that we managed to see a bit more into the story of Rosalie and of Jasper, which you get in the books also - but I think I'd have liked to have seen a bit more bonding going on with Bella and the rest of the Cullens.This film had great potential, but wasn't great. I felt that New Moon was a lot stronger than Eclipse, and seeing as it is the weakest book in the saga - that's not a good thing!I just hope and pray that Breaking Dawn can do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Make up your mind if you want an action or a romance movie,"While plot unfolds and the producers are ""building"" a saga, inherent weaknesses make the third film the worst of all. I can't help to notice that Twilight's director was by far the best for this kind of film. Even the photos are telling the truth; check out which of them are most attractive to the eye. Rough scenes, poor acting (didn't you notice how awkward felt the actors?) less than elemental action and irrelevant music was what I got. A pity, for I did expected something better. Not all of us are expecting endless kisses and constant close ups on the stars' faces, you know. A waste of budget and of a good plot, for Twilight Saga has its own fan- club worldwide. Yes, it surely is a love story. It surely isn't ""Interview with the vampire"". But it has a strong element of action (see the Volturi entering the plot) which shouldn't be left unexploited. Sinserely, I hope that the 4th movie will treat these inherent flaws.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Worst of the series. This movie was made to make money, save money, and for young children and old adults who like obvious scripts better than clever scripts.","I'll keep it simple; The acting is worst and better at the same time. Making me dizzy.They added a sprinkle of comedy, when I thought it's strength was darkness.To make it worst it's somewhat feels like 3rd party comedy, which means that people in the movie's own world wouldn't get it because it's about this world...boy jokes about Joseph and Edward for example.This was hyped to have more action when in fact in did not, and when it did it was even more cheesy and artificial than before. Example...the vampires bursting into stone by getting punched? Cartoon anyone? In the trailer I got this idea like it was gonna be a mega blockbuster, since it will prob be the biggest movie of the year, and there was no fighting in the big city like I thought, or any crazy blockbuster stuff.The Vulturi. They really didn't do anything. I thought their would be a big fight scene with them and everything. I was hoping they would have a big chunk of the movie and they didn't.And last but not least. She chose Edward....and I noticed some girls cry because their team didn't win.A real shame. How do you please both teams?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first two but...,"...still not quite good. This is better because it has intense battle scenes and epic music and faster pace but the still has the same lovely-dovely talk which drags. The CGI has definitely improved too. But all the lovely-dovely talk bring down the whole movie. All the talk between Bella and Edward seem like they are going on forever, they seem like they will never end. I could be annoyed too with Bella's decision of who to choose.The story: It takes place after New Moon, which almost put me into sleep, and Bella is still indecisive the love between Jacob and Edward. Blah, blah, cue to the boring talk between them that go on forever. The new-born vampires are going to attack Bella? I was sleepy from the boring talk that I did not really know what the new-born vampires want. Okay, then there are two major action scenes which are short. Even the climax is disappointing. I mean, it is like what the heck do they need to practise for? I am actually surprised at the pace of this though it is faster than New Moon. I have seen David Slade's 30 Days of Night and I have enjoyed its grittiness and suspense. But in this, he chose melodramatic lines that go on forever and drag the plot down. I would say Howard Shore did a good job for composing. The other two movies' music are nothing.Overall: This will be definitely be popular for the females who ogle at Edward or Jacob's six packs. Other than that, I don't know why someone touts it as the movie event of the year! I rather want to see that line on the Inception's poster.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed,"I am a fan of the first Twilight film and the books, but this film let me down badly. They rushed through scenes that needed more explanation and lingered on parts that could have been done in one short scene. It darts from one scene to another in a very clunky way. This was the best book in the Twilight series, it was a really lovely story, very emotional and there was some suspense, the film doesn't illustrate this at all. I don't believe it will make the Twilight fans happy as it misses out too much and the people who haven;t read the books won't be happy because it doesn't cover what it should and leaves them confused. I was seriously looking forward to this film, I love Twilight, but I feel like I'm being scammed by the film makers, they clearly don't care, all they want is to make money! I honestly can't imagine what they will do with Breaking Dawn which is the weakest of all the books and they want to make it into two films. Like I said it's all about making money, not making good films.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Practically ""New Moon"" All Over Again","Before going into the movie house tonight, I was so ready not to like this movie. ""Eclipse"" is positively the worst book in the Twilight franchise. It even discouraged me from reading the next book ""Breaking Dawn."" The entire book was an just an over-extended exposition on the indecisive wishi-washiness of one Bella Swan over the vampire Edward and the werewolf Jacob. This very same conflict was already introduced and tackled in ""New Moon."" For me, it did not really reach a new level here in ""Eclipse."" Unfortunately, it is the same way here in the movie version.The best scene in the book only happens past Chapter 20 already when Bella and her two consorts were caught in a single tent in the mountains during a big storm. Same way here in the movie. It features a most hilariously memorable line when one tells the other ""I'm hotter than you!"" After that though, even the book was better than how Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner monotonously delivered their subsequent cheesy lines.Director David Slade continues the same character quirks established in the first two movies, like how Bella and Edward love to talk in a field of wildflowers, how Bella's dad Charlie (Billy Burke) provides the comic relief, and others. We got to see the origins of Rosalie and Jasper. We also get to see the history of the Quileuete tribe. The main background conflict was how Victoria was establishing an army of new blood vampires in Seattle in order to kill Bella and avenge her lover's death. These fight scenes were actually quite well shot with good special effects. It was also good to see Anna Kendrick (fresh from her Oscar nomination for ""Up in the Air"") as Jessica delivering the valedictory speech at their graduation rites.So overall, we did not really see anything new in the love triangle aspect. Things did get more physically intimate for the three main characters, more than the previous one, but the ""romantic"" lines do get more corny. This is a movie that Twihards will love, but I do not think it can stand by itself. I feel this is actually a step down from ""New Moon."" The main limitation is really the book this movie was based on.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elipse: 5/10,"The Twilight series are just simply not worth ranting about over the net. Sure Taylor Lautner is attractive and sure there is chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson, but the franchise is crap and we all know it. Predictably when they made a successful novel, they will probably turn it into a movie, so there born the Twilight series. Written elegantly by Stephanie Meyers and ruined by Hollywood. Even though in this particular film I admired the CGI effects and the director, it still doesn't make up for the bumpy plot and high school acting. Especially Lautner, all he is good for is pleasing the audience (girls) with his abs and that is not acting (to say the least). Twilight Saga: Eclipse has its goods but there weren't enough to cover its faults.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Definitely better than the first two... but that's not saying much,"As a fan of the books, it surprised me that I was actually afraid of how terrible the movie would be. Yes, I didn't even think of the possibility of it being good. And I wasn't disappointed.What's the problem? Definitely not the director, I mean they've changed it at least 3 times and it still sucks. The writing? Of course. The story is so low and plain. It doesn't have a course. It's like they filmed parts of the books that they knew fans would love to see and try to link them without success. If I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't get a single clue of the story or the big deal about Bella (that even the books can't explain). The lines are so repetitive. We know by heart what Lautner will say every time he puts his puppy face and what Bella'll respond. Also, we don't quite understand in this movie Edward-Bella relationship. I mean, in the first one is all ""I'll die for you"" and ""You're my everything"" and now all that (after all the sacrifices that BOTH made) goes to ***. I was at the point of wanting to kill Bella to stop all this fuzz around her.Even though they tried to show us more of the relationship Bella has with her mother, you don't understand at all why she keeps treating her parents like that. Charlie for her doesn't matter at all. I used to understand all of this in the books, but now I see it's also wrong there. Come on, you shouldn't be daring to leave them forever.Acting. So LAAAAAAAMEEE. Come on. We've seen Stewart in other movies and she's definitely OK. We've seen Pattinson, and I particularly loved him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter. Lautner is the best of the main three, but still that's not saying much. Of course Anna Kendrick, Billy Burke and Dakota Fanning steal the scene every time they appear, but it's not enough. They need to show some freaking emotion. Pattinson's face the whole movie stays like this: -.-Makeup? You have to admit it is by far the best of the three movies... but, again, that's not saying much. What I mean is that if in Twilight you could see the difference between their neck and their face, now you can't... but it still looks like chalk. In one scene I could actually saw Carlisle's WHITE eyebrows. LOL! Besides, Bella's wig was TERRIBLE. And what's worse is that they kept showing her face so close that you could see everything.Sets were amazing. Music was fine but it didn't make me had goose bumps like every good scene with great music does. And the clothes... Actually they were pretty great, according to each character, you know. Effects? Definitely better than the first two but... guess what? That's not saying much. Yes, I am saying that too much. And what's worst... WHY THE HELL DID VAMPIRES LOOKED LIKE THAT? Like some freaking crystal. Wolves looked like Lotso in Toy Story 3, but I have to admit the fights were really great.Anyway, it's not worth it. I guess those books aren't meant to be good movies.Oh! I almost forgot! The worst part of it ALL? (Yes, there's something worst) WAS THE FANS! God! I wanted to kill them more than I wanted to kill Bella! And THAT is saying something. I have 16 years old and definitely read some other books. They don't have a clue of what ""adaptation"" means (neither the people who work in this, I guess). At one point I was about to throw my shoe to her face, but I contained myself.Seriously, if you're seeing a movie you want to WATCH, then WATCH IT and shut up.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way better than New moon,"Okay,so I didn't read all the books, I'm not obsessive fan, but I really liked the first movie, cause it' a love story with vampires. The New moon was nothing like that, it was something between really bad drama, bad action movie, etc. Cause I liked Twilight, I gave it a chance for a third movie. And I liked it. The story wasn't lame, it wasn't slow, it was OK. So yes, all that loving scenes, it made me go eh, but I'm not 15 anymore, I don't believe in love like that, but I can see why people want to believe and why they love Twilight saga. It's positive, it's like you can escape from a bad dream, where bad dream is reality. Yeah, when I was 15 i wanted love like that, what Bella and Edward have it's amazing, but that's just a story. So yeah, movie is what it must be. A beautiful fairytale.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than the last one, but just as lame, and still aimed at teens","This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was a teen when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 9/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst Hollywood adaptations of such a classic novel,"first things first you will b disappointed whether you have read the novel or not,its better if you have not because it will make you feel more sorry for the classic novel,the third in installment of the twilight saga,but don't give second thoughts to reading the book if you are judging it by the movie,well the movie is too rushed for the first thing and I thought they will utilise the time to showcase the battle in an epic manner, I was really looking forward to it but mostly dud.Plot has been twisted everywhere ,seems like they were keen on ripping the soul out of the terrific plot the novel offers,the crucial points in the plot like Bella finally figuring out Victoria's involvement were all dealt with so casually like they were not even in the plot,and I cant even guess why's Riley given so much screen time when not required and his role all cut in the fight,man where was Seth ripping him in parts.Even the dialogs were pathetic leading to all the wrong conclusions.Quileute legend,Rose's story and Jasper's telling of the newborns's enemies were really the worst part.Seems like there was no plot at all,even background scores were not as gud as previous ones.So why would you go watch it,well for all the beautiful males and females,Esme is stunning ,Rosalie somewhat down,Jasper was more beautiful in previous movies without the new hairdo,chemistry between Edward and Bella is something you can look fwd to,Carlisle n Jake are again very good at what they do,Jane's screen tym cud have been easily edited without affecting plot.well what I would recommend is that if you r a Twilight-hard fan nothing will stop you from going for it but you will be very much disappointed n well for others its very much avoidable,hope breaking dawn has have some luck with justice to it",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mediocre,"I've never been fan of the Twilight saga movies nor the books, I've only watched them because of the popular choice me and my friends take when we've been to the theater. OK so basically the main plot remains the same,there is this big event coming up and the the tension builts around it, introduce some couple of new characters here and there and you are good to take off, in the Twilight saga universe things can get a little too dramatic, well that's not the exception here. A big part of the movie is spent of preparing for the big event/climax of the movie and manages to include the love triangle between the leads, the storyline is not crappy for what it is, but may not fulfill die hard fans' expectationsOn the acting department, we still have that all weird behavior from Kristen, Pattinson as the same, And Taylor a little too much angry through the movie, The supp cast gets also the job done for what the movie aloud them to play(overall one can say there is talent among the cast, but not so much in this flick). This is as bad or as good as the previous entries, depends of how much you like to put it, if you liked the first two you'll probably like this one, If you hated the first two you'll probably hate this one too. Personally I didn't liked it, felt slow-paced and overly predictable. This wouldn't even be my choice movie for a free Friday.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not That Bad,"This one is about as good as New Moon for me. We did get some action in this one which made it entertaining.

"The best in the franchise, but this isn't saying anything","I really hated the first TWILIGHT. It was badly acted, with cringeworthy lines and sloppy editing all around. The first of the sequels was a bit bad but not as bad as the first one. So, while my hopes were low for this third installment, I actually ended up mildly liking it, and naming it so far the best movie in the series, tho isn't exactly an accomplishment.After the events of the second movie (including a small trip to Italy to the Volturi tribe) Bella is torn between continuing to see Jacob or stop this since Edward is annoyed. So there is no other choice than a fight between the wolf-boys (guys who can turn into giant wolves) and vampires, but they'll soon have to join forces for stopping Victoria (who had her partner killed by Edward in the first movie) after there are some reports of gruesome murders in Seattle. They will succedd in defeating Victoria and after a while Edward and Bella will plan their marriage (to be continued).This time all was better, The acting by Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and most of the other cast members was decent and the fight scenes were cool in some points (especially in the mountain part). The photography and soundtrack were good, nothing to rave about. Only the pacing was a bit dull at times, especially towards the end.If you are into the TWILIGHT franchise I bet you already saw it, but if you are someone who occasionally watches bad movies just for a laugh, this is somewhere in the middle.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best one so far... still flawed.,"Unfortunately, I saw this movie when I started getting over my Twilight obsession that started when I was fourteen. The weird thing about the Twilight movies is that they get better, but not by much.This movie had a darker tone to it, and that was good. The scenes that show Riley, the newborn vampire, wandering the streets and murdering people or turning them into vampires were pretty cool.Also, I was glad to see that the two most overlooked characters, Jasper and Rosalie, got to have their shining moments in this movie. Like the book, the movie included their stories of their transformations from human to vampire. What really impressed me was that Jasper, until now, has been a really creepy and awkward character, and we got to see another side of him. He mentions to Bella the time he first met Alice, and actually looked... like he had feelings.Now the bad things in this movie were almost the same as the last two films: Edward and Bella's ""chemistry"", Jacob and Bella's ""chemistry"", Kristen Stewart's acting. Edward and Bella have no reason to be together. Jacob has no reason to love Bella. Bella has no personality, and being a weak human, could be killed by Edward easily. What does she have to offer? Pointless drama. Kristen Stewart, as infuriating as it is, still sees no reason to work on her acting. It is still awful.What also annoyed me was the message the movie sent to the teenage girls out there; that you should just hang back, and let your boyfriend do all the fighting for you, and that you don't need to stand on you're own two feet. You're boyfriend will do that for you!One more thing, I did not like the new Victoria at all. Victoria is supposed to be a menace. A vicious, merciless, vengeful, unstoppable, bloodthirsty menace. The new Vicotria fell WAAY short of what she was supposed to be. She ran away from everything, she had this terrified expression on her face almost the whole time! The way Edward ripped her head off looked totally fake. It was too funny. People in the theater, die-hard Twilight fans, actually burst out laughing!This movie was a step up from New Moon as New Moon was a step up from Twilight, but at the same time, it really isn't enjoyable unless you are a naive and immature twelve-to-thirteen year old girl.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A dull version of LOTR,"Even though I don't particularly like these movies I understand why someone might like the first and even the second film to a certain extent.But this movie jumps the saga into a highly inferior version of Harry Potter, LOTR, and GOT.I understand that Tayler Lautner has abs, and that's the only appeal. But in all seriousness I can't name one thing this film got right.

Bad movie night Sundays week three,"Well I'm going to be generous with my review here as at least with this installment in the Twilight saga it had some intriguing moments.What holds this film up for me is the conflict between the new borns, the Cullens, and the werewolves. Also Jaspers storyline was very intriguing to me as well. Apart from that the rest is a cringe fest of writing with the cringe love triangle between Edward, Jacob, and Bella. I don't get it I think they can both do better. Everyone's Bella this Bella that... I don't see it. Meanwhile I'm over here thinking it's all about Alice. I mean I'd...

"Out of the first three, Eclipse is the lead favorite so far","Compared to the hilarious acting in New Moon, Eclipse finally brings us a much better plot line and also the creme de la creme scene near the end where Edward and Jacob have a 'talk' while Bella is sleeping. It's so cringe it is fantastic! The running gag that Jacob is always shirtless was a good snort too.In all seriousness though, I'm guessing the author in the books gives us some vampire backstories because we finally have a few flashbacks with add depth to the characters, especially Jasper, Rosalie and the Quileute tribe. We finally find out why Rosalie has a stick up her backside towards Bella - she wishes she were human again and angry that Bella is willingly choosing the vampire life not realizing what she is throwing away.I wished to see Alice and Emmetts's backstory, but I guess not. On a side note, the wigs in this film are terrible....just ignore them.The best scene is the training up to the fight at the end and the fight itself.After watching this movie I'm definitely Team Edward. Jacob we find out is a controlling male who KNOWS what's best for Bella vs Edward who makes dumb decision thinking it's in her best interest. But as Bella tells both guys, it's obvious neither of them trust her fully with the truth of things. End point it's clear that Jacob want to control Bella 'for her own good' and calls that love. He's already told Bella that guys in his tribe can get physically violent and he already forced a kiss on her showing that he has a lot of trouble controlling even himself and his emotion.Edward on the other hand can control himself with Bella, at least in this movie, but he still doesn't trust her fully. At the end it's clear Bella is still very much a teenager (although just turned 18) and wants modern day relationships whereas Edward wants his 1900's style with courting, proper proposals, and sex definitely after marriage.I heard the next in the series had 8 razzie awards for terrible everything and I look forward to it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A slight improvement over the first two, but still pretty bad","Ofcourse it is no secret that The Twilight Saga is not one of cinema's finest forthbringings, as its first two films are some of the worst examples of acting/writing you will ever see, and while Eclipse might not be much better, atleast the unintentional comedy finally seems kept to a minimum this time. ( Yes, there are still unintentionally comically bad moments, but not so many as previous ones )The main reason that this one still towers over its terrible predecessors is because of the fact that we are actually given some insight to backstories of some of the Cullen's, such as that story about one of them being a confederate soldier or the one by that blonde Cullen woman ( I forget a lot of the Cullen's names as their characters were not very memorable ). The cinematography is a bit better than its predecessors too, yet we can still notice a lot of actual wideshots ( Such as the one in the mountains ) was greenscreened and therefore didn't quite look as great as it would have like to have been. Tension is a bit better than in the previous ones too with the story about the newborn army, but since this is kind of like a kids franchise we know none of the good guys are probably going to get hurt, and if they do, why should we even care? The people displayed here do not talk and act like actual people, and therefore an emotional connection cannot be made.The love triangle between Bella, Edward & Jacob is starting to become ridiculous. Ofcourse, i don't quite understand what anyone could see in Bella who always has just one facial expression, but Jacob's & Edward's fighting over her borderline on the comical. Seriously, who would fight over a inhuman emotionless dead inside kind of girl like Bella? The screenplay might be a little bit better, but still it mostly consists of your typical Twilight conversations like: 'You love him', 'I love you more', yeah these types of clichés are what your general Twilight screenplay consists of most of the time. It might have less unintional comedy, but let us not forget the AMAZING scene with Bella and her father when she admits she is a virgin. The sheer inhuman and unnatural acting by Kristen Stewart will make you laugh out loud at this point, but at least it was kept to a minimum this time.The acting by the three main characters is once again terrible. I reckon even if you get these actors to play on a film with an actual good script, they will still blow it with their delivery. Lautner might be slightly better than Pattinson and Pattinson slightly better than Stewart, but all three of them have non existent acting talents. It baffles me that especially Stewart is still somehow getting work, whose constant sighing makes it look like she is extremely nervous everytime she has to film a scene. I mean, i get that David Fincher cast her in Panic Room as the spoiled annoying little brat because she wasn't known at the time, but people who still cast her should know better. There is just no argument you can give in her favor when it comes down to acting. The sighing, hair touching, head shaking, eye contact evasing, open mouthing, deadened line deliveries & the list goes on. Like a robot sent from Mars to act on Earth, that is really what her style comes down to.While it is a bit better than its predecessors due to the fact that it had a couple of backstories which took the focus off Bella ( Who is a TERRIBLE character ), it is still a Twilight film featuring Kristen Stewart & Robert Pattinson, and this alone still makes sure it is a mediocre mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a solid addition to the series and much better than New Moon,"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows Edward and Bella back together after she picked him over Jacob to conclude the previous picture. Unfortunately for Bella Edward's past is on the hunt to find her and make her cease to exist. As the why unfolds her only chance for protection may be for her current lover, Edward, and her spurned lover, Jacob, to work together...This movie is directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) and stars Robert Pattinson (The Batman), Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsmen), Taylor Lautner (Abduction), Billy Burke (Drive Angry), Anna Kendrick (Into the Woods) and Ashley Greene (Apparition).After a big drop from the first movie to New Moon, Eclipse rebounds nicely with a better storyline, premise and fantastic fight and kill scenes. The vampires versus the werewolf scenes are very well done and underrated. Some of the Jacob vs Edward banter was more fun than I previously remembered and the father is always a great character. The character backstories of some of the other Cullens are entertaining and the final battle is excellent.Overall this is a solid addition to the series and much better than New Moon. I would score this a solid 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How do they get away with this?,"My guess is that the book series is just so popular that the production company thinks that they can get away with making poor films. They shouldn't! I thought it was slow, boring, and the acting was just God-awful. The only saving grace was Taylor Lautner's ever improving smoking hot body, and the fact that for once Kristen Stewart finally looked pretty for once.It was better than New Moon; I will give it that. But other than that, it was just so lackluster that there is barely anything else to be said but that. A huge disappointment.

"Discovering Kristen, v1.10","For me, Twilight series is easy to under-appreciate.My comment re Twilight 1 relates to the movie series and my comment re Twilight 2 relates more to my experiences of the novels. This relates to the movie series leading to me discovering Kristen as an actress.I discovered the Twilight Saga because some episodes include Dakota.A lot of Kristen's stuff is available in affordable, to me, second hand copies and that allowed me to spend several months getting to know her other stuff. It includes a lot that is really okay.Eclipse commentary mentions a film that K S and Jodelle Ferland had both acted in. I had to try to get that and it was available as a relatively low cost second hand blu-ray. K S has the lead and I found this to be one of her best movies. I preferred it to Twilight Saga 1, but now consider them both to be good but different.This made me discover more and I found that I already had two on DVD, features that I had considered as memorable. K S was starting to seem to be rather hot. It was definitely not my early reaction to the Twilight series that showed me that but The Messengers and Panic Room and Zathura.The other stories seem to mostly have some common elements, with the possible exception of Jumper, where K S appears at the end in a minimal role, as if a cameo appearance. Of these I currently prefer Fierce People and The Safety Of Objects and Cold Creek Manor and Mission Without Permission and In The Land Of Women and The Cake Eaters and Snow White And The Huntsman, but that is just personal taste. Also the difficult Adventureland and The Runaways, easy to follow stories that pose difficult questions re how a storyteller needs to describe real realities.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nowadays, a girl can freely have a threesome with a vampire and a werewolf, and no one says boo.Back in my day, they'd lynch you for just flirting with a Frankenstein.Thankfully, the times have changed, however, women's eternal turn-on of nice guy/bad boy love triangles has not.As Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her fanged fiancé Edward (Robert Pattinson) plan their wedding, the vengeful Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) gets her retribution against the betrothed by siccing her army of newly turned vampires on them.To defeat the horde, Edward must team with Bella's canine crush, Jacob (Taylor Lautner).The third installment of the franchise, Eclipse is the first blockbuster: the cast is heavily airbrushed, the soundtrack is overproduced, and the love story is thrice as campy as before.On the plus side, however, when you marry the deceased, their life insurance policy kicks in immediately.

Disappointed favorite part left out,"I thought it was a good movie, just very disappointed my favorite scene where Alice held Bella ""hostage"" was not included. I think it should have been in there. That part of the book had humor and passion. Alice got the car as payoff and then Bella called Edward and was angry and forgave him very easily when he got home and the scene that followed would have been great where Bella ""got the wrong impression."" I just think the scenes were too rushed and cut off. I understand they couldn't put everything in the book in, but it was just very ""choppy"" with several of the scenes. But overall, I did really enjoy the movie and I think all of the actors were great.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best ""Twilight"" film","That's not saying much though, cause the film still lacks a lot of qualities that would deem a film enjoyable. They are pumping these films out like it's nobodies business and unfortunately they are making boatloads of cash. New Moon, the worst of the three, was misguided and had no interesting conflict, other than who Bella should date. Finally the series gives the viewers a showdown of violence as the ""vampires"" and shape-shifters take on a new army of ""vampires"".There is a quote on the internet that best describes my feelings towards the series and it compares it to the other mega cash cow Harry Potter. ""Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity. Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend."" Now, despite what you may think, I don't hate the series. If I did I wouldn't watch them and flame Twilight messageboards. Instead I go in with an open mind. Yet for some reason the series continues to impress me with how lazy and boring it is.I sit here wondering though, what could possibly happen in the next two films. I get the fact that they get married and have a kid, but it seems like a epilogue that is going to be stretched out way too long. The immediate conflict with Victoria is solved. So unless some kind of Volturi stuff happens (most likely), are two more films really necessary? The answer is no. They took a page right out of Harry Potter's book and decided to split the last film in two so they could make twice as much money. The young girls still flock to see a shirtless cry complain about wanting to be with a girl and a moody guy who no one understand but her. In real life do young girls have to choose between such an incredibly shallow pair of boys?Eclipse happens to have the best fight sequences and dialogue that doesn't suck. The characters finally seem comfortable in their roles, despite still not reaching what I would call, quality acting. Kristen Bell herself, for whatever reason, looks totally different in this film than the previous one. Not a complaint, just something I noticed. She still lacks the strength (if there were any to begin with) the character so desperately needs to be interesting. These characters don't really seem to change. They have been saying the same stuff in every single film. Jacob cries because he wants to be with Bella. Edward wants to be with Bella, but doesn't want her to become a ""vampire"". Bella still wants to leave any career aspirations at home, along with her friends and family and kill herself to be with a boy.The most interesting scene in the whole film is when Jacob and Edward finally sit down to talk one on one without Bella interrupting. Could this be a sign of maturity?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An astonishing achievement for the Twilight film series! A very enjoyable addition to it!,"My goodness! I never thought I would be saying this! But I actually really enjoyed Eclispe! This coming from a guy years ago who couldn't stand the first one! I saw the second New Moon at university because lots of friends who were girls beg me to see it with them at the film society and I mildly enjoyed it.Since writing the review for New Moon. I have taken to reading the books. I wanted to partly see if it was just the making of the two films that was the problem of why they were bad or that the books were the cause, well it was the films. The books are immensely enjoyable, the best for me being Breaking Dawn. In the books the chemistry between Edward and Bella is there, but that has been missing completely from the movies. And even Bella's happiness of smiling and laughing in the book was never apparent in either film.I think since New Moon, the new director David Slade has made huge improvements and he has to be commended. The first of the improvements which I have been hoping for was improvement in the acting of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as Bella and Edward because in Twilight and New Moon they couldn't act. They mumbled there lines, sounded dull and bored with zip chemistry between them. But I'm amazed and very pleased to say, their acting has improved! Kristen has come the furthest. She had injected more emotion into her voice when delivering her lines and I can for the first time actually believe she cares about Edward. She also smiled and laughed! Something else that has been missing from the films that were apparent in the first two books. There were times where Stewart did fall flat of delivering her lines as her acting was still very bad in places, but she has improved and has at least stopped along with Pattinson the annoying habit of pausing before finishing a sentence, which brings me on to Pattinson. He has become better in his acting too. The anguish he felt at certain points in the film where Bella is in danger was clear and it made me feel sorry for him. Also the argument between him and Jacob was tense. He still delivers a lots of his lines deadpanned, but there were instances like Stewart where he injected more believability into his role.What has also helped these two actors more is the scriptwriters. The dialogue is even less cheesy than New Moon (though there were still parts that were) and thankfully as mentioned flows naturally without any awkward pauses. Furthermore for the first time there was actually romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward, something that had been seriously lacking and had been desperately needed in the last two movies. When they are kissing in the meadow or Edward's bed. The chemistry was electric, which was something I wasn't expecting. Slade wisely uses extreme close up shots to show this.Other parts of the film like the special effects were stunning as the other actors and actresses like Taylor Lautner who plays Jacob, like Xavier Samuel as Riley or Bryce Howard as Victoria did well in their supporting roles. The action sequences and there was more that made me like it even more was choreographed superbly, the scenery was stunning, the music was also nice, there were some good moments of comedy like when Jacob kisses Bella and she punches him in the nose and gets a broken hand for it was funny and I also liked the story more than the others. In terms of relating it to the books I have to say David Slade did a great job keeping in the essence of the story going (considering I thought Eclispe was the weakest book) even though scenes were cut out. Normally like the majority of others on IMDb I would severely criticise this film, but I cannot accommodate them this time. I agree with the few on here who have given this a higher rating. Improvements still need to be made particularly with Stewart and Pattinson, but they should be proud of themselves for doing better and I am glad there acting is improving along with some great chemistry with the characters. David Slade has made the franchise come in leaps and bounds and has to be commended for a terrific achievement. I look forward to Breaking Dawn with high hopes it will be even better. My expectations for the franchise has just been raised. I recommend Eclispe as a great summer film. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Impressed with its awfulness,"I sat there waiting for something to pull me in...and waited... and waited... and then caught myself rolling my eyes at some supposedly heart-wrenching moment. From that point on, I just played with my phone while the story ground to a sludgy conclusion.The plot is enough for maybe 30 mins. The rest of the film is padded with ridiculously wooden actors supposedly wrestling with intense emotions. We know this because they say so, in flat, deadpan voices, and kiss occasionally. They certainly don't display any convincing emotional realism!Actually the only character who showed anything like watchable acting was the evil Victoria. The contrast with the others was amazing. I've seen the heroine and Pattison in other things where they were better, so can only assume that the directing was the problem, not the actors.The thing that held my interest most was the ridiculousness of the vampire myth in this film. They move around in daylight, but can't go out in the sun (so the hero spends a weekend in Florida, hiding from the rays. Stupid, eh?). They have absurd colour changing contact lenses (sorry, eyes), but no one notices - or thinks that an adoptive family maybe shouldn't have so many resemblances? They all wear wigs, or spend so much time and money on their hair that it must swallow half their lives (sorry, deaths).I'm struggling to think of another film that was this bad. I think only 'Mortal Combat' and 'Rambo 3' come close.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A guilty pleasure,"My favorite from the whole Twilight saga. Not the best acting, not the best actors, not the best story. However, it is great light-hearted fun and a feel good movie.

Too slow at the start,"Continuing where the 2nd film ends this one tells the third stage of Bella's choice making process. She's still tossing and turning between Edward and Jacob, and that is starting to make less and less sense to the people watching the films but not reading the books (like me). Still, the story goes on. And, since it continues where the previous one left off, this one makes no sense when watched on its own.The film then. It starts slowly with the normal twisting and turning of the days - normal when you consider your boyfriend is a vampire and another friend you care about is a werewolf. All is well in the world, but there's something brewing just a few cities away. It looks like the start of something nasty, something that will have to be dealt with and that seems to be too big for the Cullen clan to handle on their own.This story is one of the two red lines through the film - the other one is the obvious love triangle between Bella and the two guys and convoluted as that one might seem it still isn't enough to fill the first half of the film - it's just too slow with too many long stretches of nothingness. The 2nd half the film picks up speed and becomes quite all right, but it doesn't make the film as a whole work out. It's not enough, even though it's enjoyable (if you're very bored).6 out of 10 sparkling vampires",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Only one good scene.,"I'm not really into the Twilight Saga, having only seen Twilight and now Eclipse.Five minutes into the movie I could see how boring it was going to turn out.The acting is still wooden and to be honest I think the actors don't get into their characters. They try but I think there is a thin veil of hatred for the characters and to them it is just a franchise and money on the side.What I mean is I saw The Runaways with Kristen Stewart and Daktoa Fanning and both actors have far more emotions, expressions and seem to really get into character as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. While on Eclipse their skills are so wooden, Kristen as Bella is still a blank canvas only slightly going ""Oh no Jacob don't fight Edward"" with a stunned fish expression.Robert tries to capture Edward but as I said they seem sick of the character.The fight scene was the only worth while scene. Sorry this isn't going to be in my DVD collection.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than New Moon but still not good enough.,"While New moon's story sequence was pretty bad, it actually improved in Eclipse. Sad thing is, the scenes were too cheesy and fake to look at. The CGI for the background is also very lame. It was like they were just place in the setting like how cartoons are. The musical scoring was hideous too. They don't go together most of the time.We can't deny the fact that The Twilight Saga was originally written as a love story, but the director selected all of the cheesy lines of the book and fitted it all in 2 hours. As a result, the movie looked cheap and corny. It wasn't romantic anymore because of this.Twilight's musical scoring was very impressive. New moon was also good. Here in Eclipse, i felt like I was watching an old epic flick. Though they tried to make it better by inserting some emo-rock song, it was still very bad. Most of them were very classical and it didn't fit into the teen chick flick movie it's suppose to be.The action scenes were pretty impressive. But they looked as if they were just placed in the feature. I don't know if they lack the budget or what. Judging from the outcome, seems like they did. To add to everything, they styro-slash-mannequin for the dead zombies was too much. Too much cheapness I mean. Why can't they use a better representation?If you ask me if I would still watch Eclipse had I known all these, the answer would still be yes. Not because I liked the movie or the book. But just for the heck of it. Next year, I hope it'll be better.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What....?!?!?!?!??!,"A movie should do just that; move you. This movie moved something in me..... But they weren't the right things that got moved. First off I should admit that I did not read the books. I was going to after NEW MOON, but now.... You know, the Harry Potter-movies made me want to read the books after not wanting to do the ¨sheep-thing¨ and worshiping the books/movies with rest of world. But this movie did nothing to promote the books. OK maybe I am too old (30) for the teen-love-stuff. But I cannot believe teens will actually swoon at watching this movie.

Please explain?,"What I do not understand about the Twilight furore is that, judging by billboards, the tabloids and 'Women's Magazines' would have us believe Pattinson and Stewert are an 'item', really 'in love', yet most critics comment that they have no on-screen chemistry and their acting together is unconvincing and 'hammy'. I've only seen 'Twilight', as an in-flight movie on the long-haul from HK to London, so not the best ambiance, and I found RP and KS totally unconvincing. RP seems genuinely to be a bad actor. 'Little Ashes' and 'Remember Me' both got terrible reviews. His acting was described as 'wooden'. He was OK as Cedric in HP4, but then it's a tiny part and he really only had to look good and be 'nice'. I've not seen KS in anything else, so cant judge her ability, but she seems to be equally wooden and limited. So, my question is: Can either RP or KS really act and what is all the fuss about? The story is some of the worst tripe I've ever struggled through - only because my students think the books are good and I needed to disillusion them.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Avoid this movie unless you're a teenage girl in love with Edward,"The hype surrounding the Twilight saga ensures that movie houses are filled to capacity for this third installment, but the truth is that this film is so bad it should be shredded. The plot is so weak that if it wasn't for the endless (and boring) conversation between Bella and Edward about whether she should become a vampire there would be no plot at all. The rationale for the attack of the newborns is feeble and Bella's familial relationships vacuous. If the characters were one-dimensional they would gain a full dimension in weight. The absurd inconsistencies are, in fact, the only source of entertainment -- like the fact that Bella struggles with hypothermia while in her big thick sleeping bag but, the next morning, stands outside in the snow in a light fleece without so much as a shiver. The movie, obviously, targets teenage girls in love with Pattinson and Lautner; everyone else should avoid it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"This series gets better every time, but still . . .","I am a fan of the book series. I read the series after being forced into it by my neighbor whom I mistakenly told that I kind of liked the first movie.After reading the books, a soft spot in my heart for these movies formed and I am thus forced to venture out into the darkness in the wee small hours of the morning and fight my way through middle schoolers dressed up as wolves to see the newest installment.I wasn't aware the movie had even started, in fact, I was still riding the high of seeing the Harry Potter preview on the big screen--I simply thought it was another preview. And then I realized it was Riley. Great opening scene. The movie is slightly rushed in the beginning, understandable due to time constraints. Many of the scenes left me wishing for just a few extra lines--words even. When you jumble scenes you must keep the characters motives consistent. I loved this movie, but as a fan of the book was a bit annoyed by the portrayel of the main character's love triangle. The character's actions didn't quite match or maybe they just weren't conveyed properly due to cut scenes--either way Bella seems even more obnoxious, Jacob isn't as devious, and Edward comes off like a jealous pansy.That said, this picture is by far the most visually stunning. Thank goodness they fixed the Cullen's hair and make-up---New Moon was unacceptable. Rosalie's wig should have been burned. The background stories of Jaz and Rose are perfect--Jaz is awesome. And then there is Charlie . . . he is just so . . .well . . .you just want to hug Billy Burke. I can't imagine anyone else as Bella's dad. I think the acting is improving as well, there are some moments in this movie that are really quite good.So, all in all--It was worth listening to the cat calls, the applause at the end of all the good scenes, the heckling of either team and the ridiculous comments from people who haven't read the books. It wasn't perfect, but no book adaptation is. There are a few good zingers in there that'll give your date a chuckle, fan or not. :D",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not for Everyone,"The Twilight movie series takes a beating from males over the age of 15 and anyone that turns their nose up at this kind of movie entertainment. But I can kind of see what they are trying to do, and these movies are just another way for teens to escape from the world for a little while and forget how difficult it is to be a teenager. Not being a teenager anymore I have a hard time seeing the attraction but, like I said, I can understand why these movies and books are so popular.After seeing The Twilight Saga: Eclipse and what Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has done to himself, it is not difficult to understand why these movies are popular with mature women all over the world as well. Not to say that all mature women chase much younger men in movies, but Robert Pattinson does tell some interesting stories about being approached by older women in ways that would embarrass a lady of the evening.But fan activity towards actors and actresses is not really anything new. I am sure Harry Potter gets his fair share of older women making embarrassing offers to him. The thing here is the movie, and this movie is OK.I look at these Twilight movies from the perspective of someone just looking for a good story. Sometimes you find it here, sometimes you do not. The obvious focus on the young teenage girl audience creates elements that make this movie really hard to watch for me at times.Kristen Stewart's performance could have been done by a store mannequin. She shows no emotion, and her allegiance to Jacob and Edward flips constantly. It can actually get quite frustrating.The teenage-focused love scenes, and the at-length discussions between Jacob and Edward about who gets Bella (like she is some sort of mannequin for sale at a store), really make the movie drag. You get glimpses of some very cool action, and some really great drama as well, but it gets watered down in the teenage girl angle. It is too bad because, as vampire and werewolf stories go, this one is not bad. But in order for this to work for the average viewer, there needs to be substance that is augmented by sappy love scenes and mindless dialogue. This movie is sappy love scenes and mindless dialogue augmented, a little, by some very good action and drama scenes.If you like the books, then you will like the movies. The movies do not stray very far from the books at all. If you are not a fan of those kinds of books, then this film does not offer you a whole lot to look forward to.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipse,"I went to watch this movie with my girlfriend cause she insisted that we go. I wish I never would have wasted my money. Its a movie for teen girls. And really it sends a bad message to all young females. Bella loves Edward then she loves Jacob then its back to Edward and then who knows, it could jasper next. Sending a message to be in love with more then one person is wrong. If you are in love someone then there should not be someone else. I rate it a five because of the sarcastic and funny things Jacob would say throughout the movie. He kept it real!!! Now Jacob you know all the girls love you, you don't need Bella I seen plenty of other fine girls in the Twilight movies, Holla at one of them.

An exercise in tedium,"After suffering through the last two Twilight's I only figured it made sense to follow through with the rest of the series, having never read the books and never wanting to suffer through that as well. Eclipse seems to follow the same tones and moods of it predecessors. It doesn't improve upon anything and seems to be entirely built around vacant expressions, bland dialogue and Kristen Stewart walking around looking ""worried"" (I guess thats her range, emo and worried) I still don't see this epic love between Edward and Bella, they seem to go around each other like they still don't know quite how to act and are very awkward and lack chemistry. Everything else is about boring as a Twilight film can be, not really really adding any level of dimension to the characters.In short, good for the tweens (at least it gets them reading) but bad for anyone who expects anything resembling vampire lore",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Once again... EPIC fail.,"Okay let me start out by saying this installment along wth the other two fails. I read the books and I was never particularly fond of them... I'm a Harry Potter shipper. The books have always lacked the dimension and depth that really makes a book, or series. A standout. There was none of complexity in the books that I love about HP. Twilight Saga is completely one sided and easily forgettable in my eyes. And the movies.. Oh my they are HORRENDOUS! The acting is well, one sided. Once again no complexity or even chemistry. The actors aren't believable. At all. And these movies WOULD NOT be the success they are if it weren't for crazed Tweens and teens. Being a teen female myself, I just don't see it. I can't stand Lautner's, Pattinson's, or Stewarts acting. Oh and to some of the reviewers mentioning how haters don't understand the deeper story line or whatever that bull is.... There is NO deeper story line, the plot is weak and it's all just one sided fluff.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME...

'Eclipse'?  More like Boring.,"First, let me clarify: I hate Twilight. I could give you a million reasons why I hate the books and the movies, but I won't. I only went to the movie a) to see if it would be any good, and b) to poke fun at it. Even after I started hating the series, Eclipse was still my favorite. So, of course, I thought that maybe the movie wouldn't be too bad. But was I wrong.I mean, even from an unbiased point of view, it still stands that the movie was just downright boring. I felt myself wishing for scenes where no one was talking. The script was, in my opinion, poorly written and very predictable, just like in the two previous movies. The characters were flat and the acting horrible. I'm starting to wonder if the actors are being bad on purpose. The ending felt as if they were just brushing it all away, like, ""Well, that was our little adventure. Let's go back to our normal lives and forget all this, shall we?"" There was no big cliffhanger ending, no sudden, gripping desire for me to see Breaking Dawn. In short, it was a complete and utter waste of two hours.On a last, more positive note, the movie did have a few redeeming points. The action scenes were great (especially the first one with Victoria) and well-executed. I also liked Charlie and Bella's 'talk'; it was nice to see Kristen Stewart actually showing some emotion for once. But one of the top moments was when Riley and his little army were emerging from the water (I was practically squealing at the epicness). Also, the movie seemed well directed.But overall, it was boring, it was predictable, and by the end of it, I wanted my money back.

""" The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" aka the battle of Edward and Jacob for Bella's love.","""Eclipse"" picks up right where ""New Moon"" left off. Edward and Bella are hopelessly in love with one another and talks about their marriage begins. In the mix of all this happiness, there is a huge battle brewing between the newborn army lead by the evil Victoria and the Cullen family. On top of all this the love triangle between Edward and Jacob continue as Jacob is still determined to win Bella's heart. Lots of suspense, romance and even some action pursue.While there are a lot of things going on in this film, the battle for Bella's heart was the primary focus. Robert Pattinson's Edward really becomes passionate about his love for Bella in this film. The relationship becomes truly believable here. Taylor Lautner's Jacob frustration with trying to win Bella's heart is equally believable here. I actually feel bad for him and that's pretty odd. I really liked how in ""Eclipse"" that Edward and Jacob have become comedic with one another. The humor between these characters really worked in the film. Kristen Stewart seems to be fitting into her Bella shoes nicely and you can tell her character is maturing and growing as the series goes on. I really liked how in this film Rosalie's and Jasper's back stories were fleshed out especially Rosalie's, which I felt gave her character more depth. I can't really complain about the acting or the character development in the film because I think they did a good job with it.David Slade was definitely the best director for the franchise so to speak. Like many other critics have already stated Slade really made this film feel like a blockbuster rather than an independent film. I think his unique work behind the camera really worked for this franchise. When I watched Slade's ""Hard Candy"" a few weeks back I said to myself he is going to be a great director for ""Twilight"" and I am glad that opinion became fact. The film's direction is probably the highlight of the film and the way Slade got the characters to play off one another. I also liked the subtle humor that Slade added to the franchise something that made the other films feel more stiff and this one a little more relaxed. Great job Mr. Slade.Now as for my complaints: The first is the build up. The build up for the ""battle"" made me very angry with the film. From about 15 minutes into the film, there is this talk about this battle of the newborns lead by Victoria. Throughout the entire film this point keeps being brought up, when the moment finally arrives the result is just disappointing. Without giving anything away, this battle that is being built up from the first 15 minutes requires both the Cullen's and the werewolves to work as a team. This pretty much serves as the subplot of the film and the epic battle lasts at most 10 minutes. This is without a doubt the biggest disappointment in ""Eclipse."" Your waiting and waiting for this excitement and it feels like a slap in the face when it happens. Now I can't say that this is the first film to do this in recent years because ""Alice in Wonderland"" as well as ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" both have done similar things. They build up what is suppose to be an epic battle and instead its this lame ass scene that feels like it's 2 minutes long.As for the second and third complaint well those go hand in hand. I know this is a teen vampire flick but are the numerous make out sessions necessary? I mean we get the point they love each other so we don't really need one every 15 minutes to reinforce it. Also and this isn't the film's fault but Stephanie Meyer's fault, this series needs some sex. The sexual tension in this film you can cut with a knife it's so thick. I know its trying not to focus on sex but love but if any film needed some sex ""Twilight"" does. I find it funny because ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight"" are very similar as far as story lines go but with one main difference. ""True Blood"" focuses too much on the sexual aspect, which of course makes it more appealing to the male audience, and ""Twilight"" has no focus on it at all. Learn a lesson here make a film or television series that uses both these ideas and equally balance them. I never thought I would ask for a film to contain some sex but man it definitely needs it.In the end does ""Eclipse"" live up to all the hype? From my perspective it does not but apparently from die-hard ""Twi-hards"" it does. I felt that the film was a good entry in the ""Twilight Saga"" however this franchise from a film lovers perspective does not offer anything ground breaking. The ""Twilight"" films are truly a guilt pleasure for those who like them. I appreciate them for what they are a unique fluffy vampire/werewolf tale from a female perspective. The big thing that makes me favor ""New Moon"" over ""Eclipse"" was the build up for the epic battle that just fell flat. If that was better executed I would say this would have been the best film in the franchise but because that was disappointing I would say ""Eclipse"" is still behind ""New Moon."" For those who loved the book, ""Eclipse"" is the most loyal to the book. David Slade is definitely the best director yet for the franchise and the film overall finishes up nicely. The film itself is a lot darker and definitely more violent than the previous entries. Overall, its a good film that keeps the true fans wanting more, but offers just more of the same for the everyday movie goer.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My guess it has to do with the fact that like me they are kind of tired of the hype that has been given to certain things like Jacob's chest and not the actual love story that is happening. Or because they have finally realized how stupid the actual concept of the story sounds.I myself have read all the books, and have for the most part enjoyed all the movies. I don't think it deserves higher than a six because it just wasn't amazing, it didn't wow me and the acting was terrible to say the least. But I am a loyal fan, I liked the story and I am not afraid to say so and yes I have read other books. I am not an over obsessing teenager, who dreams of a romance with a vampire and can't get over how hot Taylor Lautner has gotten.The movie was way too acted out, these actors for the most part do not know how to act at all. Taylor unfortunately is not the best actor in the world, and ended up being a bit too dramatic for my liking. And lets not mention Robert Pattinson and his very furious faces; it was beyond annoying. I don't even want to get started with Kristen because just hearing her awkward voice makes me flinch.So why did I dress up, on a Friday night to go see a movie that I knew had so many wrong things going for it? I think I did it because I am loyal to the story and my curiosity couldn't stop me from playing out.It had its cute moments and I have to give it up for the man who plays Charlie because he alone drags this whole movie around. Without him, I strongly believe the Twilight Movies would have died long ago. My favorite scenes would have definitely been the ending ( and not because I wanted it to finish), and the snow scene ( although I can't quite say why). It was decent, if you are a twilight loving teenager then you won't be disappointed with the many showings of Taylor Lautner's very poised behind. ( no nude scenes though)I also wanted to say that I enjoyed finally hearing some of the characters actually talking now, (finally the vampires speak)So I suggest you go see it, it is really not that bad, we were sitting next to an old couple and they truly enjoyed as well. Try not to go watch it in places with many teenagers because you will hear a lot of noise and hopefully you will have better luck getting seats then the ones I got.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is This Film Over Rated?,"I have not read any of the books as yet..in fact the first movie I did not see until a friend burned a copy of it and brought it over one evening. Seeing that I have always liked vampire lore and such..I really thought I would like these films more than I did. I never could understand the hype over the ridiculous ""Team Edward/Tea am Jacob"" junk either...but that is a different story..(OK..it was dumb)..anyway...the story is..Bella LOVES Edward...but...wait..here is Jacob..whom longs for her to LOVE him too. Either guy is not going to be a healthy thing for Bella..both could kill her or cause her to be killed at any moment. How romantic. Then there is Bellas' father..who wears a badge...but never seems to be able to notice HUGE wolves running in the forests or the fact that Edward NEVER eats or drinks. Some observant guy/father he is. Apparently wolves smell..and vampires detest that and whoa..vampires are UNDEAD...and werewolves detest that. It all boils down to Indian lore...passed along through the years. Bella just part of that lore somehow..it is her destiny. Meanwhile..she has become close with both families..wolves and vampire...most of them anyway. When the Newbloods show up...new vampires who do not understand their powers yet and are vicious to kill...they wreak havoc on the town..and of course...Jacob and Edward decide they have to deal with it together..putting their hatred aside...to save Bella yet again. Frankly, I was expecting more...but the parts that should have been dramatic and involved ended too quickly. The fight scene should have been intense..but it was really not. The vampire who stirred up the problems to begin with was destroyed without much fanfare..it seemed to easy..why did it take so long? I liked it...and didn't like it at the same time. You almost wished for Edward to go ahead and BITE her..get it over with so she stops being such a tease...and we all know that Jacob is buff...he is powerful as a wolf....stop showing us over and over. We get it. He is tone and tan...while Edward sparkles and is pasty white. Both also have gross feeding habits...can you say ""bad breath""?. Teenage romance has never been so dramatic. Blockbuster? Maybe...according the the box office sales. A timeless film that will NEVER be forgotten? Sorry...no...it is not one of those.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit lame,"I am forced to compare this against other love stories and conclude that this one is rather lame indeed. When reading the Twilight saga books I guess it is way better. In the books it can be seen as about being positive and hopeful. But the movie builds an elaborate ""castle of cards"" which collapse towards the end of the movie. If the first half hour did not bore you, then the ending is guaranteed to. I refuse to believe that teenagers are so mindless. I have more faith in teenagers and young humans than this movie would make me believe. This was a brilliant chance to make a superb movie and now that chance is lost.

A solid and frequently enjoyable film.,"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, commonly referred to as Eclipse, is a 2010 American romantic fantasy film based on Stephenie Meyer's 2007 novel Eclipse and the 2010 companion novella The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner. It is the third installment of The Twilight Saga film series, following 2008's Twilight and 2009's New Moon. Directed by David Slade, the film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively.High school student Bella is haunted by the revengeful vampire Victoria. Amid this, she is coerced to deal with her graduation and a crucial choice between love and friendship.Twilight Eclipse is a convincing piece of entertainment that illustrates the franchise starting beginning to realize its full potential. What elevates Eclipse above the previous Twilight films is that it doesn't take itself so seriously and Slade doesn't allow his stars to. Eclipse is Darker, grittier, and a tad more thought-provoking than the previous installments. The mythology finally feels comfortable in its own skin, aware of both its strengths and limitations, It embraces its own sense of camp and is consistently funny in an intentional way.Eclipse breaks the mold at the hands of a craftsman. It becomes something new and surprisingly unlike what has come before, It's a nice mix of comedy and action, especially with the running gag of Jacob appearing shirtless to Edwards eye-rolling dismay. All three actors are comfortable with their characters and Slade finds the right balance of action and romance; the story feels organic bringing a smoother, more confident style and tone that balances the romance and the violence in a way that gives the film more weight. Eclipse is a solid and frequently enjoyable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""It's Not Modern, It's Ancient""","And that is probably one of the most thought provoking quotes said in Eclipse, the third movie in the Twilight film series based off of the books by Stephenie Meyer who has denied ever having watched a single episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I believe her. If Meyer had seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series she would have easily avoided the many clichés that sprinkle her book: the forbidden romance between a human girl and a supernatural being; werewolves as the symbol of unveiled masculinity; vampires as the symbol of the outsiders of society.To her credit, Meyer does do some original things with the werewolf and vampire mythos. Who else would have thought to make vampires sparkly underneath the sun? And doesn't every vampire movie have their own set of rules? Buffy, Underworld and even Nosferatu both had different takes on the mythos and the Twilight Series isn't any different.After two movies, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) seem to finally be happy with each other. If only she could still be friends with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who's heart she broke in the previous movie. If only that darn Victoria would stop trying to kill her. It appears that Victoria (Bryce Howard Dallas) has been making an army of the undead to come and attack Bella and it's up to her vampire friends and an alliance with their enemies the werewolves to save the day. Of course, Edward is a vampire and Jacob, Bella's other beau is a werewolf. Jacob spends most of the time with his shirt off - and for a brief moment naked - in his human form. This is the heart of the story really, this never ending love triangle, not the shirtless teen.The movie is very well paced and full of self referential humor. Edward asks Bella in one scene if the mostly bare chested Jacob even owns a shirt and Jacob in a later scene replies to Edward ""I am hotter than you."" The film does suffer from too many scenes of Bella and Edward conversing in what appears to be conversations they've already had a dozen times. Some of the editing seems sloppy. In one scene, it was very obvious that not all of the actors were all there at the time of shooting. The film also suffers from way too many oddly framed close-ups.Eclipse already has a built in audience, so no matter how I review this film, it's going to make the money it has been destined to make and more. It's worth a watch, and it's very well acted compared to the first two, but personally I feel out of it's teenage demographic.http://neonboy619.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible but it's better than the first two,"Unfortunately I was roped into taking my sisters to this and New Moon (and saw the first movie as they watched the DVD over and over.) After the first two movies I was actually a little surprised by this one; sure there is still the terrible acting, the average special effects and the sappy ""love"" story (seriously, when is Edward going to fess up to Bella that he's really gay and that's why he won't 'seal the deal'?).I was able to get past what I knew was coming and find some enjoyment in the slightly dark tinge this movie added with Victoria and her army. I've always thought DB Howard was a pretty boring actor but she definitely brought something to this movie.I still thought it was pretty darn bad but at least I didn't spend the whole 2 hours actively hating everyone on the screen and looking at my watch.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
20 minutes-,"So i'm going to be truthful and say that I didn't spend money on watching the movie- don't get me wrong i'm a fan of the BOOKS but the first movie that they came out I thought that they did a very sucky job at picking some of the actors they messed a lot and left out very important information that the people were supposed to be told before the second movie came, and even then the second movie people were supposed to be shown some things and they were not, and as for the third....well twenty minutes into the movie I fell asleep! The movie was so boring, I couldn't believe that I was able to even sit thru the second movie, and now i know why. The people did a every bad sucky job at making the movies that this newest one...was so much sucker then before- lmao I'm not kidding I fell asleep sitting at my friends house, i wasn't tired so don't tell me it was because I was over tired. In fact my friend who was watching it with me didn't even last forty-five minutes into the movie. She shut off it, so i'm sorry to say, that the whole twenty minutes that I did watch the movie....I give it twenty thumbs down- & I fear for the next movie Breaking dawn",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I think Eclipse was great! It had humor, romance, action, thrill, good-looking people! Haha, you name it! All the actors did a really good job and it was fun to see new characters/people so it felt like a different movie and not all the same. I haven't read all the books so I can't compare with that but I like to watch the movie first because I like the thrill, and for me this movie was so freakin' good!I really enjoyed this movie and to be true I'm now in Team Jacob.

On expected terms - but still gripping!,"I went to watch the movie bravely an hour after reading the comments here. I came to read the reviews just for the heck of it but an avg of 4.1 for the rating intrigued me.Was it really that bad? .... Heck no!!! I wonder if people expect some vampire, werewolf battles in this movie series more than the central theme.. which is simply 'love'. I agree it does get a bit cheesy here n there but I guess thats what should be expected in teenage love stories even if it does involve the creatures mentioned before.Yeah she does not have lot of expressions on her face .. so? Does that make her a bad actor? I think that is part of the character and she would have messed it up if she were showing her obsession for Edward like a blonde cheer girl (No offense .. just trying to get you to picture it).I liked the way they showed the history of a couple of the Cullens. It gave the characters a lot more personality than before.A lot of smooching and cuddling... yeah... not for the people who like war movies and LoTR kinda stuff.I am not going to say that it is an awesome movie. Just that its a genre by itself and you need to have an open mind and have seen the first 2 parts before you go for this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People are too harsh on this movie,"after reading the reviews on here, i have concluded that people are content to give it either a 1 or a 10. it does not deserve either. let me say that i am a HUGE fan of the books, but i thought that the second movie was not very good. after watching this movie, i conclude that a lot of people that write these reviews will hate on it no matter what! i bet a lot of people didn't even see the movie. the movie is not perfect, but it is enjoyable and isn't predictable. the effects are pretty good, though not the best. the acting has improved in some areas (like rob pattinson) but Taylor laughtner is a weak point. i am not saying this will be an amazing movie, but it isn't awful. the story is better developed than the others, and you really feel for the characters. although, something that bothered me with all the movies: the actors all talk low and slowly.overall, the movie is worth your while, and ignore haters that will not admit that this movie had good in it.overall, 6.5/ 10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A masterpiece considering the lack of story and idea,"We all know what Twilight is all about - it's a fiction novel written by a woman with no talent or writing abilities.Still, the new Twilight movie was made as good as it was possible considering the fact that the book is unworthy of reading, let alone ecranisation.The plot is very well paced, not too fast, nor too slow, although there are the usual pathetic one-on-one scenes that drag. Eclipse joins other Twilight movies in being visually beautiful, with gorgeous scenery and 'burned' colors. The soundtrack is also well done, maybe I missed more indie rock since instrumental and classical pieces prevailed.Acting, well... I didn't expect much anyway. But there was one actor that simply amazed me with his lack of talent, playing his role like he was found that day on the street and was paid 100$ to take part of - Jacob. Yes, Taylor Lautner does not know how to act to save his life. Apart from taking his shirt off and looking like a child on horse steroids, he managed to ruin every scene he was in, specially the scenes when his desperation and anger was suppose to erupt. I haven't noticed before how bad he was. Maybe it was due to the fact that in previous films he had no more than few lines in his scenes. Maybe it was due to the fact that his nudity distracted me. Anyway, he's very bad. Very.Robert and Kirsten are usually numb, they are probably both bored and don't really try. Kirsten is a tad better than in the past few movies, she doesn't breathe as much and smiles here and there.What is also new in Eclipse, was the amount of erotic/kissing scenes. Almost everyone was sucking the life out of each other as soon there was even the slightest chance.There are a few very good humorous scenes, well done, with word plays or interesting situations.Summa summarum, Eclipse is the best Twilight movie so far, with minimal amount of cheesy dialogues and unnecessary romantic scenes. I would even call it a masterpiece since I've read the books and know that their substance is lack of brain, talent or writing abilities. So yes, they have made it as good as they possibly could. It does not get better for Twilight than this.All the negative reviews you will read, just ignore them. The Twilight franchise itself is not cinematography's peak accomplishment, but this is a good Twilight film. Do not expect Dark knight, but do not expect Dracula 3000 either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's okay but not great.. nowhere close to first two editions!!,"Twilight 3 is okay but not great. To say the least it is no where close to editions 1 & 2. In fairness may be there were great expectations from the movie (at least I had) after enormous success of the Twilight franchise both in printed and visual versions. The pace of the movie is slow and there are lot of conversations, not the usual romantic ones which are hallmark of this series, just the back and forth ones!! It misses on action for a good part and when action arrives, it's nicely executed but then action disappears before one could blink. One thing which amuses me is that in edition-1 Bella was ""unconditionally and irrevocably in Love with Edward"" and by edition-3 she is 'eternally confused'. Come on Stephenie Meyer don't go the Harry Potter way - you could do better!!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Two for/plus one ...,"The third Twilight movie is a bit better than the second one (which was just too much of Kristens character crying/being sad/suicidal etc.), but does that even matter for Twilight fans (I heard they are called ""Twi-Hards"", which is kinda funny) or those who won't watch any of the Twilight movies?I guess not and after I watched it, I was pretty sure it would be more than enough for the fans. Which is not completely true as I found out a couple of days later. Seems that fans do care about the franchise and as a (female) friend of mine told me, she had wished the movie would have looked much better than it does.What does that mean? That it does look a bit cheap (her words), because the set designs and everything else is pretty ""spartan"". I couldn't argue with that, though brining up ""Lord of the Rings"" is not really fair to the Twilight franchise. And I guess the makers were thinking the same thing though. Why spend too much money on those things (when they had to spend money on CGI), if fans only wanted the relationships to look forward too. And a few fight scenes, too of course.And yes, as with every franchise, we do get ""darker"" here. Nothing too much, still teen-friendly, but why would you expect anything else. It is what it is. And since I started watching the whole thing, I will be there for the last (two) part(s), too.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film that is fashionable to hate,"This film has, on this site, attracted a negative reputation. But I'm not really suppressed by that, after all the previous two titles in the series also garnered a considerable degree of criticism. However, I'm not sure this criticism is warranted. I suspect many of the people who have written poor reviews and given the film a low score are jumping on the bandwagon. It seems that films like Twilight, and its offspring, have been branded as chick-flicks, ney, teenie-chick-flicks; and thus open to any criticism and without merit, by male viewers (or as I suspect in many cases individuals who have judged the film based on reputation as opposed to viewing).This view is not warranted, if you willing to remain open-minded and ignore that various male prejudices regarding the plot, the bulk of which are both juvenile and in many cases rather chauvinistic, the film is actually quite reasonable.That is not to say that the film is not without genuine problems. For example, the primary female character Bella is an entirely two dimensional entity that fluctuates between bitter fluctuating reflection of her relationship with Jacob and morbid obsession with Edward. This results in pallid pouting through out the duration of the film. But then again, I have met self-obsessed teenagers that the film reminds me of, and in fairness Bella is equally vapid in the books. I also found the film rather patronising in places, providing sign post commentary for the most basic of observations and, rather than leave an explanation of various obvious plot developments to the intellect of the audience, instead chooses to excruciating to spell it out. But, again, the book does that too.These issues aside, the film was actually rather good, aesthetically impressive and backed by an apt sound track. The film also kept a reasonable pace through for the duration despite being drawn from a novel in excess of 600 pages. Given the fact that the film is in excess of two hours, the achievement of retaining a good pace without condensing the plot into incoherence was most welcome. I was also impressed by the actors portraying the three main characters, given the rather bland characters Meyer provided them to work with, I thought they did a lot. There is also something to be said for the films gender politics. On the one hand I am not a fan of Meyer's literary attempt at an advert for 'Purity rings', but it is hard to blame the film for addressing the central underlying theme of the source material. On the other, however, it is good to see a Hollywood franchise attempting to cater for a female audience by placing male flesh on display; as opposed to the typical routine of filling films with breasts and bottoms in an attempt to add appeal for teenage boys. For too long film makers have seen the female body as a commodity, and at last they have begun to broaden their horizons. But most of all the film was, despite its various flaws and vapid characters (all of which can be placed at the door of the author), was actually entertaining and I left the cinema not feeling as if I had been cheated. While I did not have quite the same admiration for the film as many of the rapturous individuals in the packed screening I attended, both myself and my girlfriend, who is not a fan of the series I should add, both enjoyed it.So all in all I thought this film was a flawed, if, fair effort and that much of the criticism surrounding it is simply because it is Twilight film, and that such an enterprise will always attract a negative, and unwarranted, reputation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The only thing that was good was the previews. Specially the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows one. I did watch the preview before, but its way better to watch on the big screen! But other than that, Eclipse sucks really bad!But hey, here is me hoping that next one wont be that bad.

A third installment that's ultimately just more of the same,"While it's certainly been the popular thing to criticize the Twilight series, it's not without good reason. As much as I wanted to enjoy the first two installments, the constant intensity on the melodramatic meter, as well as the annoying-beyond-belief lead characters, make the films nothing more than a soap opera with just a higher production budget. But what about Eclipse , the third entry in the saga? Well, I enjoyed it a bit more than the first twoTo start off with aspects of the film that I actually liked, the way that Eclipse is shot is done much more competently than in Twilight and New Moon . There are several particular images, in fact, that are still looming in my head. Also, the action sequences have a grander feel to them this time around, and – on the whole – end up being pretty fun to watch. This is due in part by the special effects, which I think are a significant step up from those found previously in the series. The wolves, especially, look much more convincing, despite the occasionally apparent green screen.The film also pokes a little bit of fun at itself. It's as if director David Slade said ""Okay, there's no way that we can take some of these scenes seriously."" These types of moments don't occur all that often throughout the film, but the ones that are present go a long way.It's unfortunate, then, that the rest of the film is just what you would come to expect from this series. Edward is still that controlling boyfriend who won't allow Bella to see her friends, Jacob is still that kid who, try as he might, will never exit the ""friend zone,"" and Bella herself is still that two-timing slut who doesn't know what she wants.To be honest, though, there are characters in this series who I genuinely like – specifically, Bella's dad and Edward's family. They're each 100 times more likable and interesting than either of those three. The problem is, though, that neither of them are part of the main cast, and as a result, we're forced to sit through dialogue that's become so melodramatic to the point where I was laughing in my seat, as well as a love triangle that I don't find myself invested in in the slightest.While the overall fun factor has been significantly enhanced this time around, I still can't find myself interested in this aforementioned love triangle that's been set up. It's amazing that, after two hours, it feels like so little happened in the way of this story. For those who are already fans of Twilight , I'm sure that they'll enjoy themselves. For the uninitiated, however, more of the same just isn't going to cut it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"i had low expectations, but...","I won tickets to an advanced screening in Connecticut through Kiss95.7 and really wasn't that big a fan of the first two. The first was too high school-drama-ish to me, and the second i found alittle boring (although i saw it at midnight the day it came out). This one, however, actually had an enjoyable story. They could have done more with it, yes, but it was good all the same. Lautner isn't as bad an actor. Still not good, but he makes baby steps each film. Bella doesn't play with her hair 24/7 in this movie, which is good. and i didn't totally hate edward. So far so good. Director David Slade has added an edge to the film that i think was missing before. It is much more exciting, alittle darker, and didn't bore me to tears. I think he is the real hero here.

"Sue me, but...","I actually found myself enjoying TWILIGHT: ECLIPSE at times, and that's the first time that's happened with a TWILIGHT movie; the first two movies left me cold throughout. This one has flashes of inspiration and there's been an improvement in the direction at the very least, which is all for the better. There's actual drive to the plot, too, with the massing of evil vampires instead of just the same old love-triangle stuff of the last two flicks.There are also signs that the acting is improving, particularly in the case of Robert Pattinson who's more relaxed and less wooden than he was before. I even warmed to Kristen Stewart a little (but only a little). The action sequences, making use of copious CGI effects work, are well handled and 30 DAYS OF NIGHT's David Slade blows the efforts of previous directors out of the water.The film isn't perfect, and it's still a chore to watch in places; Taylor Lautner is ever the weak spot in the cast, and there's a lot of faffing around and sitting around talking when there should be action. But still, it's better than before, and I hope that improvement carries over to the last two in the series.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An overly serious and underwhelming installment,"I have to admit that I really did not enjoy the simplistic and shallow narrative of the first twilight book, however I quite enjoyed the first film, I was impressed with direction of the original director. Though I still find the story fairly childish and naive as a form of light entertainment I would 100% recommend the first film.Moving on to New Moon, which I must admit I have not read, but I watched the film as I wished to see where the film would go after being impressed with the first film. I was unfortunately very disappointed. The direction was uninspired, safe and ugly compared to the original. The special effects were also fairly substandard for such a money making franchise such as this. The story was over dramatic and humourless, and the character of Bella is unrelatable and pathetic.When Eclipse reared it's ugly head I was excited by the director and the prospect of a far more action orientated installment. But I was once again let down by a film that is much the same as New Moon, stilted and lacklustre action sequences, poor computer generated imagary and Bella once again unrelatable and humourless. The two leading gentleman look good but give stiff performances. One thing in Eclipse's favour is the way it's shot. The scenery is stunning and is shown off in subtle and yet grandeur way, so kudos to the director for this but it really is not enough to lift this film from the badly melodramatic and pretty anti-feminist story.I will complete the series too see how it all pans out, but I'm praying that things improve. The producers should get Joss Whedon to come and help them out.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

50/50,"Having read all of the Twilight books a long time before the films were mentioned, I can say that I at least appreciate that it's hard to please everyone when it comes to making a film adaptation of a book, whether that book is popular or not. As I found the first and second films rather cringe-worthy at times due to the acting, I did personally quite like that the producers stuck as close to the book as was possible, and quite a few points that were vague in the book are explained somewhat in the film to which I would go 'Oh yeah, I get that now!' I've always been a grouch when films waver somewhat erratically from their written roots, but fans of the books and the previous films will most likely appreciate the attention to detail that has been a constant throughout the previous films. However, as I mentioned previously (and I hate to admit it as I for one am a lover of cheesy films) I found the acting at times to be quite amateur for such a popular franchise; Stewart just doesn't seem to quite hit the undying love mark that we've seen in other films, and at times I wonder if her chin will actually begin to graze the floor due to the amount of time her mouth is hanging open in what is meant to be a shocked/thoughtful expression; in actuality it comes across as making her look rather gormless and is an annoying little feature that winds me up throughout all of the Twilight films. Unlike the previous two films, I found Eclipse to keep up a decent pace throughout its entirety which is always a plus point for such a lengthy film, and the scenery of it is just amazing; they really picked a beautiful place to film Eclipse- some of this film is jaw-dropping in its beauty. Although, at the end of the day, the beauty in the surroundings means nothing when the dialogue feels empty. It is very rare that you find a film of such popularity to have such dead dialogue in it; rarely when the actors are talking on-screen do you actually feel the emotions that they're meant to be portraying, and for that reason I couldn't really let myself be absorbed into the film, and ended up watching it with half-hearted interest.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally Getting Somewhere,"Twilight was an average indie film, New Moon was a bad Hollywood film, and Eclipse is starting to get it right. Having never read the books, I have to look at this from just a movie-goers perspective.David Slade, director of the cult film, Hard Candy and the much loved/hated, 30 Days of Night, is manning the helm with this newest installment of the Twilight series. And as someone who is unbiased with this whole phenomenon, I actually enjoyed Eclipse.Pros: The acting is nowhere near as cringe worthy. The action is intense and great for us guys. The love triangle is actually worth watching. Some of the supporting characters are properly developed. The special effects are better.Cons: Slow pace at times. The awesome battle scene is too short. Still some bad dialog. Luckily it's not as bad.Basically if you're a guy who has to take a girl to see this movie, you won't be completely annoyed. David Slade managed to make this watchable and fun. Don't take it seriously.Rating: Matinée",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
lamest movie EVER,"I saw new moon and twilight and i have to admit i feel ashamed to admit it but i like some scenes of these movies (love scenes, i am a girl after all). But Eclipse is by far the worst of the saga. I spent the entire movie clicking fast forward, i couldn't' resist the dialogs; far more stupid than the other two movies (hard to believe). The hole movie was pointless and boring...i understand that the target of these movies are teens so it doesn't have to make sense, but does it have to be That boring??. The hole movie is about the love triangle (the vampire, the shirtless wolf and the dull girl)and the pointless dialogs between them. I think i am done with these movies and i would protect my neurons from it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Don't Understand,"Every time I come here to read reviews I'm just dumbfounded. Did we see the same movie? Like seriously? I've read the books and Eclipse gave me everything I expected from the book. Maybe I loved it so much because I love Jasper. I thought they did a great job on the wolves. I didn't find the movie boring as some have said... I actually found it a little rushed. Some of the love stuff can be gagging. I hate Jacob. Let me say that again I HATE JACOB, and I'm not too big of a fan of Bella, though I'm sorry, but I do think Kristen plays a good Bella. Rob's performance I could give or take. Taylor plays Jacob well. I just don't know if people are going in with too high expectations or what. I thought that I really wasn't going to enjoy them switching Victoria, but to be honest I don't think the original actress could have pulled this one off. Over all it's a good movie and I would normally rate it 8, but because I think the rating is very unbalanced I gave it 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best of the series, but that isn't saying very much","I don't hate the Twilight movies as much as others do, but I don't care for them either. The first was average, the second was pretty poor and the worst so far and while Eclipse is the best yet that isn't saying much. I haven't read the books the movies are based on, apart from a couple of pages of one which didn't spark my interest in reading the rest, but my sister has and likes the books and movies, though she says she likes the books more.Eclipse does look good. I think the scenery in general is splendid and the cinematography and editing is much better too. The special effects are also an improvement, they don't feel as rushed here. The score is also very nice, courtesy of Howard Shore it is probably the best score in any of the Twilight movies. David Slade also does an above serviceable job directing, Eclipse is by far the best directed movie of the Twilight saga as of now.However, Eclipse still has the same major problems as the first two did, but not quite as bad. The dialogue is still very clunky, Pattinson and his family have some pretty good lines but Stewart and Lautner's dialogue are quite awkward and in general the delivery is too. The story is more involving than in New Moon, which was not only sluggish but almost a non-event in terms of story, but there is the odd disjointed part particularly in the middle act and in the more ""romantic"" bits. Stewart and Pattinson have a decent chemistry, but Stewart still looks awkward with Lautner, while the action scenes felt rushed and the pace is still incredibly sluggish especially in the middle.The acting is very mixed. Pattinson and his family I was fine with this time around, and Bryce Dallas Howard is a welcome addition to the cast as Victoria. Billy Burke while somewhat underused is decent as Charlie as well. Conversely, there are some weak links too. Taylor Lautner does little more than take his shirt off and say some clunky lines, while Kristen Stewart while better than she was in New Moon with a marginally more expressive face gives a rather lacklustre performance as Bella as she does have a whiny delivery here and there are still the awkward pauses between each line.So overall, it has its strengths but also its weaknesses, but it is watchable and while it could have been a lot better with better scripting and pacing Eclipse is the best so far of the saga. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"-throws hands up in the air- get over it, not everyone will be pleased with these movies.","If you were reading this, hoping to read yet another, complaining of how Kirsten Stewart has no emotion and cant act, or that Taylor Lautner's abs have gone from 6 to 4 pack, you should go along to read the other 300+ reviews.Movies of books most of the time NEVER live up to the book itself. The reason for that is because we paint a specific picture in our head of the characters and how they would look acting out the chapter. Everyone is different on how they read a book. Different picture+Everyones different = no one can be satisfied. Yes, the series itself cant even hold a candle to the Harry Potter books, but I see why it's loved by millions of teenager girls(and boys, I don't judge) because Edward is what most girls picture as a perfect boyfriend. Beautiful, Gentlemen, Loving, Kind, Willing to die for you, Madly in Love, and to look at you as if you are the only girl in the world. Even I was sorta bedazzled the way Edward looks in my mind, the way he takes care of her, worries about her, shows pain in his eyes when Jacob tries to get in the way of there love. I understand quite well of how many girls daydream if they were in Bella's shoes. But, for me, that isn't enough to push me to love the books. The movie itself is not half bad: the fighting scenes are pretting intense, enough to make me think it looks real, its MUCH better then the first two movies, and I think Kristin Stewart did a good job portraying Bella Swan. Remember, the character of Bella Swan is an awkward girl, that which matches Kristen perfectly. But, her way of showing her emotion, is like everyone else says, very sad. She is a very good actress, but this movie of her is low on her best movies acted in. Robert Patison, ugh..For me, he doesn't give out the fire that bleeds threw the pages of the Twilight books. I don't think there is really any emotion/physical connection on screen. For me, he isn't the same actor mentally who stared in Remember me, which was much better. Taylor Laurent-sighs- is like Heidi Montag. Sex symbol, both incredibly attractive, but has no acting ability. Yes, Taylor will sell tickets to his movies when he takes his shirt off, but he will never be portrayed as a serious actor, only when he takes his shirt off and takes some serious acting lessons.Nof Stephanie Meyer, why did you portray Bella Swan as a women who does nothing more then complains and lets people fight her battles. Please, for future refence, this is not a good image to plant in the eyes of a girl, hoping to be in that same situation, 2 guys that love her, will fight because the situations she put herself into.Besides that, this movies is good enough to spend $9.95 at the movie theater(if there is nothing else playing)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fire and ice -- but not much really happening,"The extremely successful romantic franchise mostly if not entirely for teenage girls has reached a midpoint, with this the third in the series and two more to come. How is it doing? Well, the strategy is good, this time: some violent, if blurred, battle scenes; some out and out sensual attraction -- and physical contact -- between Bella and her two boyfriends, the delicate vampire and fiery werewolf. They come face to face with each other and with the object of their affections, still with no thought of becoming sexual, following the series pattern, with Bella exchanging some warm kisses with both boys, nothing more. The movie begins with Bella and Edward (Kirsten Stweart and Robert Pattinson) in a dim but flowery meadow, making out, while Bella reads Robert Frost's poem ""Fire and Ice,"" whose proffered dual choice as to how the world will end reflects her oscillation between the chilly but sweet and pretty Edward Cullen, the vampire beau, and his rival, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a fiery werewolf, a hotblooded mammal.""Some say the world will end in fire,/Some say in ice./From what I've tasted of desire/I hold with those who favor fire./But if it had to perish twice,/I think I know enough of hate/To say that for destruction ice/Is also great/And would suffice.""(Bella's reading this is the one allusion to the fact that she actually has subjects to study in high school, including English.) Twilight: Eclipse does not rise to the disturbing apocalyptic level of Frost's poem, but it does hint at the radical dilemma Bella faces in choosing between the tow boys. Edward is her first love. But he offers no warmth. ""Face it, I'm much hotter than you,"" Jacob gets to say to Edward up on a mountain, when Bella is freezing in a tent and needs a cuddle to avoid hypothermia.It may not really matter to devotes, but it's more obvious than ever that of the series principals, only Kiristen Steweart as Bella is much of an actor. Robert Pattinson as the romantic vampire seems only barely possessed of any kind of reality. As the Indian-werewolf clan boyfriend Taylor Lautner at least, as required, is lusty, angry, and alive and is speaking in his own accent, unlike the London-born Pattinson. Unfortunately Lautner has a whiny childish intonation unworthy of his torso, Bella, or being a semi-mythical creature.Bella has bargained to marry Edward if they can consummate their love, after high school graduation, and she can join him in eternal vampire-hood, a fate he has always wanted to spare her, for reasons he has yet to reveal. Old fashioned Edward gives Bella a ring which was his mother's. But graduation still seems far away. She is increasingly tempted by Jacob, or at least he insists she is. But that remains up in the air. It's all about titillation.In the background other stuff is necessary as temporary distraction from the fact that when this episode is over we're still pretty close to square one. Jacob and Edward and their respective clans team up to deal with an invasion of a sudden horde of vampire ""newborns"" who descend from elsewhere, attracted by Bella, for some reason. We learn that in their first few months of vampire-hood is when vampires are at their most powerful. These freshly-mined and dangerously violent blood-suckers clash with the Cullens and the werewolves in their wild four-legged form for some rapid-fire action. It's all so pumped up with CGI and loud music none of it makes sense, but young people are used to this kind of trickery and don't know what they're missing: it's like a video game, but one that's not interactive.Apart from being better received critically than Twilight number two, number one one had a big advantage: the whole concept was new then, and the appearance of vampire siblings in a Pacific Northwest high school had a campy novelty about it. I liked the idea that the weather up there was so gray vampires would choose the region to live in, with the Cullens able to inhabit a woodsy modern villa with lots of windows. Edward wasn't even there for most of number two. Now he is back, and the rivalry between the two boy-men livens things up. Trouncing the rival outsider newborn vampires provides action that has little effect except for providing Edward and Jacob a chance to cooperate with each other. Bella talks to Edward, Bella talks to Jacob, and Jacob talks to Edward. All three have zeroed in on each other more than in number one and number two. But has anything changed? Nor really. All this may make more sense in the Stephenie Meyer novels -- but mus be pretty darn silly there too.None of these Twilight movies makes much sense without filtering them through a teenage girl's viewpoint, according to which, evidently, boys are very attractive but also scary. It feels as though the larger action that takes place is just a metaphor for stuff outside Bella's real understanding, a world of danger and confusion, when her involvement with these two boys, with their opposite-pole natures, is danger and confusion enough. David Spade is good at keeping the action flowing; not much can make up for the shortcomings in the acting category. Striking closeups happen throughout of the wolf clan, the vampires, and Bella. Visually the vampires win out: the images seem sickly and twilight-dim nearly all the time. Natural light and shadow, the essential stuff of real and traditional photography, are not to be found. Maybe the next installment will be in 3-D (the way things are going) and it will all look even more unreal.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best One,"Gave it a ten. it probably isn't a 10 but it is definitely not a 1 which all these people are giving it. This is clearly the best one out of the twilight series. It's less talking and goes more. Got action and surprisingly a lot of funny moments. Easily the most entertaining twilight movie. Those fighting scenes were awesome. Seriously people just watch it. Talks a lil about some of the other Cullen's past which is cool. Who cares if u think the acting is so horrible. Is it really that terrible? If that's your only reason to bash the movie, then wow get off your high horse. I don't understand the negative reviews, that say things like ""once again, the twilight movie sucked"". if u didn't care for the previous ones, why are you spending more money to see it?

Just an awful film,"I went into this movie open minded hoping that i would enjoy the third installment much more than the second. I really enjoyed the first film and was highly disappointed in New Moon. Eclipse in a nut shell is New Moon all freaking over again plus a new terrible ""villian"". I was shocked by the story and acting in this garbage of a film. The whole story is a never ending cycle of, does she love Edward? Or does she love Jacob? and it gets VERY OLD! I really wanted to just take a nap in the theater so i could at least get a bit of enjoyment out of this awful experience. Now for the acting... I could have had my 5 year old sister play a better Vultari leader than Dakota Fanning, I seriously had to laugh at every scene the Vultari were in because it was that bad, and I don't even wanna get started on Taylor Lautner because if i do i will be writing for days. He is by far the worst actor in a big budget movie i have ever seen, period. For your own good please do not waste your 10 dollars and see this in theaters! Don't even rent in when its out on DVD.

David Slade finally nails the material!!!!,"Twilight the book series area guilty pleasure written in such a way that makes it very easy to connect with it's characters and story lines. twilight the original film was a big time guilty pleasure. Quality wise it wasn't very good, uneven performances, uneven direction accompanied by some slick cinematography, a great soundtrack and an entrancing chemistry from Pattinson and Stewart. It's sequel fared much better. Although critically trashed the film was made for the fans. Anyone whose read New Moon knows how extremely close it is to the book. All the good and all the bad that film was accompanied by a solid lead performance from Stewart, some truly inspiring cinematography, a giant helping of wonderful creative and confident direction. This installment Twilight Saga Eclipse is a merging of the formula that both those films so successful and add it's own touch of pizazz with Director David Slade who just absolutely nails the material. Fans will love, the regular movie going audience will love it, critics seems to be loving it for te most part it's just a great movie. The performances are so solid in this film and the chemistry between the main threesome of main characters is so enthralling and believably complex in this installment. the effects seem to have been cleaned up and refined, the cinematography is once again beautifully striking although not as creative last time around, the score is breathtaking and the film just feels fresh, like nothing you've ever seen before. The film is just so entertaining and involving on so many levels but almost flawless with the exception of two things why change Victoria from Levre to Howard. I mean Howard didn't have a big enough role to merit that change. If it was performance they were looking for I could understand Howard being a better actress. But it just seemed to be a wasted change. And the one thing I hated was Bella's wig it just looked awkward and weird in so many scenes besides that the new editions to the story line fill it out nicely if only for a brief period of time and at the center of this truly brilliant film is just a theme of graduation, self discovery and decisions and not in the way you would be led to believe something we've all experienced. It was just wonderful without a doubt the best of the series, the best of the summer, the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I just can't see them topping this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ultimate fake emotional picture,"Watching this movie i felt stupid. All these fake emotions that tries to pass to the teen girls are awful. Its a movie made for money, and just for that. All the plot and all the action takes place around Bella once more (the main female character) and everything seems to be made for the female crowd to feel in love with Edward and to get impressed from Jacob (the two ""lovers"" of Bella). The script is poor, the director isn't exactly that interested to tell a story but to impress the females by showing highly emotional scenes between Bella and her ""lovers"" and finally, the actors are doing a great job in not doing anything at all. Kristen Stewart (Bella) changes only two types of faces (just the same as before)and Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner (Edward and Jacob) are just being over reacting to play the ""perfect guy"", for the ladies watching this movie. If there is only one thing good in this film, is the soundtrack that sometimes is very nice. But the whole package just screams ""fake and only for teen females"".",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Eclipse- better than the last two films.,"I do not claim to be a fan of the Twilight Saga- either for the movies, or the books. In my opinion, the writing of the books and the movies is mediocre and some parts of the story are rather shaky.However, I do find the story sweet. To me, of course it is a story of a human girl who falls in love with a vampire and also has feelings for a werewolf, but it's also about the many different facets of love, and what they can lead to, for better or for worse.So, obviously, I was frustrated with the first two films- I did not think that the writing allowed perfectly capable actors and actresses to portray the sweetness and humor of the story in full. It seemed like a shame- Kristen Stewart being my favorite actress, I had seen her in other films where she did a stellar job at acting her character. The scripts were written too darkly and kept the characters from developing into a three dimensional person, vampire, or werewolf.From the first ten minutes I could tell that Eclipse was different- the characters were lighter and more real, and easier to take seriously. The acting improved ten fold with more realistic lines, and it was a visually pleasing film. Not to mention the soundtrack, which was simply to die for (at least for my musical tastes.) Of course, not everything could be rock solid, though. There were a couple chunks of dull long dialogue that slowed down the movie. However though, Eclipse being such a complicated story, I suppose some long dialogue was required to convey the plot to the audience, some of which had never read the books.All in all I found it a very sweet and entertaining movie and would be pleased to see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010, PG 13)","The Twilight movies (so far) began with a vampire's dangerous love. Edward's romantic intensity boiled his undead instincts to their max and attached him to Bella beyond his control. In an unguarded moment, Edward might uncontrollably drink Bella's blood. Most of this is absent from ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,"" the third movie in the saga. Hidden behind artful landscapes (waterside sunsets, firelight chats, dark vampire nights, green forest fields, snowy mountains) and flashy, humorous sequences is a hollow and wordy love triangle that had fantastic potential.Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has a way of getting into mortal danger. Again she's hunted by vampires. Victoria, from the second movie, ""New Moon,"" wants revenge for the death of her lover. But it will take Riley's army of vampires (and a little luck avoiding the Volturi, an order to the most powerful vampires) to get past the Cullen family led vampires and Jacob's werewolves.Riley (Xavier Samuel) uses a new weapon and it's probably the best fantasy idea in the movie. A mysterious, deceitful, and smart vampire is able to breed new vampires and control them for short periods of time like puppets. New vampires are ultra powerful (stronger than regular vampires, or werewolves even), uncontrollably thirsty for blood, and known for mass killing if they are left without guidance after their conversion. Vampires and werewolves unite to defend Bella against the army. Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) has experience with controlling them and helps train the Cullens and the werewolves to deal with the new born vampires.Much of the plot involves an ongoing romance triangle. Enter Edward (Robert Pattinson): all of our knowledge of Edward, the 100+ year old vampire, comes in glimpses and mostly from the point of view of other characters. His character sort of hovers around waiting, and waiting for the last two movies, without us getting to know much about his inner world (perhaps he's like a stage under construction left with minimal shape or feature). Traditional marriage (abstinence, for example) and Bella's safety are the main things he functions to promote. But maybe if we dig deeper, we could find something more about him in Bella's interesting confession.Edward is so other worldly and so non-human, for Bella, he stands for an existence other than the normal mortal one. Bella doesn't just love Edward and want to be a vampire; she wants to be a vampire for her own reasons (and happens to love Edward too). Bella feels strange in the human world. She's more comfortable with a vampire's embrace and feels natural in it. But all of this is difficult to put on a poster or to frame in a close up, so none of this spoils anything important because David Slade's film doesn't get to any interesting uses of it.Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a werewolf, further complicates the triangle. He wants Bella to choose him over Edward for the sake of his warm, beating heart and normal life (of the living). Plus he hints that werewolves sometimes imprint on humans and they would do anything for their loved one once imprinted. (Perhaps he would be as much a puppet as Edward is from his love for Bella, or as a new born vampire is for blood.) Some of Jacob's scenes are shirtless, muscle poses while others are humorous or warm exchanges with Bella or Edward. His wordy dialog says a lot but doesn't mean much of interest; it certainly doesn't give the viewer much sense of aggression, action, comfort, etc., that characterized him in the novel.One final complaint is about the spacing of characters: in the mountain scenes, it was a bit difficult to tell where characters were without the help of dialog. Is Edward watching Bella and Jacob kiss? Is Jacob running fast enough through the forest to adequately spread his scent and successfully hide Bella?The film is certainly made for fans and audiences familiar with the world. Don't try to count the number of references based on other Twilight movies, but this didn't seem harmful to the story. Some of the best parts were the snowy battle scenes, the dark vampire setups/intros, the werewolf battle attacks, and Riley's mastery of newly bred vampires. But the villainous vampires were not as scary as they could be. The high body count of supposedly immortal vampires makes you wonder whether Bella and Edward should argue so much about whether (or when) to transform her to a vampire. It was a bit more enjoyable to watch than ""New Moon,"" but it still didn't deliver highly interesting characters (besides Bella) or well developed ideas.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the Series So Far... But That Doesn't Take Much,"After Edward's proposal to Bella at the end of ""New Moon"", a few loose ends need to be tied up: Bella must confront her feelings for Jacob, and they all must face Victoria, the vengeful vampire who hungers for Bella's death. If they can achieve this, smooth sailing!Working off a book that my friend Tina cites as the ""least memorable"" of the series, I felt the film did a really good job bringing the story to life. Unfortunately, when you're working with a weak story, there is only so much you can bring to the film. The strongest parts of the book, for me, were the flashbacks, and indeed this was the best part of the film.Overall, this story has little plot. I'm pleased to say the romance and sap has been toned down yet again, the action is slightly improved, but overall the film is nothing but a speed bump between ""New Moon"" and ""Breaking Dawn"". You could probably skip this film entirely and not miss an important piece of the story (though you would miss the fleshing out of Jasper and Rosalie).Sadly, director David Slade does not take the stylistic approach I felt he was capable of. After his ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"", I knew he was comfortable with edgy topics and dark imagery. He does not take that route, instead mimicking the style of the first two films. I respect his adherence to continuity, and I know he had to work in the PG frame, but still... the Harry Potter films took stylistic turns with new directors (most notably in the third film with Alfonso Cuarón), and the producers should not have been afraid to make that choice.Professional reviews have been largely favorable, for reasons that escape me. The rating sits at 4.8 on IMDb (as of August 2010) and I find that to be much more realistic. The film showed no great writing, directing... and Kristen Stewart's acting is one flat note as it always is. Where is the emotion? Shame on reviewers who caved in and praised this film.Roger Ebert, bless his heart, gave the film only two stars and two thumbs down (though he loved ""Karate Kid"" around the same time, so he's not flawless). He understands what appeals to the audience: ""A sweet girl is forced to choose between two improbably tall, dark and handsome men who brood and smolder and yearn for her."" (His review is worth reading for his comments about Edward's hairy eyebrows and what he sees as homoerotic tension.)I take issue with the inclusion of Bree Tanner. She was singled out by the camera, and the promotional clips talked about her, presumably in an effort to help sell the Bree book. But her role is ultimately rather small, and her name is not mentioned once -- if you didn't read the book, you're not going to understand why she is even in this film. In fact, maybe she shouldn't have been.If you saw the first two films, you're probably going to see this one. If you didn't, why see this one first? In fact, if you can avoid all three you are probably better off. While I enjoyed sitting in the theater heckling on opening day, I have very little desire to ever return to the city of Forks, Washington... though I know, sadly, that I will.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Best Entry in the ""Twilight"" Franchise...  Still a sloppy, boring film, but a BIG step up after the abysmal second film...","People who have read my reviews for ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"" know I'm not a fan of the series. But at the same time, I'm not a hater. I'm basically indifferent, and am only watching them as they become available for free to see what the fuss is all about.I found the first film to be halfway decent (nowhere near as bad as the reputation), but it did suffer from sloppy direction (courtesy Catherine Hardwicke, whom has never impressed me) and a boring storyline that didn't take advantage of the material. The second film was much more competently made, and had top notch direction, but suffered from a painfully boring script and hollow characters, and ended up being one of my most hated films of recent memory as a result.I was surprised to find that this entry was actually the best of the series thus far. Directed by the talented David Slade, this film delivers a suitable tone and style, and actually has a sense of completion. It didn't feel as vapid and lifeless as the first two entries.When the evil Victoria (the gorgeous Bryce Dallas Howard) begins creating an army of vicious ""newborn"" vampires to get revenge against Bella and the Cullens, Edward (Robert Pattinson) is forced to team up with his rival Jacob the werewolf (Taylor Laughtner), in order to protect his love Bella (Kristen Stewart). That's basically the important plot line. They do try to add tension to the relationship of Bella and Edward, and make you guess more if Bella should be with Jacob, but it isn't important.As I said, this is a well made film, courtesy of Slade's direction. It feels more confident and more secure with itself. The visuals are actually quite remarkable, and the battle sequences are well done, although still too brief. It is simply the best-made film in the series, and this is what makes it the best.However, it still has a large share of problems.For one, the characters are still infuriating. Bella still comes off as a complete jerk, Jacob is tedious and unlikable, Edward is still too much of a ""wuss"" at times. The main characters just aren't compelling, and I found myself worried more for the secondary characters (particularly the sweethearted vampire Alice, played by Ashley Greene, who is one of the only truly likable characters in the franchise). Also, the villainess, though played well, is underdeveloped beyond belief. Howard tries her hardest, but Victoria has always been uninteresting since her introduction- she's simply evil for the sake of being evil.Also, the film wastes too much time on the romance, which was basically ""completed"" in the second film. Dragging out the ""Who will Bella be with?"" storyline is pointless, and even though the script was written by a woman, the film feels very misogynistic at times.The writing is as corny and cringe-inducing as always. The film is still very boring, the acting is still a mixed bag. It's all very mediocre.But as I said, this is easily the best-made film in the series, and is arguably the first entry to actually accomplish something of a plot. It was very watchable, even though the series feels like a Hallmark TV movie, with lame production values and bad writing. And for that, it gets credit, and I will say I kind of enjoyed it in a way.I give it a just-slightly-above average 6 out of 10. This series still does not deserve all of the attention it gets, but it's OK.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"uneven entry in the ""Twilight"" saga","Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament – should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? – has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, ""New Moon""), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation. She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move – eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up – her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own. The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control ""newborn"" vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves – bitter, sworn enemies of one another – to join forces in defeating them.These ""Twilight"" films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like ""True Blood,"" as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way. And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way. Still they do have their moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cough, pause, swallow, pause, biting lips, pause, little bit of action, credits.","This movie was as funny as the previous one. :-) This time it had a little bit more action but the acting was still terrible! The actress who plays Alice does a decent job and most of the Cullens but the main character still warms my heart as much as a dead rat does. People complain about the 'sparkliness' of the vampires but I think THAT is more credible than the fact that the main character still has friends after all her whining and selfish behaviour.I don't think it's credible that one guy fancies this girl, let alone two! They actually fight over her, Jesus. Her 'best friend' is a lot more desirable than she is! By now, the story should have gone somewhere and we're still stuck with Creepy Stare-eyes fighting over Bella Moo Whiny-arse with Jacob ""I'm hotter than you"" Black.Pick your guy alright and move on!At least this movie had 'some' action but there still is more swallowing, pausing and biting lips than action, which makes it more funny than exciting, really.I'm recommending this to watch with friends and have a good laugh.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Contributing to the raping of the imagination?,"'THE TWILIGHT SAGE: ECLIPSE': Two Stars (Out of Five)I've never been one to jump on the band wagon and hate something just because it's popular to hate; I disliked the first 'TWILIGHT' movie the first time I saw it on opening weekend even before I had any idea it would be so infamously loathed by so many (and yet loved by an equal number, which is always the case). I was actually expecting a good movie since it was directed by a good director (Catherine Hardwick, who helm-ed such well respected movies as 'THIRTEEN', which she also co-wrote, and 'LORDS OF DOGTOWN') and starring the very talented Kristen Stewart, not to mention the fact that it was based on an immensely popular book about vampires and werewolves (but popular books can be just as trashy and poorly made as popular movies and I've heard from people that have read the books, as well, that they're just as bad as the movies based on them). So I was somewhat surprised to find out how awful the movie actually was and then later learned that many others agreed. I thought the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, was about the worst actor I had ever seen in a major motion picture and the dialog and drama was so cheesy and ridiculous that it wasn't even so bad it was good, it was just nauseating. The sequels have gotten a little better with each one though through well executed business tactics. Experts take note on everything that doesn't work about a film and attempt to somewhat fix it with the next installment.With this chapter they've really tried to draw in at-least a small number of males with their almost solely female audience by making it slightly more of an action / horror film. To do this they hired yet another impressive director David Slade (the man who brought us '30 DAYS OF NIGHT' and 'HARD CANDY'). He does manage to deliver some somewhat impressive thrilling and horrendous action scenes but they're few and far between. What he also does well is attempt to cut all the boring crap down; he only lets Pattinson speak as long as he needs to for plot development and edits camera shots of him to make his acting appear not quite as atrocious. There are a few good scenes between Stewart and the only other good actor in the series Billy Burke, playing her father, but then Slade also allows Taylor Lautner to yap for way too long which is a fatal mistake. The only actor that should be allowed to speak at any extended amount of time in this series is Kristen Stewart. Lautner managed to suck so badly that in this installment he made himself look like a worse actor than Pattinson!The film tells of the continuing romance between Bella (Stewart) and the vampire 'like' creature known as Edward (played by Pattinson, and he's not really a vampire considering the fact that he can survive in the sunlight but the movies still shits on the vampire mythology by calling him one) and her struggle to fight off the sexual advances of her werewolf stalker buddy Jacob (played by Lautner). This time around there's a female blood sucking creature (now played by Bryce Dallas Howard) building an army of freshly born blood suckers in order to kill Bella and get revenge for the death of her brother (from film one). The only way this series could possibly come to a somewhat satisfying conclusion is if it's revealed that Bella is actually a more deadly and vicious creature than them all and is manipulating everyone to her will. That would be pretty cool.I saw this movie at the drive-in which is probably the best way to see it considering it's really just a glorified 'B' monster movie and trashy 'B' romance. If you really respect film you have to acknowledge what's good about a movie even if parts of it are repulsive. A movie like this isn't all bad; you can't just say it's a zero star movie because parts of it are atrocious. The director and crew pretty effectively deliver exactly what it's core fan following wants to see. You can argue that that's contributing to the raping of their imagination though. I know the books were intended for ten to thirteen year old girls which it does make sense why they would like them but it doesn't make sense why anyone older than that would actually enjoy these movies and consider them well made in any way. I think the only reason grown women like these movies is because they think the two lead guys are hot which proves that women are generally more superficial than men. You don't see guys becoming obsessed with movies that some hot actress like Megan Fox is in just because she looks good in it and actually trick themselves into thinking they're well made movies. Women act like they're less superficial than they are and men act like they're more superficial than they are but things are actually reversed; women are a lot less likely to settle in the looks department than men on average, they're obsessed with appearance as these movies show.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too Much Twilight and Moon in Eclipse,"More of the same. Serious wooing and cooing on screen, yearning in the audience; the man-sized CGI wolves still look unconvincing and cheesy; their human counterparts still roam the woods predominantly shirtless (why is that, by the way?); Bella still can't decide between the hot vampire and the hot lycan and takes her father for a nincompoop (okay, in some ways he is); the Cullen clan is still too good to be real (or alive); the Volturi are still evil vampires...but this time around they created an army of newborns, recently turned bloodsuckers ready to rumble. So we finally get a battle good vs. evil - all within the PG-13 confinement, of course. That's the one thing we haven't seen in ""Twilight"" or ""New Moon,"" all the other goings-on in this installment are strictly by the book (and I don't mean the novel, though I think it would apply). But Kristen Stewart is so good as the brooding heroine and the photography is stunningly beautiful, so this kind of makes it worth your while. A warning: All the protagonists are flawlessly pretty, so when you leave the theater be prepared to fondle the inferiority complex you grew while watching the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
improvement over the second movie,"It's the third movie in the Twilight series. Bella Swan is completely in love with Edward Cullen. Jacob Black is not happy and still wants Bella. Seattle is hit with mysterious murders. Victoria has an army of newborn vampires. The Cullens and the Werewolves have to join forces to battle the vampire army.The love triangle is in its last gasp and it does it in good style. The vampire army is a good addition. Overall, this is an improvement over the second movie. There is an approaching danger and a climatic battle. The romance is good. The human characters are essentially sidelined at this point.

Teenage Angst Gone Wild,"It is rare that I actually write a review, but this film warranted some sort of posting. This was, without exception, one of the WORST films I have ever seen. I knew there would be a flimsy plot, because I read the book(s). However, the acting in this film is what really made it painful to watch. Pattinson was decent, but unremarkable. A much older looking Stewart maintained her forever-pouting look throughout. Lautner was nice eye candy, but absolutely abysmal to watch in his attempt at acting. As for acting... thank God for the supporting cast. The best scene of the film -- and the one which earned it a ""3"" for my vote -- was the final fight scene. Some night slow motion shots were pulled off quite well. However, a five-minute scene can't save this film from being amazingly shallow and poorly acted throughout.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Both a 8/10 and a 3/10,"First off, the only reason i gave it a 10, is to counter balance the negative votes this movie received, which il get into later.On the second day of this movies showing (Thursday) i decided to go see Eclipse with my family, as i had done for the past two. i was a fan of the books prior to the movie series, and was unhappy to see that both twilight, and new moon cut out major parts of the books. When going to see eclipse.i had low expectations. The ratings were low, and my because prior experience to the movie saga, i had doubts this film would be any better. The only reason i decided to whip out $10 for probably ""B"" movie, was because i heard there was a new director who wanted to capture the ""male"" audience with more action. He did not succeed. If you look at the votes, 90% of males votes this film 4 and below. When watching the movie, i couldn't help but noticing the directors promise for a less-chick flick eclipse was a load of crap..what really surprised me, was how good this movie was despite that fact. I can't say either Robert Patinsonn or Kristian steward are great actors, but they're both certainly improved. The awkwardness between the two actors( Edward and Bella) was apparent in both twilight and new moon. Their chemistry surprised me in eclipse, the romantic scenes between the two characters were more..natural i guess you'd say. Another MAJOR thing that surprised me, was how accurate this film was too the book. A few details were left out of course, but most parts were true to the book, and the extra hour to do this, was totally worth it.I know i don't represent the typical male-audience member..Most wont even give the films a chance. My advice to anyone seeing this movie..if your a guy, and don't like the twilight books, or past movies..Don't SEE IT, your not going to like it, and even if it was really good, you'd probably hate it anyway because, lets face it, most people hate twilight just for the sake of hating it. Most girls, will probably like this. its a good love story, with good action scenes to back it up. IMO a good watch.Go check out the votes for this movie..most males may have voted the movie 4 and under..females generally gave it a score of 6 or more. Why? its a chick-flick, and thats all i have to say about that.see the movieactual rating:Acting: 6/10 Robert Pattinson and Kristain Stewart may not have been great, but Taylor Lautner made up for themEffects/CGI: 6/10 Other then the fail-CGI wolves..all's goodPlot: 8/10 A great plot strait from Stephanie Meyer's popular book series, very accurate to the book.Sound: 9/10 Great music soundtrack, really fit the mood of the movie. Though if probably depends on the theatre, the sound quality was greattotal: 7.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A marginal improvement over 'New Moon',"This installment of the Twilight saga is a slight improvement across the board from the last one, but it is still every bit as cheesy. The story this time is a little more engaging, following the love triangle between Edward, Bella and Jacob and revolving around an unexplained series of killings in Forks. It turns out to be an army of Newborns being built by Victoria, and this draws the attention of the Volturi, who have a slightly expanded presence here. One thing that does keep me watching these movies without being utterly bored is the unintentional humor, especially in this one. The scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob are really funny and over-the-top in their portrayal of masculinity and because of the woodenness of the performances. Some other positives include effective tension in a few scenes, as well as more action. The obvious set-piece here would be the climactic battle between the Newborns and the Cullens and the werewolves. However, since the movie is PG-13, the violence is bloodless. I still have some problems with the visual effects being slightly less than convincing, but at this point I don't really expect them to improve significantly anyway. Generally speaking, the acting has improved marginally since the first one, but the material they're working with is passé, immature and flawed. One performance in particular that stuck out to me as being really bad was Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi. Also, Stephenie Meyer's Mormon roots are on full display now, as Edward acts as the mouthpiece for ""traditional"" values. It's a shame, really, that teenagers eat this stuff up. Times have changed, but most likely they were distracted by all of the teenage flesh on display. There's also a creepy moment early on where it's suggested (through dialogue) that Bella is essentially being groomed to be a vampire. This takes on a new meaning when you remember that Edward is over 100 years old, and Bella is a minor (although she does turn 18 in the movie). Still, this movie is somewhat worth watching, if only for the moments of unintentional comedy. Just don't complain if you don't like it, since you most likely made it through the previous installments to get to this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So close to being pretty OK,"Rating-5/10The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is the third instalment in the series and one that well, kind of takes it up a notch. Now please don't get me wrong, this is an average made movie but one that is so close to being kind of OK, it actually weirdly surprised me. It's better than New Moon by a long way and also in my opinion better than the first movie so this really does feel like the closest point this film series can get to franchise redemption so far.This part is better acted, Kristen Stewart steps it up a notch and Pattinson does too after a poor showing in New Moon. Even Taylor Lautner gets slightly better and it almost feels like he has come of a new age with confidence and more actual skill in his work. The story is kind of overstuffed in truth though with new people, Bryce Dallas Howard returns, well replaces the previous actor to play Victoria, the evil vampire bent on revenge on Bella since the first movie. The problem with so many people is that it feels hard to not only keep track but also it means the acting goes down a level as most of the new people are inexperienced.The film is no doubt a thrilling one, it has it's action although it is very much confined toward the end and so anyone wanting all out fighting will be slightly disappointed. One good thing with this though is that it doesn't hang around like it has done previously, the school isn't shown as much and we also get to explore more in the vampire world and we finally spend some time not talking about Bella. The romance is as ever it's radiant self, but is still awkward but not as much again as before. The lines are less stupid and the characters feel more real in this showing, some fans may feel it even strengthens in this one as the relationship is tested at times.The cinematography is one of the technical aspects that improves here, it feels more good movie like and avoids the common traps that make the camera work feel dull and not exciting enough. One trap that does get fallen into is the director David Slade, now he isn't bad but he doesn't improve enough for this to be a good piece of work for him, it falls back into the same old kind of category and although I feel Slade and the movie do try to escape that, it ultimately just about slides back in.It can feel just a little slow at times Eclipse can, with it's as I mentioned more time away from the school, it is more interesting but the boredom can creep in and kind of pointless adventures and conversations are had that feel very much like time wasting. The effects that are fairly poor before are still not perfect, but they are at least used well and on the point of the slow film, when the effects come, it can breath fresh air into the plot. They are also not overused as is also the usual case, before we had silly backdrops that looked really dumb, now all that is annoying scenery wise is the incredibly strange camera filters.Overall this is a kind of so-so movie that although never makes the grade, never falls flat on its face. This feels like a new beginning in the chapters of Twilight the movie series and is much more confident and all credit for at least pleasing hardcore fans yet again. One thing to say though is that this isn't good I will repeat, it may be for me the best in the series so far but I highly doubt the most cynical of critics for the series will find any solace in this part.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ignorant and useless.,"I just can't understand why a so low rated series like the Twilight Saga stills being a huge box office thing. This proves at best how can studios make so easy money with so lame thing. Most of it, this proves the best how to alienate teenagers so early, making 12 y.o. kids going out of the theaters with the books under their arms like a bible thinking about sex symbols and perfect bodies and with no sense at all of what's good or what's bad for them, because if you tell just one of them that this is the worst movie series ever they can spit right in your face and call you a sh*t. This is one of the reasons that makes me think that this is the end of days. At my teenage times (almos 15 years ago), my parents would never accept me going watch this piece of crap. Never! That's why my senses today are so better than a lot of what will be in the future when this kids have exactly my age now. That's sad. There's no good movie for teenagers. In one hand you have that huge crap called Karate Kid, then... in the other hand you have The Last Airbander... and in the middle you have entire Twilight 'Crap' Saga.This is the best entertainment effort to make the future ignorant and useless.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining,"Personally I like the movies of the saga which I find entertaining. Life is tragic enough so you don't always have to watch realistic films. It is all about what kind of movies you enjoy. I find it is a very relaxing fantasy movie, far better than some I wouldn't even watch through the end. Eclipse has more action than the first 2, a battle, but perhaps the emotions the characters are displaying I can't feel very much. I wouldn't blame the actors, I think they can display a wide range of emotions. Maybe sometimes they don't connect. The movie is revolving around the choice of the kind of future Bella wants, as a human or a vampire, and who she loves the most, and will her beliefs be changed by events.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Haterz who see it anyways???? Its for the fan's guys!,"The wife and i just watched this and boy let me tell you, never mind what the critics are saying, these movies keep getting better and better. Another favourite for 2010 and believe me it's a small list. This and Toy Story 3....that's it! If you haven't read any of the books of Stephenie Meier(although i suggest you do so) you don't need too because the storyline follows very closely to the book. Something book adaptations as of late have failed miserably in doing. Great Cgi only left me drooling for 2011-12's Breaking Dawn the last in the series. Critics have also said that the casting is terrible another thing i highly disagree on considering once again if you are a fan of this series in print as I am you will know that all were cast perfectly right down to Kristen Stewart as Bella as she is as awkward in real life as Bella is in the Twilight story lines. Funny listening to the teenybopper set of girls that were set directly behind me gasp every time Taylor Lautner graced the screen (shirtless of course) Which even had fellow cast mate Edward asking ""Does he own a shirt?"" Taylor if you are unfamiliar with these films plays Teen wolf Jacob Black in this. This chapter opens up with various people in Seattle going missing which in turn raises flags amongst the Cullens as being far too familiar and want to do something about it before the Volturi step in. Red head (as Jacob labels her)Victoria (this time played with perfection by Bryce Dallas Howard) is still stalking Bella, in retaliation for Edward killing her mate in the first one James. The future seeing vamp Alice keeps getting visions of the new vamps titled the newborns and Victoria making their way to Forks for a major fight, which in turn has the Cullen's seeking help from Jacob's werewolf brothers. Can Jacob and Edward, who are having their own game of tug o war going on with Bella, bond together with their clans and fight together and protect Bella?

It surprised me...,"We all need to remember that it is a Twilight Series film that we are reviewing here. It never has, and never will be, a great piece of art. By giving this the rating I have I am in no way comparing it to silver screen legends. It will never stand the face of time, and this rating is purely based on how enjoyable I found the experience of watching it, keeping a comparison of the previous two in mind. Remember that there is only so much a director and screenwriter can do with the material they are given (which in this case, as anyone who has read the novels will know, is pages upon pages of lovelorn fluff and faux danger). To me, anyone that could make something remotely entertaining and enjoyable from this source material is a sheer genius.That being said, I don't think David Slade is one. Very rarely could I see his true cinematic tact and I did feel that he held back a lot in creating this one. This was definitely not his true artistic vision. However, of all three directors who have taken the reigns on these projects, his work is by far the superior of the three. Melissa Rosenberg also surprised me in this one. Despite never really being a fan of her work and still believing that she is probably the worst thing that happened to these movies, the fact that she included many humorous and tongue- in-cheek moments within the goofy dialogue actually made watching the film slightly less cringe-worthy than the previous two.Perhaps these factors, mixed with the inclusion of probably the closest idea of a real plot line that the series will ever have, actually surprised me in creating what I would say is a fairly enjoyable film. I am not going to lie, there were still strings of dialogue that literally had me cringing in my seat, but they were much fewer and farther between than we saw in New Moon. The storyline felt as if it was constantly in motion; it never sat stagnating on the screen. Just when a sequence became a little too drawn out, it would move right along nicely. Most important of all, I actually felt that these characters, for the first time, truly felt for one another - particularly recurring non-main characters like Alice and Jasper.Look, its obviously not the best film I've ever seen, but it did keep me fairly entertained for two hours and I did find myself, in a series first, actually engaging with the characters. Twilight and New Moon felt oddly detached and indifferent to me, but this one seemed to stick. I actually smiled and laughed and FELT for them where I previously hadn't. I've never sympathized with the characters and watching this I felt just a glimmer of a connection. Just a glimmer, mind you. It should honestly be much more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nonsense, but a little less boring than the previous two","I'm sorry to report that this third installation in the infernal Twilight franchise is disappointingly similar to its predecessors. I had been hoping that director David Slade who is responsible for the fang-tastic 30 Days of Night might have injected the franchise with the dose of blood that it so desperately needs. Unfortunately, it seems he is as sanitised as the others. It is very clear that these film are so desperately in need of the tween audience that the filmmakers refuse to allow any glimpse of gore; even going so far as a focus pull when the villainous Victoria bites someone's neck and making it so vampires heads smash like glass when they die! No blood n guts here, no sir! This instalment follows Victoria planning vengeance for her boyfriend's death at the hands of Edward (way back in the first movie) by trying to kill Bella. Of course this sparks a war between the evil vamps and the veggie vamps. As the evil vamps recruit an army of newborns the veggie's join forces with the werewolves in a truce formed with Bella's best interest at heart. Meanwhile, Bella must choose between the very lovely Jacob who will love and protect her forever and ever and Edward who will make her a vampire and she can fend for herself. Bella's decision to become a vampire, thus losing her soul, for the love of a boy is made even more troubling by the fact that she seems hardly distressed by the thought of ending her life. Despite pretty much everyone telling her it is a bad decision, she is staunch in her determination to do it. I dread to imagine the suicide tallies in a few years time if this is the stuff that is feeding our young teenagers imaginations. Although this is certainly the least boring of the three films so far, it is as still almost completely devoid of humour, and the story structure is bafflingly tedious. The problem is that every dramatic setup is merely a way for the audience to gain insight into how much Edward and Jacob love Bella. There's never a sense of danger, because we know that none of them die and despite the beautifully desolate cinematography (by Javier Aguirresrobe, fast becoming my favourite), there is not enough darkness to ever really thrill the audience. Eclipse tricks the audience into thinking that there is a dark, fearsome story going on but really it is just sanitised nonsense with no bite to it whatsoever. I cried for sex, blood and rock n roll after the first two films and hoped this film might give us some of that but unfortunately it has become clear that this franchise just doesn't have the balls! If you're a Twi-hard you know not to bother reading reviews anyway, but this is definitely the best of the bunch. For those of you who haven't been seduced, this probably won't be the one to do it. That being said, Eclipse is shot beautifully, there are topless werewolves aplenty and it is far less boring than the last two films.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the Book,"So this movie was not amazing by any means, but I believe a 1 or 2 out of 10 is a little harsh. If you are a twihard you will be a little disappointed but your not going to cry about it for days. I've read all the books and the third was my least favorite, so naturally i was expecting it to be pretty bad and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. It still has the corny lines that it did in previous movies and in the books however, it does not make it a horrible movie. it just give's you something to laugh at. So I believe that if you have seen the first two and enjoyed them or if you have read the book, or labeled yourself as a ""team Jacob"" or ""team Edward"" you will enjoy this movie at least a little.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A while a gay man is someone strong, muscular, tanned, toned, tall and runs around in a pack and works as a team. As someone who works in a team everyday for the Army, I find this offensive.

I really don't understand what all the fuss is about,"I've really tried to understand why these movies and books are so popular. I read the first book, and though it was a somewhat fun read, I didn't' see what all the hoopla was about and didn't bother reading all the others.The first Twilight I found to be entertaining, New Moon was a snoozefest, and now Eclipse found me straining to keep my eyes open. In all honesty, it just seems like nothing ever really happens. Yes, there are some short action sequences, and it was interesting to get some background information on some of the Cullens, but that's about it.I've really tried to understand why Edward and Jake are so into Bella, and I really don't get it. She's not that interesting of a person and she's always walking around in what seems to me to be a gloomy state. Really, guys, just move on! Also, (just as a sidebar), if the werewolves shorts can magically reappear after they turn back into a human, why do they run around without shirts? Shouldn't they reappear too? Just a thought.It also seems to me as if the actors are bored in this film too. Especially Kristen Stewart. She seems as though she would rather be anywhere than making another Twilight movie.But I think the overall problem is that there are really no surprises, no twist and turns in any of the movies. It's all pretty straightforward and predictable. Quite honestly, I find the TV show ""The Vampire Diaries"" to be far superior to Twilight in almost every way. It has the same premise, more or less (mortal girl torn between her love for two supernatural beings), except that you need a score card to keep up with what's going on. Every week is a roller-coaster ride, which is really enjoyable, and you completely understand why everyone is into the lead girl. And that's what I thought Twilight should have been like.I guess at the end of the day, you can never underestimate the power of marketing, both for the books and the movies, or the buying power of the average teenage girl.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It wasn't that bad,"OK, so i was a late bloomer into the book craze, i read the first one about 3 weeks after it came to theaters (i read the book before i saw it), but then ate up the other books, one right after the other! Yes, i am an adult, and i loved the books, but strictly for the joys of getting lost in a story, they are by far not amazingly written or anything like that, so don't start busting my chops about literature, OK.... but, as i was saying, i loved the books, but the movies....Twilight, decent, it was nice to see the characters visually, i think they did a decent casting job. I love Kristen Stewart as Bella, and i think Rob Pattinson is great for Edward...but i think the lack comes from the directors and the screenplay writers Saying that, i thought New Moon was actually pretty bad...i reserved my copy of Twilight on DVD and haven't even considered purchasing New Moon, maybe by the time Eclipse comes out on DVD i'll get it.but back to the topic, i actually enjoyed Eclipse a lot.Yes, like the other reviews, there was a LOT of story left out. It did seem too fast and too slow at the same time. However, the makeup i actually thought was decent this time! Twilight you could see the makeup on everyone, New Moon, not that much vampire work, so not that big of a deal, and Eclipse, i actually like the stylization of the vampires...they were meant to look a little stony and not just white. Yes, the score sucked, the sound editing could have been a little smoother, and the transitions between scenes should have been a little more blatant sometimes. However, as these movies go, i really did enjoy this. Maybe they'll release an extended version DVD to fill in some of the gaps, or maybe, now that they are doing Breaking Dawn in two films, they extend some of the Eclipse story into Breaking Dawn. Anyway, it was fun, i'd go see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There is no point in writing a summary since the movie lacks a real plot.,"Honestly I didn't think this movie would be such a disappointment considering ""Bella"", ""Edward"" and ""Jakob"" has had two attempts already in the previous movies to learn how to act. Considering the hype revolving this movie I really thought it would differ more from the first and second one, but to me it only feels like one prolonged version of the first. Besides lacking in plot, the movie also has to much romance without anything leading up to it. It's like Edward and Bella are attached to each others lips to the extent of being unable to communicate with oneanother. It's not that I don't like romance quite the contrary, It's just hard for me to believe in them being In love, since they never seem to connect in any way. Also I really don't like the cop-father what's his face, he reminds me of Deputy Doofy from scary movie.Im not even going to mention all the incorrect facts ""Stephanie Meyer"" writes about vampires, but it is tedious work to try to ignore while watching the movie.So in conclusion I urge everyone who's not a twelve-year old girl on acid, not to waste you precious time watching this movie. It doesn't matter how many awards it has received or records it has broken, people who enjoy this and consider it to be a movie of the vampire genre are (no offense) retarded.Still it get's a 4 because I'm in generous mood and despite the fact that ""Bella"" looks like a junky she's kind of cute in a cancer kind of way:)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A girl's eternal choice between necrophilia and bestiality,"We all know of the battle on the internet between Twihard and Twihaters, both be very vocal opinions and giving the films artificially high and low scores. This is clear when you look at the voting breakdown on the IMDb scores for all three Twilight films so far and since Twihaters are much more likely to use IMDb they have made the scores low. I am a neutral to Twilight so my review for Eclipse will be honest.Eclipse starts off with a more darker opening, with a young man, Riley Biers (Xavier Samuel) getting attacked by a vampire outside a Seattle bar on a cold rainy night. The film then goes to Forks to see Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) as they prepare for their graduation, but importantly for the date Bella will have to be turned into a vampire. Bella has to say to goodbye to everyone she knows, without them even knowing she is going. But matters are made more complex because of the feud between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) because of Jacob's love for Bella, the feud between the Cullen vampires and the Quileute werewolves and more important, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her army of new born vampires wanting to kill Bella.The coup for the Twilight franchise was getting David Slade to direct Eclipse. I personally think Slade is not the great new hope some critics making him out to be but he does have a reputation after making Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night. Still he does have a darker edge then Chris Weitz who directed New Moon and he is more confidence with action compared to Catherine Hardwicke. There were interesting moments like the flashbacks showing the origins of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone). In the film it shows that Rosalie was properly gang raped and when she was turned into a vampire she got her bloody revenge (though it cuts away before you got to see the juicy violence). Rosalie is also interesting because she hates being a vampire and tells Bella what her dreams were before she was turned. The action is also the best in the series having a big battle between the Cullen and werewolves against the new born vampires. Many vampires deaths are actually shown this time round. I just wish that the action scenes were longer. The CGI for the wolves is better then it was in New Moon and they did have more of a wolf like look when in New Moon they looked more like huskies.A problem of the series has been the acting. Stewart is a little stiff but she is not terrible, she is not the whiny then she was in New Moon. Pattinson is decent and he is best of the trio of stars, adding some dramatic weight and I personally believe he will be successful after Twilight. He is at least trying to make more independent projects like Water and Elephants. On the other hand Lautner is a terrible actor, unable to show real emotion and I am sure he was cast because of his body and that he looks a little Native American. Its even joked in the film on whether he has a top on. His performance and character felt forced and he relationships with the characters was empty. Most of the younger members of the tribe looked like they were cast because of their looks. Some of the supporting cast were better, like Reed and Anna Kendrick but they are not given enough screen time.A problem that I have with all the Twilight films is that they come up with interesting ideas but does not explore them enough. This time round it was the formation of a vampire army: I would have liked to have seen how that was done, how people were targeted, turned and fed a diet of ideas to make them loyal. I wanted to see the violence and chaos they caused in Seattle and more of the public and media panic. I liked the idea that newborn vampires are more powerful but are particularly wild animals with no control. I have not read the books, so I can only judge Eclipse as a film but I do know that the character Bree Tanner (Jodelle Ferland) is teenager who was turned into a vampire was expanded on. I would liked to seen the story through her eyes and how she hates what she has become. But she is barely in the film.There are some interesting ideas in the film. The main one is Bella who is willing to sacrifice her innocents, life and chance to gain experiences for love, particularly because Bella is only 18 and she if she goes through with the change it would be a mistake she can never rectify. I know that focus was always going to be on Bella and Edward, but some scenes involving those two and Bella's home and social situation could have been shorten and the action/adventure element been heighten up.On a technically the music score is the best so far. That is thanks to Howard Shore, a great composer who is best know for his work on Lord of the Rings. His music was fitting to the situation, whether it is an important fight or a more personal scene and Slade and Shore rely least on outside music. Javier Aguirresarobe is also a very good cinematography, having worked on New Moon and The Road and he is able to craft some really nice shots of the mountains in the background and foreground, the sunny environment of Bella's mum's home and the field of bluebells.Eclipse is the best of the Twilight films so far.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst Eclipse I ever see,"When you see a real eclipse, the scientists say to you ""don't look it, maybe you'll lose your vision..."" That's the same with this typical, predictable, and bad performed movie. Not only the story sucks with the same guideline of the sequel, also doesn't give anything new, fresh, a roll movement of the history. TOO predictable also is the sequence, if you joke in the theater what will happen, your laugh more higher when you will goes like a map. The actors, again staffs nominated for another RAZZIE for WORST performance ever in a theater. So ¿why I see again this sequel? 'cause my little sister who doesn't know anything about quality films, good photography, great performance for actresses... If you see, this movie is for people under a 90 IQ.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good  intentions,"powerful images, impressive fight scenes, dramatic conquest of the heart of Bella. werewolves are the remarkable part. but, like each part, the force of images is far to be enough. because are only images, the story is too fragile, the motivation of characters - only sketch. so, it remains , in the best situation, only a teenager film, and a decent adaptation of novel. part of a trend, he has many good intentions,splendid special effects but , in same time, it has the sin of little ideas for create a credible story. and that sin covers all.short, a Hollywood product, pure show, thin story, good intentions, fake romanticism and seduction of a public without real cultural roots.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
total crap,"i recommend twilight franchise that plz stop making its sequels,i beg u........... they even don'not know how to make a good movie i see this movie only coz of Jacob i see this only in 1 hour then i realize that i have wasted my 1 hour It's just a plain awful movie and there is nothing good about it. i want my 1 hour back who give me that????????????????? The whole love triangle had no chemistry. Would anyone actually act like this in real life? Because I'm sure that if Bella pranced off to kiss Jacob when her BOYFRIEND was but a mere 10 feet away, he'd go kick some major arse...but no. No fighting, no arguments, and no real mention of the subject. Which is really just downright unbelievable. The dialogue between the three was also tense, and I found I cringed more than once.its just i wanted 2 say",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent production values. Somewhat dull but way better than the previous.,"""Eclipse"" is the most commented movie between teenagers. It has a hot cast consistent of desirable teen actors. Who is not tired of listening to people who are into Team Jacob or Team Edward? Brrr.""Eclipse"" is in my opinion and uncomfortable watch. For one instance I thought it was well directed but contrasts with kitschy dull dialogs filed with clichés that made me cringe at some points. I mean, we have a splendid atmosphere through dynamic aerial camera angles, dark settings, excellent atmosphere (the first scene where Riley is attacked under a heavy rain for example), a brutal battle that is surprisingly attractive for the eye and more.But in the other side, we get boring love declarations, Edward rejecting Bella when she's ready for sex because he ""wants to wait until marriage"" (come on!), Bella telling her father she's a virgin, Jacob telling Bella he loves her, and Bella always being the center of attention.I think I know what happened with ""Eclipse"". In my opinion, it's easy to diagnose because Director David Slade is an avid Horror follower and even directed the obscure ""30 Days of NIght"" and the underrated ""Hard Candy"". Slade was obligated to insert the terrible dialog sequences, the kitsch moments such as when the three share a tent. I mean, it's a really uncomfortable watch: a horror atmosphere PG-13 oriented movie mixed with romantic dialogs in which we are supposed to believe that a handsome vampire is the perfect lover. Blah!The movie looks good. Feels good and generates memorable moments. The battle between the army of vampires versus the alliance of werewolves and vampires is tremendous. Great camera angles, intense fighting, violent be headings, beatings, vampires and werewolves getting pounded to the ground, and the cool fight between Edward and Victoria. This battle is the best scene in the trilogy, IMO.So we have a charismatic cast, just decent CGI, and a visual attractive direction. I didn't think I would find in a ""Twilight"" movie a band of vampires causing hysteria, murdering, burning cars and more. It was about time!.Another positive aspect about this movie are the flashback sequences that show the past of the Cullens. At last we know what's going on with Rosalie's hostile attitude. I liked Jasper's love story and what happens with Alice. In these scenes I got a feeling of a stylish horror movie flick.The flashback that explains the feud between werewolves and vampires is great. The way the ""cold man"" appears and is destroyed by wolves is very dark and good. But it was even better when the sexy female vampire returns to the village in revenge and destroys the whole tribe. That's until she's attacked and killed by the grandpa and wise man of the place. I liked how her wife sacrifices her life in order to stop the sexy but mad vampire. Damn good scene.We even get a very creepy nightmare in which Maria speaks in Spanish and Victoria suddenly appears and disappears while whispering in Riley's ear. I didn't see that coming!.What are the uncomfortable scenes I was referring before? When Bella is freezing and Edward can't do anything about it. So, Jacob appears shirtless (as always) and offers hugging Bella to make her feel warm. Both men argue and Bella tells them ""don't fight"". Also, the moment where Bella decides to kiss Jacob because she suddenly realizes she loves him. And the worst of all, the line ""I'm hotter than you"". Brrrr. But I knew these king of scenes were going to happen. Shame to myself!.They also keep talking about their wedding... since New Moon! And nothing really happens. The whole vampire-human conversion also keeps ringing in my ears.The acting is a little more better than in ""New Moon"". Or at least the lead actors believe their crappy dialogs. Robert Pattinson still looks static and doesn't show any emotions. Well maybe the role asks for those kind of histrionic qualities. Taylor Lautner reminds me a lot of A.C. Slater from ""Saved by the Bell"" and that's why I think he's a cool guy. His acting is putrid and I hate every scene where he appears shirtless. Kristen Stewart is a major babe. I mean, it's really difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she has on screen time. Her acting is wooden.Bryce Dallas Howard takes on the role of Victoria. She's extremely sexy, arousing. I like her facial expressions.Nikki Reed, Ashleey Greene, and Anna Kendrick don't have much on screen time but their charisma is very natural. They are three beautiful girls that act really good, very sexy (specially hot Nikki) and it's good that we finally learn more bout their past. Xavier Samuel was good as Riley. An interesting scapegoat by Victoria. Billy Burke is a low profile but decent actor that delivers some funny lines like ""This Edward, I think I like him a little more"" or something. The rest is OK.I wanted to know more from the Volturi. It's amongst the best sub-plots of the trilogy. Dakota Fanning has more on screen time and her scenes demonstrate she's a key character in the future. Oh, and she's very pretty.The soundtrack was really good, catchy. Muse's song should be very popular.In general, I think ""Eclipse"" is way better than the kitschy ""Twilight"" and the mess that became to be ""New Moon"". At least in this one we have action, romance, and a dark atmosphere. Fans of the books will love it and fans of horror like me will just ignore it in the future.But take my word, it works better if you want to get lucky with a girl after watching in on the movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The continued weak acting of Stewart and Lautner really hurts this one.,"The continuing adventures of vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the human girl named Bella who loves him (Kristen Stewart) and another guy named Jacob who's a werewolf (Taylor Lautner). Problem is Jacob loves Bella and Bella has to choose between Edward and him while a bunch of deadly vampires prepare an attack.This started off pretty well. It's well-directed, has some beautiful cinematography and Pattinson and his family are all good actors. Also we get flashbacks to Edward's family and why they became vampires and those are interesting. Also the werewolves are great! Unknown Xavier Samuel also makes a strong impression as Riley. Then what's the problem? Stewart and Lautner. They are TERRIBLE! Their faces never change expression and you seriously don't know how to take their scenes. More than once I thought why were Edward and Jacob were even interested in her! She's whiny and expressionless! We also get at least FIVE conversations over who she should pick as a boyfriend. It got old real quick. These talks are boring and really drag the movie down. Still the teenage girls in my audience seemed riveted. I also got a good laugh of how they all groaned when you first see Lautner with his shirt off (he IS in very good shape). The final fight is also lots of fun--quick and violent with great special effects. This gets a 6 for Pattinson and all the other actors, some beautiful scenes and the special effects--but Stewart and Lautner really wear this down.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who hid the lighting lamp?,"I'm sure Stephenie Meyer had pure motives to do Twilight books: she wanted to create romantic, clean Love never dies story, with thrill of danger, but without jumping to the sewers. Unfortunately, these films are quite awful: there is nothing romantic, lush and otherwordly in them, so unlike in the mistitled but brilliant Bram Stoker's Dracula. Characters, plot and settings are boring - I'm sure Bella is sweet person, but I just can't care about her love life - and there is no visual style. Actually, one thing I really hate in these modern films is ugly photography. Who hid the lighting lamp? Atmospheric lighting is not same thing than BAD lighting and this ugly, muddy colour scheme. However, I hope that those who still ídiotically whine about changed vampire rules, would stop. Please, everyone and their cousin changes them, not even vampire folklore agrees with all rules because they differ from country to country, and for example, Dracula walked happily in sunlight.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun movie to watch for the twilight series fans!!,"I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a series. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight Series fans. But if you see it in the theater, go during a time when all the little junior high and high school girls are in class; your eardrums will thank you for it. And I swear I lost ten IQ points just listening to them.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strictly a Teen Movie,"I saw Twilight on television. See my review of it on this site. That movie was enough. I skipped the second movie. There was absolutely nothing to see around here, so I reluctantly saw this crap last evening. My friend and I were going to leave after about one half hour, but because the admission price of a ticket was so costly, we stayed. Oh, torture. A real teen movie with a 25 year old Pattinson who simply, to me, is not all that, and an 18 year old buffed bodied kid with such a bulbous and wide nose, well, that is all you see of Taylor Lautner the minute he appears on screen--that big, wide nose. And this, the result of a nose job, too. I do not see the appeal of him or for him. Sure, he has a nice physique, but even with his nose job, he needs another. His nose is all over his face. I read there was not much they could have done. Some noses are like that, especially with thick nose skin. I repeat: a teen movie and with horrible acting encased in a juvenile plot, that is fantasy come to life. Teens made this saga a hot money maker, and now a third one is coming. Awful. Complete garbage. And the wigs in this movie were so obvious, it bordered on the absurd. Stay home.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight Eclipse: in a nutshell,"Gruaduation is fast approaching with Bella's choice still hangs whether to choose between Edward or Jacob, this plot line extends throughout the whole movie with some action in between. seeing this movie made me wonder what's the use of this installment;you can see the hesitation in Bella,you can see the past of certain Cullen family members and i felt hollow after watching this movie. Despite all of it's hype this one stands out in disappointment the acting was a little bit iffy,the plot was slow to improve and the scriptwriting was not done that well. If i were a Twilight fan i might have liked this installment,but this one doesn't cut it i gave it a 4 just because it at least got the plot correct but the other things like acting,scriptwriting,editing...etc was lousy i hope they correct their mistake so we can enjoy the last part.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not that bad,"well, i've expected much worse after seeing new moon, but it turned out not to be that bad. the actors had more facial expressions, the directing was WAY better than in the previous movies and the CGI worked pretty well. but i think they used too much quotations from the book (don't know if it was so because the screen writer wanted to keep it as close to the book as possible or just because she was too lazy to come up with something on her own) and sometimes i got the impression that the storyline was jumping from one picture to another without any deeper intention... you can't make something from nothing, though, so i'm thinking i had quite a good time watching it even if about zillion ways of how differently spend two hours occure to me:)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrible,"Plot = OK Acting = Poor Direction = Bad Effects = TerribleReally, is this the best they could do, knowing the the franchise was massive. Very bad movie and such a waste - could have been excellent. The main gripe is that it may as well be an episode of Buffy - it's as if they have made it for TV rather than being a full blown movie experience. It could be laziness knowing that it would do well anyway but feel it has let the series down and will always be known as the crap twilight - a bit like Superman II all those years ago. So you have to watch it if you are watching the series but you also could do yourself a very big favour by watching anything else at all instead. Sometimes books do not need to be made into movies or do what Harry Potter does and split it over a couple of releases. HP does it very very well, Twilight very very badly. HP will still be watched 20 years from now I fear that this series will be forgotten and rightly so.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uneasy Alliance,"For those who read the books that this film series is based on there were no plot surprises. But filmgoers like myself might have expected that the vampires and werewolves would be going at each other in Eclipse.Not so, instead the vampires led by Robert Pattinson and the Indian werewolves featuring Taylor Lautner work out an uneasy truce in Eclipse. It's a tension filled truce because these two really hate each other because of their love of Kristen Stewart. Because of that they unite to defend against a common enemy.In nearby Seattle there have been a rash of killings and disappearances that have the city in panic. The vampires however know what's going on. Someone is recruiting a vampire army in the way that vampires have done since Bela Lugosi. And we learn in Eclipse that new vampires are the strongest because they've not learned discipline.Who's doing this is Bryce Dallas Howard, female vampire who's mate was killed by Robert Pattinson back in the first movie. She's out to get the human girl he loves in the same manner.But since Taylor Lautner is also in love with Stewart, he can get the werewolves to work in uneasy alliance with the vampires to save Kristen. It all leads to a real nasty climax of a battle.The stars are among the hottest box office there is in current Hollywood. Pattinson's soulful looks together with Stewart's beauty and Lautner's physique all have their share of fans. Personally I'm a fan of Lautner who has the finest teen body since Mario Lopez on Saved By The Bell.Nice sincere playing by the cast and the great special effects make this an undead treat. I still love the way the Indian kids wolf out to protect the tribal land.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse""...good if not better than the original TWILIGHT","The first TWILIGHT film was really good as I said in my review for the first TWILIGHT film. I got to NEW MOON and I said I hated it and it was something that I would never watch again, but now I get into the third film in the Twilight film franchise, ECLIPSE.I had to say I had mixed feelings when I first saw the trailer for THE TWILIGHT SAGA - ECLIPSE. Do you know how crappy and bad that the story of THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON was? Well, the third film gladly makes up for all of the crappy stuff NEW MOON had in it.The plot of the movie follows the book nicely. The film follows Bella Swan once again, as she develops awareness of the complications of marrying Edward Cullen. As Victoria draws nearer with a group of newborn vampires, Jacob Black and the rest of the werewolf alliance to destroy her, in turn, to keep Bella safe. While Bella tries to decide who she is, a fight brews and the consequences are paid once Jacob gets hurt. Intent on keeping a compromise with Edward, she vows to keep true to her engagement and marry him.After the critical response and box office success of NEW MOON, it was announced that in early November 2008, Summit Entertainment announced that they had attained the rights to the remaining books in Stephanie Meyer's book series, TWILIGHT: New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. In February 2009, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. The director of the second film, Chris Weitz, decided since he was in the post-production phase of NEW MOON would not be directing the film. Instead, David Slade was directing the film, with Melissa Rosenberg returning as the script writer.The story is not as confusing as the story of NEW MOON was, it is really good. The CGI on the werewolves is a very good improvement over the CGI in NEW MOON. The dialogue is not an issue in this film as it was in the second film. The musical score was not composed by Alexandre Desplat, as he would work on the final two Harry Potter films, instead Howard Shore, composer of The Hobbit trilogy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was brought in to compose the film score. The soundtrack is once again amazing with songs like ""Heavy Heart."" The acting is back and forth, but credit has to be given to the three main actors: Kristen Stewart as Bella is amazing, Taylor Lautner as Jacob is amazing this time around and Robert Pattinson as Edward is once again amazing. The entire original cast returns this time including Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Elizabeth Reaser, Peter Facinelli, Billy Burke and Ashley Greene. Also returning, Dakota Fanning as Jane and she is stunning and very beautiful.There are new major editions to the cast: Jodelle Ferland plays the role of Bree Tanner, a newly turned vampire. Ferland was in a video game adaptation of Silent Hill, which was released in 2006. Other new cast members included: Julia Jones as Leah Clearwater, Booboo Stewart as Seth Clearwater, Jack Huston as Royce King, Catalina Sandino Moreno as Maria and Xavier Samuel as Riley.The biggest casting change was the part of Victoria. Since the character was originally played by Rachel Lefevre, Summit Entertainment announced that Bryce Dallas Howard would play the part for the third film. Lefevre was saddened and disappointed by the decision to recast her part. The action sequences is really what makes the movie a stand-out for me and the fight choreography is really good. This movie should have won an Academy Award for best visual effects and best music as far as those two went.Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: ECLIPSE is really good, if not better than the third film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The emo generation's favourite movie strikes again harder than ever,"Things are simple with this movie. When I watched the first twilight I was like ""meh"", when I watched the second movie, New Moon, I was like ""this is one of the worst movie I have ever seen"" but after I watched ""Eclipse"" I was like ""at least it's not worse than Killers... I think the best twilight movie"". And yes it was. Eclipse is the best Twilight movie thanks to David Slade who managed to get the best of this, in my humble order, lame story.The story in eclipse it's pretty much the same like in New Moon but now with a little bit more action and cool stuff. It was executed much better. If it was like an hour shorter maybe it would have been better since I almost fainted out while waiting for the obvious ending. The same bullsh*t occurred on the screen, the same love triangle, the same lines, the same weak development, the same bad acting, the same conflicts but not the same action scenes. Those action scenes saved the film for me along with the better cinematography. It was really well edited even if it was long and dull but still, it managed to at least entertain for couple of minutes even a guy like me which does not embrace the series.Besides the better execution everything else lacked in sense of MAKING SENSE. The soundtrack was again boring. Everything about the story was predictable and the lines were so repetitive. I can't believe they wasted almost 7 total hours on a story that could have been told in like 2 hours and a half (at most). It's just too long and thinking that they are making another 2 movies preparing the grand finale gives me a big headache. I'm not trying to be a douchebag and bash the movie senseless but even if this is the best Twilight movie it's still a bad movie. Nothing great about it. The only good thing were the action sequences and I think this is the fourth time I'm saying it. I'm tired of Jacob showing he's abs, tired of Bella's confusion or Edward's pathetic reminiscent of love. Like the movie says, he is just too old-school.Eclipse delivers at the end of the day, the best movie for the emo generation since they are pretty much the biggest fans of the series. Not stereotyping but ... Did I felt I wasted my money? No, because this is what I do: review movies. I'm a movie addict but still, for me, Twilight will remain the series that have no sense whatsoever. I'm sorry kids.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not great......but not bad either!,"The first thought that came to my mind after watching Twilight eclipse was that this movie is better than its predecessor New Moon, which I thought for the most part was slow-paced, bleak and dull. This movie has some good moments but that said, it has its share of flaws too.Liked: Chemistry between the lead actors, conversation between Edward and Jacob in the tent, the interaction between the Cullens and the werewolf clan, the action sequences and the occasional funny lines.Disliked: The dialogues, that fact that the acting hasn't improved as much as I would have liked, the Volturi (I dunno what in the world they were doing in this movie), the replacement for Victoria (she doesn't look mean enough) and Bella's endless confusion (make up your mind girl!).I'm sure the die-hard twilight fans would love this movie.

"I quite enjoyed this, contrary to expectations.","Don't get me wrong, I'm normally not even remotely interested in the Twilight series (I only saw the first two movies following the urging of peers), but the newest installment was great.First off, the first two films were grossly overrated; filled with teenage angst and far too much serious, dreadfully boring romantic drama. As a guy, it was hard to appreciate the movies at all; even despite the attempt at drawing in a little more gratuitous violence in the second movie (which fell flat on its face because it was largely unconvincing and felt unnaturally forced).Now, with the introduction of Slade as the director, we see the introduction of a little humor to the storyline (""Doesn't he have a shirt?"" ""Let's face it, I am hotter than you.""), convincingly awesome action scenes, and far more interesting plot development on the Bella-Edward-Jacob love triangle.Literally, things happened in this movie! I was honestly surprised by how much fun Eclipse was, and my friends, both male and female, are all in agreement; I could easily recommend it to guys and gals alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best So Far,"I really enjoyed the Twilight book series, but I haven't always liked the movies. I thought Eclipse was the best movie so far; and all in all, I enjoyed it. I thought the screenplay was far better than previous Twilight movies. The acting had improved somehow as well. The actor who played Jacob Black was especially committed to his role. His portrayal stole the show for me. The action scenes were good, and kept my husband from being completely bored by mushy love scenes. Without giving anything away, I would say that the movie stayed pretty true to the book, which I liked. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the books and anyone who enjoys romantic films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"too decently directed to be bad, too ham-fisted and stupid and vapid to be any good.  an uncomfortable middle","Twilight: Eclispe, the third in the series, this time gets David Slade, formerly of flawed but still impressive outings Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night, at the helm of the vampire-werewolf-insipid-romance ""saga"" everyone loves to hate (or just hates to love I guess). And it turns out to be one of those rare cases where you watch a good director working a bad script. To face facts, all of the scripts- via the Meyer books- are terrible, hackneyed, trashy. The results this time are the ""best"" of the series, however technically- some decent action and a couple of well-acted and (perhaps from the director's input) well-written scenes. But the more it tries, the more it draws attention to how vapid and s*** the main characters are. I'm reminded of that scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen goes up to the couple on the street and asks what they do to keep their relationship going: ""Well, I'm shallow, and he's shallow, and we have nothing interesting to say."" ""Ah, so you've found something that works for you.""Why should anyone care about Bella? Perhaps cause she breathes, and has some thoughts, but what are her interests? What does she care about, aside from precious old-high-schooler Edward, or maybe 2nd-tier bare-shirted Jacob, or at the bottom of the rung her limp noodle father? If you had to ask what she was to someone who saw this movie, one might say indecisive, manipulative (or manipulated by proxy), and sees nothing ahead of the future. Perhaps she missed out on extra-curricular activities after school. But again, I kept trying to find something, anything, to latch on to to make me care what would happen to her, or what would happen with her and these two guys, who don't give her any great shakes either. That Kristen Stewart isn't a terrible actress (just, in general here, dull or annoying), makes more apparent how screwed up she is. But being screwed up doesn't always make one interesting.Perhaps more interesting are the men in her life, but of course those are ""Team"" Edward and ""Team"" Jacob. This time the filmmakers do try to throw some in-jokes our way as it goes with them (""Where's his shirt?"" asked by Edward is maybe too knowing, especially before more shirt-less happenings go on in the runtime), and there's actually a halfway nice scene (not great, just nice) where Eddie and Jakey have a heart to heart about how they really feel, what things might be like without what's-her-name screwing with them and them screwing her metaphorically back. But really, it's just more of the same, with a plot in the story that makes things all the more obnoxious on Bella's end. So many people end up dying, or turning into vampires and then dying or being killed, and all because Bella has to have her man. Looking at them, they're a little *too* Ossie and Harriet. The kind you can't stand.Again, unlike with New Moon especially, Slade knows how to direct actors.... sometimes (Jackson Rathbone a MAJOR exception, being creepy like an incestuous love-spawn of Harpo Marx). And he knows how to even get some cool action going on, once or twice at least, such as in the big climax where the wolves, looking less ridiculous than the last film, attacking the 'bad' vampires out to get Bella. And he gets a fascinating flashback with one of the female Cullen vamps. But at the end of it all, is it worth it? Still, not really. If you're looking for a technically proficient and competent film that only some of the time has dialog making one laugh to oneself (or guffaw or belly laugh or LOL), then be my guest. But if you happen to be more like me, looking for the unintentional hilarity of teenage romance gone idiotic and morally questionable for young women in the guise of crappy vampires, you may be disappointed. The more Slade and company try, the more I just wish it were something else, like, for example, not this.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not for me, but why is it actually for anyone?","Let's get this out of the way first, the Twilight saga is not my cup of tea. Sure I like vampire movies, but this is not a vampire series, nor a werewolf one. Its a series full of long, tedious pauses padding off as ""sexual tension"", and actors whom hormonal teenage girls can pander over. With that in mind I question why I still continue to see this dross. I have now seen all three currently released on the cinemas, the first being a complete and utter waste of my time, the second being mildly diverting in the final half hour, and then now there is this one. This one bemuses perhaps the most of the series as I had gone in after reading quite decent reviews. While I didn't expect miracles I at least hoped to see some improvement. Sadly I'd argue this was just as bad as the first one, all the mild improvement made in the first one now being put behind us. The three leads do their roles with some decency, Taylor Lautner by far being the best of the mediocre bunch. But the story is still where I get frustrated. I swear in this movies absolutely nothing happens, the promise of a wedding at the second one does not even come close to being fulfilled here. And the action comes in such short supply most male minds will have switched off far earlier.Robert Pattinson is still the weak link for me in this series, quite why he's screamed at over is beyond me. His scenes are just painful, he pouts, he acts far too emotional and he has long pauses. It is a terribly written role for a terrible character. Kristen Stewart at least has got over the whiny stage of the second movie, and here she has livened up, but still she gets the bulk of the horrific lines involving souls and whatnot that make your eyes role. So like the sequel it is left to Taylor Lautner to add some energy into the movie. Sure once again he is the eye candy, I mean does he really need to be shirtless that often? But at least he's got a spark of charisma, something I can see coming out when he has much better roles. The rest of the cast are the usual cardboard cutouts. The vamps and werewolves so underwritten you wonder why they're there. And as for the recasting of Bryce Dallas Howard, why bother?Story wise this feels like a short story at best painfully dragged to feature length movie. Once again the pace is slow, the action few and far between and special effects ranging from average to downright awful, I still despise the vampire running sequences. I will be fair and say for fans of the Twilight saga this will no doubt be a hoot for them. I don;t understand why that is at all, but I have just chosen to accept it for now. Sadly we have another two parts still to come, and as cliffhangers go, well its not exactly something that makes me want to go running back to the theatre when Breaking Dawn arrives. The final action scene is admittedly fairly decent, not too keen on the vampire death effect though. But its the closest the series has come to even trying to entertain the male audience, so for that it has my slightest gratitude. But without the gravitas of Michael Sheen like its predecessor, this movie sadly is just another overlong piece of tripe pandering to fans who seem almost blinded at how terrible this series truly is. So strictly for fans, or for those like me that have got this far ans in a sick way just go to see if it can possibly get any worse.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight: Eclipse comes to theaters with great anticipation,"For many years young girls have fantasized of being the damsel in distress. Times due change but the main theme of a young girl needing a knight to come to rescue her continue to infuse themselves into our newest films. In a mix of vampires and werewolves, The Twilight Films have capitalized on bringing a story to the screen that satisfies the girls romanticism of stories known mostly today as fairy tales.""Twilight: Eclipse,"" which opened last weekend is the third film in a series brought to screen as an adaption of the very popular books written by Stephenie Meyer. Bella, the central character played by Kristen Stewart, continues her relationship with her vampire boyfriend Edward, portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Bella is a self-admitted awkward teenager and her character has more complicated decisions than most teenagers. About to graduate from high school, it's not what college to select that concerns her. Her desire to be a vampire and evolve into a new and strange world is her main desire. Yet, there are battles to be won and hearts to be broken before things resolve. Taylor Lautner returns as Jacob along with all the vampires as well.""Twilight: Eclipse"" is a fair film on it's own, but for Twilight fans it is the best of the three films. This film has had a special effects upgrade and the story line allows the us to see in the past of the vampires long lives. There are quite a few breaks of humor that sparkle in the mist of such a dark story of even a darker world. Billy Burke, as Bella's father, provides the necessary anchor to make the story effective and he and Kristen Stewart share a few good father/daughter moments.It is truly a mistake to see this movie without viewing the previous films ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon,"" which luckily are out on DVD. If you are ready for two hours of vampires, werewolves and more teenage angst than the prom, this is the film for you. And as the Twilight fans already know that this is not the finish for the series of films. Twilight: Breaking Dawn will be sent to theaters in two parts. Part one to air in 2011 and part two to follow in 2012.For more film review by Kay Shackleton, click here: http://www.examiner.com/x-53875-Palm-Springs-Film-Industry-Examiner",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as poor as expected,"I read these books after watching, and somewhat enjoying, Twilight. I found the books to be poor on the whole and would probably rate them as follows: Twilight - Reasonable. New Moon - Awful. Eclipse - Mediocre. Breaking Dawn - Laughable. I think I kept reading them for the same reason we slow down to look at an accident on the opposite carriageway.That said, I'm watching the rest of the films, and probably for the same reason. So far, they're following the pattern of the books. I'd've given Twilight a 7 and New Moon a 1 (2 at the very most) though I have to say that the change of director between Twilight and New Moon was most likely the primary cause of such a despicable result.Fortunately, they appear to have changed director again, and it shows in Eclipse. Despite the reviews here, I saw it today and, while I wouldn't say I was overly impressed I was, at least, pleasantly surprised to see that things had improved dramatically since New Moon, both in cinematography, screenplay and on the acting front too.The three stars, Stewart, Pattinson and, er, the kid who never wears a shirt, were still pretty wooden in this, but the overall effect of the film was neither as disjointed nor as cringe-worthy as that of its predecessor. It's still cheesy, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't laughing myself out of the cinema at the end or feeling embarrassed to even be associated with such trash.If you liked Twilight, I think you'll like this. If you liked New Moon, you're bound to like this but then you're probably not even bothering to read reviews and are most likely about fourteen and female.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the three,"Eclipse was by far the best of the Twilight saga so far. I'm not a reader so I will not discuss how close or far this film is from the book. What I do know is I am by far a huge vampire and werewolf fan.I will start with the acting though. Very much improved but still not great. After seeing Robert Pattinson in the movie 'Remember Me' I hardly doubt his acting ability and blame it on this series that I even thought he was bad. On the other hand, I can't say that for the other two big three. It does seem as though Kristen Stewart has read comments or something and has decided to try breathing through her nose for once but her acting is definitely not great. How she got cast for this part I'm not even sure (though I would not change her now). Taylor Lautner is improving but I still see him as the worser of the three. Congrats on all the muscles but you probably should have worked on your acting abilities a little more.As for the movie, the first 20 minutes were horrible but the movie did pick up. In the end I did enjoy the film but had I not been interested in the saga I probably would not have been. This film was much better put together than the first two and finally some decent action to it. I'm still lost on how 2 people fall in love with Bella's character but hey... that's what Hollywood does.I still think after reading a lot of the reviews here that so many are biased but the horrible obsession people have created over this series. The movie was not bad... the acting was much improved and the action and dialogue was better. I liked Twilight but I liked New Moon better (though I was not at all satisfied with it the first time and watching it again away from a bunch of screaming teen-aged girls in the theater definitely made a difference) and I definitely like Eclipse more than others.Overall you wanna be somewhat knowledgeable of the series before you go. But it is entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
hell lot better than new moon...,"i actually thought it was the best twilight movie... i hated new moon after watching twilight... and so was expecting eclipse to be even worse...but it took me by surprise when i saw it.. OK...lets start.. ACTING = 5 ,DIRECTION = 6 ,CAST = 8 ,SOUNDTRACKS = 4 ,STORY = 7 ......therefore according to me the movie is a 6/10 and a must watch for all twilight fans.. coz it's better than the previous 2.. it is the reason why i will be waiting for the 4th part... it also has a kissing scene involving jacob and bella...i actually felt bad for edward throughout the movie as there are many moments where bella shows inclination towards jacob and edward actually thinks that she loves him....jacob is shirtless almost throughout the movie...he is looking better than edward in this movie.. There's action in this one too....and if you have longed to see vampires vs wolves..your wait is over...there's a hardcore 10 minutes scene of the vampires vs the wolves as each one of them trying to protect Bella.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
HORRIBLE!! You may get an urge to throw something at the TV,"What an awful movie. The book was good, but the movie was garbage. It was so chopped up that it felt more like a show. Nothing flowed at all. It seems to be that way for a lot of book series turned movie series, ex Harry Potter. it was cut up into 2 mins scenes jumping from one to the other without full understanding and explanation of what is going or what did go on. Don't waste your money on a terrible movie. it made no sense, nothing flowed, the acting was terrible. The characters appeared dull and boring. Nobody acted the same as in the first one. The first movie was great. The other just belong in the trash. Don't watch it or else you'll be wasting your money and your sanity. I just wanted to slap all the characters in the face. Bella because she's just so awkward, weak, and even more boring. The rest of them because why is everyone so interested in Bella and why are they are risking their lives for such a boring and lifeless specimen.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The weaker of the three films,"I haven't read the books but I was definitely disappointed with how little happens in this film. I saw all 3 films in a day and the first 2 were fairly fast paced and entertaining but for a film that sells itself as a romance novel *nothing* happens in it. There are some action scenes and some fairly impressive CGI werewolves but they still cut away a lot of the time when a vampire does something that would involve CGI which makes you wonder what they spent their $65M budget on. I was also pretty fraustrated with the constant swaying of the plot, its obvious whats going to happen at the end of the film but it goes backward and forward treating the viewer like a bit of an idiot. Honestly you could skip this film, knowing that theirs a fourth coming out next year I'd just wait for that.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best part of the trilogy,"Again, I had to suffer watching Twilight. I am not a fan of the franchise but i had to see it due my reviews and being a horror geek. For me this was the best part. Here things go on and it's not all about talking and blah blah like in the first part. Again, Bella Swan can't decide who to choose, the vampire or the werewolf. If i had to met a girl who can't choose after all that time then she isn't worth waiting for. Anyhow, she even cheat on Edward Cullen by kissing Jacob Black just in front of him. Some parts were really enjoying but again the best parts are without the two leads. Still, for me the use of CGI wolfs is the let down of the movie, and they are bigger than a human...Like many have written, if you are into Twilight you will like it otherwise leave it as it is. Some nostalgia was in the picture for me, the lead singer of old school goth band Bauhaus has a appearance of maybe 30 seconds, but what a great performance. I guess I will plug True Blood in the DVD player to see something good.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010),"Considering my hate of the previous two Twilight films, I was surprised that this managed to engage me for the entire 2 hours. The film is simply better as a whole. The second film was unnecessary, with protagonists going missing, and the same love story playing out in a loop. Nothing was resolved in the last film, so it's good to see David Slade being able to handle this more complete picture. He does a surprising amount, finishing off character arcs from the first film, visiting the Cullens' pasts in rather sumptuous and well paced flashbacks, and giving everyone a bit more substance. Rather than laughing at the film, it actually made me laugh intentionally a few times. Jacob, Bella and Edward are still mostly terrible and boring characters. I just can't care for their relationships. One of the new antagonists was much more interesting. An emotional puppet coming to terms with his new powers. The wolves also looked A LOT better, and it was depressing to see action scenes that were shot better than recent action films such as The Expendables and The A Team.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the previous but it's still too uneven,"In the core of The Twilight Saga, there is the love story of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. And in the first book I found this rather entertaining and cheesy but still entertaining. But as the books kept adding more and more, that was lost and the movies while being poorly made aren't really helping. In Eclipse this core isn't really part of the movie, the movie works with all the added material, mainly Jacob Black.Robert Pattinson is an actor I do like but not playing Edward. His performance in Eclipse relies solely on the same painful look on his face and nothing else, and he talks kinda like an emo Christopher Walken. He does have a good few lines in the movies, but nothing else really. Edward come off as a jerk and rather creepy, instead of charming as he is supposed to be. Kristen Stewart has the hardest job as she has the weakest character. Kristen doesn't fit this role at all, she is a great actress that ends up coming off as flat and uninteresting as Bella, thanks to a uneven screenplay. And her character just gets weaker and weaker as the movies go on, she can even make the most simple of decision in this movie. Then there is Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black that is fantastic in this, the one character I didn't care for at all in the books, is the only one I give a damn about in the movies. Lautner plays Jacob with a certain mix of charm and a cocky attitude that works on- screen and is fun to watch. The rest of the rest of the cast is decent, unlike the previous movies in which they really didn't have much of role, in Eclipse they all play a much bigger part and they all worked well.There is definitely chemistry in the supporting cast.The big improvement of Eclipse is that it doesn't take itself as serious as the previous installments. They joke around about how over the top and ridiculous everything is and it makes the movie easier to like and more fun to watch. The other improvement is the action,it's very well choreographed and it's exciting and entertaining to watch. These are much-needed improvements in the franchise and they made the experience so much enjoyable.There are still many problems needed to make these movies great, Eclipse is the only one of these movies that I would say is good, but still many improvements are needed. The plot of the army of new-born vampire could have been more interesting but the plot is really non-existing because the movie keeps its focus so much on Edward,Bella and Jacob that they rush the story towards the end and just tell you whats gonna happen instead of showing us, and letting us be part of the film. So, it feels more like a friend explaining the novel to you instead of you paying to watch the work of professional writers, actors and director. And, I know that Twilight is more about the characters than the plot, but when the lead character is so weak,and Edward being so obviously one note, that leaves the movie in a tough position. I like the supporting cast but their time is so limited on-screen they don't add much to the movie, so it's up to leads and only Lautner stepped up .One actor can only do so much.So summing things up, Eclipse is a decent movie, way ahead of the previous installments. It still won't win over non-fans, but with the better made action scenes and occasional humor it's a more enjoyable experience. Many improvements are still needed, but this is a good step forward. It's more of the same but it's better made.I give it a 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Leaps and bounds above the first two films,"This film shocked me and when I say shocked me I mean wowwwww!!!! This was a decent movie. To some it was even worse a movie because they are of the a.d.d generation and have no right reviewing something if they don't have an understanding and appreciation for the art of filmmaking! This film had a stronger story than the first two combined, the acting was much improved, though still very dramatic ala Gothic soap opera. Kristen was very much there emotionally and seemed more grown up and less self centered. Robert Pattinson provided an intensity that allowed chemistry to be more believable and relevant for the two lovers. I gotta hand it to David Slade. I think he did the best who could to pick up the pieces that were so amateurishly, lazily, slopped around by the previous two directors who obviously had no artistic dedication to the series. Those directors were the evil genius masterminds who knew they would make a ton of money and didn't have to make good a movie to do so. Those fainting screaming girls just want to see their characters visibly on screen and it didn't matter to them if the movies were actually seriously respectable. But David Slade is an aspiring filmmaker with a respect for the art as seen in his debut Hard Candy. He really did try to use the clicheeeeeeeeeeee driven writing of Stephanie Meyer and make something special out of it all. And he succeeds more than fails! Eclipse is not a perfect movie but It gives a bit of hope for those true film lovers who are in the know of how trashy the series has been handled, the hope for those fans that are still curious as to where the finale will go, that maybe, just maybe, fourth time is a charm and it will all end with a BANGGG!!!!

Episode III - Return of the Cringe,"This time, it's original. This time, it's got Edward and Jacob together. This time, it's not as bad as New Moon, but oh my gosh it drags.After tolerating bad wigs, bad acting, bad writing, and melodramatic, brooding, moody, young adults, now the vampires and werewolves are properly interacting and it's somewhat interesting. Bella's whole plot is deciding who she'll be with for the rest of her life; the technically underage werewolf rebound, or the technically overage vampire poet. For two movies, Bella has unmistakeably chosen Edward, yet now for no real reason other than forced plot drama, she's having trouble deciding. Other than the drama, an underdeveloped sub-plot regarding new vampires raised by Victoria and her deception of one of them is greatly sidelined and really just gives the movie a third act that'll make up for the 'resolution' in the drama. The cinematography merges the filters of the previous two movies fairly well, and the acting seems to slowly be improving with each film.Overall, another one with another cliffhanger that feels like it's setting up something that isn't nearly as 'cool' as they think it's gonna be.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best of the Twilight films - but still not great,"The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).Out of the films, this was my favourite. As most with most of the films - and general comments translate across the franchise - there's not much to it but the interaction/rivalry between Edward and Jacob makes for fun watching, and often quite humorous. The increased interaction with the Quileutes and their mythologies is possibly the most interesting part of the entire five films and there's a lot of it in this film. Bella's increased to-and-fro with all the angst about her future is tiring as her reactions as no less stilted and limited than at the start. You'd think her character would develop. Edward at least has the excuse that he's dead! It's an entertaining film, a big, cinematic piece as with all the others with lovely panoramic scenes, but it's not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as Enjoyable as those Before It,"I am a man in my 20s and I loved the first two films. The cinematography is quite nice, the shots of Washington are beautiful, the dialogue is hilariously bad, the chemistry between Edward and Bella is funnily awkward, the dialogue is cringeworth in a funny way, and Kristen's acting is really bad. Also worth noting is how it's able to transport you into that 2000's/early 2010's era of fantasizing about goth/werewolf boyfriends.Where this film falls a little bit on it's enjoyment factor is that it is actually seemingly more competent in a way that keeps it from being campy but not good enough to be a good film. The dialogue, chemistry and Kristen's acting, all things that made the original two so funny, is not as funny anymore, nor is it good enough to elevate the predictable romance plot.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring!,"Way to make every character in your narrative unlikable (Alice, Jasper, and Charlie, this isn't about you). Edward is still full-throttle on his manipulative White Knight act. Jacob is a prick who can't take no as an answer because he's afraid of the friend zone. It is nice to see the wolves and vamps working together but that is the only real joy I got because the main three are so immature.

Best One.. so far!,"I am a huge Twilight fan. I read all 4 of the books and have both, Twilight and New Moon on DVD. I went to the midnight showing of Eclipse in my town and I absolutely loved it! I think it is the best one so far. I enjoyed everything about it. I thought Eclipse was the best book, and I was excited to see that the movie also is the best (so far). I am very excited to see Eclipse many more times and for the DVD to come out for me to own. I think that the cast has incredible acting skills. Some seem to think that Kristen Stewart is the worst actress of all time because of this movie. But I STRONGLY disagree. Most of the people that think that, have not read the books and have not taken the time to understand Bella and Edward's relationship. I feel that Kristen and Robert portray the awkwardness of the characters relationship wonderfully. They seem to show the chemistry of the love they share, but also the awkwardness of the vampire-human relationship, and even the thirst and pain that Edward feels every time he kisses Bella. I think that everyone involved in Eclipse did an awesome job at making it action packed and interesting. Great Job! :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Improvement,"Compared to the first and second film this one has some definite improvements. At this point the acting and lines have been accepted as being terrible, but there was a small improvement with a better script. I think what put this movie above the last two was the side story of the other vampires and the drama of a battle. With action taking up some of the screen time and seeing less of the cringe love story it helped make the movie much more enjoyable to endure. With a new director (as they change for each film) there was definitely some better camera angles and a bluer look to the movie to make it colder. Which again helped improve the movie overall.

Eclipse,"Yes it's no secret that these movies are bad. But I dont think a lot of people realize exactly WHY the twilight movie series is so bad.It's not bad because of the horrible acting, the awkward clunky rather atrocious dialogue, the piss poor characters. Granted these are all bad things, but they are merely the result of one BIG problem. That problem is this, whoever is writing these movies is not writing them with the actors in mind, not writing it with even a movie in mind, or an audience that watches movies. Whoever is writing these screenplays is translating the books into a movie script. They put in all the foofy dialogue (that fits in the books but doesn't in this format) they include every single moment and plot device from the book and put it into the movie. People, these are 700+ page books. If you try and cram 700+ pages into 2 hours it's going to be a freakin mess of a movie. So much happens in this movie and it's all really kind of confusing. They leave no room for real character development, no room for natural dialogue, they legit just pull quotes from the movie. It's a very weird thing. It's as if Stephenie Meyer told them that they could have the rights to her books IF they keep 90% of the book in the script. It doesn't translate well, I don't think it would translate well for any book to screen movie. And it ESPECIALLY doesn't work if you have the casting of the movie COMPLETELY wrong! And in these movies, that is indeed the case. But I can't blame the actors, I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio could deliver these lines any better than Robert Pattinson. It's just a ludicrous system they have going here. Maybe it changes in breaking dawn.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Must read the books to fully appreciate these films.,"You must ""READ"" the books to get the entire story.

These Saga's are much better stories than the Spiderman, Batman, Wolverine, Iron man and Star Wars romances in those Sci-Fi movies.

Best film of the 3 so far,"This is definitely a watchable action/romance film. If you compare it with the best of the genre - of course it falls short in a couple of categories, but it definitely is head and shoulders above the previous 2 films. Most important - try watching it without any pre-set ideas.About the bad parts: yes, some of the acting is very shallow. Yes, the tempo is a bit slower for a normal action film. Yes, the plot is a bit unrealistic. Then again - you do not watch such films for a realistic plots.The good things: there are really nice views (and I am not talking about the visual effects, just nice sceneries), there is a nice ambiance, and this time you do care a bit about the characters, as they finally seem to have at least some motivation.So I would advise you to watch the film if you want some easy going entertainment and in general like the combination of action and romance.But of course, don't expect a masterpiece here.

Eclipses New Moon,"I enjoyed Twilight. New Moon, was not thrilled with and still is not a movie I have seen more than once in the theater and on DVD. I think it was the morose, depressing feel of the movie. That is how the book is, but still, the music, score and soundtrack, and performances/chemistry just seemed off. That is all corrected with Eclipse.Performances are the best of the series. Stewart and Pattinson have a natural ease to their relationship now that was great to see. Stuart in particular has come a long way. Her constant eye fluttering when she tries to emote is all but gone and she has ditched the continual stop and go delivery that even my 9 year old daughter noticed and grew tired of in the previous films. Still on the relationship front, Stewart and Lautner's chemistry is MUCH improved over New Moon. I never bought into their relationship in New Moon, here, I sense more of a bond between them. All of this is can be created to the actor's finally getting into the groove with their characters, as well as being more seasoned. Also, director Slade should be credited. Who knew that the guy who brought us scary as hell vamps could turn around and take a story that is polar opposite and improve upon the previous two entries. Charlie is back with a lot more to say and that is welcome return to the first film.The story is much more gripping this go around, it is not focused on just Bella mourning her relationship with Edward. We get more information about the Cullen family. We get much more time between Bella and Charlie, we also get more with Jacob's family/tribe. It is a more full story than we have had in any of the entries thus far. We still only get a brief glimpse of the Volturi, wish we had more. The most enjoyable is the continual questioning if immortality is a gift or curse. We are given arguments on both side, though mostly on the curse side. This is something that has set this story apart from other vampire incarnations. Immortality is seen as all wonderful, but is it really? That is the question here. One element of the story that is actually expanded on is Edward's virtue of waiting until he and Bella are married to ""consumate"" their relationship. There is a scene where this is explained and it is something today's young women should take heed of; if their relationship is true, then it doesn't have to include having sex, but that be kept for the right time and that makes it much more special. Hoaky perhaps in today's world, but a welcome stance for a series to take. A relationship's power/truth is not measured by the physical side, but the actual love and respect between the guy/girl.The Cullen family is a lot more involved and for me that made this film a lot more enjoyable. Jasper in particular, who we hadn't heard much from gets a lot more to do and say here. I have mentioned this before, but the FULL story we get here is what makes Eclipse a lot more enjoyable and really sets up the final book's two-part movie venture.Special effects continue to improve. They are still not up there with some of the best FX I have seen, but compared to the first film, they are light years ahead.There was an element of humor in the script I was surprised by and again, a welcome. These moments came during times of banter between characters that came as very natural. It made them more real to me. In all of our relationships we get to a sense of full ease and can say most anything and that is where these characters are.All in all, Eclipse has made me excited about the movie series again and now I am anxious to see it completed with Breaking Dawn.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Step Up from New Moon,"Eclipse (2010)** (out of 4)Third film is the hugely successful series has Bella (Kristen Stewart) having to choose from the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and her best friend and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). While the three have their issues, a new breed of vampires are stalking Seattle and have their eyes on Bella. ECLIPSE is certainly a major step up from NEW MOON but that's not saying too much. Director David Slade manages to make a good looking picture and a somewhat well-made one but there's still no question that the screenplay is downright bad and pointless. I'm sure there are millions of girls who would disagree with me but as I sat through this film I kept asking myself what the point of everything was. I mean, are we supposed to really care about this love triangle that's going on? Not for a second did any of these three hit me as real characters and instead they seem like throw aways from a soap opera. I didn't believe any of their motivations and I didn't believe anything any of them were saying. I mean, having the 17-year-old Bella making decisions on her future as if she's some sort of an adult just made me laugh. I can't believe we're supposed to be taking any of this stuff serious and even if she wasn't in love with a vampire and werewolf you'd still question a lot of her and these men. Not for a single second did I find either man to be ""good"" for her. It seems both of them share a great number of problems and control issues, which I guess many would say I'm reading too much into them. The dialogue is downright horrendous at times and once again we've got a story for maybe an 80-minute movie but of course it gets extended to over two-hours. I thought the film did manage to get good performances from Stewart and Pattinson. Both were back in fine form after the really bad second film. Lautner once again shows that he probably didn't read any lines at his audition and instead just took off his shirt. Perhaps it's just because I'm a straight male but I was a little confused as to what point the male werewolves had at always being topless. Once again we're treated to some horrible and embarrassing CGI effects, which really made me wonder why the production values weren't bumped up a few notches and especially considering how much money the first two films made. With that said, there's some mild entertainment to be had here but let's hope things improve.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This the second one but also kinda the third one,"So this one is about how Bella gotta choose between Jacob and Edward, for like three fourths of the movie. Now why Bella and Edward gotta have all this break-up drama, is because of super convoluted stuff like he doesn't want to drink up her blood but he doesn't want her to grow old and die but like takes the whole movie to basically get there. A bunch of shirtless dude stuff. All dudes must take they shirts off in this Twilight movie, I mean I didn't write it, y'know.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Darker, with more action, it keeps the level of the previous films, which is not a very good thing.","This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work. Despite this, this film was a box office champion, the teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed their hands in satisfaction, just as with the two previous films.The plot boils down to this: again together, Edward and Bella look happy, but a succession of mysterious murders in neighboring Seattle indicates that Victoria, the couple's enemy, may be trying to raise an army of newly created vampires, which may endanger the entire Cullen clan and also Jacob's pack. On the other hand, the threat of the Volturi to interfere hangs over everyone and Bella doesn't seem to know how to deal with Jacob, in love with her, and whom she doesn't want to hurt.Again we saw a change in the director's chair, with the arrival of David Slade. From a distance, we saw an improvement in direction with his arrival, showing the lack of capacity of its previous occupants. There is an improvement in the environment and in the story told, which becomes more profound and involving as the danger and the action become more and more present in the film. The fight scenes are very good, but very fast, which helped the film acquire a somewhat uneven pace, with fast scenes and much slower sequences. In addition, there are still serious problems inherited from previous films and which are closely linked to the way the actors behaved.In fact, each film accentuates the feeling that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were gross casting errors and never adapted well to the characters and each other. There is almost no chemistry between them, despite an improvement in the dialogues and the story told. Their characters' romance no longer seems like a childish crush, as in the previous two films, but it is still a long way from looking as breathtaking as it was supposed to. With the exception of some very concrete scenes, there is no involvement or depth in the way both actors worked, and the romantic scenes seem like pauses in which we can disconnect a little from what we are seeing and, for example, go to the bathroom for a minute. . Taylor Lautner is good, but not as good as in the previous film, where he had more presence and showed more talent. Bryce Dallas Howard was a pretty good Victoria and a convincing villain. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good and maintain the level they had so far.Technically, the film maintains the good CGI, visible in the work of the wolves and in the extraordinarily choreographed action scenes. Howard Shore's soundtrack is very good, dark in the right measure and helped keep the soundtrack as one of the best strengths of the films in this tetralogy. Good scenarios, props, and very good large-scale images of cold and snowy landscapes complete the technical work.This film is the darkest and most serious in tetralogy, but also the one that gives the audience the most action. We continue to face a dull story, but the introduction of these elements was welcome and helped the film to become more palatable and less boring.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Best One Yet, But Where's The Continuity?","I saw this film with my girlfriend on the sneak preview weekend in the UK, and I had expected it to be the best film of the series as it was also the best book of the series too. When i walked out of the cinema the first thing I said was they needed David Slade from the start. Perhaps he wouldn't have captured the emotion of the first two films as they are more of an over-riding factor than in this one which is all geared towards the battle, but he did brilliantly. Without giving too much away the fight scene was very well choreographed and fully deserving of the MTV movie award for best fight scene it will undoubtedly win.My grievance with this movie is that there is no continuity between the films. for example in all three films when vampires are injured in some way it is different: Twilight: rip like flesh New Moon: crack like stone Eclipse: Weird crystal stuff? Also it may have just been me but I'm certain Jasper and Carlise never had these accents in the first two films which have now just been invented to fit in with their back stories. Whether this was down to the fact the director changes constantly, I don't know, but it was at the back of my mind constantlyoverall however this film was easy to lose myself in, and towards the end even felt like a Harry Potter film with the cheery reconciliations accompanied by upbeat music. highly recommend for fans of the series as i doubt Breaking Dawn will live up to these standards",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An absolute snore, almost nothing happens","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse could also go by the alternate subtitle ""Hurry up and wait."" This movie tries to create tension for basically its entire runtime that there is an onslaught coming from some evil vampires, and then spins its wheels as everyone prepares while simultaneously wallowing in angst. It is agonizing to watch and mind-numbingly dull. The romance stuff that fills the majority of the film is so painful. There is nothing but a ton of cliché, and horribly-acted ""romance."" I cannot help but be creeped out by these relationships, and they seem almost 100% unhealthy. I'd like to say the climax somehow adds enough excitement and action to save the film, but it is so ridiculous and is filmed terribly. There is no intensity or excitement to these battles, they are just people using CGI to run faster or jump higher than you can follow with your eyes, or to turn into a cartoon wolf. Then they start ripping body parts off the bad guys. In a strange choice, to avoid an R rating, it seems that vampires are made out of cement and when killed they just crumble apart into pieces and there isn't an ounce of bloodshed. It doesn't help that I don't care about any of these characters, but I was so bored by the whole thing even in its most action-packed moments. If I'm lucky this will be the last of the Twilight movies I'll have to sit through, because I've had enough.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
BAH to Melissa Rosenburgh,"I was really looking forward to this movie as most of us twihards were, but I was really disappointed. There were parts in the actual film where the movie was literally green, I know this is probably the theaters's fault, but honestly we waited how long to see it.I loved that Bella had a stronger role in this movie, but there was so much lacking from the story plot that should have been in there. This is completely the screen writer's fault.Melissa Rosenburgh not only went back and changed ideas and thoughts that she put into New Moon, but she forgot a lot of important things. The way Stephanie Meyer wrote Jasper and Alice's introduction was perfect, and should have really been left as it was. The perfect southern gentleman! Melissa Rosenburgh please get your head out of your butt, I understand fabricating small battles like in New Moon, but really? Why are you ruining these books for the true readers? Do not disappoint me for Breaking Dawn, it is by far my favorite book and I want to see every detail played out like I would have while I was reading the it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cheesy but won't disappoint die hard fans,"I believe that Eclipse definitely lived up to the book. It explored (as much as it could) the choice that Bella has to make between Edward and Jacob. However I think the movie is really lacking the anger that Edward feels towards Bella for wanting to see Jacob. While I understand that you can't put everything from a book into a movie, they should have showed the controlling side of Edward more. In the book he tries very hard to make sure that Bella doesn't see Jacob because he doesn't trust him.In the movie this wasn't explored as explicitly. There definitely is a cheese factor in this movie as well. It's very lovey-dovey. But that's what the book was all about. Also I think the movie is lacking Bella's ignorance. In the book she had no clue about anything, while in the movie it seemed that she was figuring thing out without help from everyone else.Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. I'm am a hard core fan of the books. I just think that there could have been more character development. I know that people are going to make fun of the acting and the way the movie was made. But honestly people this isn't a movie for people that are just discovering the Twilight series, if you aren't a hard core fan you aren't going to like it. I believe that it won't disappoint those who loved the books. It lives up to the book (as much as it could.) I really wish that people that don't like it would stop commenting on this series. It's obvious that you just want to come on here and rip it a new one. Save your time...us fans get enough crap just saying we like it. We get what you're saying, trust me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the Series So far,"Unfortunately for fans of the book series, and for anyone who managed to watch the first two films, the movie series up until this point has been a letdown. The acting was poor, and the story just did not seem to be working on film. They could not convey all of the emotion that was coming from the book, and the dialogue was just not there.In saying that I was not really looking forward to this movie, but since I read the series I figured I owed it to the books to give it a watch. I went in with low expectations, that were buoyed a little bit by the fact that this is my favorite of the books.Eclipse as a stand alone movie is decent at best. I would rate it a 6 out of 10. It has it's entertaining parts with the battle scenes, and it actually integrates some humor onto the screen. The actor is the best of the movies so far, but is still mediocre. When comparing it to the other two films I think that this is definitely a step in the right direction.I would say it is worth a watch if you are a fan of the series, and if not... maybe redbox it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I have to be honest, it entertained me (no irony). Still, not good.","Because the construction of scenes is occasionally pathetic, the motivation of the characters not always well done/explained (although better overall than the first two attempts), and there aren't improvements at a technical level (visually, score, editing).And yet. The true is that I can't deny I was mostly unironically entertained with both the ""teen romance story"" and the supernatural aspects. Both had more coherence (not even close to perfect, but it was an improvement). The love triangle had a more than a couple of really interesting scenes (even if crazy) and I felt it was more intertwined with the overall story (in the prior movies they were kind of separated blocks). And the development of the supernatural aspects wasn't bad either (it could've been better, of course).Besides that, the acting I think it improved and everybody did the best they could to act what was on page (which lets face it, it is really hard). Even Stewart (the clearly less talented of all).
Ok movie with plenty of bad things, but it was fine.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It all begins with a choice,"Keep in mind that I am reviewing this movie as someone who read the third book, so if you disagree with what I think then you are someone who either has read the book or someone who has not read it. If you are a fan of the third book or the earlier two books, you will either like it or dislike it, and if you have not read the book, you will just not like it.Kristen Stewart's performance as Bella Swan is not amazing or anything, but I still would have liked more emotion in her performance when certain scenes needed it. Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen was not that bad; he does the scenes from the book well and some of Edward's dialogue was ok, he does work with what he is given but it could have been better.Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black was not bad, he does his scenes well giving an ok performance. I thought the relationship between Bella Swan and Jacob Black was rushed on how Jacob thinks Bella loves him more than Edward and she does not know it, even though it seems forceful even though they do certain moments from the book well. Also, the Edward and Jacob arguments in the movie were funnier to watch than when you read these scenes in the book.A little issue would be that they go through scenes that were in the book too quickly at times, and the editing can affect some scenes by cutting before the scene ends. When they do the scenes from the book, they are not bad, though they do not have great effects on the werewolves and vampires, they are not terrible by any means. I thought the effects on the werewolves did not look as believable as they could have been, mostly because when characters like Jacob transform it has weird CGI though it does have detail, along with the vampires moving fast with weird effects or killing people in a weird way.The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010) was not an adaptation, but I felt the same as I did read the book, which was that the first book/first movie was better than this. This movie is not great, but I cannot fault it for adapting a sequel book that I did not like as much as the first.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight 3: A Reprieve?,"So, was Lautner's ponytail holding this franchise back? In a series that I hate, this is probably my least hated one. We get some legit drama in the form of this vamp army showing up and ready to run rampant on the Cullens. The tension between Eddie and Jakey is mildly entertaining and... Yeah, that's pretty much all I've got. Eclipse at least felt like it was swinging for something. It never quite connects but I appreciate the effort.Why can Jake not wear a shirt? I get he might have to go full furry at some point but he could, I dunno, take the shirt off? Ok, we have to hide Bella, so lets put her up in the mountains where no one will look (someone immediately looks there), I get it. Is there a reason we couldn't get her handwarmers? Maybe a couple of blankets? It's an ice capped mountain in north Washington and she's got a coat and a sleeping bag. Bundle her up!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Decent enough with more action than the previous titles,"Let me first state that I'm not a 'fan' of this series, so I've never read the books, and my only exposure is via the movies themselves.I found this installment in the series to actually be a bit better than the first two. It is definitely more action oriented, with a faster paced plot than the previous titles. I was not a fan of the angst filled themes in the first two, and you don't escape that completely in the third, but it's not so overbearing as it was in the first two where I ended up just wishing Bella would be hit by a truck.The acting actually seemed improved from the first two as well. I would chalk this up to the actors becoming more familiar with their roles and having a little more experience under their belt. I'm actually surprised that this film has a 4.5. I can only assume the fans of the genre found some fault or flaw that they didn't think kept true to the original story. I didn't find myself looking at my watch, or noticing how long the movie was so I rated it slightly above average.If you're a casual viewer of this series like I am, you will probably enjoy it. It smacks of typical summer fare that is enjoyable, if not forgettable. It was easily worth matinée prices and kept me entertained for 2 hours, so I consider it a better than average movie.6 out of 10 for decent action scenes, a good story line, and decent acting.

Best one i have seen,"I must admit at first I wasn't a fan of twilight in fact I strongly disliked it but after watching the first instalment (purely because there was nothing else on TV) I found myself wanting to watch the others and so I did and from what I have seen there are some things that should have been improved for example the vampires sparkle which I thought to be very stupid, Kristin Stuart's acting could've been better as well as Robert Pattinsons'. But as the saga went along they became better actors but still need a bit of improvement i also thought that eclipse is the best one i have seen it has more drama, action and it was nice to see another actor step up to the plate-Jackson Rathbone-who plays Jasper Hale did a fantastic job in preparing and teaching the others about the 'Newborns' but in my opinion this tells/shows me that jasper has a harder time dealing with human blood than the others i mean after all he had to kill them off. It was also nice to see the past of some of the characters and to see the wear wolves and vampires unite for Bella's safety. Like all novel based films not every film will have it word for word or it will miss out on less important parts of the book i mean after all they have to fit it into a 2 hour movie, so just be happy with what they have created. If your not happy with it, simple DON'T WATCH IT.Overall if you are a Twilight fan you should be happy with this film but if you're not answer this question:why are you watching the twilight saga if you hate it?Ps. I have not watched breaking dawn when i wrote this so please excuse Best one i have seen comment as it MAY NOT be true when I see Breaking Dawn.Thanks for taking the time to read this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
AMAZINGG must see,"I'm a die hard twilight fan i have read all 4 books threw 10 time and have spent hundreds on merch. even with the differences between the movie and the book i really like it! the whole story line was there which is the important part though they changed a lot of minor details from the book. i actually thought the acting was much better in this movie then the other 2 films. Robs acting was just as good as usual and i actually feel like Kristens acting actually improved in this movie! Billy burke(charlie) acting in the movie was soooo good. He depict the character perfectly and actually added to the character with his facial expressing!! Hes probably one of my fav actors in the whole movie he was perfect. I was wondering how they were going to manage that ""vampire made of marble"" thing too, and that seemed pretty realistic! The wolves were actually done really well to! so i think overall the special effects were done really well! Director David Slade has added an edge to the film that i think was missing before. It is much more exciting and alittle darker. The movie has an essential good-heartedness that makes it likable. It is funny, has some good fist fights with the great Edward Cullen and is a fun film.

"Come on, these movies are just fun!","If you were a fan of the books (which by the way have a good story, but are very poorly written), then you will like the movies. These characters are supposed to be melodramatic. That's the point.. it's fantasy and it's fun. It has romance, action, attractive people, and they are entertaining.I am not a big Kristen Stewart fan and she is really what detracts from the movies. She is not Bella Swan, she is just Kristin Stewart acting sad or worried or attempting to have a personality. She uses the same mannerisms to express emotion in everything I have seen her in. The book Bella is a much brighter character despite the darkness in which she finds herself. I just want to shake Stewart sometimes.. please demonstrate something other than forced reaction to the surroundings. The guys are good and I can't really imagine other actors playing those characters. Edward is supposed to be tortured and emotive and Jake is supposed to have a serious anger management problem and be completely okay with it. Pretty spot on really.All the critique aside, this is romantic fantasy at it's best. It is utterly non-reality related and provides a superb break from the mundane. I think especially for women, it catapults us into one of the most delicious imaginary worlds ever... the two most perfect yet forbidden men completely in love with us and willing to fight to the death if necessary. Come on, that's just money right there and I'll take another bite of that apple thank you very much.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better than all the others in the series,"This movie was a little better among the total 5 movies. The story was a little bit more interesting rather than being slow and dull with literally no material at all.
However, I previously really liked the scenery and the CGI this time was terrible which took the whole mirage away of a beautiful mountainous view. The actors' acting had definitely improved.

OK These are not great films,"Every girl in the world goes crazy about these books and these movies. I read the first two books and they were pretty good. Good enough for me to read the third and fourth when I have time but they are not particularly well written. My sister is crazy about these movies so I went with her to go see Eclipse and New Moon at midnight. It was fun and enjoyable but these films are not good. I unlike most people enjoy watching great films not average ones. These movies do not suck but why spend so much time on them when there are so many other great movies out there. The direction is bad and the acting stiff and awkward. The best parts of the film being cheesy comedic lines from Taylor Lautner which are almost making fun of the saga itself. Making fun of the situations they are in. They are not boring although they are at time laughable. This movie is the better of the three. These are not Harry Potter films. The Harry Potter movies are actually good or sometimes great. These are pretty good date movies to go see if there are no other films out. Do not waste your money going to see it in theaters but rather wait till it comes out on DVD and one of your TwiHard friends has a movie night that everyone goes to. Do not waste your money on it but I do encourage you to purchase or download the soundtracks to all three movies. They are the best part of the films. If you like soft alternative rock music like Linkin Park, Paramore, and Muse you should get these soundtracks. Each soundtrack is better then its film.

Well it is the best in the series yet.,"I liked the third book best(haven't read the forth yet though). Definitely not my kind of books but they are still an alright read. It's somewhat fun to see visually the story ones just read. But I thought the first film was really poor, i most ways. With the second it got better(even if I felt the second book was the weakest) but still a weak effort compared to many other adaptations. Thankfully with the third movie the improvement in quality continues. Positive, sure quite a lot could still be better but I myself was mostly satisfied.The story stays with the book pretty well which was good but so has the other two mostly. However what was done better this time around was the plot, in that it didn't feel like it rushed forward and painfully lack in details which I often think movie adaptations tend to do. Even if you've not read the book you will have little problem following what is going on. Sure it's vampires and werewolves but really Twilight is the usual teenage love story. Absolutely not unique. Aimed for teenage girls but I think even others can enjoy it once as a ""feelgood"" film. But I admit the romance gets a bit long-drawn and doesn't make perfect sense at times, but of course that is the central thing of the story.The action was very bad in the first film. Yes the action may be a side thing to the love triangle but still a flaw. The third book has the most action so I felt it vital that those scenes should improve. Thankfully the action has gotten better, it's not great but it worked well enough. Some of the wolf cgi looked somewhat flawed a places though. An improvement enough at least.The acting is no big problem according to me. A bit wooden some but you get a feeling for the characters. I have no big complaint over the actors they chose, even though not everyone looks like you've yourself imagined from the books but thats often the case. Kristen Stewart is way prettier than you imagine Bella in the books. Definitely not a problem.I'm no fan of the book so had no real expectations. But it was an mostly entertaining movie experience. Quite a bunch of flaws but an improvement over the previous two. The action, storytelling, maybe even the acting has gotten better. Overall a satisfying adaptation that will please the fans. 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Garbage,"This is not really a review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions of the film.Only after seeing the film did I discover that I hadn't seen the two central chapters of the saga in the correct order but oh well, I think that since I generally understood the plot since in general it is very slow and without inventiveness I didn't do a great wrong to my liking of the product. So speaking of the film, the film is very similar to the first and does not make any contribution to the genre except for being the trivial teenager film that I expected. The film is therefore banal and very flat and it can be said that the only entertaining part is the battle.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""What part of forever don't you understand""?","First there was the Twilight books... and I loved them all. They were juvenile, though there were some questions in the story told by Stephenie Meyer that can relate to readers from all ages. After, we met the movies, and those questions were so left behind the adaptations that it is not a surprise the movies have so low reviews.There are some important discussions in Twilight: adequacy in a very confusing and world, of so many shallow issues; the need of making choices that can transform us in something we are not sure about; humanity and what that really means in the world today... and, finally, the search of true love (better if it can last forever...)Don't get me wrong. I saw the first two films - Twilight and New Moon - more than 10 times in the theater. I'm leaving now to see Eclipse for the 3td time in 2 days... I had so much fun with them, and could share it with lots of friends, but in every screening I knew that it could be so much better. If only the prejudice about the story were also left behind...Because for me that is the biggest problems with the movies and some reviews: lock such a sweet and strong story in a silly box of teen love and indecision. Melissa Rosenberg - the key to the questions, from my point of view - can relate to Dexter in a marvelous way, but Twilight, as she showed us with her writing, she was not able to understand... or like it. It is a guess, but, with the movies, I had the feeling that Rosenberg really dislikes Bella and Edward. With her script, she can give them a big ugh. Maybe because she can't understand the love as Stephenie Meyer described it. The wolves and Charlie, though, she loves... and that's why their characters in the movies are so funny and enjoyable.Its a shame. The movies could have been so intense and sweet and funny and good as the books are. They could bring millions to the theater and, yet, let them leave the screening with happy faces and heart. Instead, we see the finals credits with a bit sadness and hopeful for the next movie... That again show us how hope can be so illusionary.Eclipse was that way. I had fun? You bet! Edward and Bella are more natural characters. The make-up is better (Rosalie is finally beautiful). The fight scenes is nice. The songs are great... despite their bad use in Eclipse, like it was in New Moon (aplause to Hardwicke for a smart use of the soundtrack and score). Again a Muse song had a 2 sec appearance... a shame, it could have closed the Eclipse with a strong note.Well, Eclipse is the theaters now. Lets wait for the Breaking Down movies... another wait, more hope for the better... See you there.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I HATE BELLA,"I like the movie but I HATEEE Bella. I cannot express how much I do not like her. I wish Edward would stop being with a girl who has feelings for another guy, when it comes to shows/movies I never really like love triangles because I despise cheaters like honestly 😂. And I hate how Jacob keeps trying to get with her when she told him multiple times it will always be Edward, like umm how stupid are you? Both of them really just need to leave her all by herself, it's what she deserves. I would not want to be played around with like that, it's like do you want Edward or Jacob? You can't have both sweetie, and if you want Edward stop chasing after Jacob every time he's mad at you for not liking him, and stop going around him being all physical with him. I get so invested in my shows/movies so my hate for her is veryyy freaking real.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"They are all terrible, but this one is the worst for me","Let's be honest, The Twilight Saga is bad! The plot, the acting and the romance. The only good things that can be said about the franchise are the music, certain action sequences and they're all just so stupid that they're actually amusing, in fact the only reason I watched these movies was for the LOLs.Eclipse is the only exception, and by that I mean it's just as bad as the others, except it's missing the great soundtrack, has terrible action sequences babtized with embarrassing CGI, and the dialogue and plot are so boring, monotonous and forgettable that you'll fall asleep halfway through. It can't even get the title of ""so bad that it's good"" You can literally go straight from New Moon and skip to Breaking Dawn Part 1 and the story will still make perfect sense.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"still not great, but worth seeing","As someone sick of the hype and disappointed with what the first two installments did with a good book series, I was pessimistic about the film, but heard The Last Airbender was worse, so I chose to see it. At least I get to see Taylor Lautner a few times, right?Some scenes were truly entertaining and, well, awesome. Rosalie and Jasper's back-stories gave the film some much-needed depth and character development. Those two and the other supporting actors (the families of the leads) did a good job, even though Jackson Rathbone faltered. Edward was cardboard and disappointing as always, and Bella only has one emotion, but I can't really figure out what to call it.They spent a lot of time focusing on the so-called attractive leads' faces and a certain shirtless figure, and the effects were shabby in parts, although the CGI wolves were well done.Several scenes made me want a fast forward button, especially the one-on-one Edward and Bella scenes, but otherwise it was a solid film. The plot could be strange for people who haven't read the books, and some parts confused me even though I've read all four.But I don't regret the time and money spent on this, and I'll probably rent it with my friends so I can add some commentary to Bella's oh-so-controversial choice. Don't skip it because of the annoying ""Twi-hards"" or the less than mediocre other films. There's some cheesiness and slow movement, it won't win any Oscars, but it's an entertaining two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Laughably Bad...Again,"Twilight: Eclipse follows Bella as she tries to decide whether or not she wants to marry Edward, meanwhile dealing with the semi- aggressive feelings of Jacob. At the same time a mysterious army of vampires is forming and the Cullens must prepare to fight them off.Similarly to New Moon, which I enjoyed, the writing is often so bad it's hilarious. Eclipse features plenty of said scenes that have become so iconic now in this series for me.From time to time I was surprised to actually witness a decent scene in this movie. By that I mean some parts were actually kind of well- done. Some scenes ended and I thought ""huh, that was actually kind of above average"". Considering the quality of these movies haven't exceeded an average level yet, I was happy to see some things that didn't suck. While these moments were short-lived and often just barely above average (as in the difference between a 5/10 and 5.5/10 scene), they were an improvement. Who knows, maybe by the time I reach the last movie it'll actually be average.Unlike New Moon, however, this movie's pacing went down. While it wasn't as boring as the first movie, it definitely had pacing issues. That's really the biggest thing that separates this movie from New Moon. New Moon managed to suck but be well-paced enough not to put me to sleep, but this one was, while still funny, much more boring.As per usual, we get some 'excellent' performances from the cast. Kristen Stewart is worse than usual, Taylor Lautner is still garbage, and Robert Pattinson continues to be better than everyone else, if only by a little bit.And again, as I've come to expect, the writing is putrid. Somehow more so than the previous movies, though. More stuff is rushed into with barely any development, and it makes me wonder why everyone cares so much or how they caught onto something as quickly as they did.The special effects still suck. Not a lot to say about that.Something I kind of hate about these world building movies is that the world is never completely built when the series starts. So the creator keeps making new stuff and making some new things more important than others. While in the first two movies we got very little about the anatomy of vampires, we saw it more here and it was so overused that it felt like a newly added part of the movies. While it still makes sense with the universe and everything it was just so thrust upon the audience with so much of it that it felt like the director was just making up new bullcrap and hoping we wouldn't notice.Also, the fight. While some of it was somewhat entertaining, it was, for the most part, stupid. Somehow none of the main characters died, and only one got injured. And yet, every single opponent died. These opponents are supposed to be much stronger than the main characters. They actually state that their opponents are vastly stronger than them multiple times. But regardless, when you don't kill any main characters it does make the movie less intense and less realistic. I care less about the characters because I know nothing bad will actually happen to them.Overall Twilight: Eclipse is, while fun at times, still absolute trash. It's massively flawed at every corner, but sometimes those flaws are funny. It's sort of like a turd with ice cream on top. It tastes like crap, but it's still ice cream and it's kind of funny to look at, similarly to New Moon. Only this time there's a really tired old tour guide trying to explain how the turd came to be in extensive detail. While it's kind of interesting in a weird way, it's still pretty boring. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. You'd be better off watching New Moon. Not only is it less boring, it's also funnier.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Heartfelt romance, thrilling action and occasional wit make this the best Twilight film","They say three's the charm, and how true it is for this third  installment of the Twilight saga- it has the tender heartfelt moments  of love in the first movie, the hot-blooded romantic tension too  diffuse in the second movie, and some genuinely thrilling action that  was previously absent from both its predecessors. Indeed, it is no  doubt the best film in the Twilight series so far and the one most  likely to win converts who have always been clueless- or cynical even-  of the unprecedented popularity of the franchise.  Wisely choosing not to follow wholesale the events as they unfold in  the book, director David Slade and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg have  injected a palpable sense of tension throughout the movie. Opting to  begin the movie with a gripping vignette where small-town boy Riley's  (Xavier Samuel) is stalked and then bitten by a vampire, Slade is ever  mindful to bring the threat of the swift, red-haired vampire Victoria  (Bryce Dallas Howard) front and center- even as our favourite  adolescent vampire Edward Cullen and adolescent werewolf Jacob Black  continue to vie for the affections of Bella Swan.  Whether Bella has feelings for Jacob wasn't so clear in ""New Moon"", but  it is in ""Eclipse"" that Bella will get the clarity audiences have been  waiting for. Meanwhile, as Bella turns 18, she pleads with Edward to  ""change"" her into a vampire, fulfilling what the Volturi had mandated  after sparing her life and in the process sealing a covenant of love  with Edward. It is no secret who Bella chooses to be with in the end,  but unlike the ambiguity in the second film that must have left some  audiences even more frustrated, ""Eclipse"" makes it clear why Bella  chooses one over the other- and credit must go to Rosenberg for her  finesse in conveying what author Stephenie Meyer did in her book in  less words than more but without losing any of its essence.  ""New Moon"" too failed to flesh out the dilemma that Bella faced in her  choice between Edward and Jacob- and where Chris Weitz has failed,  director David Slade has adroitly accomplished in ""Eclipse"". Here we  finally get to understand the predicament that Bella faces- not simply  a choice between two people or which one she loves more, but also one  between autonomy and surrender, a decision that ultimately comes with  irreversible ramifications.  Slade also uses the looming threat of Victoria and her army of newborn  vampires led by Riley- apparently more vicious and ferocious than  seasoned suckers- to add another dimension of Bella's love for both  Edward and Jacob. More than just humans with emotions, they are also  creatures - one a vampire with a thirst for blood and the other a  werewolf with a beastly rage- who have fought against their own  impulses to protect someone they love.  So too Edward's insistence at chastity before marriage, a deliberately  old-school notion of romance (as the film itself acknowledges) that is,  together with Edward and Jacob's protective instinct over Bella,  reasons why Twi-fans are so in love with these characters. The first  movie's portrayal of sweet unadulterated puppy-love may have been too  syrupy for some, the second movie's depiction of tangled love too  (well) tangled, but this third film finally hits the right notes in  portraying the very appeal of the Twilight series that could very well  be universal.  Of course, the success of the earlier two movies are not for nothing-  for the franchise has finally felt confident enough to even (gasp) poke  fun at itself. It has taken two movies, but ""Eclipse"" finally develops  a sense of humor that has arguably made the overall experience much  more enjoyable. When Jacob turns up topless waiting for Bella, Edward  asks mockingly ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" And one night up in the snowy  woods when Bella is shivering under the covers, Jacob turns to Edward  and says wryly: ""Face it, I'm hotter than you."" These flashes of  self-mocking wit make ""Eclipse"" seem less daft about its own clichés,  and reveal a franchise that is finally learning not to take every  detail about itself too seriously.  If ""Eclipse"" is refreshingly witty in parts, it is also refreshingly  thrilling for the most part. What action sequences there were in the  first two movies were anaemic at best, but Slade (who directed the  horror movie ""30 Days of Night"") finally makes full use of the  potential within the vampires and werewolves premise to deliver fast  and furious action, complete with an exhilarating climax that though  bloodless (so it can be teen-friendly) will still leave you at the edge  of your seat.  As always, Kristen Stewart is the best performer among the three,  capturing perfectly the anxiety and uncertainty of her character.  Real-life squeeze Robert Pattinson seems more comfortable on screen and  exhibits more range than just the moody, brooding persona he was  before. On the other hand, Taylor Lautner seems to be maturing into a  fine lead actor, his intense emotional performance mirroring the  ferocity of his character's nature.  Not simply in acting, but also in storytelling and direction, ""Eclipse""  is therefore a definite step-up from its predecessors. As it rightly  should, it remains anchored around Bella, Edward and Jacob- but more  than that, it gives reason to the love between Bella and Edward and  between Bella and Jacob, enough reason to put back the bite in the  vampire-human and werewolf-human romance. Sprinkled with wit and  generous dose of pulse-pounding action, this third film most adeptly  encapsulates the appeal of the Twilight franchise and should please  both fans and neophytes alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The best of the ""Twilight"" series... which isn't really that big of an improvement.","OK, first off, I am not a fan of the Twilight series, nor am I a hater. I'm just a neutral in-between casual movie-goer. I am also not a book reader, so stop reading this review if you want to compare the film with the book. I would also like to mention that the first ""Twilight"" movie was mediocre but the second movie was just plain abysmal, in my humble opinion. And also, I personally find the fan frenzy over the entire ""Twilight"" franchise, book or movie, completely overblown. I mean, come on. Lovers are voting a 10 and haters (most of which who haven't even watched the movie yet) are voting a 1. People, if you don't like the movie, don't see it and bash it unreasonably. Let the movie critics do that for you.That being said, ""Eclipse"" is leaps and bounds better than ""New Moon"", and some steps up above the first. Apart from the screenplay and dialog (which is still bland and mostly uninspired) and special effects (which are on par with ""New Moon""... which isn't really that much of a compliment), the acting, music and especially direction has improved significantly.Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. Yes, they have genuinely improved slightly in terms of acting and chemistry. Heck even the quips they give each other are believable; Edward's quip about Jacob 's lack of a shirt made me chuckle. Some of the actors in the dark parts of the film display genuine fear and emotion, something that was lost in the previous two films. And near the end, Pattinson challenges an enemy by personally taunting them where it hurts most, and you can see the fury in each of their eyes. Other actors also get their moment to shine; Jackson Rathbone and Elizabeth Reiser in particular as Jasper and Esme Cullen, Billy Burke who made me laugh more than ever in any of the previous movies, heck even Dakota Fanning improves with an ever increasing mysterious aura around her. Bryce Dallas Howard is sadly wasted as her villainous role is nothing more than an extended cameo appearance if you count the minutes she's on screen.However, the script is just as boring as the previous two, with so much predictability and wooden stiffness to it that, I felt like it was bordering on just plain stupidity. OK, yeah I get the old ""no-one-else- but-you"" type of cliché and I kinda appreciated the fact that the hero is trying his best to get the girl away from his dangerous life to no avail and to the rival's delight, but it is written in a very stunted way that it looks as if the girl switches from one boy to another like clothes hangers. It's kinda stupid if you ask me.Production design is good but getting unoriginal, fast (it's basically the same as the previous two), while the cinematography is great in which you get to see beautiful panoramic scenery and/or the wolf pack's shirtless abs. It's a mixed bag, that one.Call me a movie freak, but one of the best thing worth watching (or listening) in the movie is Howard Shore's fantastic orchestral score, which is rousing and sweeping, and best of all easily suits the film. Compared to Carter Burwell's atmospheric score in the first film and Alexandre Desplat's great but horrifyingly mismatched score in the second, this one feels more suitable and gives out even more emotions than the actors themselves. And during the battle preparation and action sequences, one can't help but wonder when Frodo and the Fellowship are going to show up to aid their battle.Finally, director David Slade. The film's action sequences and moody/grim parts has his style all over it. Even during some of the talk scenes, the camera shakes in a similar way to that of Slade's previous films ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"". Heck, the very well-handled action sequences is basically a PG-13 ""30 Days of Night"" with no blood and extra werewolves thrown into the mix. From the moment the film starts, his taut direction immediately puts you into the action. But most of the action is near the film's end. Moreover, it's a huge surprise to why Slade ever got dragged into the ""Twilight"" franchise: he should be doing more gory films instead of this. Nevertheless, an interesting director does not make a bad script into a terrific movie, but at least Slade does his best with the material he's given.In short, although the third time's the charm with the ""Twilight"" franchise, it's still adequate, and it's mostly a hit and miss with the movie-going crowd. If you hate ""Twilight"" you're gonna hate/stay away from this one; if you love it, you're gonna love this one. Simple. As a normal movie reviewer, this is just nothing more than a decent time waster, with romance, vampires, werewolves and CGI.One could wonder what Bill Condon could do with ""Breaking Dawn"".Entertainment value: 6/10Overall: 5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Long, Slow, and Boring","Entering the next phase of the Moon and their relationship, Twilight continues to craft its supernatural love story with Eclipse. While the previous installment wasn't critically adored, it was a box-office hit, landing as the 7th highest-grossing film of 2009.While Bella (Kristen Stewart) & Edward (Robert Pattinson) continue to debate the logistics of turning a human into a vampire, the villainous Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) builds an army of newborn vampires nearby. Still suffering after the loss of her lover, she vows revenge on the ones responsible for his death. Through Alice's (Ashley Greene) visions. The Cullens begin preparing for the inevitable battle and are willing to take whatever means necessary to ensure they win.Eclipse continues to suffer in similar ways to its previous predecessors. While it tells an interesting story, it drags it out over a much too-long runtime and ends up boring its audience repetitively. The movie could have cut about 30 minutes of slow, dry dialogue and greatly benefitted from the shorter experience. Though there is a captivating climax, it comes after nearly an hour and a half of boredom.The lead cast maintains their soap opera-esque performances, which causes its stretched runtime to feel doubled. Though they introduce new and interesting ideas, the status quo is constantly returned to as characters are not quite ready to develop. Continuing to repeat the franchise's previous mistakes, Eclipse remains as one of Twilight's more forgettable chapters.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010): A Blend of Romance, Action, and Supernatural Intrigue","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, directed by David Slade, marks the third installment in the popular film series based on Stephenie Meyer's novels.

"""Wah Wah Wah Wahhhh"" Maybe someday, but it's certainly not going to happen this time.","After I reviewed New Moon which I think is the worst out of The Twilight Saga so I'm coming to know what to expected with Eclipse taken place right after New Moon. Victoria played by Bryce Dallas Howard, replacing Rachelle Lefevre, attacks Riley Biers so she can create an army of newborns with him to get her revenge on Edward Cullen for killing her true love James who is from the first Twilight. Edward and Bella both talk about the complications of becoming an immortal vampire. Edward refuses to turn her into one until they are married. While she visits Jacob Black, Jacob confesses that he is in love with her and kisses her. Bella punches him and sprains her hand and Edward threatens Jacob that he ever touches her against her will again and tells him to wait for Bella to give it to him. Alice sees a vision of the newborn army attacking Forks so now the Cullens and the wolf pack teaming up to train and defeat Riley Biers, Victoria and the newborn vampires. Now as I am thinking through this, when Bella expresses her love for Edward, Jacob is in love with her so there is a love triangle going on. It's just stuff and clichés that you've seen over and over again. I also looked upon that Rachelle Lefevre was supposed to reprise her role as Victoria but later got fired due to the fact that her filming schedule overlapped with that of her other film Barney's Version so she replaced by Bryce Dallas Howard. Yeah, you'll get to see her in Jurassic World with Chris Pratt, eh? I'll give it this, It's not as worse as New Moon but it's still not a very good sequel. I'll give my full thoughts and opinions after two more movies, so is Breaking Dawn going to be a good movie for me?

Very good,"I Love Twilight, I don't care for New Moon, Eclipse was pretty darn good! It was a little slow for me in the beginning. Once the ""leg hitch"" scene arrived, the movie progressed rather well. I loved all of the EDWARD! They remained fairly true to the books, although some of MY favorite parts of the book were changed or eliminated, but it still worked. The ""newborn deaths"" were AWESOME! The ""tent scene"" was practically perfect! I feel that some of the scenes were written with the assumption that the viewers have read the books. There were some people sitting next to me in the theater that had never read the books or seen the first two movies. Some of the camera-work was a little shaky and gave me a headache, but those scenes were few and far between. I WILL see this again! Bring on ""Breaking Dawn!!!""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better,"Following a rather clumsy second entry, Eclispe is just the kind of third entry that the Twilight series needs. Though not great, it's Superior to Twilight and New Moon. The editing is tighter, the plot is more fluid, the cast is starting to open up, and there is more action. Even the writing, which is the worst thing about the whole series, is improved here. In addition to throwing in a few jokes, we are treated to some back story to characters which up till now have been little more than sparkling faces.The one thing about Eclipse that I didn't like was that the rivalry between Jacob and Edward is snarly and obnoxious. Bella frequently has to play referee and step between the two. In New Moon we were meant to think that Jacob is the nice boy. Now I'm not too sure I like him that much. He is presented as being a bit more selfish and immature than I think he should be.Eclispe deserves credit where credit is due, things are coming to life in a way that makes the series enjoyable to anyone outside the twilight fan base, (or at least to anyone who likes Gothic). The problem is whether, it warrents the recommendation of two predecessors, one not bad, and the other mediocre.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Somehow they are getting worse,"Every time I watch one of these films I remain stumped as to how they became such a worldwide phenomenon.Everything that made the first two films poor remains an issue in this instalment. The story feels drab and very repetitive from the first two films. It is melodramatic and cringe and just poorly put together. I think on balance it is probably the weakest of the first three films as the story lacks drive and consequence.The acting is awful. I will defend Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as they are both great actors who have fantastic performances under their belts, but they are shocking in these films. They aren't helped by the god awful scripts but still, neither of them seem even remotely interested in what they are doing.There is a slight improvement in some of the effects from the first couple of films, and the third act action sequence (despite being ultimately underwhelming) does at least look half decent.Really I don't know what more there is to say about these films.

Shirtless Werewolf + Very-cool Vampire + Girl Who Can't Even Made Up Her Mind = 'Twilight' Us,"Thiz movie is phenomenal. A lot of movie critics sneer at thiz romantic flick. But on thiz review, I want to stay neutral and try to be objective. If you want to be fair, whoever the Director or the Cast members will be getting a hard time to fulfil viewer great expectation since everyone pays full attention to thiz franchise. The original content is written by a woman novelist Stephenie Meyer. Twilight Saga schedules for quadrilogy. I think thiz third constellation is better than the second one, ""New Moon"" (2009). But the first one ""Twilight"" (2008) is still the best because of its mysterious atmosphere and effective introduction by former Director Catherine Hardwicke. Thiz time, The Director is David Slade who is previously known for ""30 Days of Night"" in 2007. Thiz sequel has better pace of story-telling. Although some people said the sequences are a little bit slow and boring. But I think if you want to get some precise romantic scenes, thiz is the only way to do it. Slade successfully captures the emotions for most of the times with his close up cinematography. If we look at the main performers, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) do not show much improvement than before. The better performance belongs to Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) with his deep eye gaze. The best performance surprisingly comes from the supporting Cast member Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi members. With her accent tone and body language, Fanning made an incredible vampire's aura. The blood-thirsty Jasper's character (Jackson Rathbone) annoys me a little bit. His character evolves too much. In two earlier prequels he was almost invisible, but on thiz third one he has changed dramatically to become tough vampire warrior. I observe, Thiz is an odd movie, where girls love it and boys hate it. I hope they didn't come to the theater just to see some good looking faces (I'm saying thiz, it's not because I'm a Twilighater). On the other hand, if you look inside, no matter how corny the movie is, it still has a story to tell (I'm saying thiz, it's not because my close friend is Twilighter). The formula is repeated quite well, shirtless werewolf plus very cool vampire plus girl who can't even made up her mind, equal to movie that totally twilight us.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Still Lacking Depth,"""Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" brings more action and higher stakes to the series, making it a slight improvement over New Moon. However, while it refines some aspects of the franchise, it still suffers from weak dialogue, an unconvincing love triangle, and inconsistent pacing.Kristen Stewart's Bella remains emotionally detached, making it difficult to connect with her struggles. Robert Pattinson's Edward and Taylor Lautner's Jacob both get more screen time, but their rivalry feels repetitive and forced rather than compelling. Lautner brings more energy to his role, but the chemistry between the three leads still feels unbalanced. The supporting cast, including the Cullens and the Volturi, continues to be underdeveloped, despite having the potential to add more intrigue to the story.The film does benefit from improved action sequences, especially the final battle, which offers some well-executed choreography and visual effects. The werewolves are more involved this time, adding a new dynamic to the story. The cinematography also moves away from the overly muted color tones of the first two films, giving ""Eclipse"" a slightly fresher look.Despite these improvements, ""Eclipse"" still struggles with clunky dialogue, uneven storytelling, and a romance that lacks emotional depth. While it provides some entertainment value, especially in its action moments, it fails to fully deliver on its potential.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best chapter in the ""Saga""","This saga of vampire movies finally realizes it's potential in the hands of Slade as Eclipse is truly good in it's own right. It's still got the love triangle, it still has some groan inducing dialogue (sprinkled in with some light hearted moments), but what's gone is the doom, gloom, and downright depression that plagued all of ""New Moon"". We've got a marriage on the way, but a group of new-bloods threaten to take over a city. However, we've got alliances that are forged and pacts that are made.I really can't single out any actor or actress since they are all average at best, but collectively, the ensemble cast works fine. I actually did enjoy Dakota Fanning and her legion, who basically looked on ominously in the distance, waiting for their a reason to strike. This bodes well for Breaking Dawn, which I hope puts the series out with a bang, because Eclipse sure set the stage for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Eclipse has a somber permanent climate, and the action is well performed, but the story do not advance to another level","Again under the care of Melissa Rosenberg, the script can summarize a book in fairly long 124 minutes of romance, action, drama and even a little comedy. Unlike the previous films that focused on presenting the universe of Stephenie Meyer and her characters and deepen ties and relationships between all in Eclipse the story takes a new turn. This time Bella will remain disputed by Jacob and Edward and her even more confused about her feelings, will have to take a final decision in relation to what he feels for both. We also see the increasing proximity of the day that Bella will become a vampire and a major threat. Besides the players, it is also given space to some players who do not have much role in the first two films and get a greater emphasis now, as in the case of Jasper and Rosalie. Once we know more about the past of the two characters and why they are as they are, since Jasper carries the will to continue in this new life he led since he met Alice, and Rosalie, unlike his own destiny, do not like the fact that Bella able to choose between continuing human or become a vampire and wasting this privilege by making the wrong choice, she said. Yet we get to know a little more briefly the ancestors of the Quileute tribe.Eclipse, in addition to the above factors, it is the largest investor in the action and a darker atmosphere and constant suspense, which certainly also have higher chances of pleasing a portion of the male audience. Not to talk about the fact that the visual effects and makeup submit so much more convincing. It is this greater integration between romance, drama, action and suspense that makes the pace of the story more dynamic and well-directed scenes. However, some typical clichés of the books and movies are still present, and some scenes are pure embarrassment and worse, the story hardly moves again and dilemmas and discussions of previous films are present again and again not resolved, leaving all the past adaptations. For a series that bills itself saga, lacking many significant events and greater complexity in general that the idea of ""saga"" is justified. The film, like the novel, again does not progress in the narrative that creates an expectation for aa last part of the plot of vampires, humans and werewolves.Kristen Stewart - who had to wear a wig during filming, since he had to cut his hair for the filming of The Runaways (2010), a film that starred alongside Dakota Fanning, who plays vampire Jane - is clearly more comfortable in character. Robert Pattinson returns to have enough prominence after being a long time without appearing in New Moon, and not enough to compromise. Taylor Lautner Jacob expands on the sarcastic side of his character and bestial, making it extremely important to have. Jacob's gift to Bella to remember all that she is giving up and how great the sacrifice she will do, and that she can find him a love as strong as what she feels for Edward. Billy Burke once again appears good and yields one of the best scenes in the film that ""tries"" to talk to Bella about sex. Unfortunately two great actresses appear very little and are wasted, as Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard, who has little time for mostar his talent, but when they appear dominate the scene.For the climate of greater suspense and grand battles, probably the unlikely choice of David Slade has been the right one. Of course, the romance is still very present, but the scenes of creating suspense and action that Slade can show your greatest contribution to the saga. To do so, the director remained in charge of the great cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe so he could deepen what had already done. Aguirresarobe had created a climate more somber and melancholy that represented well the state of abandonment experienced by Bella throughout the movie, and now he can enlarge the suspense and exploration of the use of cameras in the scenarios. Early in the film we see a chase scene night, dark and rainy that would give an accurate idea of how expensive this would be the third part of the franchise. The chase scenes to Victoria in early with a bluish tint night, or the scenes of destruction through the streets dark and gloomy Seattle caused by the army of newborns, or scenes from the past Jasper and Rosalie are highlighted. The stunning scenes in flowery fields between Bella and Edward are present again, as had already occurred in early New Moon. Important also speak of the scenes in the mountains covered with snow that pack the final battles and give a beautiful look while threatening the scenes.On the other hand, not being the fault of the director itself, but because he inherited from the books, screenwriter Melissa Rosemberg could have better adapted some sequences that don't work as well brought to the cinema. The highlight is the scene in which Jacob has to warm up beautiful inside a tent on top of a mountain, with Edward watching everything next to him, and still being forced to listen to all Jacob's thoughts. The purpose of the scene was to show a closer relationship between the two rivals, but in the end, it only served to embarrass the audience and the actors who filmed it. We can still quote several cheesy declarations of love at least embarrassing. As for the last act, although well done, it is disappointing. The great battle between the Cullens and the werewolves against the newborn vampires is interesting, but it lasts very little, and the newborns who are introduced as a great threat, have been defeated with extreme ease., The struggle between Edward, Victoria and Riley Biers is also interesting, but it doesn't last long, not really making us fear for Bella or Edward's life at any time. Especially in the case of the battle, the feeling is that it could yield much more.The production designer Paul D. Austerberry also knew how to work well especially in the composition of environments destroyed by the newly created, and the scenes of time that tell the history of Jasper and Rosalie during the Great Depression. Here it is the editor Art Jones and Nancy Richardson knew well merge the flashback scenes, with the expectation that generate most of the audience for the final battle scenes. As for the different special effects represent a major step in the franchise. In New Moon since we noticed one significant improvement in this sector, and Eclipse can surpass its predecessor. The scenes involving the wolves are much greater realism than before, as well as the changes in speed and scenes of vampires.The instrumental soundtrack of Eclipse would be composed by Howard Shore, who worked on the trilogy The Lord of the Rings inspired Shore composes some songs, especially those with romance and suspense, but not enough to excite the action scenes. In comparison, the trail of Alexandre Desplat New Moon is more mature and far more engaging, failing to provide consistency to complement pretty bleak for the action on screen, being more mature until the age of audience that accompanies the film bands most prominent are certainly ""Riley"", ""Mountain Peak"", ""Victoria"", ""Imprinting"", ""First Kiss"", ""Decisions, Decisions"", ""They're Coming Here"", ""Jacob Black"", ""Mountain Peak"" ""The Kiss"", ""The Battle / Victoria vs. Edward"", ""Jane"", ""As Easy As Breathing"" and ""Wedding Plans"". The musical selection Alexandra Patsavas adheres again to the formula of the other Twilight mixing heavyweights of alternative rock with indie artists. We once again with the band Muse, who participated in the tracks of the two previous films in the series, with a track entitled ""Neutron Star Collision (Love is Forever)"" and even bands like The Black Keys, Bombay Bicycle Club, The Bravery, Battles, Metric, Ceelo Green and Florence + The Machine.Eclipse has a somber permanent climate, and the action is well performed. Are very well directed scenes in which Slade uses handheld cameras and beautiful open plans. The fight between Edward and Victoria against Riley arrives to thrill. Already the struggle between vampires and wolves veterans against newborn vampires also yield excellent sequences, with the only blemish a short duration. As two battles going on simultaneously, the struggle of Edward and Victoria is much more detailed. Gets the feeling that the two fights could be extended to the delight of the audience. Another embarrassing scene is the moment when Jacob and Edward talk in a tent on their feelings for Bella and in relation to each other. The scene looks like a parody of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and the embarrassment is inevitable. It is also difficult to listen to the conversations of chastity Edward with Bella.The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was met with criticism usually medium or mixed. According to Rotten Tomatoes, based on 177 reviews collected, received 50% approval. By comparison, Metacritic has assigned an average of 58/100 based on 38 reviews. Overall, Eclipse keeps the same good level reached by New Moon and gives focus on elements that had not yet been explored. David Slade focuses on action and explores the tensions between Edward and Jacob, and the love of Bella, dividing fans of the film between the two. This third film in the franchise is less visually creative than New Moon, but the advantage is that it is the busiest, if not propel the story itself to a new level.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Twilight Soap Opera Continues,"¨You have a choice. I didn't. None of us did. But you do and, you're choosing wrong.¨ The Twilight saga continues with this third installment of the popular Stephanie Meyer novel, Eclipse, and I don't think the film will win any new converts by now. You either liked the previous Twilight movies or you hated them and this third film will not change your opinion on them. So if you disliked the first two then stay away from this one, but if you liked them -like I did - then you won't be disappointed with Eclipse. Yes, the movie continues with its cheesy dialogues such as ¨Isabella Swan I promise to love you every moment of forever, ¨ and awkward pauses such as ¨I kissed Bella (pause). And she broke her hand (pause). Punching my face (pause). It was a complete misunderstanding.¨ , but the characters are what make us come back, the soap opera triangle love between Edward, Jacob, and Bella. The scenery and action scenes are also pretty well crafted. This movie even plays a little with the audience and decides to use some humor. Bella's difficulty to decide what she wants is getting kind of old and some of the same situations from the second part repeat themselves in this film so it doesn't feel as fresh, but the film is entertaining nonetheless. Like in the previous two installments the screenplay for Eclipse was adapted by Melissa Rosenberg, but this time it was directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night and Hard Candy, the last one was a movie I enjoyed quite a bit in 2005) and he does a decent job at satisfying the hard core fans who really just want to see more of Jacob and Edward fighting for Bella.The pace of the Twilight movies are so slow that there isn't really much explaining to do with the plot that is pretty simple. Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are graduating from High School and it is time for the Cullen family to move once again. They are planning on moving to Alaska and Bella is going with them. Meanwhile there are a series of murders taking place in Seattle and the Cullen's suspect that the killings are being produced by a newborn vampire army. What they don't know is that Victoria (this time played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is behind this army and is preparing them to attack Bella so that she can get her revenge on Edward for killing her partner. Edward's brother, Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), knows how to face this breed of vampires so he prepares everyone for the upcoming battle. The Cullen's and the werewolves make an alliance in order to face the army because they both want to protect Bella. In the meantime Jacob (Taylor Lautner) declares his love for Bella and she has to decide who she wants to stay with, so the soap opera begins.Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner have become overnight sensations with Twilight. Stewart is by far the most talented of the group as an actress and she has proved herself in other movies like Adventureland and The Runaways. She is also a pleasure to see on screen although her character in this film may become a little tiresome with all her indecisions, but that just proves how human she really is. The movie itself has become some sort of soap opera, but by now those of us that are hooked want to see the final outcome of the franchise. There is nothing new in this third installment and some elements can get old, but the action scenes make up for it in the final battle. This time the vampires and the Cullen family had more screen time, although I wasn't a big fan of all the flashbacks which only served to make more time before we got to the final battle scene. If you come to think about it not much really happens in this movie and most everything could be told in 30 minutes since it serves as a kind of bridge to the next film. From the beginning we are left waiting for the final battle and the entire midsection of the film focuses on the love triangle, but the movie still manages to entertain because by now we are already drawn to the characters and used to the pace of the movie. I recommend this movie only to those who have enjoyed the previous two because it is more of the same, so let me state once again if you didn't like the other films then save your time and stay away from this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
stayed true to the book,"For all the reviews that are posted saying ""awful"" or ""horrible movie...i was dragged to see it and never read the books"", if you hate The Twilight Saga, never read any of the books, and were dragged to see it, then obviously you will not like the movies. But if you were fans of the first two movies, and read the books, then watching Eclipse is a must! It is by far the best movie yet, and stayed true to the book. It is that one movie that you can say was just as good as the book. David Slade was an AMAZING director. He actually showed vampires and werewolves looking and doing what they are supposed to do, and in the light they needed to be showed in. The action was intense, and the boys will love it. And for a horror movie director, he made Edward and Bella's love very romantic and sweet. All in all, Eclipse was a tear-jerking, heart pounding, exhilarating film that can be enjoyed by all audiences. If you read the books or not, you will LOVE this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A sanguine effort.,"I saw this, I know I saw this, but I struggle to remember what this was exactly about.There's one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen for sure...two guys want her...there's a vampire council that's mad at them...The Charlotte's Web girl is in it I think...I did not hate this, I remember the movies I hate. But sometimes something is made not caring about the number of people who like it but the kind of people (Klimt said something similar). And this was made for the fans.My girl Kristen is great of course but even she can only do so much. At one point Bella says ""for now, I'm Switzerland"" and that sums up the whole movie.

Eclipse -  Blows New Moon out of the water!,"I was smiling for an hour after I left the theater last night. Concern that David Slade (director) would disappoint quickly faded as I watched the story unfold. Eclipse is my favorite book, so my expectations were set high. The cast did not disappoint! Finally...finally....finally, Melissa Rosenburg (screenplay) captured the humor in Edward Cullen. To see him smile at Bella...I really think they finally captured the undying love those two have for one another. And the wolves were epic! They were huge, like the books portrayed. I can't say enough about this movie...I will be watching it again and again. Bring on Breaking Dawn...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way better than a 1 out of 10!,"I only voted it 10 out of 10 just to compensate for the haters who voted 1 out of 10. It was actually a good movie and pretty true to the book. It was choppy at times and lacked a good flow. I believe that if one of the last two directors did this film it would be rated much higher. If you're a fan of Twilight than you will love it and if not then you probably won't appreciate it as much. What I did like about this movie is that it did give the audience what it wants ie. more Edward and Bella time and the movie was actually funny at parts. I feel like the characters have grown and the actors as well. Especially Robert, when people were walking out of the movie they all were talking about how they are switching from team Jacob to team Edward, he really looked good in this movie and was convincing as Edward Cullen. Anyway see the movie if you are a fan but don't expect it to be epic and then give it a one because it didn't live up to your critical expectations. It's a fun movie to see with your girlfriends.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipses 'New Moon',"Certainly over the top on romance scales, stuffed with ridiculous dialogue and an inconsistent cast, the 'Twilight' adaptions certainly leave their-selves open to criticism. However, for some strange reason, I found 'Twilight' a reasonably entertaining encounter and the much slated 'New Moon' - pummelled with abuse from critics - more than watchable. So what for 'Eclipse'?It is certainly not without its flaws which have been highlighted transparently at the beginning of my review. Just like the original movie though, if you are able to cast a blind eye to the cringe-worthy aspects it entails, you may be pleasantly surprised.Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a villainous vampire intent on revenge following Edward Cullen's (Robert Pattinson) antics in the first instalment. She will attempt to pursue Edward's love Bella (Kristen Stewart) and kill her to make him feel how she did.Meanwhile, numerous deaths in Seattle force the wolves and vampires (good) together in a bid to stop a possible vampire army.Also, Bella must make a difficult decision over who she really loves - Edward or childhood friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner).Flashes of 'Eclipse' are what makes it a greater achievement than the much slower paced 'New Moon'. A thrilling climax and an intriguing love triangle are the main highlights of the film but also the fact it includes some an essence of humour. 'New Moon' had a gloomy ambiance and took time to find its rhythm; it wasn't necessarily a poor sequel but its what made it the weakest of the three.'Twilight' and 'Eclipse' are my current highs in the franchise however I still expect greater achievements for the coming movies. These films are just beginning to get interesting...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
BEST of the twilight movies. I want more.!,"What a great movie!!!! The best of the 3. They've got so many details and new ""sidestories"" in it. I really don't understand the ones who found it boring. Yes it is a ""love triangle"" , WE know, and love it !! The ""game"" between Edvard and Jacob is so well played. Also the sad story of Jacob and Bella. You feel like a teen again when you are inside this universe. Thumbs up for the makeup this time to. They really did a good job. The only negative thing to say, is that ""new"" Victoria isn't looking bad enough.. It's a crime to change actors, even when necessary.

Much Better Than Previous Movies,"First, I don't understand why some of these reviewers waste our time bashing all of the movies because their girlfriend dragged them to see it and they didn't want to go. If you don't want to see the movie in the first place, of course you're going to think it's terrible! I could write tons of negative reviews for movies I knew I wouldn't enjoy going in but that's not really fair, is it? If you don't like the movies, DON'T GO! I don't like gore, I clearly wouldn't like a gory movie.Now, on to my review. Eclipse was, by far, the best movie in the saga so far. The books were (as always seems to be the case) far better than the movies and, to be honest, Twilight was pretty terrible. I thought it was slow to pick up and relatively uninteresting. New Moon gave me some faith in the movies - it was much more interesting and the script was better. Eclipse was actually a good movie, so if you're at all interested in the story, I really think you'll enjoy this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It serves its purpose,"So Its Bella's last year of school and she wants to turn into a vamp and get in bed with him. Every new age teenage girls dream huh. Edward like the not so new age male in return asks her to marry him.The thing is she's fooling around with Jacob and the volturi just wont leave them alone like the good bad guys they are. But you guys already know the story so Im ganna jump to the ""I love I hate I perish"" part. (Or was that I burn I pine?)Lets start off were no others do, with the secondary characters.They have more dialogs, which leads us to a bit of Jasper's and Rosalie's backgrounds as a person and not as a Cullen. Which in my opinion was the best part of the book surprisingly well written and fairly described.Sadly they made it so dull and slow in the movie, if I didn't know any better Id think they were just trying to make time with these scenes.They made it so obvious it didn't seem natural. Why would Bella all of a sudden care about Jaspers past and why would he open up like that when he is so reserved. (Completely different situations in the book *sigh*).Once again these two very great actors were put to shame with boring and fake dialogs.These are not the kinds of roles that get you respect as an actor. The surroundings in the flash backs weren't convincing and dare I say neither were the outfits.The surprisingly good news is that the poorly described action scenes in the book turned out very well put together mixed in with a bit of entertaining Edward Jacob antagonism. Visually the fight scene were quite captivating for not being an action film itself.There are lots of unnecessary Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and wolf dude close ups for my taste, and we all know why they're there.To lure the audience when boring dialogs are being said. Now if the actors weren't so expressionless all the time it wouldn't feel like such a D class soap opera. Im not complaining about their acting. Im complaining on how they want to compensate for the lack of everything into those kinds of shots.What else? Well we've got a new Victoria played by the oh so wonderful Bryce Dallas Howard, but yet again how can you give birth to a great performance with a lousy script?They had something great going with her disciple that should have been explored a tad more. Non the less it was a nice and refreshing plot for all the readers.The main dilemma with these films is they have such talented actors as secondary characters, and yet what do they give us? St st stuttery Kristen Stewart and those other two guys who are there just too show off some chest.Not that complaining about that, but they have two more films two get there ACT together. They have good potential but they're not quite up there like their costars.Oh two things i was keen about: Jasper and Carlisle didn't have accents on the other films, and Bella's hair is darker. On some shots they glossed patinson's lips over the top which looked awkward and unnatural. We all know vampires are feminine, but feminine does not mean extremely queer!All In All David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces; but with level 1 performances from the lead cast and blunt dialogs.Does the movie serve its purpose? Yes! Does that mean its a good movie and everyone will love it? No! Because its purpose is to sale merchandise. Why do you think there's the Cullen crest and Bella's ring and this and that.But it entertains, its enjoyable, there's plenty a eye candy(unless you're a man). The characters are lovable, teen girls can relate to Bella. Its just nice for the moment, you will find no cult classic in this franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than New moon !!,"I happen to be a fan of The twilight saga and comparing all the three of them I must say I liked the third one the most.Here at least Kristen Stewart has come out of her role of a pointless dame who she happened to be in the past two movies.She had in the past got her stuck to this sluggish persona which I hated the most.As the story however plays with her character and the difficult choice she had in front of her of choosing between Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson was a joy to watch. I've started to like Taylor Lautner, as my sympathy lies with him because of the fact that he has become a one side lover and he has still not given up.His die hard capability really is fascinating.It was a joy to watch Lautner stealing Pattinson's girl in the tent and of course by the apparent kiss that Lautner was asked for by Stewart. The movie has got more action than the past two movies and I loved it.Victoria comes back to take her revenge but eventually she has to pay and was slain by Edward with Bella's assistance. I'd recommend everybody to go for it coz the movie is not bad at all. I don't know whats wrong with the others who are criticizing the movie like hell. I think it was a good movie and I can't wait for the fourth one. The twilight saga is certainly a captivating series and its a real joy to watch the romance of Edward and Bella with a mist of Jacob in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The 3rd movie was LIT!,"First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot. The plot of the third movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not really innovative because it was kinda similar to the previous movies. The storyline was unexpectedly well-written and well-explained, even though it was still very simple and easy to understand. The characters were the same as before, at least they were still very interesting and well-developed. The casting was the same and their performances were descent. I have to admit, it was an intense movie and there were many action-filled moments. Also, the final fight scene was epic and I really enjoyed it. The opening scene was unpredictable, promising and kinda different than the previous movies. The ending scene was predictable and it was just fine. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done. By the way, there were many deaths in this movie, even though they weren't bloody. Overall, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" was an enjoyable movie, very intense and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not perfect, but honestly a fun time, and pretty well made","The first movie was an oddity, but unexpectedly entertaining. The second movie was a suitable continuation of the story, but with too many deserved critiques that hampered it substantially. What was I to expect from 'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse?' It wasn't a cold open that was superficially detached from the ongoing narrative, a startlingly well done slice of real horror appropriate for the filmmaker who gave us '30 days of night.' It wasn't a shift to early scenes of romance, personal drama, and conflict that carry a surprising carefulness, precision, and even subtlety well exceeding what 'Twilight' and 'New Moon' had to bear. Whatever else is true of this third film, it quickly impresses in some important ways as a certain step up from its predecessors.I can't speak to a book I haven't read, but judging by the many flaws communicated in the first two movies, I have to assume noteworthy apparent improvements in the writing has less to do with novelist Stephanie Meyer and more to do with screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, who crafted all the adapted screenplays. The dialogue is more mindful, honest, and real - with some genuine laughs in store with some choice lines. The characters seem more believable and complex, and less melodramatic and caricatured. The in-universe lore and character back stories that we get are more refined and seemingly thoughtful as they're imparted. This is also true of the scene writing: action scenes are genuinely exciting, and thrilling, on paper and in execution; scenes of romance are more heartfelt, and authentic; scenes of personal or interpersonal drama, or tense conflict, are more sincere and impactful; and once more - there is actual, meaningful horror flavor littered throughout.Even the narrative in 'Eclipse' is noticeably more balanced, and the shifts from one mood or aspect to another feels rather fluid and organic. Sure, it's still a film geared toward young adults and teens, with supernatural and romantic bits at the core. And the core of this title does feel a little contrived: a bit too neat and orderly, built for visceral and emotional satisfaction instead of, perhaps, utmost storytelling wisdom. But it's also not like the picture has any illusions about being something it's not - it stays within its lane, but makes the most of it. Rosenberg shows a more polished hand, director Chris Slade demonstrates adept and well-rounded capabilities, and so it is on down the line from one element of the film to another. Editing, cinematography, fight choreography, lighting, effects (even the wolves!); costume design, set design, production design, art direction - everything here is an exhibition of far greater attentiveness, and film-making and storytelling dexterity and responsibility, than what we got in this title's antecedents. Why, even the guidance of the hair and makeup crew has been reined in. 'Twilight' and 'New moon' were characterized by do-ups so emphatic and visually distinct as to be garish and outlandish. The same aesthetic choices are applied in 'Eclipse,' yes, but one gets a sense that a more muted, natural palette was employed, as though in answer to critiques of the initial looks.None of this is to say this movie is perfect. I've already spoken to some faults, and there are others. The Quileute are depicted with a more careful hand than in 'New moon,' and given an improved air of both reason and personality - but much of the same criticisms remain, and we also see additional adjectives applied, like ""possessive,"" ""sexist,"" and ""hypocritical."" More astute as the writing is terms of the romance, there's a definite gaucheness to some scenes as they linger - and the climax of that facet, in 'Eclipse,' though written well, maybe leans just a little too hard into the ""young love"" of the YA genre. The same is also true of the quasi-love triangle of the saga, which at its pinnacle is altogether forced, threatening to undo what has otherwise been woven. And evenhanded as the storytelling may be at large, sometimes one can't help but feel that the feature is a little overlong and perhaps self-indulgent. It's all done pretty darn well - but did it actually have to be a hair over 2 hours long?Still - the climax and ending are handled very well. The original score by Howard Shore (!) is outright magnificent, as vibrant and electrifying as the most pulse-pounding action, and as warm and moving as the most wholehearted glimmers of romance. The selected soundtrack of popular songs is solid. The image quality and sound design are both crystal clear, echoing the tighter direction, writing, and other details that build the whole. And with the more delicate touches that inform 'Eclipse' - even with the imperfections throughout, the performances are decidedly stronger, too. To whatever extent the abilities of the cast were subdued, restrained, or painted over previously, we get to see much more of the range, nuance, personality, and poise that everyone involved has illustrated before, since, and elsewhere. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson stand out most, naturally, but even Taylor Lautner, whose acting in 'New moon' was one of its notable weak points, shows more promise here. And the supporting cast, once again, is frankly beyond reproach: Gil Birmingham, Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Ashley Greene, Bryce Dallas Howard, Dakota Fanning, and everyone else in the ensemble gives much more robust displays of acting than the most knee-jerk negativity and myopic cynicism of the Internet would have one believe.For sure, there are a lot of reasons this film won't be for everyone, not least of all those who are less enthused about the genres at hand, or had a hard time accepting the first two movies. Whatever each individual picture has to offer, the overarching tale of Bella and Edward, and their friends and acquaintances, has a lot to dissect, for good and for ill. Yet when all is said and done, 'Eclipse' quite successfully washes over the most severe flaws of 'Twilight' and particularly 'New moon,' and there's no part of this title that wasn't approached with significantly more exacting conscientiousness. It's entertaining; it provides some actual laughs, thrills, horror, and heartwarming moments; it's engaging; it's satisfying. I recognize the faults, but I also see the value, and I never dreamt 12 years ago, sights unseen, that I could have ever said this - but I truly enjoyed 'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.'",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hell yes!,"The best of the first three Twilight films. This one felt the truest to the spirit of Meyer's novels. Bravo.Granted, you should only watch this if a) you fancy something ridiculous on a drunk night in, or b) you've already read Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series and loved every page of those novels. (Then obviously start from the first film and work your way towards this one.)But this was great. For one thing, Robert Pattinson finally showed some charm and personality as Edward Cullen! That's how Edward is written in the books. I find that in the earlier films, Pattinson is a slightly miserable Edward - here, the playfulness is back. Hurrah. Some of the novel's more tender and intimate scenes were included here, and they were done beautifully. (Kristen Stewart is brilliant as always.)And this was the best general adaptation of the first three films. Their inclusion of the initial fight with Victoria (which, in the book, Bella only hears about after the fact); the fantastic actors playing the Volturi (especially Jane); the battle between Victoria and Edward...I loved every minute of this. Did Meyer's books great justice. Can't wait to watch Breaking Dawn.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
unique heroin,"Although the film is short, but the episodes are all classic, all are what we hope in real life, we all like to have a unique him, he regards us as a unique heroin, only let him fall for it.

One of my favorite movies,"This third part is based on the first two movies, Twilight and New Moon. Now that we have delved into the overall plot and looked at the history of vampires and werewolves, we return to the part of the plot from the beginning that has not yet been resolved. Bella is being hunted by James. Eclipse tells a continuation of that story: James' soulmate Victoria is hunting Bella to get revenge for Edward killing James in the first part. Victoria is great in the movie because we see how menacing the dark side of everyday vampires is. Outside of Vaultury.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Such handsome boys,"Edward and Jacob so handsome, they would make a much more interesting couple than with Bella. I love the red eyes, and Jacob's steaming coca skin. I prefer Jake with longer hair. I saw this movie back when it came out in theaters I had never heard of Twilight before and immediately fell in love with Jake and Edward. I also enjoyed the gender bent Life and Death book Stephanie wrote oh how I hope for a movie with Edythe Collen and Beaufort Swan, that would be so cute, here's hoping for a new film with the gender bent versions.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
twilight eclipse review,"Overall i actually really like this one it had quite solid fight scenes, this movie was great for a twilight movie, I thought the story was great, it had a darker tone to it which I liked, overall I say this is probably the best ttwilight and I d actually look forward to rewatches",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best one yet,"This is a very entertaining movie. I'm a fan of the books and previous movies even with their flaws. It's not perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they did this one.Fans might pick the little details apart, and believe me, I'm aware of them, but overall I think everyone did a great job. Some things from the leaked script were left out that might have made things a little clearer and convey more emotion.I think Robert did a great job with Edward in this one. His devotion to her is completely believable, but I would like to see Kristen display more affection with him in the movie though - at times I was wondering what Edward sees in her. Breaking Dawn is supposed to be the culmination of their love, and I want her to work on showing some tears of joy and adoration in that one!I recommend this movie even to people who have not read the books. David Slade did a great job - and even Melissa Rosenberg can be commended for sticking closer to the book and fans can appreciate the many book quotes included!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the series...so far,"It's quite simple, if you're a fan of the book then you'll be a fan of the movie. I was actually surprised that the acting has improved greatly. At times there were some awkward moments but nothing that distracted from the movie as a whole. There was nothing left out in this adaptation. Books adapted to movies always go through rewrites and subtle changes. I've struggled with the enormous omissions in the Harry Potter series. I can't say the same for the Twilight movies. They, in my opinion, have done a great job staying true to the storyline and have managed to translate that book into a popular movie series. And while I know that this is a tween movie and that many people love to leave their negative comments, I say only this. It's for ENTERTAINMENT, it's not meant to be an Academy Award winning movie. If I had to choose between Eclipse and The Hurtlocker, I would choose Eclipse any day of the week and twice on Sunday.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best of the Series...So far,"I don't really understand some of these reviews that i am reading. I understand that the Twilight Saga is not everyone favorite movies, but I don't know why some people think it is the worst out of all three. I truly believe that Eclipse was the one movie that was pretty much dead on to the book. I know that there were things that were different, but that happens in all book adaptation movies. I thought that the acting was better in this one as well. Robert Pattinson has done his best work as Edward in this movie. Edward actually smiled and had fun, not the always moody and brooding vampire that he has been in the other two films. Kristen's acting even improved. She seem to change her acting from only have one emotion, to have a few more. This movie definitely lives up to the book,and was by far the best! But for the people that don't agree, all I have to say is this: To each their own. This movie was spectacular!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
finally - one worth the midnight showing,"Let me first start off by saying I was brought into this by my 11 year old daughter. The only problem I have with these movies is it is so difficult to bring the intensity of the books to the big screen. That being said, finally Eclipse manages to get something right. This was by far the best one yet. I was very impressed with Robert Pattinson's acting in this one - he seemed to have more substance (as Edward) in this movie. He was finally able to portray some different emotions, instead of his usual brooding all the time. He actually smiled and had a sense of humor!! Kristin Stewart did a fantastic job of showing the transformation of Bella from an unsure, scared little girl to the beautiful self-confident women she has become now that she is sure of herself. Love, love, love Billy Burke - he's just great! The only complaint I have is I wish more time would have been spent on Jasper's back story....would have liked to see more of him in his confederate uniform!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best yet!,"I am a HUGE fan of the books, and have literally lost count of how many times I have read the series. ""Eclipse"" must prove that third times the charm, because it is the best film in the ""saga"" so far- hands down. David Slade did an excellent job bringing this story to the screen, and Melissa Rosenberg's script is the strongest by far. She finally brought the humor to the script that is rampant in the books. However, it's important for anyone going to see the film to remember that it is NOT the book. By now, people should understand what ""based on the book"" means. Hello Harry Potter!But, the humor is FINALLY there, the romance is abundant, the music is fabulous and the visuals are stunning. I have seen it twice now, and can't wait to get back for a third time (hopefully tomorrow). This fantasy love story is true escapism at it's best!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best so far,For the life of me I'll never understand how people cannot like a film like twilight. I'll admit the first one failed to impress me and if you've read my reviews you would know that it isn't very hard to impress me with films. Eclipse takes this saga to a whole new level of whoop ass. There is far more action and intensity in each performance and some quality camera work as well. The cinematography is well done as the light varies throughout the film nicely with each scene and it's mood. When there's romance it's bright and colorful when there is horror it's dark and creepy. The directing is also better in this film then it is in the other 2. It's worth a look at and comes recommended.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I will return to see it!!,"Loved all of it! Was disappointed when it ended! Kristen's wig was tough at times...but the director compensated by the close ups, catching her lovely features and expressions. The team seemed to get the wig right the majority of the time. Kristen is naturally lovely and refreshing. Taylor stepped up his delivery and seemed deeper in his acting with this installment. It was very nice to have Pattinson in the whole movie! His resolve of unconditional love for Bella is Lessons in class, value, and virtue is nice in this casual sex saturated culture...what a concept! The fight scenes are amazing! They fit within the PG13 setting. It's clear the director was limited in expression there. It was interesting how the vampires were shown to break apart. I thought the throw a match on one of them silly. That should have been better thought out. However, Bryce Howard delivered a great, tho brief, performance. Loved her interactive scene with Edward. Go Bryce! Riley was brilliant. They should def bring Xavier Samuel back for Breaking Dawn perhaps sporting a mustache and curly hair as a different character. He is excellent!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"1 star voters, if you don't like them don't watch them!!","Ignore most of the reviews that have given this film a 1 as the majority of them are Twilight haters but for some reason beyond me, they still pay to go to the cinema to see the movies! Do not get me wrong, I am not going to sit here and tell you that this film is a masterpiece and deserves to get endless Oscars, because it doesn't, but being a big Twilight fan it definitely does the job, my boyfriend who is NOT a Twilight fan found it enjoyable too.My biggest disappointment is the graphics for the wolves, a huge downgrade from the outstanding graphics from New Moon, and the way David Slade (who was probably not the best choice of director for this film) chose to show the vampires running at speed is also not done as well as in New Moon, but on the whole I loved this film. It continued to show me the reasons as to why I am without question team Edward, and the most vital details from the book are included. If you are expecting everything in the film to be identical to the book then you will be disappointed, because as with all adaptations this is just not possible, but if you go without this expectation and are a Twilight lover like me you will enjoy every second of it.Eclispe was by far my favourite book, and I think also my favourite out of the three films. November 2011 and not come soon enough. I will look forward to the new directors approach to which will be, undoubtedly, the most difficult 2 films out of them all!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best out of Twilight Saga,"Alright, let me just say that I am a fan of the books. I, however, did not enjoy the adaptations of the first two books. I went into this movie with hesitation. My friends had all said that it was good but I thought it would just be as horrid as the first two films. I was wrong. This film was better filmed than the first two. The special effects aren't quite as cheesy this time around.The Good: 1) Jackson Rathbone pulls off his portrayal of Jasper amazingly well. He was more of a background character in the first two but given something to work with, Rathbone has exceeded my expectations of Jasper and has quickly become my favorite actor of the whole series.2) Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and the rest of the Cullen gang (except for Robert Pattinson) return with some amazing performances this time around.3) I enjoyed the background information on Rosalie and Jasper even if their scenes were cut a bit short. I also enjoyed the fight scene this time around.4)Bryce Dallas Howard takes over Rachelle Lefevre's spot as Victoria and gives a spectacular performance.The Bad: 1) The Volturi scenes were a little stiff. Not as great as I had anticipated.2) Xavier Samuel wasn't that great of a Riley. I really didn't care for his performance.3) The Wolf Pack didn't do an excellent job but did the best with what they were given.The Ugly: 1) Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have not done anything to change my opinions about them. Nothing. They give very wooden performances and still don't bring any depth to the characters at all.If you're a fan of the books, you'll enjoy Eclipse, perhaps. I enjoyed it despite my hesitations.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the Twilight movies hands-down!,"Eclipse is my favorite of the books so I was super anxious to see the movie but nervous at the same time that Summit wouldn't do it justice. I went to the midnight showing and I was beyond stoked! They stayed truer to the book then the other two movies. There were times I knew what the actors were going to say before they spoke because of the book. The cinematography was gorgeous. David Slade has an incredible eye and his talent really shined when he successfully made this film a horror film and a love story at the same time! The actors really came together and stepped it up a notch. They all seemed a lot more comfortable with each other and Kristen, Rob and Taylor made me feel like I was in this crazy love triangle with them. The action scenes were more life-like and not too CGI like – compared to the other two movies. I LOVED it and I can't stop thinking about it...going again tonight! I heart Twilight! PS: All the dudes that are giving this movie a bad review because they had to see it with their girlfriend – maybe try to find something healthier to do than to be negative just to be negative? – like, see The Last Airbender or watch World Cup or do something outside? - basically let us TwiFans have our magic you have yours. Thanks. :}",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,I have to say that I was expecting to not see all the important scenes from the book in the movie but we were in for a treat. Out of all the movies this one stayed true to the book and was put together in a great way. All the characters were more comfortable and played their roles well. The scenes between Edward and Bella were great and so perfect. The action scenes were well put together and were great. My favorite scene was the proposal scene and I'm glad that it was portrayed in exactly the way I imagined it.I have seen this movie on opening night and last night again and I'm sure I'll check it out again. I give David Slade two thumbs up. If you haven't checked it out please do.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie that worked for me,"I've read a lot of negative comments about how this movie is just more of the same, but what would you expect? It's a continuation of a series, and obviously the final resolution is still two movies away. So the people who say it's just more of the 'Will Bella choose Edward or Jacob?' plot need to realize that it is the centerpiece of the entire saga and one of the biggest reasons that the Twilight movies are so popular.I went with my 11 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it from start to finish. I haven't read the books and she cover-to-covered them more times than I can count, so we both approached it from different angles. She liked the way it stuck pretty closely with the book, and I found enough action, humor, and intrigue to keep me focused from start to finish.This, in my opinion, is the best of the three movies so far, as it balances out all the major elements that keep it moving through the whole two hours. Two thumbs up here!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Satisfying and better than New Moon,"I went to see Eclipse with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I saw the first movie as a rental with friends, and enjoyed it, then read the books. I skipped ""New Moon"" since I found that book boring (too much Bella is a whiner stuff - I mean really is she no one without Edward or Jacob - pathetic! What a terrible role model for young girls).Be that as it may, I really enjoyed ""eclipse"". Very nice visuals, good acting from the cast, especially by Taylor Lautner, who makes Jacob much more appealing than he was written in the book. The movie really has it all - good intense action scenes, love triangle angst, comedy.Not so great - Kirsten Stewart who seems to only have one facial expression with minimal variation. And some fans of the book may be disturbed that many key points/themes were a bit rushed.I went back and watched New Moon, but this one is much better.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best one yet!,"I thought this movie was very good. I didn't read the book just before seeing the movie (the Harry Potter movies taught me that wasn't a good idea) and I only read the book once. Although I'm not a die-hard fan of the series, I did go to the first two movies (with my friend who IS a huge fan and loved this one) and I have to say, this movie was the best so far.You can tell the actors are starting to get comfortable with each other. Bella and Edward, while never my favorite couple, are nonetheless much more interactive and believable in this movie than they were in the first two. And Jacob is excellent. The scene that Jacob and Edward have together in the tent is superb. Also, I loved any scene where Edward was uncomfortable.The back story of the newborns, taken from the new novella and not Eclipse itself, was an interesting addition. While not strictly necessary, it added depth to the villains that made the movie more interesting, and the fights more believable. Actually, they were likable enough that you felt bad for them when the Volturi were planning their demise. Not to mention some good violence scenes that came out of it.Finally, the CGI of the wolves was great. I could almost believe there were real wolves there...of course, you could still tell it was CGI because of their precise movements, but they didn't stick out like bad CGI does. And the fights between wolves and vampires were very well blended indeed.I don't know why this movie is rated so low...probably just people wanting the whole of the book crammed into the movie and missing their favorite part. But as someone who completely forgot what happened in the third book by the time I saw this, I have to say I loved it. The pacing was good (no random scenes circling around Bella for unnecessary lengths of time) and it was easy to follow. To all involved in its creation, keep up the good work!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Movie was AWESOME!!!,"I do not understand how 1,500 people rated this movie as a 1... Unless they were confused on the rating system.... Or just being stupid.... I have read all the books twice in the Twilight Series and this latest movie follows the book to a ""T"" and I was really impressed on how much they did include a lot of the books storyline..... I stayed up late and watched the movie last night at 12:30 and it was so good it kept me awake through the whole movie and kept the story moving quickly enough to keep your interest..... This is a must see movie if you want to follow the Twilight Saga.... I can't wait for the last movie to come... It is the best of all of the books and if you are a true fan... You will love the last movie...... Stryde",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent movie one to see time and time again,"Eclipse was my favourite book and now the movie had become my favourite, I like the way the movie flowed and it's relation to the book, especially the fight scene, a lot of action which the guys in the cinema seemed to really enjoy, the sex talk between Bella & Charlie was a crack up and Bella's little thumbs up at the end finished it really well. I think there are those who always complain about story content they should remember Stephanie wrote these books for teens so get over it already, i am not a teen but a 44 mum of 2teens and i am more addicted than they ever will be ..... bring on Breaking Dawn I will be going to the cinema many times to watch this one !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Trilogy With A Pulse,"It's incredibly rare that I enjoy a sequel to a film, but it is even more uncommon for me to appreciate the third and so forth. This is the first film that I have enjoyed more than the films before it. I'm a little bias of course because I am a fan of the Twilight series, granted as with every film - the novels are always better, than again they can go into a lot more detail.David Slade has done a brilliant job on his part and I do hope he is given credit for his work on this film because I truly feel that he deserves it. To be honest this film has a little slice of everything, drama, humor, romance and action.It is clear to me that the actors and actresses have matured in their line of work for this film. I found them far more convincing and to have much more chemistry than in the previous two films. Kudos to them for helping bring this saga from it's infancy to a fruit, ripe and ready to pick.I do hope this film receives the notoriety that I feel it deserves, as well as everyone who was on board. Thank you all for delivering this wonderful film. Overall I give it a 10, and I would give more if I could. If you are a fan or the Twilight series, this was certainly well worth the wait and I do recommend you give it a try. I am eager and anxiously waiting now for Breaking Dawn 1 & 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Actually pretty good!,"So the first Twilight movie received like a 6 rating on IMDb. New Moon received like a 4 something and I do not understand how Eclipse can get a 3!!! If anything at all, I think that the ratings were in backwards order. Now Twilight was not horrible horrible but there were many many things wrongs with it. The acting was just okay, the cinematography was amateurish, and the special effects were unimaginably horrible. I've seen Youtube videos that have better special effects. The soundtrack/score were pretty good though. New Moon was a tremendous step up from Twilight, especially in acting (except Rob Pattinson) and extremely in the special effects. Yet somehow, it received a lower rating. Eclipse was even better. The acting was a major improvement for almost all the characters, but especially Rob, Kristen, and the Jasper guy (forgot his real name). Taylor Lautner seemed a little lacking but he did okay. The previews had me worried that this sequel was going to be really really cheesy but it actually kept the cheese factor down to a low. There were certain parts in Twilight in New Moon that actually made me cringe with the acting and cheesiness. The screenwriter (Melissa Rosenburg or something like that) actually did a pretty decent job with this one. I wanted to smack after seeing Twilight and New Moon but she did pretty good with this one. The Eclipse book actually bored me a little through the middle but the movie did a good job of not boring us too much. So overall, this movie was a lot better than the previous two which is why I do not understand why it's receiving such harsh reviews. If you're a fan of the books than you'll love seeing this movie, but if your not, than just stay away because us fans aren't really going to care much about your criticism anyway. And hey! If it's such a bad movie....than why does it top the box office charts every time it comes out?!?!?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I liked it & my 8 year old loved it,"It's weird how a movie gets a generally low scores as far as it's rating, yet the people who I talk to who have seen it seem to like it. I guess it's one of those cult following movies where the ""masses"" just don't get it or like it but there are those who obviously like it, kind of a love / hate type of thing I guess. Overall I think I liked this movie as much if not more than the first one. It's kind of funny too as I read a few preliminary screening reviews where people complained about a slow boring predictable story with bad acting & dodgy special effects. Honestly I liked this movie and thought the flow, story, acting, additional character development & action were all good. So to each their own I guess. My daughter loved it. So there you goFar as younger kids viewing it are concerned, I should point out that I have an eight year old daughter and the fact that I saw the first two movies prior to letting her see them as after all it is a love story, she's only eight and it is rated PG-13... So I took a chance on this one being we went to see it in the theater together and there was definitely more kissing / make out scenes than I anticipated even know I new this one focused more on the love triangle aspect. There was one scene I thought I was going to have to cover up her eyes, but luckily it fizzled out before it got too juicy. Far as the action & gore are concerned, there is really no reason to be concerned here. The few ""feeding"" scenes aren't graphic and the climactic battle scenes while intense were not gory in the least being the action is pretty quick not to mention the vampires don't bleed but rather crumble more like statues when killed. I did not and would not bring my 6 year old daughter to see this though Overall I liked the further character development they did on the Cullen family members, this movie focused more on them whereas Bella's classmate friends took more of a sideline in this movie. Again I thought the story flowed and developed well and I was not bored through any of it. It's not the kind of movie where I could watch again and again though and I would typically not pay to go to the theater to see this movie, but my daughter is in love with the series. In the end I'm glad we went and had a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
She Loves Someone Else,"When Sting performed with The Royal Philharmonic at The Hollywood Bowl, he said in his experience there are two kinds of love songs. There is ""I love you, and you love me.""—very circular. Then there is ""I love you, and you love someone else."" –which is the more interesting. ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" aligns with the latter. In ""Eclipse"" vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) protect their beloved Bella (Kristen Stewart) from merciless ""Newborn"" Riley (charismatic Xavier Samuel), who means to kill her with his powerful army of vampire. Edward and Jacob, literally mortal enemies by blood, are both in love with Bella. Bella must choose, reconcile her own heart, and her future as human or soulless immortal.In the opening of ""Eclipse"" Stewart reads Robert Frost's ""Fire and Ice"" to Pattinson about the end of the world—metaphor for this story arc. ""Eclipse"" is not as eloquent as a Sting love song, and under the orchestration of Director David Slade and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (adapting Stephanie Meyer's novel) is captivating action packed melodrama. Granted I am not a fan of the books or the demographic. ""Eclipse"" is much better than ""New Moon"". The tone is darker, and enhanced by Howard Shore's score. This time around Slade and Rosenberg infuse a sense of humor about their material. In one scene Edward asks regarding shredded werewolf Jacob, ""Does he ever wear a shirt?"" Although at times the dialogue seems as awkward as a George Lucas movie—this may have more to do with the source material? In a tent on an icy night atop a mountain, Edward (Pattinson) and Jacob (Lautner) talk man to man about their profound love for Bella—each risking their life. Jacob asks Edward what if Bella chooses not to be with him. Edward says, ""Then I will let her go."" Jacob ends with a cute comment instead of acknowledging a mutual respect. Beholding to Meyer's material frequently keeps the movie from soaring. I think Rosenberg could have refined, matured, and retained the spirit.Much of ""Eclipse"" is uneven. Elsewhere Rosenberg and Meyer exact eloquence. With amazing poignancy Rosalie Cullen (sad and beautiful Nikki Reed) implores Bella (Stewart) to reconsider her choice to become vampire—""You are frozen, never moving forward."" No possibility. Pattison's Edward pleads with Bella to consider her choice to ""turn"". He forfeited his very soul, and the paradox that he tells her is, ""I will protect your soul"". Perhaps, this is the very essence of the vampire vogue. The Vampire is the ultimate existential hero. He is immortal, but by nature destroys the object of his love. He lives forever, and is forever alone. Kristen Stewart as Bella embodies the angst and longing, but I think the narrative fails in underscoring the consequences of her humanity choice. Rosenberg gracefully enlightens the consequences of eternity with the past lives of Rosalie (Reed) and Jasper Hale (amazingly strong Jackson Rathbone). Rathbone is a surprise from the last 2 movies, as he commands as a leader instructing the Cullen's and the Werewolf to combat the powerful Newborn.The Newborn are newly born vampire with insatiable blood lust and very powerful—stronger than the Cullens. Alice Cullen (stunning and strong Ashley Greene) has a vision of the army of Newborns lead by the Riley (Samuel) coming to kill Bella. However, Riley is a mere puppet of the malevolent Victoria (coldly compelling Bryce Dallas Howard), who seeks vengeance upon Edward (Pattinson)? Also lurking in the shadows is the powerful and calculated Jane (understatedly evil Dakota Fanning) of the omniscient vampire Voltari. Here unlike ""New Moon"" the catharsis completes with the bloody battle between good and evil with lives and souls in the balance. Pattison is commanding and passionate as Edward transforms into the great hero he is destined. He balances Edward's humanity as he fights for the soul of his eternal love. All culminates in the showdown with Edward, Victoria, and Riley—nice modern mythology.""Eclipse"" is a welcome and satisfying surprise. It is Gothic love story in the midst of the battle of good against great evil, and classic hero story as well. Pattison and Stewart are amazing, and smooth out some of the narrative turbulence. ""Eclipse"" is well worth seeing, and now I look forward to the next ""Twilight"".",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Of course its still a movie that needs lots of work but duh nothing will be as good as the book.

If a director spent his time putting EVERY single detail in the movie, it would be over 2 hours!

Your already judging it simply because of the name.,"Eclipse is good. It's not great, it's not life changing relax, it's just a standard good film.Obviously the budget's are getting bigger, therefore there are better stuns, better camera angles, better substance, and much better special effects.The music is also a plus. And this film does something different and adds small character back stories (which were in the books) to the film. However since back stories from the twilight novel were cut from the twilight movie I didn't expect the film eclipse to add them in. But they did which was a very pleasant surprise and added something very new to the saga that none of its predecessors had done.The movies are getting better. Each movie is developing, the acting is developing on everyone's part except for Taylor Lautner who was very dry in some scenes, weak in others, and then passed in a few. Stewart and Pattinson are getting better significantly with each film. Their chemistry is also very noticeable this time around.Screenplay is the most highly developed element. Had the screenplay for the other films been written with this quality then maybe people wouldn't hate the saga simply because of its name and status in today's pop-cultural society. Close-mindedness is stopping a lot of people from admitting even the small things they do like about the film because they don't want to admit that they enjoyed it and fall into the crowd. swallow your pride and watch the film damn it.Don't be an asshole. There are a lot of people I know who've read the books and enjoyed them but simply stopped liking them because it became a ""teen-phenomenon"" and are now closet appreciators or have denounced it completely and think its total garbage. What's there to be ashamed of? Top 2 reasons why people stopped liking the twilight saga.1. The movies killed it. 2. ""Its all the rage"".1. I understand, the first movie was completely ridiculous, but why that changed the way you feel about the book I don't get its not the author's fault people can't act or direct or manage to write a screenplay that depicts the depth to the novels (because there is a depth to the novels, I'll get to that later). She's not a terrible author. She's obviously a newbie. Did she know the books would get that big? Nope. So? Why are you bitching now? You read and bought the entire series but now that people think its gay your following suit? I had no problem admitting that the first movie completely let me down because it twisted the words that I read and displayed something that had no effort or heart. Not only that, it was so bad that I felt embarrassed. Embarrassed to say that I was looking for depth in something so melodramatic and shallow. And too embarrassed to admit that I'd been looking forward to see the film. But that didn't make me forget what I read or what I was hoping to see2. There has always been depth to these novels. The thing about this series that's interesting is trying to figure out what Bella will do. It's a choice that all teenagers face to some degree. If you go this way, the outcomes are irreversible, if you go that way, the outcomes are still irreversible. That's the beauty of being a teenager, you steadily learn that life is based on your choice. And having the power of choice will always be overwhelming but its so much more magnified when your a teenager. But what's tragic for Bella is that she's not in a situation to test out option A and head towards option B if it doesn't work out. But Bella isn't lost she acknowledges her wants, she knows the risks and is willing to take them. This courage she has to follow her want and not the ""easy"" life that would appease the essential people that surround her is inspiring, because most are too afraid to take the such risks. But that doesn't make the ""what if's"" in her head rest in peace. The ""what if's"" will always be there -Jacob; the life she could have had with Jacob and what she feels for Jacob will always be significant- but, why live in a life being something you're not when you've got the opportunity of being who you honestly are?I don't like how some say that the series give teenagers the wrong idea. What's so wrong here? Is the sexual tension wrong? Because I think people should start listening/reading the word's correctly. In this age/era/generation, sex is profited on. To me, women are being degraded, exploited, and are thinking less of themselves. Meyer took a leap of adding principle to his character. Edward made a tired tradition new again (at least for Bella), he made a big step in a girl's life (that is taken for granted now) beautiful again, he made sex seem ""important"" again. That it's not something you do to feel, its a stronger emotional bond that a relationship develops to experience. He did something that teenage girls have stopped doing for themselves; he respected Bella. And from that grew Bella's self-respect. Yes, I understand it is a hackneyed idea in this generation for a reason, but it would be nice if some of the self-respect teenagers had would come back, or at least be taught to them. It was that standard that made it so much more clear how precious Bella is to Edward. This is part of his appeal. Yes, he's a vampire, yes he's got the edge, yes he's the got looks, yes he's the got lines, but he's got something greater, he has the genuine qualities that a man should have; respectfulness, loyalty, integrity, and principle. What's the wrong message there? Isn't is a good thing to fight towards keeping a person like that in your life?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
by far the strongest film yet,"After looking at the average rating and the mass of pessimistic ratings given for Eclipse, I decided to give it a 10/10. Its not a perfect film, and I don't think it deserves a 10/10, but for all the people giving the film 1's, 2's and 3's out of 10 i am giving it a top score to balance it out. Even if you don't like the film, the concept, or vampires in general, it still deserves great credit for its great choice of music, amazing cinematography, at least decent acting.Eclipse was my favourite book of the 4, and it comes as no surprise that it is my favourite thus far. As a male, Like other reviewers have said, it had the greatest amount of action and character development, while still maintaining the drama and romance. The Volturi are great, the Cullen family have more screen-time, and the scenery is how I pictured it in the books.You think you've seen a bad film- watch House of the Dead 2, then watch this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful and very true to the book,"I read all these reviews before seeing this film. After reading a few I realised there was no point in reading more. I think because these movies are so intensely loved by fans and are so hugely talked about and promoted everywhere, people who don't get the craze can't stand it because whether you love them on not, the characters are everywhere you look and it can drive people crazy and cause them to have severe hate towards the whole thing if they don't understand the fuss. A lot of movie critics will write terrible reviews about this film, whether the films good or bad, its just what movie critics do, so I wouldn't take anything they say seriously. Anyway, Eclipse. I've read all books, I'm team Edward, Eclipse is my favourite book. I was nervous about this film, the trailers I watched had me worried. But it was actually very true to the book(as much as a 2 hour movie can be to a 628 page book)I had previously thought the Bella/Edward scenes in New Moon were okay, but after seeing Eclipse I realised they weren't. The Bella/Edward scenes in Eclipse are beautiful, you can tell the actors have really grown into there characters and also feel so comfortable working together. The camera angles, the music, it all really works in Eclipse. David Slade has surprised me. I just wish they'd get rid of the Vampire contact lenses. The ones from Twilight were fine. If your a Twilight fan, I don't understand if you find yourself not enjoying this film. If your not a Twilight fan, I still don't get how you could find yourself hating it, your just being stubborn and possibly even immature. But if you do find yourself disliking it, fair enough, forget about it and move on with your life, instead of all the others who seem to hate it so much they can't stop talking about it. Overall I'm gonna say Eclipse is the best out of 3. The acting is amazing. I'm so impressed by how well these actors have understood the characters, especially Edward as he's a touch character to portray properly and I don't think many people would be able to get it right, but Robert Pattinson manages to play the beautiful vampire just the way it should be and for that I love him.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you don't like the movies, why keep coming back for more?!","I can quite happily announce that I am a Twihard, and for me, this movie was definitely the best of the three so far. If you're not a Twilight fan, and do not like the films, why keep going to watch them? By giving the movie a '1 star', is definitely rating it unfairly, due to the fact that you don't like the saga. Give the film a fair, overall rating so that others can have a real idea of what they are going to expect.On the ratings, there has been mostly males rating this movie? Okay, I think everyone here knows that this saga has a wider female audience, so here is a factor which adds to the unfair rating it has been given. We know men are less keen on the Twilight Saga!If you're a Twihard,then this film is brilliant! It stays true to the books and is visually incredible! Everything is there! If you are not a fan, please stop wasting your time writing bogus reviews, because we know you don't like the films! I just don't understand why you keep watching them? hmmm.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie of the Year....With Some Flaws,"In my opinion I think that Eclipse was the best movie I've seen all year. Although it is clear to see that the movie goes by the same story line as the last two ( with tweaks ), that is what it's supposed to do. Hello... its a sequel, that's the whole point of a sequel-to pick up where something left off.In Eclipses defense I say that it was a good movie. The acting was wellplayed out and produced and the action sequences were beautifully put together. I can honestly say that the directer David Slade did a good job of getting the aspects from the book correct, but I can say that I was disappointed on a couple of things they left out and a couple things I DID NOT WANT TO SEE...one of them being-seeing Taylor Lautner BUTT NAKED. And though I enjoyed the movie I could go without seeing Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson suck face a whole hour of the movie and again seeing Taylor Lautner with his shirt off. Past that the movie was a great success. Harry Potter, step aside because unlike you we don't want to have 12 movies where you do the same thing over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Does Slade Get It? Yes, He Does","I was apprehensive about seeing The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. I worried that David Slade didn't have much affinity with what is a very female genre piece - a post-feminist meta mythology – plus it appeared as if the producers were actively courting a male audience, dissing (or even spurning) the core demographic. Of course, Eclipse does contain more 'action' and so, in some sense, the narrative demanded a different director to New Moon. Happily, Slade delivered an engrossing – and stunning – film. Slade doesn't have Chris Weitz' poetic sensibility - I especially admired the way he rendered Bella Swan's depression – but, then again, I am not sure Weitz could have directed Eclipse. But what Slade does is balance the different facets of Eclipse - on one side, the rivalry between Jacob Black and Edward Cullen, and Bella's conflicting emotions, and, on the other, the looming menace of the newborns and the ramifications of warfare between the Cullens/Wolves and Victoria's army. It's an awful lot to compress into one movie, but the adaptation didn't feel truncated. I can now appreciate why Riley's role was expanded in the film: Xavier Samuel is a fine actor and his Riley provides a catalyst for much of the drama. Ironically, he eclipsed Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard). As much as I've admired Howard in other films, I am not sure she has the presence required for Victoria - internal politics aside, Rachelle LeFevre manifested her cruelty, hatred and disregard for human values. The diminutive Howard appeared almost meek. Victoria needs to be a vampire Boudica - a flame-haired warrior. Howard didn't exude that. I enjoyed seeing more of the excellent Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Cullen – and, as Bella's pal, Anna Kendrick was given a few extra lines befitting her growing stardom. But the biggest revelation of Eclipse was that, despite their celebrity, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart and the less exposed Taylor Lautner melt into their roles, the characterisation so seamless that you forget who is portraying them. For today's actors, that is an achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie,It's just the one of the best movie series I have ever seen... Bella and Edward.. the best couple nd their beautiful love story...can melt anyone's heart. It's just beautiful.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable aside from Robert Patterson,"These movies as pretty good except for Patterson who attempts to play Edward but falls FAR short. Not only is he an absolutely awful actor he doesn't remotely resemble Edward from the books. More distracting though is the fact that he isn't even slightly attractive, masculine, or sexually/intimately intriguing. The ridiculous ""looks"" he uses in his pitiful attempt at acting are hilariously awful. Jacob is far more attractive, considerate, and filled with compassion meanwhile Edward is a cardboard cutout of a pouty awkward 14 year old dork.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Weakest Twilight Movie,"After two perfect movies I assumed this one would be just as terrific, but it was more of a filler movie. Nothing notable happened and it doesn't do anything for the last two. I mean the whole Jacob and Bella thing was very important along with the proposal. However, I do have to say that I hated Edward in this one. His controlling and very serious attitude did not make his character worth watching. The whole thing where he did not approve of Bella seeing Jacob bugged me. Especially when Bella picks him. I still believe Jacob was the better choice and whenever Bella and Jacob were on screen I felt their chemistry. With Edward and Bella it felt too forced and awkward. That being said, I did enjoy the Edward and Jacob scenes.
I will say the directing, acting, and music were on point once again.
It really is just the weakest Twilight movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eclipse - Bella's Lullaby?,"Overall, I REALLY liked the movie. I've read all the books. Eclipse probably being my favorite. At this point, I'm kinda 'over' the love triangle. So, lets focus on the other characters and aspects of the movie for a change...The effects:Loved the 'sparkle' effect in Eclipse! Best yet!I really liked the wolves in Eclipse. In New Moon they were beautiful - but HUGE! Like, the size an elephant huge! I know the book describes them as big. But I thought they were ridiculously big in New Moon. In Eclipse, their size was better. Or maybe they were the same size, but just looked better? I don't know.The fight scene was great! Maybe a bit brief, but great! I like the way David Slade handled the vampire's speed in Eclipse. Probably the best so far, to me.David Slade did a great job on the cinematography. Especially with Jasper's back story. That whole thing was beautiful!Twilight had an obvious 'blue' tint to it. New Moon was 'red'. Eclipse is the first movie in the series that didn't seem to distract me with color. Good job!The make-up was also really good overall. Except, it seemed like nearly all the actors needed their eyebrows trimmed! Bella's wig was only distracting for about 10 minutes. Then I got over it. Jasper's wig/hairstyle grew on me as well. A big improvement over the way he looked in New Moon (for the minute and a half that he was in the movie).Acting:I am a Team Edward person. The character of Jacob bugs the 'heck' out of me! Especially in New Moon (the book). Talyor does a good job with his role anyway. Beyond that, I'm probably Team Alice/Jasper. I just love them so much.Ashley and Jackson have great chemistry and are so sweet (as their characters) in Eclipse. It was so great to see Jasper's character fleshed out in the movie. That was probably my favorite part. Jackson did a WONDERFUL job with his work in Eclipse; as did Nikki.Billy Burke as Charlie was spot on. He makes me laugh. When Charlie gets between Edward & Jacob to cool off the fight...I thought that was so funny. A human cop stopping a vampire & werewolf from ripping each other apart! Awesome.The 'wolf pack' as actors are all really good. Leah & Seth are nice additions.The tent scene was very nice too.Musical Score:So far, Twilight had the best score/soundtrack. Maybe I missed it; but I didn't hear 'Bella's Lullaby' at all in Eclipse? Did anybody remember hearing it? There was 'Clare de Lune' playing in the background at the Cullen house in one scene. But, nothing of the lullaby? That's unfortunate or maybe an oversight?I hope the DVD has great special features??? Looking forward to it.Peace!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better that I expected,"After reading so many terrible comments addressed to this movie I just gave up any expectation but went to the cinema from curiosity. I knew already the story from the books. However, the movie was better than I expected. It followed quite closely the story of the book. I consider it a better performance than New Moon. Jacob must have got more used to his role as he's acting much better than in the first two movies:)) I think he is the only one who progressed actually. Bela is really acting in the same style, almost a bit boring and Edward used to seem more involved in the first movie. There is nothing deep or completely impressing going on but still it's a nice movie to watch, even funnier if you take your boyfriend along. Enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,The Twilight movies as a whole are receiving a lot of criticism as being lacking in comparison to the books and although I would agree with this diagnosis I would also remind people that in reading a book the potential is only as great as your imagination and I think in most people we all have the ability to create and visualize something spectacular. In the movies however its different because the picture is already made for you and a movie will never come up to the standard that a book has. Twilight Eclipse is a great movie although they do miss out parts of the book and although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie I was a little disappointed in the fact that if they had given each movie more time they could have made them incredible. I think Twilight is a wonderful story and although it is receiving criticism which can be as expected much like any movie would there will always be pro's and con's. Twilight has a teenage tag to it although I think its wrong to suggest that its the only age range of people that are fans of it as I am in my late 20's and many of my friends are also as addicted to it as I am.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The  best so far!,"Firstly i have to stress that i have never read any of the books so my review is based purely on its credits as an enjoyable movie and its comparison to the previous two.To be honest when my partner asked if we could go and see this at the cinema i gritted my teeth as i was dreading it. I never saw either of the last two at the cinema, just on DVD while i thought the first one was just about watchable, i thought the second one was one of the worst and most boring movies i had ever watched. So like i said, i was dreading going to see this! Thankfully i was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed this one! For the first time with these films i didn't feel the time go by as it seemed to go very quickly. Its a lot of fun with some fantastic special effects, some great action and a fun love triangle.If you stop harping on about how close to the book it is and go to see it with the attitude of going to see another action movie about vampires and werewolves then i promise you you'll enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitely the best so far,"I love the Twilight saga and have read all the books 6-7 times. I also hate the movies. Twilight was a joke, with crappy writing and terrible actors with no on screen chemistry. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by Eclipse. It was, by far, the best movie of the three. The acting was better, special effects were more believable, and it might actually be considered an good movie to someone who wasn't obsessed with the books. My local newspaper even rated it a 9/10, while the first two were a 4/10 and a 6/10. Still a long way to go to measure up to the books, but if the movies keep improving the last one (second part of Breaking Dawn) might actually be pretty great.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great vampire love story for die-hard fans gets better...,"The further adventures of Bella Swan and her friends continues in this next-to-last installment of the popular Twilight saga, Ecliipse. Set in Forks, Washington, the film once again deals with Bella's decision to choose which man she'll marry, the werewolf Jacob, or the vampire Edward. Meanwhile, the Volturi are on the hunt for Bella and her family. Directed by another director (an unknown), this film has better special effects, a Hollywood-style score by Howard Shore (no stranger to fantasy films), and some epic love scenes that may leave some guys to go to the bathroom. The movie is a half hour less than the previous one, although the upcoming Breaking Dawn will be much longer, despite being in two parts.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great but still didn't quite cover the real love story,"My very favourite book in the Saga. Not my favourite film however. Why? Coz I feel that the director has gotten carried away with too many irrelevant story lines including bigging up Jacob's role way too much. In this film he is whiney and I just want to slap him. They have so obviously jumped on the band wagon re Taylor Lautnors abs too. What they have missed out on is the real intense feelings between Bella and Edward. Some of the best lines from the book are omitted and the film is filled with inappropriate dialogue and far too many comedy moments. I really thought that Riley's back story was well done and appropriate. The new Victoria was poor, I much prefer the original who was more menacing and believable. Rosalie's and Jasper's back stories were okay, poor Rosalie she looks frightful throughout this film and her wig is laughable. Why was Alice's role in Eclipse not as prominent as in the book. I thought her and Bella's friendship really took off in the book. Edward's makeup was too extreme and the whole Cullen's contact lenses not right. I get the feeling David Slade is not team Edward. The soundtrack is brilliant. Well done to whoever pulled all the songs together. I really hoped to see some strong emotional scenes between Bella and Edward, I only got the 'leg hitch'. Lets hope Bill Condon is brave enough to tell the real 'Breaking Dawn' Melissa Rosenberg obviously isn't.Fav film of series Twilight, raw, emotive and the awkwardness of the young cast reflected well the awkwardness of the early Bella and Edward relationship.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
best of three parts,"i was big fan of twilight, but new moon was totally a boring movie. but this third venture has everything love,romance,action,brilliant dialogues and brilliant acting both by Edward and Jacob. above all a brilliant story. i have read novel so the director have shown everything in a momentous way and dialogues of all the three parts is excellent. i am from Pakistan and i will have to say that its the best Hollywood sequel ever. i agree that there are many more good fiction movies but twilight series is best of all and box office collections show this.

Amazing - in so many ways...,Absolutely Amazing! It was breathtaking and enchanting how extremely well all the characters from the Twilight Saga was brought to life in Eclipse. I am very impressed with David Slade's vision of the movie and how well he managed to tie everything together. When you leave the Theatre you know that David Slade is a director who really did understand the book. Thank you David for making this Twilight experience exceptional.I don't care what critics say - the acting was better than great. Kristen does an amazing job when she portrays Bella's confusion as she is second-guessing her choice to become a vampire. It is brilliant how Kristen manages to communicate the confusion through great acting – without countless monologues or dialogues to explain her emotions. That's what I call acting! Taylor Lautner was also great. His character could easily have been tiresome after New Moon but he managed to keep Jacob interesting. Last but not least – Robert. There aren't enough words to explain how perfect his portrayal of Edward in this movie is. He brings the character to life in such an astonishing fashion that he is worthy of all praise. Thank you Robert for that breathtaking experience!But it wasn't only the main characters that made this movie great – everyone in the cast should get their fare share of admiration. The Cullens where fantastic – I loved the fact that they where so three-dimensional. The acting and storyline made you fall in love with the whole Cullen clan - just as one does when reading the books.Eclipse is a stunning cinematic experience and a Hollywood Epic!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What is the deal,"I'm a guy and I think this movie is good, great actually. So I can't say I understand why so many guys are against it.Yes the love triangle is kinda cheesy but if you look past that this movie has a lot more to offer. It offers a new twist about not only vampires and also the werewolves and, to my knowledge, it is the only vampire movie that actually proposes that vampires can choose to be good, or rather not evil, by not killing humans.Also I like it uses the native Americans beliefs in animals spirits to explain what werewolves are instead of the usual bloodthirsty animals that always ends up being killed.As for this movie in the series I think it is the best. A big battle between werewolves and vampires and as always those evil head vampire clan in the background. Just wish there was more of action and intrigues and less of Bella and her love feelings... really don't care much about that. Other than that I think it is a great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Whole series is Amazing!,"I think the movie was amazing!!! I love the romance between Edward and Bella, very sweet. I LOVEEEE the fight scene, it was very intense, and the whole move had a little bit for everyone! For the romance-lovers, the Leg Hitch Scene, very, very, romantic. And for the action-people the fight scene, AWESOME! And for the ones who love BOTH, like me, there's just EVERYTHING there! Amazing movie! I'm extremely excited for Breaking Dawn Part 1, it's going to be phenomenal!!! I want to see how the wedding, the sex, and the pregnancy all works out for them two because they have worked and fought so hard to final get to this part so I think it'll be exciting to watch them finally get married and have sex and all that. Plus in Breaking Dawn part 2 I really wanna see how different Bella is as a newborn vampire, she's less clumsy,and she's really more aware of everything and then when they gather the witnesses for Renesmee...AWESOME!

Perfect to go with the first two Twilight films,"I have waited to see the third film-adaptation of the ""Twilight"" series.

And also, Bella is on the ""deciding"" point of her choice to stay normal or become a vampire like Edward. Especially when he had just propose to her...in marriage!

Good enough to see 3 times,I saw this movie 3 times in the theater an i will explain them all.1st was at the midnight showing i was soo excited an i literally enjoyed watching it i loved the book and the director did not disappoint.Kristen Stewart did a way better job then in the last 2 movies i saw her and so did Robert Patinson. Taylor Lautner was good but he came off to me as trying to hard or something to that affect. Bryce Dallas as the new victoria amazed me with her performance and in my opinion (no disrespect for Rachel Lavere) i would have perferred her to have been victoria for the other 2. I left the theater amazed an happy with the movie that i went the next day just to see it this time i wasn't so entertained it was still very good bu i was only really looking forward to the action scenes in the end. On my 3rd time to the theater i was finally convinced that the movie was amazing the plot a little rushed but the dialouge made up for it the acting so much better an the intense fighting scenes had me on the edge of my seat all 3 times. I love David Slade(director) an i wish he would be directing Breaking Dawn. If you did Like this movie and your blaming the director please don't because its not his fault i think if anyone wants to blame someone it should be the screen writer she is the one who writes the scripts and takes things out from the book the director is the one who films it.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"romance, rivalry and mythos","""Twilight: Eclipse"" is the epitome of guilty pleasure cinema-a film that knows exactly how to turn up the heat, the drama, and the supernatural spectacle. For anyone who has a soft spot for love triangles, this third installment delivers a potent dose of romantic tension, lingering glances, and, yes, Taylor Lautner's chiseled physique.Let's start with the core of this movie: the intense tug-of-war between Edward, Bella, and Jacob. Here, Bella faces the ultimate emotional conundrum: does she choose the steadfast, immortal love of the vampire Edward or the warm-blooded, fiercely loyal werewolf Jacob? This love triangle, undeniably the beating heart of the movie, is so deeply felt that it seems to almost leap off the screen. Edward brings his brooding, gothic allure, wrapped in centuries of longing and vampire mystique. Meanwhile, Jacob-let's be real here-brings fire, both literally and figuratively. Taylor Lautner transforms from sidekick to serious romantic competitor, and his performance has a raw intensity that makes you believe every moment of Jacob's passion and frustration. And with that body? Lautner's shirtless scenes are practically a love letter to physical dedication, and they remind everyone that werewolves are built for brawns, not just barks.The alliance between the vampires and werewolves is one of the highlights of Eclipse, turning long-standing enemies into reluctant allies with a shared goal: protect Bella from the lethal threat posed by Victoria and her newborn vampire army. It's a rare sight, and one that makes this movie so intriguing-werewolves and vampires setting aside their grudges to fight together. There's something raw and thrilling about it, like watching two forces of nature collide in unison rather than opposition. The battle choreography is gripping, as these supernatural beings unleash their full fury in scenes where loyalty, fury, and a hint of vengeance play out in sweeping action sequences.From an aesthetic angle, Eclipse is drenched in Pacific Northwest atmosphere, making full use of the moody landscapes. The cinematography is lush, capturing the misty forests and rugged cliffs with a beauty that matches the film's supernatural edge. Director David Slade amps up the tension with tighter pacing and a darker, more action-heavy tone, giving us a breakneck finale that makes up for some of the slower moments in the first half.In the end, Twilight: Eclipse stands as a turning point in the series. It takes the romance, the rivalry, and the mythos established in the first two films and heightens everything. It might not have won over the critics, but it knows exactly who it's made for-and it unapologetically delivers every ounce of supernatural, star-crossed passion that fans could ask for. And for those who find their hearts skipping a beat at the sight of Lautner's Jacob-let's just say, this movie was made to be savored.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good representation of the book, but not perfect!","Many people have slammed this movie, pretty much the same people who hate all the Twilight films. For a franchise that made over 3.3 billion dollars, they certainly cop a lot of flack. It is not fair and most of the criticism comes from immature boyfriends who can't sit still long enough if there is nothing blowing up on the screen! I feel sorry for all directors of these movies because they are hamstrung by ratings censorship. If they were able to make the movies with an MA rating they would have been much better received by a wider audience but because the books were loved by so many young girls, they could not make the movies violent or sexy enough to do the books justice. Eclipse is a very good film but please don't go if you can't keep an open mind, especially if you have not read the books.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you hate it, it's probably because you haven't seen it or made up your mind before hand","Okay, the first movie SUCKED, the second one was good, but the third one is SO much better. Is it a perfect film? No, not at all. But it is better on so many levels.People attack the story. A.) I've watched worse and B.) It's actually legit. Who were the target audience members? Young adults. Okay, so 12 year olds and their mom's found their way in...big deal! That does not ruin the fact that the story does have solid ground. It is a chick flick, so that is probably what gets most guys. Also, vampires have been brought in a 100% different light (I myself am not a fan or the changes, but I realize that this is someone's story and that vampires are not real. There is not a code of conduct when writing these fables) Eclipse brings the suspense. It brings a darker tone. It brings better performances from Kristen and Rob who show that yes, they too can smile and enjoy life. They make out better. They interact better. Some of the minor characters get to shine more. Jasper and Rosalie to name two. They both were very good with what they had.One reason New Moon was enjoyable for me was Taylor Lautner. He SAVED that movie for me. Had he sucked, it probably would have faded. I laugh at the people who dismiss him because of his body. Jealous guys mostly who all they can say is he has a body and no talent. Yet, do they complain when Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman go shirtless? Nope. Kate Winslet has appeared nude in more movies than any non porn star but she isn't less of an actress. It's just them trying to make a cheap shot. Now, back to him, he once again was great (when I use these words I don't mean Oscar). He is so sincere and I know that as he gets older he'll get better. This boy knows how to use his face aka eyes and mouth in expressing more emotions than any line could get across. He will go places.Bryce Dallas Howard was a welcome change. The other actress did little to leave an impression and Bryce actually knows what to do. The story flows better, the pace is steady and the acting is 30 times better (which for this may not be saying too much!) Eclipse won't be making the AFI's top 100 any time soon, but it will gross over 300 million in the U.S. and it will stand as being superior than the past two. Whether you think vampires should sparkle or could care less if Bella chooses the troll down the block, this film holds merit. The struggle is actually felt this time (whereas in New Moon the audience really only felt the bond between her and Jacob and not Edward which shouldn't have played that way). Also, there is a scene where Bella is with her mother. I actually felt a little emotion inside me during that. I WAS SHOCKED! Usually I only feel sorry for Jacob, but Kristen got something out of me!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best of the three thus far, but still a bit off as well.","I seem to be one of the few straight guys out there who have read all the books. I try not to be influenced by the insanity that is the teenage girl, and write the movies off. I did make the mistake of seeing the first film on opening night, and thus had to contend with the large amounts of screaming girls who all wanted to fight over who was better..Edward or Jacob. Oh and to answer that question: Neither...they would both kill you in a heartbeat.;)With that said I very much enjoyed the latest installment of our friendly vegan, sparkly vamps. The pace was pretty good, and I was happy that they kept things from the book in the movie unlike some book to movies I have seen that liked to make unnecessary changes and even add plot elements that were not present in the novels, mainly Mr. Potter and the Percy Jackson movie.I was unhappy at the recasting of Victoria. While I love Bryce Dallas Howard, and would love for her to have my children, it really messed up the feel of the story after having Rachelle Lefevre establish the character so perfectly. While both actresses are extremely pleasant to the eyes, Rachelle really gave off a more unnerving feeling when you looked at her Victoria, while Bryce I just wanted to make out with and run towards rather than away.In the end, good movie. Bad choice to recast Victoria, but still worth watching.P.S. I still love you Bryce! Call me!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the Series - So Far!,"As a moderate Twilight fan (by no means a Twi-hard), I've thoroughly enjoyed both Twilight and New Moon. Eclipse, however, is the best of the series! Great action sequences (love the wolves). The acting was what you've come to expect (though I did find Pattinson's performance improved this time around) - an overall nice experience.A major bonus was when Tyler Lautner took off his shirt and there wasn't a theatre full of screaming women (as happened with New Moon). I guess they're finally used to seeing him without a shirt. :-) If you are a fan of the series, you of course must see this, but I'm sure you have already. If you are not a fan, this honestly is the best of the 3 films in the series so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Loved it, and I'm sick of the misconceptions.","I made an account just to review this movie, because I was reading through these negative reviews I realized the people just don't get it. And that is usually because they don't take the time to understand or actually read the books and then give their opinion. I'm sure there are a few people out there who have actually read the books likes them, but dislike the movie because of their own reasons, but that seems rare. 99% of reviews I have read on here were just ridiculous. People REALLY DON'T get it. Which I guess is understandable, I can't judge.The movie was great in my opinion. A lot better than the first two. I have always liked the first one because of the mood, the feel to it. I loved the colors in it. The second one I did enjoy watching but I had a few complaints. I felt like the pacing was off, the parts that we actually wanted to see were a disappointment because they went so fast, and then the parts that weren't really too entertaining dragged on. But the fact that I loved the books, and they did do some parts right, it's nice to see it played out on screen. To see the things I saw in my head come to life. And they did do a lot of things right.Also, they left a lot of important things out and changed a lot of unnecessary things. But to be fair, New Moon is a hard book to get through, but we get through it because it is important. It's a piece of the puzzle. Another complaint of mine is the WRITER, ugh. She has the easiest job in the world, the script is already written for her and she messes it up every time, changing dialog for no apparent reason, just playing with it. We love the books, not her interp of the books, or what she THINKS they should have said.That being said, Eclipse is much better in all aspects. They didn't really leave anything important out. A COUPLE of minor things, but they got everything important which is why some people think it seems a little crammed together. That again would come from someone who didn't read the books, to understand the pacing better. The script is better. Pretty much everything said in the movie is right out of the books. No complaints there.I heard of someone complaining that the flashbacks were too long, not at all. That would also come from someone who didn't read the books. They are shorter than they are in the books. I would have liked to see more of Rosalie's but her's is still quite enjoyable and Jasper's is AWESOME.People that haven't read the bookS don't understand the characters. I know a lot of people didn't like the first one because they didn't understand half of what is going on, it is almost impossible to unless you have read the books, that first book that was hundreds of pages long. The people that make these movies know that we don't really need a PLOT. They are making them for the fans, we know what happens, plus so much more that is in the books that they don't even touch on in the movies. All three movies haven't even scratched the surface compared to the layers and complexity of the books. We love seeing it because we love that would and want to see at these SOME of it on a screen.Eclipse was wonderful. More cullens, I am pleased that Rosalie and Jasper have way more lines. Alice and Jasper are SO CUTE. I loved seeing them fight. Kristen and Rob did good. I sometimes wonder if I like Kristen and Robs acting. But then they both do scenes and I am impressed by their talent, in different ways. People complain Edward always looks like he is in pain. This is because he is, if they had read the books they would know that him even being near Bella makes his throat burn like he's getting a hot iron shoved down his throat. All actors have difficult roles to play and they all do it very well.Rob smiles more in this movie which gives more life to Edward. I thought it was really believable, the acting. In certain scenes I was just swept away, thinking of the books.Rob and Taylor's hotness is nice sure. I don't even really notice it and I know most Twilight fans don't really care about that, and if they do, they still didn't get into the series just for that, and they get excited to see these people come to life. Jacob doesn't wear a shirt for a REASON. It's because he is poor and when he bursts into wolf form it destroys their clothes and shoes, they can't afford new ones so they try to conserve their shirts. ANd shoes. There are some things that annoy even us fans, but we just go oh, man, wtf, and get over it. Because overall, the experience is worth it.Overall, Eclipse, if you are a fan, is so amazing. You will love it. It stays true to the book. And I think the entire cast, and the director did a great job. It comes closer to the book we all love. And a series we know isn't perfect but we love it anyway. I could go on and on about people and their misunderstandings but I don't have all day.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Movie,"Okay, I'm not a die hard Twilight Fan. I'm not part of any team, and I DON'T wanna have Robert Pattinson's babies LOL! I DO however enjoy these movies very much. The acting has steadily improved and I would definitely recommend these to ONLY THOSE WHO ARE NOT CLOSE MINDED PEOPLE WHO Don't HAVE A LIFE!!! Like I said I'm not crazy for these movies, but I'm open minded and these have grown on me. In their defense, there are plenty of other movies that are a series to pick on. I collect movies, its a hobby, and I learned that everyone has an opinion. So for those of you that hate this series...just keep your big mouths shut, and get a life. Let people have their opinions! Let them get whatever small joys out of life that they can. If you don't like these movies, state your opinion, but end it there. Don't write a loooooooooooonnnnnng drawn out story about how you hate them. Let people like what they like!

Follows Book Given Format,"All the naysayers, my my. No it's not perfect and the acting is sometimes painful but, people love it because of the books. If you hadn't read them you would feel completely different about the film. You would have been looking forward to it like the next episode of NCIS. The books have spoiled us all. Very had to compete with are expectations of what and who these characters should be.I think the bottom line is a one weekend gross that paid for the film. Not to many films even come close to that. We will watch them all hopping for the few moments that come close to what we wanted to see. Otherwise, wait until it comes in a box set, all five films, for ten bucks. At least you can save some money.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maturing With New And Better Direction,"David Slade has thus far been my favorite director on the Saga. I loved his work in 30 Days Of Night and Hard Candy so it was no surprise to me that Eclipse surpassed Twilight and New Moon in presence. It felt darker and more engaging as well as complicated, despite already knowing the story from the books. The only complaint was with casting. I know I don't stand alone on this issue but either Bryce Dallas Howard should have never been cast in this part or the make-up department behind her should have been fired, maybe both. Thankfully, Victoria dies. BUT, Michael Sheen was great casting!Catherine Hardwicke's version was quite dull and cheap to me and Chris Weitz upped the ante but it was just sorta soapy to me, just my opinion. Even Bella's look went from plain to make-up and soapy in transition. I thought this was Chris's best work and enjoyed it much more than The Golden Compass.I think Breaking Dawn will be worth the wait, but it is tragically so far away. It's the greatest book in the series and it was smart to break it in two. I didn't know all that much about Bill Condon to tell you the truth but I just watched Chicago the other night and was beyond impressed. I think the best is yet to come.....",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My first dip into the franchise.,"I'm a 44 year old English teacher in Korea and have had to listen to my students praise these movies and beg me to watch them ever since they started coming out. I resisted because I obviously wasn't in it's target audience. I do like good vampire stories, but this series didn't seem to be it. That said, I broke down and saw the movie.Wow, it was just a movie. Nothing hideous; easy to follow even though I'd never seen its predecessors or read any of the books. Over all, the feeling is hyper-melodramatic and that makes it drag a bit. But is that enough to make so many people dislike it so strongly? Why do we always need things blowing up and jumping from one scene to another? The drama felt grounded, the flaws in acting felt like weaknesses inherent in the actors' young age and/or the character's young age. Pattison is 24 and his character is supposed to be so aged but he comes off so naive and younger than his actual age. Lautner just comes off really young. I like the way he projects a young person's seriousness when they think they fully understand all the emotions they have, but they don't, really, because it's just their first time. He really came off well portraying someone having deep feelings for someone else for the first time and the awkwardness that goes along with that. As for Stewart, I saw The Runaways first and was afraid I was just going to feel like I was just seeing Joan Jet again. I was happy that it wasn't true. I don't know if her Bella matches the one in the books, but it is separate from the other characters I've seen her play, and that was nice. She shows talent. All the other characters threatened to be over-shadowed by the leads and the central triangle. That's why I enjoyed the flashbacks giving more information about some of the secondary characters.Over all, I connected with it far more than the Underworld series. The landscapes are gorgeous and the cinematography is nice if not exceptional. For all its action and violence, I found it to be a quiet movie about one girl's dilemma between two guys. As such, it held my attention surprisingly well.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
definitely deserving of a higher rating...,"Okay, let me start by saying that I am a fan of Twilight. I'm not die hard, and I only really liked it after I heard Kristen was going to be in in the saga. Eclipse was my favorite book in the series, so I had been eagerly awaiting it's release. I wasn't expecting it to be Oscar winning movie making, but I sure was surprised at how great it was. Let me start with the script. The plot & dialogue were much better written in this film than the first two by Melissa Rosenberg. The soundtrack was AMAZING as well. The music featured many hot artists in the current indie scene, and the music was great, and it was used wonderfully in the film. The acting wasn't Oscar winning, i must admit, however it did surpass well over the expectations for normal films. Many call Kristen Stewart's acting horrible, but when you see the script, it's just how Bella was written. The author for the original books has stated that Bella was something like an avatar for people reading to put themselves in to, and Kristen does do a good job of portraying that into the character. The rest of the acting was wonderful, the short lovely moments with stars like Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard really add up to make a good movie. Howard Shore did a magnificent job at the score, and it also made the film better. Kudos David Spade, this movie was great. Sure it may not be Oscar winning, but it's still enjoyable, and isn't that what it was trying to achieve? I seriously doubt someone could rate this movie so low, there is nothing seriously wrong with anything. I suspect some people dislike this movie because of the whole Twilight label it holds. Just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is. It's a big improvement from the other films in the franchise, and with more action, great music, not bad acting, and wonderful cinematography, what isn't to like?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still not a Twi-hard but really enjoyed it,"Just got back from the cinema after seeing Eclipse. I must be in the minority of 32 year old males who actually liked this movie. I was a late comer to the whole Twilight saga. I only got into it when my girlfriend started reading the saga. I've liked the two previous movies too. As I said in the review of New Moon I'm really interested in the whole werewolf thing and there's plenty more werewolf action in this movie. My girlfriend told me that her favourite character in this book was Seth and he is pretty cool. For me, the best bits of the movie are the action sequences involving the werewolves. God I'd love to be a werewolf and this ticks my escapism box nicely. Oh and contrary to what I've read in some other reviews I think there was chemistry between the three main characters. One other character who comes across very well (in my opinion) was Jasper. Roll on Breaking Dawn part 1!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
this was fantastic,"lets start of by saying, if you are one of those people who did not like this film, then don't read further, because i liked it and i thought it was huge improvement from the last.this film starts of at a high and grabbing point that makes you question that maybe this time they seemed to know what they were doing. i felt that this film was edited well in places, but in others that editing looked timid and frail, and that i think is partly because they wanted to please the fans. though i was pleased with the ravine chase in the movie, the editing was rushed at the start of the chase but It better when Victoria had gone to the other side of the border. i deeply enjoyed the way the score seemed not to add only a dark quality to the film, but the way in which the score gave it a very traditional film making feeling due to the sound of the drums and weirs clicking in the background of the score.the film was moved through fantastically and i thought, rather much better than the last one, the love dovey moments weren't over done to the moment were you feel uncomfortable like they did in new moon. this film showed that the director cared about showing the story as well as telling it, David added a cinematic edge, which has been cropping back into films since avatar.overall, the film was good, despite one or two patch performance and the let forgetfulness of the editing, i was generally pleased to see that this film was huge improvement.p.s if this proves to be true, then we will have a truly amazing two part breaking dawn, that better than eclipse....",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved the movie!,"I had not followed the Twilight series at all when my 11 year old daughter and I went to the movie Eclipse. I enjoyed it very much even though I had no previous knowledge of what was going on.Of course when it was over, I HAD to see the previous two movies Twilight, and Twilight New Moon. They were also very good, and I'm now caught up with all that has taken place.Just the other day I read the book ""Breaking Dawn"", and enjoyed it as well. I look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out.On here I've read so much about poor acting, but after going back and watching the videos again, I'm not sure what those people are talking about. If they can rate the Twilight movies so low based on the acting, then how about some references to good acting... Because as far as I'm concerned, there's no issue with acting at all.I buy the video's and will spend the $$ for the movie theaters as well just as my way to support the Twilight series and those who do the acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

2h I will never get back,"I never write reviews on movies I don't even have an IMDb account, I am using my gf account to write these lines because I have to say to anyone who reads: ""Dude stay home and sleep, no need to waste money for that"".Beginning with the screenplay continuing with the music and acting this movie is awful, I thought it can't be worse than the last one, well I think they did it, lack of any action whatsoever stupid gay dialogs and bad visual effects makes you feel sorry for the lost time.They called action 5 minutes of showing some poorly made wolves jumping around? I saw one guy that gave 1star for special effects well I can't give 1 point for special effects since they were really bad, but since they don't allow me to use 0 for rating I suppose 1 is more than fair.As another dude said, if you want vampires and werewolves watch True Blood, I am adding that any 6 hours you take from the TV show are way better than the 3 Twilight movies put together.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I like these movies!,"Unlike many people who have given this movie negative reviews, I like the Twilight Saga Movies. The acting is criticized, but the actors portray their characters accurately and convincingly as they were written. Certainly, the books are not Shakespeare, but they are interesting and light reading. There is good use of music in each of the movies, and each movie is different. Someone complained that these are NOT werewolves. That is true, the wolves in the Twilight movies are ""shape shifters,"" not werewolves. Besides which werewolves and vampires don't actually exist - it's all fantasy! So if Stephanie Meyer's take on vampires is different from the traditional interpretation, so what? I actually found this interpretation of vampires interesting and different.There is also criticism of Bella's character being whiny and selfish. There are many young people who feel like Bella's character; not outstanding in anything, not fitting in etc. I see Bella finally discovering she can ""shine"" (as a vampire) allegorical and encouragement for any young person that there is a place where they too can shine.And then someone said Edward's refusing to have sex with Bella before marriage means he's gay. What!? It is refreshing to see a movie where a young couple waits until marriage to have sex.In any event, I find the Twilight movies entertaining and interesting, which is all I expect in a movie",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Movie Adaptation the best it can be!,"Twilight books - fantastic for my imagination Twilight movies - fabulous compliment to my imagination I've been writing and rewriting this review, trying to find the right words. To put it simply though, I believe that the books are like the best meal you've ever had, and the movies are like the spices, the sauce on the meal that compliment it and give it life.Let's not forget what these movies are - adaptations and a visual showcase. I can't say that they are not as good as the book; they are not books so they shouldn't be compared. They are movies! But what they offer should not be disregarded, or discouraged by anyone. They are a director's showcase of what he believes the movie to be so it's just a different perspective to our own which doesn't make it wrong.But you know what ... if they capture and portray to us most of the magic contained in the book, in the characters, I will be happy.Thank you Catherine Hardwicke. You found the people, you gave it a beginning, you picked THE best soundtrack and I thought you had Edward's hair the best, but too many scenes with Bella's ears popping out unfortunately. Your kissing scene was the best and the editing was really good. Baseball scene was awesome and again, the soundtrack and the score – mesmerizing. My only issue was the lack of dialog, that's all and a few scenes I would've liked to see which missed the cut. That's OK, there was magic and mystique in your portrayal and we can't go past that.Well done to Chris Weitz. He gave us a beautiful perspective of Jacob and he portrayed the scenes delicately. I believe he gave the characters the space especially from the outset of production. His sensitive approach to the leaving scene and yet letting Jacob show his fun happy side was appreciated. Edward looked more like a 100 year old vampire in this whereas in Twilight he seemed like a teenager. I loved the hair on this movie for all except probably Jasper and Edward. It should be more like it was in Twilight. Editing was OK, the linkage between the scenes was great, Volturi were awesome – love Michael Sheen! Your wolves were fantastic so big ups to your CGI. Your backdrops were incredible; soundtrack was good though a little bit too quirky for me. I have grown to like it though.David Slade - wow! I think your job was the most difficult. You saw Catherine portray the characters, and then you watched Chris developed them in his own way. I got the feeling that you tried to stick to the book, provide awesome dark moments and action which is your specialty and then just let the story come through. Brilliant! Some will say it sounded like the book; however it visually wasn't the book. I saw who cares to them, using the words from the book made it more like we were reading it and adding the pictures. Awesome! Charlie was great in this, the scenes were real. My only criticism was the linkage from scene to scene kind of made me feel like I was jumping around. I've seen it twice and will see it again. Once I have the DVD it will be much better for me. I loved the opening scene with Bella and Edward in the meadow, very nice. I loved the way you portrayed the stillness of the vampires, their speed and agility. We never see such things so it's hard to imagine yet after watching the movie I can visualize it now. I think Stephenie had a big part to play in the tent scene and we fans are grateful. Bryce did a fantastic job, wonderful. Your portrayal of the newborns was great, Riley and Victoria's background hinted at just enough. Bella's hair though – let's never do that to Kristen ever again. Her real hair is too beautiful to be ruined with wigs! And Edwards hair was still a little like New Moon, but I still loved it. I think the close-ups could be relaxed a little and give us a bit more dialog. I think it should've been longer.For Breaking Dawn - what would I like to see? Edwards's hair like it was in Twilight, Bella's hair more like it was in New Moon, Alice/Jasper/Emmet/Rosalie/Carlisle and Esme developed more as they have such beautiful personalities we should see them more. Don't be afraid to make it 3 hours - we will watch it and give those more to say. They say so much in the books that we shouldn't be cheated out of that, I feel.I've never read books as much as I have with these. I have never watched a movie so many times as I have with these. And what's even better, my husband is also hooked which is a big deal for my rugby, macho man. I often think of how Stephenie could've felt when she saw this story in her head. I am thankful she had the skills to be able to write it for us.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slade brings sharp edge back to romance saga,"The third instalment of the Twilight saga sees Bella Swan (Stewart) struggling in her friendship with Jacob (Lautner) whilst her love for Edward (Pattinson) grows, but an army of newborn vampires are sent to Forks by an old enemy to avenge a death.The saga based on Stephanie Meyer's bestselling novels has sprouted much praise and critics all over the world and whether you like it or not you have to admit it has made one massive impact.Hopefully with more edge and better direction the hype and praise will be surrounding the accomplishment of a good film rather than who is dating who off screen like we had with New Moon last year.Eclipse starts in a fast manner with a new figure being chased by an unidentifiable attacker in the pouring rain. Straight away you can tell it has the right director at the helm in Slade. The action is consistent not just in this opening but throughout. His choice of extreme close shots and realistic taming of motions for his characters works better than its predecessor. There are times when the story itself borders quite finely on its 12A certificate but that's the beauty of this story. He handles the managing of time very well not always overselling and when there is a vibe of repetitiveness on in the air that is more due to the source novel and the amount of mind pondering being conveyed through the protagonists here.When reading Eclipse last year it seemed to me the tension and adult circumstances moved up a few notches and there was more intrigue and scenarios that made it less queasy and more entertaining than many critics have said. The violence is sharp but not graphic and parents may wish to take note of the implied meanings in many conversations between the teenagers.For this film the plot shifting from scene to scene in the 'war' works well enough but it is the romantic side the twi-hards will be interested in and none will be left too disappointed.All the ideas and screenplay will satisfy many as Pattinson and Stewart generate their best on screen chemistry, despite a few queasy moments. Lautner still frowns too much but has improved vastly since New Moon.This adaptation is better than others because it incorporates the side characters in more. Jasper, Rosalie and the wolf pack get more on screen time which was a necessity to the film's success.I must confess I went into the cinema believing this would carry forward the slow repetitive vibe of New Moon but thankfully the pace is faster, the comedy is sharper (Billy Burke is a genius as Charlie Swan) and the 2010 release justifies the nature of Meyer's book which is what it needs.If you, like me were let down by the second part fear not. Go and give this a view because if you liked the raw upgraded book this shall not disappoint.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favorite twilight movie,"To be honest, this is the best installment in the twilight saga. It's not only the most entertaining, but it is also the most well made cinematically. The cast is the same of course, except for Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria. I really liked Howard as Victoria, I think that she's actually better than the original actress that played her in the first twilight movie. And I think that the main reason this movie is the best is because it has a great balance of action, romance, and a good storyline to go along with it. The first one was all about introducing the characters and getting everything set up. The second was all about Bella trying to make it without Edward and exploring her relationship with Jacob. And this third movie has made it through the introducing and the obstacles new moon gave us, and now it's all about Bella and Edward strengthening their relationship, fighting the evil forces threatening them, and events that lead up to the two breaking dawn films. The acting is pretty good in my opinion, sure I guess things can get a little cheesy at times, but that's excusable. I enjoyed the action sequences and I liked the writing overall. I give The twilight saga: eclipse an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not for everyone,"I went to see it on opening midnight session and I must admit I expected more from the movie but still it was good and I would for sure see it again and again.What I find most annoying is people who haven't liked the previous 2 but have gone anyway to see the 3rd and then come make nasty comments on IMDb.I agree this movie is not intended for everyone and the books are far much better than the movies and it would have probably been better to be made in am mini series for TV and more could have been added and it would have been more like the book.But never the less I loved the 1st, liked the second and liked the 3rd.I'm also sick and tired of people saying that Kristen cannot act as well as Robert Pattinson. People need to also take time out to see some of their other work. You will be surprised.As for Eclipse it is worth watching in my opinion if you are a Twilight Fan.Lost of action going on and funny bits. If you are an Edward fan then lots of Eddie in this as well as if you are a Tay Tay fan u wont be disappointed.For me I can't wait for then next chapter of this series and I'm sure it will be just as good as the rest.For those with negative feedback maybe u should skip the next chapter and find something more for your taste.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The 3rd one is better then first 2,What is with all these men complaining that there wife owes them money from taking them to this movie?. Guys if you took her to see 300 then you owe her money. You do not have be a woman or a teenage girl to like this movie. I am a 31 year old man who like vampire movies and I like this movie. It is very underrated movie. The first two Twilight movie were pretty good. This is the third one and it is better. Yes it is love story. But it does have evil vampires in it. It has some scary parts it is a great fantasy film. I can think of better vampire movie like Dracula (1931). But still this is great film. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. This movie is a must see.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie,"This movie was definitely one of the best experiences i've ever had with movies.I got chills so often! I laughed, i shuddered, it was awesome. They only reason i give it 9 and not 10 is Kristen Stewart. It's so sad that she's such a bad actor, but the overall picture is great. When i think about the film, my mind doesn't linger at Kristen's poor performance, but with all the great stuff which happened in the movie. It was only when i had to grade it, that i remembered the bad bad BAD performance made. :/One of the best films i've ever seen, despite a truly horrific acting by the lead character. That something you don't see everyday.:) Enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We love twilight and eclipse,"Just watched Eclipse on DVD this afternoon, watched twilight on sky the other week so decided to watch new moon again and then eclipse for the first time. Daughter watched a couple of days before me and she said it was good. I loved it, its a story of romance and love. The special effects are great we wondered how they make the vampires look like they are running so fast, so we watched the special features behind the scenes etc DVD, and the special effects are fantastic, you need to watch that to see how much effort goes into making films that make people do things that are impossible. I really believed that they are vampires thats how good the acting and effects are. Blokes wont probably like it too much as its about finding true love and it doesn't happen in real life but its a film make believe, because if there are vampires and werewolves like that outside I am staying inside. We have now decided to buy and read the books as according to the special effects DVD they only put a small proportion of the book in, there is always more in the books. We cant wait for the next part.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hit all the buttons for me...,"This review is for the entire saga.From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!My favorite quote:""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""""What a stupid lamb.""""What a sick masochistic lion.""Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too, so be on the lookout for those reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Than New Moon!,"Eclipse is definitely better than New Moon. There is more action and the love story becomes more intense. Also, this movie stayed true to the novel. It also sets up the stage for a really great finale to the series.This is pretty much a battle between Jacob and Edward to see who gets Bella. Also things look bad when the Cullens discover that there is a vampire army being bred.The acting is not bad at all. Stewart and Pattinson aren't that impressive but they aren't horrible. Billy Burke and Dakota Fanning shine in their roles.The CGI is pretty good especially when it came to the wolves. The music by Howard Shore is also pretty good.Overall, this is a good installment to the Twilight franchise. I do hope the last two are much better. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Yes it was amazing, stop judging it!","God, everyone on here is having a go at it! And mostly it's guys in their late 40s and 30s having' a moan at the talents the actors posses, I must admit, Taylor Lautner CANNOT act and shouldn't be in the film, but as for Robert and Kristen, they CAN act! Just look at their body of work to find that out, with Robert, in Remember me, you cannot fault his performance, and Kristen in The Runaways and The Yellow handkerchief.I love the films, but sometimes, I wish I didn't. Not because they're bad, but because people don't like me for it. People genuinely avoid me because they don't want to hang with a ""Pattinson chick""I think the film should be given a break, it's not a bad film, it's not a bad cast, it's not a bad director! It came out at probably the wrong time, where now you have the Harry Potter films, which in my opinion are yes better than the twilights, for they go out to a larger surface area of people, female and male.But! The films are great, and the soundtrack is too! I feel very sad for Rob and Kristen, who now may get chosen for films, but will not find anyone liking them anymore, since everyone who hates Twilight hates them, no matter what they go on to do...The film is amazing, if you're into Twilight, go see it, if your not even, it doesn't matter, give it a break and just look at it as another film not as a ""chick flick twilight"" film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a eclipse better than sun?!,"let me at first make some categories and ranked them so that my approach to this movie will be crystal clear: ACTING: good, not perfect. the main 3 actors (Pattinson, Stewart, and Lautner) are still immature and young, so there should not be high expectations. although, Lautner's voice is as nice as it should be. in the book, it is described as ""husky"" and it is. I wonder if it's one of the reasons why he has been chosen for the role! Charlie is totally believable and much like the book. thank you Billy Burke! MUSIC: perfect, it was chosen very carefully and correctly. i like the music in the mock battle, the music in the Cullen's house when Bella ans Edward are alone in his room, and the music in the Edward and Victoria's fight. they are really awesome. SCREENPLAY: good enough. i know it's too hard to write a screenplay based on novel. because when you want to visualize a text, you have to omit thing which can't come to pictures such as thoughts and feelings that have a very important role in books. at last i think this movie is better than previous one (new moon) and as lovely as the first one (twilight). although i still strongly believe the books are sth else!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautifully made film,"Twilight saga continues with Bella now approaching graduation from high school.Very beautifully made movie with good acting and good story. Each scene is framed just perfectly with beautiful actors and actresses. I consider them to be young A list of Hollywood. Story is interesting, but details are difficult to understand. It's an action movie but, its hidden under the muted atmosphere. Mixture of ordinary, and extraordinary. The story is something that can be dark, but it isn't.As my description shows, this is a difficult movie to rate. It's a unique creation that's very original. The head game that happens between the vampires, and the werewolves is well written. It's not a werewolves in the dark kind of a movie. Where they show up, they show up. Where there's supposed to be action, there's action, and where there's supposed to be romance, there's romance. It's a great movie.I think this movie will become a classic that will be around for a long time.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Triangle has Matured,"This is the third movie in the saga, and two years since Twilight came out. I will say that this has been the most interesting one of the set yet. The actors seem to have matured, as well as the characters. Kristen Stewart was able to project Bella Swan's conflicted, yet firmness in her decisions on the screen. Robert Patterson looks more natural in character, possibly from having other acting experiences in between the Twilight movies. His Edward Cullen's character has brought his ""old school"" mentality to the surface, showing some conflict between him and Bella. He was born in 1901. Taylor Lautner gave a great performance of his frustration and his love.Throughout the movie, there were more background information on other members of the clan, as well as more on the vampires of the Twilight universe. Also, we were given the glimpse of the inner workings of the Volturi and their role in the world.Altogether, the plot has thickened and the world has become more complicated for the oncoming of Breaking Dawn. For those who have seen the previous first two movies, I think this one will be a treat for them. This movie is not just about a love triangle, but also of human communication, decision making, dedication, loyalty, and commitment. There are different parties and play and each have their own agenda. The love triangle is really just the backdrop.My only disappointment is the extremely small role of Anna Kendrick. I believe her part and most of the high school scenes should have been cut to save us the agony of watching a great actress' talent being wasted and saving the viewers' time. She was great in Up in the Air, I hope she will get more prominent roles in the near future.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not just for the Twi-hards,"Saw a preview of this movie and as a fan of Meyer, I wasn't disappointed. Mostly a great cast, lots of humour and suspense, uber-camp Volturi...what more do you want?!! Look, all you guys who have given it crappy reviews....fine, but let's face it, you knew what you were going to see. It was never going to be Citizen Kane. You just have to suspend all belief and let it all wash over you. I don't go to swoon over the actors like some of the girls sitting behind me in the theatre, I go for a good old movie that pays homage to a great book. It did that, and by the way, it's not just for the book fans...dragged husband along (he's never read the books) and he loved it too.Only one gripe...has Rob Pattinson got over productive saliva glands? Lots of swallowing and grimacing in between his lines....or was I imagining it???",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprise! I'm not sleepy at all,"I'm watching any kind of film... just to know whether I like it or not. The Twilight Saga is not an exception. The first movie makes me sleepy with all the poorly acting, the dialogue and the story but I thought b/c its a cheap project and supposed to be indie... so never mind. The second movie--expecting to be good b/c of Chris Weitz and all the money in the world--only makes me suffering in theater. Constantly checking my watch and wondering when it'll be over, yawning, yawning and feel extremely bored. So, when Eclipse comes to the theater at the same time with my occasionally insomnia problem... thinking this could be the perfect sleeping pill, I'm going to theater and I was surprised! I didn't feel sleepy at all. I actually enjoyed it a little (but the lack in acting still bother me, though--do they really think: ""B/c of the PHENOMENON this film will always be top 5 in the box office, so why so serious if wooden acting or simply JUST said the line without too much effort will do. The Twihard never complain."") and realize that watching this didn't help my insomnia at all b/c throughout the movie I always smiling, grinning or laughing. Sometimes sighing. Maybe when the actors put some soul in their acts, this could be one of my fave romantic comedy... just ignore the vampire-werewolf things.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
