"Almost 70 Years Later, This Still Holds Up Well","This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards. It still looks good, especially with today's DVD technology and great-looking television sets. This film, along with Bambi, exhibit some fantastic watercolor-type artwork with the latter being ever more spectacular than this one.The story is ""cute"" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.To be honest, some of the scenes lag a bit and Snow White's operatic voice is a bit much for me, but those are the only complaints I could find in this classic film, one of the best ever from Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Wanna know a secret?""","It's spellbinding! I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song ""Wishing"", and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's ""inanimate"" body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art! Highbrows probably don't like it because it was charming and incredibly popular, so does any normal person in the world dislike this film, and if so, why?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Grimm's Fairy Tale source lends beautiful darkness to Queen's scenes / Disney cuteness + classic songs in dwarf scenes make for excellent children's viewing. The only scenes i remember from my childhood, how","Snow White is the fairest one of all. The queen wants to be number one, so decides to come after her. Snow White, cut loose from the castle, stumbles upon a hut where seven dwarves are living - which is where the Queen comes for her, in disguise, with a poison apple...This has classic written all over it. Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.Drawbacks:There are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days. Contemporary audiences just don't worship ""perfect"" people like this. Plus, the attempts at animation of real people is not good. Snow White and the Prince in particular just don't work - whereas the cartoony dwarves really come alive. Try watching her face when she talks.Highlights:All of the Queen's scenes are absolute gems, actually. And the dwarves are great. Seven great characters.One of the best things Disney ever did was the Queen's angry walk down the staircase to the dungeon, and her subsequent making of a potion to transform herself into an old witch. The way the liquid she's mixing comes alive is fantastic, and the close-ups on the crow sitting on the skull are a nice touch.The poison flooding towards the centre of the pot, engulfing the apple, and the jack o'lantern face on it afterwards.Some of Disney's most classic songs come from Snow White: Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho (its off to work we go), and one of the most beautiful Disney songs ever, Some Day My Prince Will Come.There's also a very memorable piece of theme music that plays during the climactic storm scene.10/10. An essential, marvellous work. A thing to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Movie Milestone,"Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
STILL The Fairest One Of All!,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's ""Platinum Editions"". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD finally arrived. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 50th anniversary reissue) and made it THE DVD for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that ""Snow White"", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle.In one scene, when Snow White is scrubbing the steps of the Castle, and pours water from a bucket on them, the effect is remarkable-and that one, near the beginning, is just one small sample of the film's artistry.Back to the DVD. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this ""Platinum Edition"" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent ""Platinum Editions"", they have yet to top this one. And I doubt they ever will. Incidentally, this year marks the film's 75th anniversary, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this movie milestone than picking up Professor Kaufman's beautiful new books The second volume '' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs:The Art And Creation Of Walt Disney's Classic Animated film''is also published by Weldon Owen/Disney Press.It's a very extensive and fully detailed catalog of the ''Snow White'' exhibition,(currently at the Walt Disney museum in San Francisco,California).Here, the emphasis is more on the beautiful art as well as rough sketches and background paintings. Along with it's companion book ''The Fairest One Of All'' it will educate and enchant anyone who cares about the history of Film, Disney Animation and especially ''Snow White'' They are, without a doubt,the definitive tributes to a Timeless Classic, and together, they make perfect souveniers for both the film's 75th Anniversary and and a once in a lifetime event.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still one of the all-time great animated classics...,"My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a ""masterpiece"" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing ""Heigh-Ho"", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.",,Anonymous,Animation
A classic,"Even though it is almost 80 years old, it is still an impressive piece of work. Indeed, at the time, it was the very first full length animated feature, a huge gamble for Walt Disney, but this gamble paid off as it was a big box-office it and it started the massive empire of Disney in the film business. Eventually, this movie would become the blueprint for their future work and, after all years, the timeless fairy tales are still their most enduring trademark. Fortunately, they have the financial means to maintain their work and this movie has been restored already a couple of times and it looks quite amazing. Of course, they would improve and/or diversify their technique through the years but this one was already quite gorgeous to look at. To be honest, even though the story was charming and the dwarfs pretty hilarious, the plot was decent but not really strong, in my opinion. For example, they spent half of the running time with Snow White getting to their home and getting acquainted with those fellows while everything involving the prince was seriously underwritten. Indeed, nowadays, this whole concept of this prince coming up from nowhere and basically saving the day seems rather hard to swallow for the modern audience (see 'Frozen' and 'Maleficent', also both Disney productions). Anyway, to conclude, , even though it can seem outdated, it remains a timeless classic nonetheless and it is definitely worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"And then there was Disney,,,","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it's a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it's way into your heart. I still enjoy watching this film to this day, who could love the seven dwarfs? They all were so funny to watch and are so memorable. They pretty much represent our moods, they're kinda like a mood ring that's put into one room, lol. But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the perfect family film that is still holding up very well all these years.Snow White is a lovely princess who one day is just traveling through the forest. She comes across a house where it's a total mess, she decides to clean it as a favor to those who are living there. It turns out that seven dwarfs live there and when they find her, they realize they got a good thing going here, a hot girl who'll clean for them. But not everything is happy, the evil wicked queen wants to be the fairest in the land and Snow White has just beat her by a land slide. So she disguises herself as a witch and offers Snow White an apple, she eats it, and dies. Now the queen's the hottest girl in town, but the dwarfs come up with a clever plan to get her true love, the prince, he must kill the queen and save Snow White so they could live happily ever after.I'd say that's a nice summary, I try my best anyways. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is just one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It's such a charming film and is very much apart of our pop culture today and as far as films go, this is just a great one. I can't wait to show this to my kids one day, they'll probably laugh thinking how old this movie is that it's hand drawn, but I think that's what makes it so special. The voices, the songs, the animation, everything about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was just beautiful. I highly recommend this, it's a great family film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming and Innocent Animation,"After all the controversy surrounding Snow White, I decided to revisit this classic. I had seen it several times as a child, but my memory of certain details had faded. I think it's a good film, or rather, a short film. Essentially, it's a small story about a witch, Snow White, and the seven dwarfs. It's an innocent animation, with no malice-perhaps a bit reflective of its time. Of course, it was one of Disney's earliest animated films, made in 1937.The animation is quite impressive; I especially liked the scene where the witch tries to throw the boulder at the dwarfs at the end. Overall, the animation is charming and the story isn't particularly complex or developed, given the film's short length of just over an hour. I enjoyed it overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's triumph,"Derided as Disney's Folly during its production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would turn out to be Disney's greatest triumph. How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time. It is still thoroughly enjoyable all these years later. And it is well worth its iconic place in film history.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"the Dwarfs steal the show, but there's much to see in this ground-breaker of cinema","To call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a classic goes without saying that practically everyone has called it such. It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's.This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The One That Started It All,"''Snow White'' was the first big and famous movie from Disney, and also the first of Disney's princesses.(She would help to start the success of all the other female characters from Disney) They took three years to produce this classic,and even being far away to be one of my favorite movies from Disney, it deserves lots of credits. Snow White is beautiful teenager princess who works as a maid to the evil Queen. One day, when the mirror says that Snow White is prettier than the Queen, Snow whites needs to scape from the castle, because the jealous Queen wants her to be killed.Running through the forest, Snow White founds small house who belongs to the dwarfs ,and asks them to stay there to be far from the Queen. With the help of the forest animals and the seven dwarfs, she stays away from the danger for some time. But one day, the evil Queen discovers that Snow White is alive. What is going to happen from this day on is what makes the story a success and also more exciting.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sad to say, I have never liked this movie.","It's not a ""bad"" movie. The animation is beautiful, the songs aren't too bad either. The story is alright. I just find the characters really boring and that's why it's hard to really like any of them. Snow White is so delightfully sweet and just way too cutesy for my liking. She comes of as almost too flawless which is annoying. The Prince has no personality (or name?) except prancing around being romantic. I never found the dwarfs very entertaining either. I found them mostly annoying and I did as well when I was a child, so I never enjoyed watching this movie even when I was young.The pacing of the movie is also a big problem for me. So much time is spent on walking around, looking at things, investigating at snail-pace. Fine if the characters look around the house for a while, but I swear Snow White sometimes stops for five minutes just to comment a chair or something.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Queen Rules,"Quite simply, this one reigns supreme. Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, ""Cinderella"" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in ""Pinocchio"" (1940).The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The ""Heigh Ho"" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem ""Someday My Prince Will Come""; another gem in the Disney library.All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable.",,Anonymous,Animation

The first feature-length animation by Disney is a true classic!,"I loved this movie 10 years ago, and I still do. Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is ""Someday my Prince Will Come"", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise ""a beautiful and limpid voice"" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from ""Sleeping Beauty."" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10/10. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Snow White - A Brilliant Classic!,"I've just watched 'Snow White' for the first time in a long, long time. Man alive, I really enjoyed it! What a good film! Seriously, by any standard, it's stood the test of time beautifully and it's a wonderful piece of cinema.The story we should all know. You have Princess Snow White - perhaps the most stunning cartoon woman ever? Not only is she beautiful, but she's extremely lovely and pleasant. If she existed, she'd be the next Princess Diana or Mother Teresa. It seems that everyone who meets her grows soon enough to adore her. But not everyone loves our dear Princess. Her wicked step-mother hates her and is terribly jealous of her. That's because Snow White is thought to be the 'fairest in the land'. So the Queen plans to have her killed by a Huntsman. When this plan fails, Snow White runs away and finds a place to stay - the house of 7 utterly lovable dwarfs! In a short time, they are completely crazy about her and love having her around. She's the ideal woman! But the Queen discovers her plan has failed and decides to take matters into her own hands...It's a very simple but thoroughly captivating story. The characters are superb and wildly likable. They are marvellously given life by the great work of the cartoonists and the actors who voiced them. This is an excellent collection of some very fine voice actors, especially Adriana Caselotti as Snow White. She sings like an angel and her innocent voice is very lovely indeed. The music is well suited to the story and memorable, particularly the infamous 'Hi Ho' song.The fun bits are fun; the serious bits are serious; the awful bits are awful; the feel-good bits make you feed good. 'Snow White' doesn't seem to do anything by halves. It's a truly charming gem of a film. I can hardly praise it enough. Walt Disney didn't put a foot wrong with this one. It was Walt Disney's first full-length film and in my opinion it will always be his finest hour. It's a masterpiece of entertainment. It even had me shedding a tear at the end! It's just a brilliant film - a classic. Few films have or ever will be as good, original and ground- breaking as this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing for its time,"This movie was an amazing accomplishment for its time. The animation is beautiful, and it's a true musical. There are lots of details in the animation, and it's so skillfully done that you feel immersed in it. There are also gags reminiscent of the ones in the Silly Symphony short films. I found them to be clever.What bothers me about this movie is that Snow White is a very flat, undeveloped character. It's difficult to identify with her. For example, after she's been running through the woods terrified, she asks the birds for advice and they tell her to sing. So she does, and then she says, "" I feel better now, I'll be alright"". That kind of immediate recovery is really unrealistic. I find her perpetual cheerfulness to be grating, it's like she's not a real person. She never shows any real personal struggle or an obstacle that needs to be overcome. She just runs away to the woods, adapts immediately to living with dwarfs, and is completely happy even though she's just been threatened with death by the Queen and lost everything. She doesn't show any sadness, anger, or regret. It's a little weird...if a real person had that lack of reaction, I'd be concerned. The dwarfs are okay - cute but not very developed characters.My favorite part was actually the animals. They're adorable and have a lot of personality. They are also responsible for helping Snow White when she was lost in the woods and after the evil queen tries to take revenge.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The one that started it all is still the fairest one of all,"In early 1934, when production started,everyone thought Walt Disney was mad to make the first ever animated feature film. All that changed on December 21,1937, as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs was embraced by not only critics, but everyone.And how it is still loved today. Nobody gets old enough for Snow White, and I doubt anybody will.It is simply the original fairytale, only animated. It has a few changes from the original tale, but really, I'd say the changes are for the better. The characters are amazing, each has their own unique look and personality to them,and the voice acting is outstanding.The whole look of the movie is beautiful, every moment is enchanting. Out of every single film out there, and I'm just not talking about animated films, if there is one film that I think has the most beautiful moments, it's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.The songs are simply a pleasure to hear. From 'I'm Wishing' to 'Someday My Prince Will Come', you'll fall in love.Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is the best animated film of all time. It may not be my favourite(That being The Lion King), but no doubt it is the BEST of all time. In fact, I think it's one of the best films of all time. It's simply incredible, with humour, drama, romance and even some intense scenes. I rented out the new Diamond edition a few weeks ago, and can I just say, it looks as if it were made yesterday, no lie.For anyone, I would most certainly recommend Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. It's the one that started it all, and it will always be the fairest one of all.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Classic with Stunning Animation and a Mediocre Plot,"The animation is stunning and holds up to this day, in particular, the sequence where Snow White is in the woods and the forest transforms in a whirl of personification, embodying her mental state and showing the magical world that Snow White lives in. There are a few beautiful shots that really do the animation justice and showcase its value as a film medium. While the technical aspects of the film hold up, many of the factors contributing to the story do not. The characters in this film lack dimension, the dwarves are named what they do, with the exception of Doc, and while they provide comic relief and are visually entertaining, they do little to further the plot. They don't protect Snow White or save her from the queen, instead they have her clean up after and cook for them which, while Snow White seems happy with the arrangement, reinforces gender roles that were prevalent at the time. Snow White lacks individuality and isn't an interesting character. She is a passive character and doesn't take action, instead just letting things happen. The witch is simply an embodiment of evil and vanity. The prince sings a little and swoops in to the rescue at the end, but based on what the movie shows us about the characters, the prince is boring and Snow White would have been better off with the dwarves. While this is an animated movie based on a fairy tale and the goal of the film is to be visually entertaining, which it succeeds at, the story and the characters (except the dwarves) are forgettable. Snow White was a groundbreaking film and essentially the driving force in building the Disney Empire. The animation holds up to this day, rendering the film a classic and a must-watch, despite the plot being simple and the characters two-dimensional.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic!!,"Snowwhite and the 7 dwarfs is one of the best cartoon-movies ever made, and is much better than many of Disney`s newer movies.  The animation is brilliant, and could teach many modern cartoons a lesson or two about how to make a good cartoon-movie.  I guess that I don`t have to tell you much about the story, since most of you are familiar with it, but I`ll tell you some of it(in case some of you have missed out on this classic). Snowwhite(a princess) is the most beautiful woman in the country, which her stepmother(the queen) doesn`t like.  The queen orders her best hunter to kill Snowwhite when she is picking flowers.  The hunter is not able to kill Snowwhite, and she runs deeper into the forest.  The eventually discovers a small house, which is the dwarfs` house.  The queen finds out that Snowwhite is still alive. Snowwhite is a true classic, with superb animation and stunning soundtrack. It was also a groundbreaking movie, which meant that Disney could produce more high-class cartoon-movies to an audience which was gasping for more. 9,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad,"Out of all the Princess films this one is the worst. It can get boring and Snow White is super annoying. I did enjoy the dwarves and the songs throughout, even if Snow White's harmonizing could get annoying. And the Prince came off as kind of creepy. The end was the part that kind of annoyed me, she woke up and then said goodbye after everything they've been through? Why not just throw a celebration?",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Historically Very Important,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)**** (out of 4)The beautiful and charming Snow White comes under attack by a man who has been hired by the evil Queen to kill her. She ends up taking shelter in the forest with seven dwarfs but soon the Queen has more plans to destroy her.There's no question that this is a legendary film and a very important one to history as it was the first feature-length film from Walt Disney Studios. The film was a tremendous hit when it was first released and it really broke new ground in regards to what people would be willing to sit through. After all, it was a mystery if people in 1937 would be willing to sit through a feature-length cartoon and whether or not they'd be able to show emotions towards animated characters.As for the film itself, it's certainly a great one from Disney's original Golden Age. There's no question that the most impressive thing is how great the actual animation is. I've seen plenty of cartoons from this era and the quality is usually good but there's no question that the amount of detail was just taken to a new level here. Just take a look at how much detail is in the forest scenes. Look at the detail to the seven dwarfs. Look at the terrific detail in the Queen's potions.SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS features a memorable and lovable lead character, a great villain and seven great comic relief characters. I also liked the fact that the darkness of the Grimm's Fairy Tale was also left in and this certainly makes the film more adult in a way. Disney would make a major breakthrough with this film and it remains refreshing all these years later.",,Anonymous,Animation
This never gets old!,"Disney has made many animated feature films, and there are still animated movies aplenty being made out there in modern times, but very few can eclipse the very first one of all, which is the story of a beautiful young princess called Snow White who is under the watch of the wicked Queen, who forces her as a maid in the house. This movie is now so highly rated and acclaimed that in 2007, the American Film Institute named this animated flick the 34th best American film of ALL TIME.Even while watching it as a little kid, watching it again as a grown up teenager still brings back awesome memories, proving that the story, the characters and beautiful music is gripping and makes this a fascinating tale. Snow White herself is drawn so beautifully that you can't help but simply admire her, and the incredibly adorable voicing from Adriana Caselotti is a child's fascination. The Seven Dwarfs are very united and usually do things together- they live together, work together etc. But they are all different in personality and even in appearance. One example is Grumpy, who is for a while reluctant to accept Snow White and cold towards her, but is still one to play a part to rescue her from the Queen when danger arrives. They are the other backbone of the story, and are my personal favourite in this.This one animated film has received a lot of praise and attention over the years, right up until now 3 quarters of a century later, because by 1937 standards this is just phenomenal. Kudos Walt Disney for having the far-sightedness and innovation to create this stupendous movie in Technicolor back then and making it fun and realistic. Even now, all children should watch this- perhaps even with their parents who will not mind it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perhaps the Most Beloved and Treasured Piece of Cinema of All Time,"Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is arguably the single most endearing film of all time. The story is one that is familiar, yet Walt Disney was able to breathe fresh air into this classic fairy tale through wonderfully lovable characters and witty humor. Every animated film ever made after Snow White owes great debt to it in one way or another. It is simply the most influential animated feature of all time. As visually striking as it is charming, this masterpiece has stood the test of time and proved it's undeniable appeal to audiences and became a classic in the eyes and hearts of millions worldwide. Imagination, both of the filmmakers and the audience let this film live on for generations.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still the fairest of them all.,"The first of a growing cannon of classics, 'Snow White' epitomises the Walt Disney Company ethos of dreams coming true. The world's first feature length animated film succeeds not only as a masterpiece of filmmaking, but also in being the earliest representation of jokes and tropes that are nowadays a common cliché.With an opening credit dedicated to the perseverance of his team of animators and various other personnel, the enormity of the task that was Walt Disney's original ambitious endeavour is clear in its first few frames. Everything audiences take for granted in the new millennium of computer wizardry and computer generated effects marks a milestone in his earliest classic, from its sheer length to its lasting beauty.The movie's charm never relents, but is also genuine and never overbearing. The story is simple, yet efficient and effective. 'Snow White' is a condensed vessel for the studio's genius, every shot brimming with creativity, a timeless labour of love that proved how all that would follow might be possible.Walt Disney's vision is never compromised, from references to gore through terrifying sequences of hauntings and witchcraft. It's this determination to make people laugh, to make them scared, to take them on a journey that makes 'Snow White' a wonderfully immersive celebration of storytelling.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Favorite Disney Classic Film,"There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure.Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine.As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha.The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith.Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh-Ho"", ""I'm wishing"" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one.The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst Disney Princess,"One word in a sense describes the way I feel about this film: sickening.Not only is it enough to make you want to gag when the ridiculous animals are fluttering about helping this idiot girl clean, but the whole concept of her in general is annoying. I just hate Snow White. From her tacky primary colored dress to her stupid sounding voice and naive actions, this is one character who will forever annoy me with her ignorance.The only reason I give this a three is because I like the dwarfs in the movie. That's it. Other than that it's a completely idiotic film that will waste years away collecting dust on your shelf when you realize how crappy it is yourself.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, while not great, is still a pretty good Disney animated feature","After watching the recent Disney animated feature-The Princess and the Frog-I decided to finally see the recent DVD I bought of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs-Uncle Walt's first attempt at a full-length cartoon-for the first time ever. Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the ""Heigh Ho"" number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S. The Prince's singing and speaking voice is that of one Harry Stockwell, father of child and adult actor Dean Stockwell.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A milestone in cinema...still the greatest animated film of all time,"Having just picked up quite possibly the last copy of the recent Diamond Edition of this film, and watching for the first time in 15 years, I am compelled to write this review. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is 74 years old this year, and it doesn't feel like it has aged a bit. What everyone thought would be a flop is the reason we have the likes of Pinocchio (1940), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Toy Story (1995) and Tangled (2011). This film blew away audiences back then, being hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements and even being proclaimed the greatest film of all time by Russian director Sergei M. Eisenstein. The amazing thing is, Snow White blew people away when it was re-released in 2001 in the Platinum Edition, reminding people that the older Disney movies are timeless, and will never be topped.Adapted from the Grimm Fairytale and made family-friendly, Snow White follows the story of...Snow White (Adriana Caselotti), who is proclaimed the ""fairest of them all,"" much to the distaste of her stepmother, The Queen (Lucille La Verne). A hunter is hired to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, returning her heart to The Queen as proof, but having a change of heart, lets Snow White escape. She stumbles across an old house in the woods, which houses seven dwarfs.The re-master is gorgeous, highlighting just how beautiful the animation is, and why hand-drawn will always be the best. The animals are cute as ever, the ""evil woods"" scene looks stunning, The Queen's transformation still frightening, and the final scene in the storm is just as epic as it was when I was five! I forgot just how many fantastic musical numbers this movie had, with ""Whistle While you Work,"" ""Heigh Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" sounding as good as ever.This film spawned some of the greatest family films of all time, with Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Fantasia following straight after Snow White's success. As a 20 year old guy, I thought the magic may have worn off, but this film is a lasting legacy, a testament to the brilliance of these old Disney films. Watching this again, I found myself smiling at the antics of the dwarfs, singing to songs I'd long forgotten, and crying with the dwarfs over Snow White's body. Snow White has managed to enchant audiences for 74 years, and will continue doing so for as long as I can imagine.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully drawn... Buuut the rest.....,"First of all the good stuff. Like i mentioned in the title, the drawings and animations are absolutely beautifulle. The attention to detail is astonishing especially for the age of this movie.On the other hand, the story is pretty boring and drags along without getting me invested into the characters or what might happen to them. The songs are, at least for my taste, OK at best and i really found snowhites voice to be quite annoying.But one of my biggest complains is that the art-styles of snowhite and the one from the dwarfs dont match. When i start to get a little bit into the movie, the weird mix just rippes me right out of it again.Overall the movie is still worth to watch if you just want to see some nicely drawn animations. If you want a good story, then this movie isn't for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The jewel of animation,"So Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first ever animated feature length film, and people had told Disney 'It would never work'. Well, it appears that they were wrong in the end, as this is one of the most beautiful and amazing films, and that I am being honest! The character's are interesting and you never get bored of them, despite the Prince not having a major role. But that didn't bother me really, as all the scenes and songs are just amazing to watch and hear! This really is the jewel of animation. Animation has changed over the years, and a lot of people pay more attention to computer-animated films now. But I'll be surprised if somebody watches this movie and dosen't see how amazing 2-d animation can be. It is the inspiration for all animated movies, and it'll always be treasured. Simply Disney at it's best. No doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Learning to do it. Not the best but interesting.,"After being dismayed by Dinosaur & Tarzan (Luckily I rented them) I decided to re-watch Snow White. I love all the scenes with the forest creatures and I noticed a lovely simulation of a waterfall. There were other interesting sequences but I wouldn't call them spectacular. (Their technique rapidly improved - Pinocchio, Fantasia & Bambi provide evidence.) Snow White is a nice testing ground.The characters didn't do much for me, especially the dwarfs. They have some amusing lines but the gags weren't that funny. The Queen didn't scare me. Snow White was gentle & nice but too youthful for the role. The Prince is just a plot device. The songs are memorable, although some are a little irritating. The film also seems overlong for such a simple story but that's just my reaction. But whatever faults you may find, this is a film for everyone. Don't forget. This is the film that made possible all the others and re-shaped the industry.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Classic Truly Withstands the test of Time. It's As Beautiful Today as Ever!,"Before Cinderella lost her slipper and before Aladdin met the Genie, Walt Disney did his most crazy and insane project ever - a feature animated movie, the first of its kind. The title of the film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Parents and kids loved this film decades ago and, a generation later, families can now enjoy this beautiful classic in Blu-Ray.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a musical with catchy, and beautiful singing done by Adriana Caselotti, (Snow White), Lucille La Verne (Queen) and others. There is also a sense of adventure, and a magical romance, between Snow White and the Prince.The story begins when the Queen discovers that she is not the fairest of them all, and that Snow White is. Out of jealousy, she orders the death of Snow White. However, Snow White gets away. She comes upon 7 dwarfs which she befriends. The Queen angrily learns about her failed death, and decides to poison the young princess!Since this is the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is packed with extra features including a tour of the animation studios in the 1930s, actual interviews with Walt Disney, cool facts, (Did you know Snow White was originally designed to have gold hair? Who knew!) and so much more. My favorite part concentrates on how Walt Disney hired over 300 artists, how he spent so much money on making it perfect, and just how much speculation and hate he got for attempting to make (and being very successful as a result) a 90 minute animated film.Even though this film was made almost a century ago, the quality of the animation is as good as films made today. Hand-drawn animation has a quality of from the human touch that CGI can never achieve. In terms of the soundtrack, Walt Disney had a knack for making his animated films not only have background music, but he created it in such as way that the music becomes an integral part of the story. For example, when Snow White and the Prince first meet, they sing a song together and it represents almost, ""Instant love,"" better than words ever could. This story is based on a classic European fairy tale, and Walt Disney hired a few people who specifically made European-styled drawings, to make the film feel like the original fairy tale, which was perfect for the film. The voice-over sound quality is also top notch, amazingly so since again, it was made almost 100 years ago. I would easily compare it to the voice over acting and quality of the late 90s. This film was ambitious in terms of being the first animated feature film, but also was first feature film to have a female lead.My favorite scene is the meeting of The Prince and Snow White. In the scene, Snow White is cleaning outside and she explains to her bird friends what a wishing well is. A prince overhears her fantastic singing and is love-struck when he meets her. This scene is one of my favorites because the music is beautiful, the animation is spectacular and this scene specifically illustrates my point about European artists designing the backgrounds. It really looks like a European castle of some sort.This film was designed for all ages and I still agree. I recommend it for ages 6 to 13 specifically. Younger kids will enjoy the bright colors, dancing and singing. Older kids can appreciate how difficult it was to make this film and the storyline itself. Adults who have happy memories of seeing this film years ago will also enjoy it. Overall, it's a great film for the family. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of the spectacular animation, exciting story (typical of films made by Walt Disney) and clear voice acting.",,Anonymous,Animation
The film that started the Disney Princess franchise,"Even though I am now 25 years old, I love the Disney Princesses. But an animated princess (or a live-action one) needs no certain fan age group, and this is the film that started it all, Snow White.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. It was the Walt Disney Studios' first full-length animated feature film, as well as the first American animated feature film in film history. The story is a familiar one: Raised by a wicked and vain queen after her royal parents died, beautiful Snow White is taken into the forest to be murdered. However, the huntsman cannot commit the horrible deed, so she flees and finds refuge in the home of seven diamond-mine workers/dwarfs: Doc, Happy, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, and Dopey.My favorite musical scenes are the wishing well/balcony scene and the ""Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum"" scene. To me, that washing scene is like teaching cats to wash like humans instead of using their tongues. So overall, I love this beautifully animated film from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
10/10,"Oh My Wow! This has been one of my top favorite Disney films since I was a child and now it's still on my favorite movie list, it used to be number 1 on my list but unfortunately got moved to being number 5 but the important thing is that it's still on my list nonetheless. Snow White even used to be my favorite Disney princess but only until another princess came along and became my new favorite Disney princess, but that doesn't mean that I love Snow White any less, I love her now just as I always have. Everything about this film deserves all the glory, love, appreciation and fandom as it always has with its animation, characters, musical score, feelings, effects, story, laughs and wonderous style since this is the first ever animated film that the genius Walt Disney ever created for generations of kids and adults to enjoy for years and years, no matter how old it is even now as the year of 2021 has just begun. Out of all the dwarfs my favorite is Doc and the main reason is because he's incredible at taking charge and makes an amazing leader and also is sweet, caring, bold, brave, wise, adorable and always makes time for others close to him, the seven dwarfs are actually the main reason why this movie is one of my top favorite movies of all time because of how much they dazzled and impressed me when I was a kid and how much they still do now and I still just love all seven of them to pieces and they still make me laugh like crazy, plus the song Heigh Ho is my top favorite song in this wonderous masterpiece.

Fairytale on the screen,"this was the first big movie from Walt Disney and his team, and it was received with great cheers from everyone - the audience as well as the critics. The movie even got a special price from the Academy Awards: One normal sized Oscar, and seven small ones! They didn't have a category for Animated Movies at that time, but its popularity was demanding much attention - and got it! It's a feel good movie that I remember well from my own childhood, but now in my old days I have some critiques. It's a good adventure, but it evolves as more like a musical, a type of genre that I normally greatly dislike. A few songs could have been skipped, and the choreography in the dancing scenes are too ""nice"". However, this fairytale from the brothers Grimm that I read as a child, was very exiting, and done good on the big screen. It has great animation with good colours and a marvelous depth in the frames. And the dwarfs are fantastic characters; all seven from Grumpy to Dopey.Yes, this movie was ground-breaking when it hit the silver screen, and I think all animated features from Disney is very good - well,up to the end of the 70s.

A timeless and unforgettable start of a great entertainment industry,"Before the beginning of the World War II in the 1940s, an entertainment industry was born and while most of the movies were made in the early 1910s and 1920s, a man named Walt Disney and several of his workers created a company known as the Walt Disney Company, a light-hearted entertainment industry, by releasing their very first animated full length feature, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" based on the Grimm fairy tale of the same name.It tells the story about Snow White, a girl dressed rags who meets a prince. The queen, after becoming jealous of her beauty which will result in taking the queen's place as ruler of the kingdom, sends his huntsman to take her far into the forest where he can kill her. When he tried to kill her, he apparently lets her go after telling her of the Queen's plan. She runs into a forest, but after making some encounters with some forest friends, they take her to a cottage where she along with the animals clean it up. Little does Snow White know that this cottage belongs to the seven dwarf men, who then find her and decided to make friends with her and let her stay for as long as she likes. Meanwhile, the Queen, having found out the Snow White is still alive, transforms herself into an old hag and makes a poison apple so she can give it to her and will result in sleeping death.For their first attempt at an animated feature that will lead to their success and create other classics, Disney has done a fantastic job and to me, I remembered watching this as a child and it finally grew out on me which is why I'm giving this a full 100%. The story is very original with an emotional feeling to it and the pacing is really good with some scenes that aren't drag. The characters are extremely likable. Snow White, although the weakest of the other Disney princess, is at least decent, the prince only appears in the beginning and the end, but was OK. The seven dwarfs are so funny. Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, and Sneezy are great and the hilarious moments with them are enjoyable to watch, but the only character who steals the show the most is the Queen who is by far a great Disney villain. Her motives are excellent and her old hag form scared the living soul out of me as a child. The voice acting for the characters are what I would like to say ""excellent"", but the strongest aspects goes to the memorable songs (I'm Wishing, Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho, The Silly Song, Someday My Prince Will Come) and the beautiful animation I've ever seen in any film out there today.Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will always remain to Disney-fans as one of the most classic films in cinema history before MGM would later do the same thing by making The Wizard of OZ, an adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic book. This deserves a higher thumbs up from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing and Powerful film.,"I love this movie. It is much darker however than most would think. I girl is forced to flee into the forest to escape the evil queen. This queen is the most serious villain and most insane in my recent memory. Not only does she try to kill Snow White twice, but is into witchcraft and sacrifices her own good looks to destroy her stepdaughter's. And of course the music, animation, characters and voice talents are wonderful. This is Walt Disney's dream, share it with your children.I would be advised that today, the Witch would probably give this a PG rating. But it is worth it in the end to see good triumph over evil. And considering this was done in 1937, the animation and dedication of those animators is stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good today as it once was - although it shows its age.,"One of my favorite all-time animated Disney movies. I used to watch it all the time as a kid. Pretty much every song is a classic, every character is unforgettable, every voice is just perfect, I honestly think that not a second is wasted. Snow White and the Severn Dwarfs is Funny, scary, entertaining and revolutionary for its time. You have to remember that this was the very first animated movie ever. In 62 years, I believe that this movie has never been equalled. OF course there have been many remakes but in my opinion none of them ever equals the magic and splendour of this movie. It has stood the test of time. I really enjoy watching this film over and over and it never gets old. Wonderful.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Absolute Masterpiece That Changed the Cinema Forever,"In thirties there was some short animations, and so Walt Disney decided to make a full-length movie, and many people thought he was going crazy, that nobody will stand this, and so on. After more than four years of hard work for him and his team, and more than a million dollars spent, the movie was ready in December 1937, and the result was amazing. With an impressive and creative work from the designers, the characters come alive in a captivating way, and the public was mesmerized with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The audience was thrilled, many come to tears after Snow White ate the the poisoned apple, and the success was so astonishing that the movie became one of the most watched movies in history, and it still continues to captivate millions of people around the world. This was Walt Disney's cornerstone, all that he made after was based on this unique movie, and because of it he was one of the few persons in the world able to fulfill the most of his dreams.

Animation aside this is sexist and dull,"Wat Disney's first full-length animated cartoon was a HUGE hit in 1937. I saw it when I turned 5 in 1967 (I was told) and LOVED it. I saw it again 7 years later (back then Disney films were reissued every 7 years at theatres) and was bored silly. Just saw the digitally restored version on DVD. It LOOKS incredible with bright colors and beautiful animation but I still don't like it.The story is sssloooowwww and the character of Snow White is given NO characterization at all! She's just SO sweet and SO innocent that you just want to hit her. The Prince barely figures in this. The music and songs were terrible! ""Whistle While You Work"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" were (kind of) cute but way too sweet. Also they're sung at such a high pitch they could break glass! The dwarfs are annoying and obnoxious and act like a gang of badly behaved children. Their ""comical"" antics were anything but. Only the animals come across as nice. Also the sexism is horrific. Snow eagerly agrees to keep house for the dwarfs for no good reason whatsoever. Yet when the Prince awakens her she has no problem running off with him to be ""happily"" married!

In particular The Queen looks incredible, she still ranks as one of Disney's finest villains.Adriana Caselotti had the most sweetest, most delicate voice, she was perfect for the character, so soft and innocent, a perfect contrast to.

An animation classic,"I admit that this film has a couple of flaws. The music is not too good and (of course) the animation is not too good. But you have to see it all in perspective. This film was made about 65 years ago and I think it is a great accomplishment that the film can entertain people (including me) even now. I mean I'd rather watch this film (which is not perfect technically regarding today's standards) than watch Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars again. I honestly must say that the theme of the film has an approach that is well kind early 20th century but hey that's when it was made and although I didn't like that aspect very much I still enjoyed this film more than I did 2001's Artificial Intelligence (just to name one). The execution of the theme might be a bit old as may the animation techniques, but the good thing is that great humoristic scenes never lose their effect. My favorite dwarf? That's easy DOPEY. I mean the face he has and the stunts he pulls easily make him the funniest dwarf in my opinion and the one that deserves most of the grade I give this film.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A milestone in filmmaking,"Snow White is a milestone in motion picture history. It is the first (and possibly the best) full length animated feature film. It spawned a whole new line of motion picture entertainment. It still sets the standard for animated features today. And it was a simple good story incredibly well told. Snow White herself is only mildly interesting. But give her a cast of quirky and funny side characters, and you've got a brilliant picture. Snow White does not focus solely on plot. It slowly moves along, giving room for the scenes of her interacting with the dwarfs and animals to draw us into to the atmosphere. We really get to know all of the characters well. The storyline may be familiar, but it is spiced up to create something fresh (compare it to taking ordinary soup broth and then adding a perfect combination of seasonings to make the best soup you ever had). Snow White also has some of the best music ever recorded. A lot of what Disney would later use to lesser effect in other films was birthed here: The animals who are there to give Snow White something to relate to, the animation timed out to song movements, the glorious foreground and background animation panels filmed to give a 3D effect. And the artistic detail rendered by hand in each frame is breathtaking. Only Pinocchio bettered this masterwork in terms of sheer artistry. The dwarfs naturally steal the show, but the scenes with the queen are given full weight in their creepiness. Not too scary but scary enough to send shivers down kids' spines. What a great movie with so much life and love poured into it! What a magnificent achievement! A must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stained Glass,"I have a lot of complaints about Disney; what he made personally and the lumbering beast his studio has become.In particular, he murdered one of the most precious literary structures we have in Alice. But in his first big project, he did well enough to change the world. In its day, this was a rule- changer, the Star Wars of its day. Everything that happened afterward was different.Many people credit the characterizations, which Disney never did as well afterward, creating a vacuum for Pixar to fill. I admit that except for the ""swallow the soap"" trick, I liked that element.But I think there is something more fundamental at work.Movies are basically about visual notation. Its less about what the stories are than how they are told. One of the evolutions that I track is the business of outside awareness. But this, I think is something different, sort of in the opposite direction. We had comics before, where objects were not masses but boundaries. We had cartoons before, where large blobs of grey and then color defined shapes that we assigned identities to. But this has two things. They were revolutionary.The first is the narrative long form. It isn't complex; it has only one arc. We even know what the arc is and how it will end, the only mystery (for the original viewers) being in the cinematics of the thing. Disney would stumble later, on understanding the nature of long form storytelling but here he does what must have seemed impossible.The second is more visual. At the time, this seemed more natural and organic than anything that had gone before (except for the Prince  Disney always has trouble with men). We focus on the dwarfs, but the girl has mannerisms that are beyond anything we had seen before, the best being Betty Boop before the censors intervened.But there's something deeper, and to explain it, we need some history. Light is magical. Reflected light isn't very special, light like you see bouncing off a magazine page. The colors you see are dimmer than real world colors because of the strength of the light of course, but what you see is what is not absorbed. You see the leftovers. In stained glass, the light comes through, directly from the source. The colors you see are more vibrant. Ancient glassmasters formulated glass that the moderns do not, so if you have a chance to see one (like the Tree of Jesse in Chartres) you will see millions of facets in each color because of the way that the color was layered on in a ""flashing"" process, creating refractive crystal boundaries.These windows are a profound experience because of this scintillation effect that is subliminal. Like these old cartoons, the beings and objects are blobs of shimmering color with outlines that infer identity. Its a deep art that exists no where else, and not even since in stained glass.Now another fact. Snow is not white. Snow is a collection of ordered microcrystals that refract light in all colors. The combined effect adds to white, but as you move ever so slightly, you will be receiving millions of millions of flashes of pure color. And now a final fact. In 1952, when I saw this on a huge screen, the screen technology involved faceted grains of silica that had this snow-effect of micro-refraction. Today's screens use microspheres, tiny balls with smooth surfaces, so the effect is not the same. And obviously digital screens are another matter. They all preserve this ""transmitted light"" effect of stained glass, as do all films. (But the new mastering of the cartoon for DVD does increase the purity of the colors, emphasizing the stained glass semiotics.)I recently saw this on DVD, and was instantly reminded of the viewing 55 years ago, which washed over with a blizzard of snow scintillations with medieval weight, both in the story and the stained glass. I've never lost that thrill, and I wish it for you. This changed me and it changed film.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",,Anonymous,Animation
I prefer 'em with a tan,"Walt Disney's first full length feature, animated, and in color, is now regarded as a classic above criticism. Well, while it is a huge achievement, especially for 1937, it IS a little thin on story.Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsmen to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.Still a classic, but perhaps a little too quaint from a modern point-of-view.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

There she is rescued by the Seven Dwarfs. The Queen finds out that Snow White has survived and decides to curse her with her own poison apple.It is deserving of the label classic. The story is fun. I love the Dwarfs. I love the Queen. I wish Snow White could be less girly girl, but those were the times. For being a first, it does it with great charm. It is a credit to the movie world.

Still fair,"For all its historical importance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is not treated well by most Disney fans. It is tolerated, but not respected or loved. Common complaints fall upon the heroine being too passive, the music being too dated, too much padding, etc. No film is perfect, even great films, but my God, people are too harsh on this one.No other Disney film possesses the innocence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It has a freshness, an excitement to it. It's as though you could feel the animators' joy in every frame. There is no hip irony or cynicism on display, no need to be subversive or cool. The whole thing is a fairy tale played straight and with tons of heart. It isn't hard to see why weary Depression audiences so readily took it to their hearts and declared it ""the happiest thing since Armistice"".Snow White is not complex or super interesting as a character, but she has more of a personality than she is given credit for. She is also tougher than you'd think: she's a young teenage girl from an abusive home, yet she still believes she should keep a positive view of life and tries her best to stay optimistic through all her troubles. That's admirable. As for her warbling soprano, many will not favor it and yes, it is dated. However, don't be too harsh there. After all, I doubt the modern pop hit ""Let It Go"" in Frozen (2013) will gracefully age either.Of course, the dwarfs are all lovable and entertaining. The Queen/Witch is chilling, one of the finest Disney villains. The Prince... well, he's rather dull. Honestly, I don't get the criticism of Snow's supposed lack of personality; she has it all over her prince.The animation is still beautiful, even if there are a few awkward moments due to rotorscoping and experimentation. The muted color scheme is lovely, a great contrast to the exhausting bright colors which saturate modern animation (I mainly think of the garish Hercules (1997) or The Lorax (2012)). The backgrounds give one the impression of a children's storybook come to life.Overall, this is a great film and we are still feeling its influence (for better or worse, since American animation is rarely allowed to leave the Snow White model). Without a doubt, it deserves more respect from modern audiences.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Classic First Full-Length Animated Feature Film.,"This is the first full-length animated feature film from Walt Disney. As a kid, I had wanted to watch this movie in its entirety for the longest time, and didn't get a chance to see it until it was released on video, finally, in the 1990s.This film was better than I had expected, with catchy and sweet music (especially the Dwarf's Silly Song), memorable characters and beautiful sceneries and animation. This is what I think the best adaptation of this classical fairytale. Songs that you grew up with were probably introduced in this movie like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work.This story really portrays the gentleness, kind-heartiness, beauty and innocence of Snow White and the silliness, humor, yet selfless characteristics of the Seven Dwarfs. The movie also did a good job in portraying the mystery, eerie and horror surrounding the Evil Queen and her chamber full of black magic. The design for the Queen and the Magic Mirror is the best in any adaptation of this fairytale - animated or in real life.This is the perfect film to start off a long list of Disney's Full Length Animated Feature Films. When comparing this film and the more current ones, you can see how far these films have come and the difference in style.

Had there been an IMDb back in 1937, I surely would have scored this one a 10--no doubt about that. However, despite being one of my favorite and sweetest Disney films, I also have to admit that the film, though wonderful, does suffer a bit on two accounts. First, Snow White's voice and singing is hellishly awful. What was wonderful for 1937 is just cringe-worthy today. Second, the ending is very abrupt and lacks depth.

"HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO, It's Wonderful You Know","The Walt Disney Studios went a long way towards earning its nickname of The Magic Kingdom with the release of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. There will never be another version of the beloved Grimm Brothers fairy tale because you couldn't find all the elements that make this one work so well.I imagine that with today's computer generated graphics you could come up with a more realistic animation. But it would probably frighten the children and in all the wrong places. More than the wicked queen would be frightening folks.Snow White is a tale of imagination, something that lets the kids work their minds and really get into the characters. The voices selected so perfectly match the animated figures. And with the exception of Billy Gilbert they're not known players. Snow White is first and foremost a character driven story. Today the Disney Studio would probably take from their stable of TV and film personalities for voices, but the emphasis would be on the celebrities not the story. I don't think Disney Studios alone would be guilty of that however.Much as I like the simple story, the thing I love best about the film is the musical score that Frank Churchill and Larry Morey wrote. This is the Annie Get Your Gun of animated films, so many different and beloved hits come out of it. Even today you can hear people offhandedly humming 'Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho' and they might not realize where it's from, it's so ingrained in our consciousness, almost like Happy Birthday.A favorite song of mine is the operatic ballad One Song that the prince and Snow White both sing. I have a recording of it that Allan Jones did and it's a gem. It could have come out of a score by Sigmund Romberg or Rudolf Friml, it's that good.The movie DVD is still a hot seller, it's like White Christmas and the other Christmas songs that Bing Crosby did which still keep his name before the public every Yuletide season and keeps making money for his estate.

It should also be pointed out that, for all of the adorable animals and dwarfs, there are some genuinely spooky parts, too. Snow White fleeing through the shadowy forest is possibly my favorite scene of the whole movie. The Queen's ultimate fate is also quite dark. It's really a terrific film.

The Best Disney Move I've Seen,"I watched all the Disney movies that have remakes and their remakes with my little brother last year. We watched one movie almost every week. We watched dozens. Of all the many Disney movies we watched this one was the best! I hadn't seen it in decades. It was full of life, color, character, music, harmony, creativity, and humor. It draws you and and keeps you excited and it has beautiful animation and a great lesson to boot. So good! I look forward to the next time I watch this film, which, if I'm being honest, will likely be when I have kids of my own.I have a degree in fine art and a keen eye for beauty after visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City many times in the past twenty or so years. I especially appreciate Rennaisance art, which I view as the pinnacle of art in human history. I'm able to tell when something was produced well and with good values. As cartoons go, this one was certainly good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

it stars a witch other witches wanna be like,"Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters.Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house.The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White.Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple.It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I don't know, but I'm agin' 'em","A faithful retelling of the old Fairy tale.This was the first feature animated film. At a time when everyone else was certain that the hand-drawn format could only work for shorts, Walt Disney knew better. It's impressively self-assured. Sure, a lot of the sight gags and jokes are what you would find in the brief ones. And it does kind of show that there really is not a lot of plot here. Like, if this had not been picked to be made into a one hour 22 minute length, and they purely focused on story, this could have been trimmed down to a mere fourth of that. But the different scenes manage to evoke different moods and all get something across, sometimes just introducing new characters, a dynamic we haven't seen already in it, or developing those. It doesn't feel stitched together, or like it is just trying to run out the clock.Is it silly to signal to the audience that Snow White is good by showing her positively interacting with woodland critters, and that the Queen is evil, because even rats and ravens flee or? Definitely. Does it still work, to endear us to the former and render the latter horrifying? Absolutely! Some of the moral messages that it communicates are now regressive by today's standards. You will definitely want to talk to your kids after showing them this so they don't take those to heart.I recommend this to fans of folk tales. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some Day My Prince Will Come,"Another wonderful ""damsel in distress"" film animation from Disney! This movie is right up there with Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I still love this movie after all these years.The seven dwarfs are cute, comical and each of them as cuddly as a teddy bear - including Grumpy! Without the comic relief of the dwarven the movie would be a good drama.Snow White has all the inner and outer beauty that a person could hope for. She's cheerful, helpful, charming, polite, friendly and fun. Quite a nice character.Queen Grimhilde is the picture of all vanity. She wants to be the only beautiful woman in the kingdom. She is quite beautiful on the outside but she lacks the inner beauty that Snow White has which makes her more angry and jealous at Snow.Prince Florian is a dashing and daring guy who has his eyes on the beautiful Snow White. Prince Florian is another ""Prince Charming"" and our hero of the film.Yes this is a great Walt Disney classic that should be seen if only once in you lifetime.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't expect too much,"I might start considering Enchanted a direct parody of this instead of just ""Disney princesses"" in general.Not quite sure how comfortable I would be dunking on this though, because story and character wise, it really hasn't aged that well...but it is also the first animated feature film ever made, you know?It's directed fine, the voice acting is fine, the dwarfs are kind of funny, the animation is still really great (even if Snow White can't keep her eyes open for whatever reason), the characters are all one-note as hell, yes Snow White is an utter dunce for eating the apple, the songs are all pretty bad (except the dwarfs' hi-ho, I like that one), and the animals are all adorable to no end.In short, it's probably exactly what you'd expect from the first ever animated feature film. I understand they couldn't really do anything too complicated, because even this was a huge risk back then, so I'll cut it some slack, but I don't think I'll be remembering it as anything other than a really important milestone in animation.Also I swear to god the dwarf with a stutter nearly told the others to ""search every crooked fanny"" instead of ""nook and cranny"" and I wheezed",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent beginning!,"The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are ""I'm Wishing,"" ""Whistle While You Work,"" ""Hi Ho,"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come.""A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are some scary scenes in this when those kids know when the evil queen turned into the evil witch and Snow White running in the forests. The songs are really good, the chase between the seven dwarfs and the evil witch is phenomenal where she fall to her death, the ending makes audience's cry because Snow White died by eating the poison apple by the evil witch and the prince bringing Snow White back to life by kissing her.

Longing for the Days of Hand-Drawn Animation,"Watching this first feature length Disney film is a reminder that today's slick computer-generated Pixar movies come at the expense of hand-drawn artistry. ""Snow White"" is horribly dated in some ways, especially apparent whenever Snow White herself breaks into that piercing, warbly soprano to sing some very familiar songs, but there are moments in this film that will take your breath away with their sheer beauty of animation. I especially liked the wicked queen, who's really scary, and not a jokey villain like those of Disney's more modern animated films. O.k. so a single attractive female shacking up with seven smitten men would make many an eyebrow raise today, but get your minds out of the gutter, people.I can accept that technology changes, and today's animation offers many treats in its own right, but that doesn't mean I don't lament an art that has become by and large obsolete.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great classic,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is and will remain one of the quintessential classic films. This story is probably so famous due to the success of this film that it will never stop being seen. Obviously for future generations it may seem strange as a story but we must bear in mind that this film dates back to 1937 and that in those times there were different ideals. In any case this film is revolutionary with additions by the great genius Walt Disney that make the film very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The Seven Dwarfs are the cutest thing you'll see today and what's not to love about Dopey. It's not a crazy movie but still in my opinion it's worth seeing if you get the time.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Walt Disney is Genius!,"It was in 1933 Walt's mind began to picture a film that would revolutionize the industry of Hollywood forever. With a cost of over one million dollars and more then three years of production he could not afford a flop. Critics predicted the worst for Walt's film. Though it was impressive from the animators prospective no one else knew what to expect. On December of 1937 the world finally saw the masterpiece. People laughed and cried and were excited and were frightened. Walt received more money then he had ever dreamed of having. Today the film has earned more then $1 Billion! Though today we may look at it with a feeling... this film isn't that ahead of it's time. I saw one comment here saying that when Dumbo and Bambi were released it was much better quality.

LIKE THE FILM -- THE DVD BECOMES A LANDMARK!,"There are certain motion pictures that must be recognized as ""Landmarks"" -- films that made such an impact on the public and on future film makers as to make them ""Landmarks"".

And now many of these classics are being given excellent DVD releases. Just as Disney's SNOW WHITE was a ""Landmark"" in 1937, being the first feature-length animated film, now, the 2001 DVD Platinum Editon (two Discs) release of SNOW WHITE is likely to be considered a ""Landmark"" in the field of DVD's! The feature itself has never looked and sounded any better then seen here -- it's state of the art! And the EXTRAS (and the access to them) are absolutely amazing!

There is a lot to admire about this film,"So this is the groundbreaking first feature length animated film - a film of which Sergei Eisenstein said it was the best ever, whose first screening was greeted with rapturous applause, and whose cultural influence endures to this day. Of course as someone interested in movie history I had to watch it. In fact, I found a lot to admire about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". The animation is well done: Everything is moving fluidly, and it is evident that every single scene was designed with meticulous care. Human characters (Snow White, the prince and the queen) move naturally, whereas the dwarfs and many of the animals are comically bumbling. The colours are beautiful, and there are some charming ideas (the cuckoo's clock that contains a frog, for example). But still: the film is far from perfect, even by the standards of the 1930s. The plot is more than thin and drags in many places (for example, the dwarfs take ages to discover Snow White sleeping). Moreover, Disney needlessly cutified it: Snow White is not supposed to clean and tidy the house (let alone with the help of assorted animals), but rather to eat and drink of the food left by the dwarfs and to leave the room in a mess. But of course, a woman's role was cleaning, if not in the Grimms' early 19th-century Germany, then in the mind of Walt Disney. And finally: I simply dislike Disney's style of drawing. I dislike it intensely. That is of course no more than a personal antipathy, and I realise that someone brought up on this kind of material probably feels differently. Still, I could not watch the film with more than a kind of detached interest. On balance, 6 stars feels about right.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Impressively Animated,"Snow White was Disney's first feature-length cartoon, and it's clear he wanted something that would wow audiences. The animation is ambitious and wonderfully detailed. Of particular note is the scene of Snow White running through the forest and the scenes involving the forest animals. Those forest animals are the single most impressive thing in the movie, flowing and swirling like leaves in the air, almost constantly in motion yet never unpleasantly chaotic.At the same time, these scenes have been so well parodied in other movies that at times they seem a bit absurd. Even before the parodies, there is something over the top about the dainty, domestic princess with a way with animals.For me, the movie lost a little momentum with the entry of the dwarfs, whose broad humor interested me less than the more serious earlier animation. This is not to say that the dwarfs weren't funny, in that mild, Disney way (both now and as a child I preferred the sharp, sarcastic style of Warner Brothers cartoons to the genial Disney style), but the focus on comedy meant less of a focus on pure artistry.The movie is also very much of its time. Snow White is the small-town girl ideal, a sweet and trusting princess who wanders into an empty house and immediately starts cleaning it. She has the girlish voice of Betty Boop without the attitude, and I found her a bit bland (although less so than Sleeping Beauty, many years later.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie with moments of greatness.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
As timeless as it is wonderful.,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a Walt Disney production based on Snow White by The Brothers Grimm. The rest, as they say, is history. Famously said to be Disney's folly prior to release, Snow White has gone on to be one of the company's biggest earners; few, if anyone, can deny it's not the most deserving from Disney's back catalogue of being released every once in a while on different home formats. Very much a landmark movie for being the first full length animated feature, it also deserves its accolades for the high artistic quality that seeps from every frame. The advancements from Steamboat Willie ten years earlier are nothing short of incredible, the richness of the animation is a joy to behold, as the woodland creatures dart about with purpose, or the way the terror comes to life as Snow White runs thru the forest, the depth and clarity dazzles the eyes. Then of course there's the songs, most of which have formed part of pop culture ever since they were first heard. ""Whistle While You work,"" ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" each one a standard uplifter on a dreary day.That the film is accessible to all ages obviously helped it gain universal appeal. Yes, very young kids are quite easily spooked by the darker moments that lay within, but around the corner is a treat, most notably in the form of 7 little dwarfs, each one with an identity and character that the young and old can fully embrace. One of the finest quotes I can remember about the dwarfs came from Charlie Chaplin, who straight out insisted that Dopey was ""one of the greatest comedians of all time"", and he's right of course. True enough it has some minor rough edges that time has inflicted upon it. Snow White is voiced by Adriana Caselotti, her voice is very 30s, very shrill and much too childlike for a character meant to be a young woman. Whilst she's not exactly painted in a good light, bit of an air-head is our Snow White, but to do down the film for its social portrayal of women in the late 30s would be churlish in the extreme!Pixar, presently, keeps raising the bar, as computer-perfection-animation thrills the modern day crowd. But make no bones about it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still the benchmark animation movie. As technical advancements ensure we are wowed by this particular art form, Disneys folly watches over proceedings as the rightful lord of the manor. Masterpiece 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The One That Started it All ...,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is the triumph of guts, imagination and talent, an outstanding mixture that only a visionary genius like Walt Disney could have concocted. He was told it was a folly that would bankrupt his company, no one would endure bright colors and little creatures fooling around on a big screen for more than an hour but since when do geniuses listen?""It all started with a mouse"" loved to remind Walt Disney, as an encouragement for people to believe in their dreams and never underestimate the magical value of the smallest creations. The road for success is paved from these little ideas, visions and intuitions  even the iconic Mickey Mouse would have been named Mortimer if it wasn't for a precious advice from Disney's wife. And starting with his iconic mascot, Walt Disney established a real laboratory on the field of animation. It was the famous 'Silly Symphonies' era that brought up to screen so many enchanting cartoons, featuring animals, trees, flowers and music in the purest tradition of European storytelling. When you compare ""Flowers and Trees"", first animated cartoon in colors made in 1932, with the unforgettable ""Band Concert"", made three years later, you realize how impressive the progresses were but when you see ""The Old Mill"", 1937 classic masterpiece of realism, you immediately get the feeling of a crucial step finally reached, and asking for something more adult, more revolutionaryMickey Mouse and the 'Silly Symphonies' contributed to the success of the Walt Disney company but what Disney needed was a flourishing empire, a bigger project that probably started with an innocent 'what if' question. Making an animated feature  think about it, in term of works, it's probably equivalent of making ten or twelve animated films with the same level of artistry as ""The Old Mill"" with the whole gallery of emotions we would expect from a film: thrills, laughs, passion, endearing characters and memorable songs. I make it sound like a 'business plan', but we're talking of the then highest grossing film of all time on which the whole existence of the Disney Company was jeopardized. If only for that, ""Snow White"" deserves all the praises for having been one of the most groundbreaking creations, on the same sensational level as ""Star Wars"", 40 years later.And Disney couldn't have thought of a better story to begin with. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is in total aesthetic harmony with the 'Silly Symphonies' (the setting, the presence of animals) and the drawing, especially of the dwarfs as cartoon characters, was the final step of what was developed during a whole decade by the Disney studios, inspired from the old classic European drawings that always had a sort of cartoon feel. ""Snow White"" stylish simplicity makes it appealing on a universal and timeless level. It can look old but never dated, and Disney proved his international ambitions by allowing the foreign animation studios to adapt the frameworks to their own language. Disney meant businessAnd the result is a triumph of both storytelling and perfectionism, Disney didn't think animation and made it into a film, he thought of a realistic film first, hence encouraged his staff to use classic designs to draw the face of Snow White, the Prince, and the Evil Queen, they might look very basic compared to Disney's following works but they're human enough to suspend the disbelief that we're watching a cartoon, an important element in order to catch the interest of the adults and awakes their inner child. And the film respected the viewer's comfort so much that the use of relief, perspective, zooming and lights and shadows was made in a constant attention to the smallest realistic details, and on that level, the making-of of ""Snow White"" is an inspirational encouragement for work and perfectionism, with dreams fulfillment as the pay-off.Another interesting aspect relies on the character of Snow White herself, so unfairly mentioned as one of the least interesting Disney heroines, when her main interest was to be a foil for the dwarfs and the villain. The dwarfs prove how intuitive Disney was for his first film, as they allowed to provide a set of seven different personalities with an almost three-dimensional value, this is the fantastic trick of the film, try to watch the other versions of Snow White, and you'll see how cruelly lacking a personality the dwarfs are. It's almost impossible to think of them without visualizing Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy and Bashful. And Snow White is the central of that universe, like the emotional core of the film that justifies the dwarfs' comicality, the Prince's passion and the Queen's evilness, another aspect of the film that provides it a timeless feel. The Evil Queen embodies the combination of beauty and vanity, she's so cold, she looks like a modern woman with an undeniable sex-appeal, and if one thing, she's the very proof of the Disney Golden Rule, there's no good Disney film without a great villain.And thanks to a final and successful pacing, the rest is history and like every classic masterpiece, each scene of ""Snow White"" is a classic on its own, the forest with eyes, the dwarfs coming from home, the Queen's haunting metamorphosis, so many songs forever engraved in our memories, ""Whistle While you work"", ""Heigh-Ho"", ""Someday my Prince Will Come"" the party and a finale that would make all the people, kids or adults, in the world cry and laugh, and finally cheer  discovering the Disney effect, that for each laugh, there would be a tear, a feeling that would last for many decades over and over again.Thank you, Mr. Disney for your contribution to the world of animation, film-making and entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best animated feature films ever made,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is what i consider to be the most inportant animated feature film ever made, why? Because it's the first one ever made, and that's why it's historically important, but importance aside, this is a really good movie, in fact, it's a masterpiece, Disney's Golden Age movies in general were amazing with some even masterpieces, such as Bambi, Pinocchio, Fantasia, etc. And this is no exception.One of the many things that make Snow White so great is it's animation, it's truly beautiful, the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking, everything is just so meticulously drawn, the musical score is really good as well, it manages to capture the tension, lightheartedness of some scenes, as well as the fairy tale feeling. The songs are pretty amazing too, they're really memorable, some are pretty catchy, some are beautiful to listen to.In terms of the characters, they're pretty entertaining too, i admit that i wasn't too crazy about Snow White herself but boy, do i love the dwarfs, each of them have their own personalities that make then distinct, and they're also pretty funny, especially dopey, they will really make you laugh, and i absolutely loved it every time they were on screen, and the queen herself is very intimidating, she doesn't really come off as a generic villain, her serious facial expressions and the ominous music that plays when she's on-screen really make her somewhat intimidating.In conclusion, Snow White is pretty much a masterpiece, it started both the disney animated canon and animated feature films on a very high note.

I just didn't fall in love with this one.,"I have recently watched this film and man did it disappoint me. When I read this fairy tale of the same name for the first time it was excellent and interesting and best of all it was straight to the point, but when Disney adapted the fairy tale into a film it became repetitive and slow plot-wise. This film was basically a bunch of dancing and cleaning, and not too focused on the story telling element. The worst part of this film is that the story takes painfully long to progress and this personality gives me a immense headache, to the point where I consider turning of the film. The animation was good in my opinion and the movie was not bad to look at, and the villain was pretty cool, but I would not really recommend this movie to anyone.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oh to go back in time.,"It goes without saying that we have come a long way technically when it comes to animated feature films,but the thing I appreciate about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the fact that prior to it's 1937 release,audiences had seen nothing like it.If time travel were possible,I would go back and sit amongst that first lucky audience that was fortunate enough to see this.It would have made it that much more enjoyable.Kids today are spoiled by technical advances,so the animation most likely won't impress them,but they will be drawn in by it's story alone.I have a 6 year old daughter who loves this film,and even though Walt has been gone from this earth for a long time now,he is somewhere smiling at the fact that after 70 plus years,Snow White is still making kids of all ages smile.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Snow White CSUN Review,"Snow White is one of the most iconic Disney films and is considered the first animated feature film. I have never seen Snow White in its entirety, but I understood what happened in it. While watching it, I found myself getting a little bored especially when Snow White meets the dwarfs. It felt like one long sequence and I started to become very disinterested in the story. For me, the dwarfs were probably my favorite part of the whole story. What I like is that they all have different personalities, so it was entertaining to watch them all interact with one another. However, they started to become less entertaining during that long sequence between them and Snow White. If they were to add other elements to the story, it would be nice to sprinkle them throughout the story. Another character I enjoyed was the Evil Queen. I like Disney villians and they are all unique in their own way. She, along with the dwarfs, are the most entertaining in the film. Like I mentioned with the dwarfs, they started to get less entertaining. With the Queen, she was sprinkled throughout the story so there was a right balance with her character. In today's world, a film like this would not be tolerable given the message. The message of a woman relying on a man to save her life is a narrative that would be viewed as negative today. Overall, the music and the dwarfs were the only thing that kept me invested.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still holds up today and is a absolute joy to watch. A fairytale told in animation, color and stunning music. I finally got around to actually watching Disney's first feature animation film and it didn't disappoint.First of the art is incredible, the matte paintings are mesmerizing and if there's a move you need to see twice it's this. Especially when more characters come on screen there's just so much going on, so much liveliness. There's something else you might notice. Considering the craft of all the hand drawn animation it's an art that goes by too fast for just 1 viewing, so I'm definitely looking to rewatch it.I could write about animation, but we know. It's perfect. Just a thing I want to note down besides the excellent animation are a few aspects, like the timing of the animation to the music, the way all the movement flows with the beats of a certain song. It's so meticulous. Besides that, I love the little ''extras'' that Disney does that make certain things just that extra cute or funny. Like the bunny peaking around the corner after being scared, but then a second later also squirrel popping out between his ears. So many fun little moments.Besides that though the music is what ties everything together and has to be my favorite aspect of the film. It synergizes all so well together and they are so fun, so joyful. But sentimental when needed. Everytime it kicks in I get goosebumps. Because it just becomes just a experience. Imagine seeing this movie in 1937, you'd be blown away.The story. Mostly its good enough. But it does make some choices that make the ending feel rushed and underwhelming. We get a fairly thick mid section but the movie ends quick. And especially the prince is underdeveloped. Which makes the kiss have much less impact. Also the sudden switch to some text slides felt like budget was becoming an issue (I think this was the case, or I'm misremembering) So therefore it's not perfect. But it's so close. I can't wait to continue my Disney journey through the years, the good and bad. It's about time.Must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

But I just really love all those Disney Princesses as a kid.Snow White is literally the first Disney full-length animated movie ever. Really amazing it's done in 1937.The most memorable thing about Snow White for me is her really high-pitched, operatic voice. I tried singing like her as a kid but ended up sounding like a hurt bird.Snow White isn't exactly my favorite Disney Princess or Disney movie, but I place it on top-tier list because it holds a special place in my heart, and it is also historically significant.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Awful,"I haven't seen this movie in probably 30 years, and I vaguely remember liking it as a child; but it's really bad. I apologize to whoever voiced Snow White but her voice is awful, and her singing is like nails on a chalkboard. Snow White's dialog sounds like it was written (and voiced, actually) by a two year old, and it seems like most of it rhymes, which is odd. She honestly sounds like she's on drugs or something; sing-songy, vapid, weird inflections, really off-putting. The dwarves dialog and voices aren't as bad, although a lot of it is also silly. I know it's supposed to be for kids but it waffles between ridiculously juvenile and really, really dark. It just didn't stand the test of time.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Original always is and will be the best,"I feel like i'm on a classic movie marathon doing all these reviews of old and classical movies. There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" 1937 version, Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams. The movie that made possibility of the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.Along, with a splendid cast of voice actors/ actresses headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure magic,"Snow White is considered to be one of the greatest masterpieces of all time for a very good reason. Not only was it innovative and very unique for its time, it is also very thrilling, funny and spellbinding.Since this is a Disney movie, it goes without saying that the animation was absolutely gorgeous. It contains very fluid animation on top of very detailed backgrounds. It is also very atmospheric, with the mood changing from scary to happy and joyful a few times.The songs were very wonderful and catchy. The actress who voiced Snow White had a very nice and unique voice. I also thought Hi Ho and the other song the dwarfs sing were very fun and ridiculously catchy. And of course it also had a very beautiful score.Although there were some things keeping it from a perfect ten. The character of Snow White can at times be irritating in her flawlessness and purity. It felt like the prince was tacked on last minute as a deus ex machina. It seems with most Disney films at the time, the only enjoyable characters are the side characters and the villain. This movie is mostly loved because of the dwarfs. And who couldn't love those guys? They were hilarious. And the Queen was, of course, very menacing and scary.It could also be argued that the movie had a lot of filler. Almost all Disney movies were full of filler in Walt's time. But most people don't really care, probably because of how entertaining the filler usually is.This movie is definitely recommended to all animation fans, and those of us who are still children inside.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hohiho, it's off to work we go!","This Disney movie reminds me of the times being a boy, simply impressed by those colourful characters and the music.

Funny how the 1st has always everything right (screen) (dad),"I saw it on screen long ago for Christmas 1983 and my actual watching is still enjoyable: unlike standardized, digitalized, stupid actual comedies about trash talking animals, this first animation has understood what audience wishes: a fairy tale, a story for all ages with an amazing artistic talent behind... Here there is no graphic violence, no bad character to attack, just the need for hard work, the comfort of a cozy home, the help from friends and love above anything! The art is simply stunning and today productions look paradoxically cheap! I wish I had kids to offer them this eternal craftwork of the best talent in humanity!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937,"'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' never fails to impress when I rewatch it, the animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937.Admittedly, it doesn't all hold up to an outstanding degree nowadays. The dwarfs still look fantastic, but Snow White herself and the world itself don't quite look exquisite; Snow White is rather dull, especially her facial expressions. I still have massive respect for those who created this though, obviously.The voice cast, as was usual in the early decades of Disney, are a little forgettable. Adriana Caselotti (White) and Lucille La Verne (Queen) do fine jobs, though it's Pinto Colvig who is most memorable as Grumpy.The premise is a pretty light too, with the main saviour hardly featuring and the antagonist disappearing for relatively large portions. Nonetheless, it's a great film to watch with family as Disney's first production is good fun - the music plays a huge part in that regard.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful angelic voice,"Adriana Caselotti's voice was so amazing in the movie! I can't get enough of it and it's so angelic when she sings ""Someday, My Prince Will Come"" to the dwarves. And the finale with the chorus is so powerful mixed with the castle in the sky at the end of the movie that represents Heaven! I definitely recommend this amazing 1st Disney movie because Adriana Caselotti is amazing as both the speaking and singing voice of Snow White.I even heard that there was a standing ovation after the movie was finished when it was made--read it in trivia! Adriana Caselotti, may God rest her soul! Legendary!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The first feature-length cartoon,"The first feature-length animated film that laid the foundation stone for Disney company and the genre itself. If this movie failed Disney company probably would never get off the ground and dozens of masterpieces would never see light of day. It is questionable if we would even have this genre today. The success of this movie encouraged other companies to take this path and enrich childhoods of many generations.The movie was made in four years, two million $ was spent, and it made a profit of around 200 million and won a bunch of awards. A masterpiece of art that laid the foundation of a new genre, resisted the test of time and to this day it keeps its place at the top of best movies of all times. Despite the progress of technology, even after 80 years, few cartoons reached this level. These days cartoons are not made by hand and the production process is much faster and easier, but movies are mostly tragically bad. That's sad. By today's standards I would give it 8/10, but considering that it was handmade 80 years ago and influence it has on everything that came after, even 10/10 is not enough.And of course, we must not forget fantastic songs led by ""Heigh-Ho"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute classic to this day.,"When it comes to Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, known as the very first animated motion picture, only one word to describe it, CLASSIC! This film alone is the reason why animation is so strong and how Walt Disney became a king in the full-length animation industry. Certainly a lot better than the CG biz that we're seeing today. This film has got everything that we could hope for, a golden story, fantastic animation, & great characters, also there are a combination of emotions felt throughout the film, charm for Snow White and the Dwarfs, but at certain moments, that charm is outweighed by the horror elements from who might be the best Disney Villain to date. All in all, this film can either make u cry, laugh hysterically, or, like I was when I was little, make u jump off of your pants when u see the Witch, but either way, this piece of history is something that we all should see at anytime of our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Washing Song,"So I am a really good fan of OLD Disney movies and I really like to sit down and just watch them. So a couple of months ago, I guess, I was watching Snow White and I noticed that when the Seven Dwarfs go to wash their hands, before ""gooseberry pie"", Doc never once gets his hands wet, or his face wet. He just stands there and tells the other six Dwarfs what to do. I thought it was interesting and amusing that when Disney made Snow White they left that in there, as a small detail, unnoticeable to someone not paying good attention. I'm going to watch it again and look for some other things like this!<33 -Beck",,Anonymous,Animation
Despite its age still very good,"I don't know if I can say anything bad about this wonderful animation. Disney's first long animation still stands after 74 years. Although in my opinion not the best (I would give that honor to Aristocats)it's still among the top Disney movies. Considering this movie is from 1937 it's graphics have by no means become old. Although the story is simple, it does make up for that because of its entertaining characters. Thanks to Disney each of the dwarfs got a name and personality, something that was lacking in all the Snow White stories I have read in fairy tale books. The songs are unforgettable especially the hey ho song when the dwarfs go back home. As a kid I found the witch very scary and think she is the scariest of all the Disney villains. Snow White never gets old as I still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it at 6 years old in theater. I would give it a 10 if it wasn't for the story to be that simple.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney hit the ground running.,"Disney's first feature-length animated film is unmistakably ground-breaking. Though it isn't the oldest surviving animated feature (that honour goes to 'The Adventures Of Prince Achmed (1926)'), it's probably the most accessible; it's basically what you expect from a 'Disney' classic, which proves that they hit the ground running. 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937)' is a Technicolor musical, based on a story by the Brothers Grimm, about a young princess who's forced to flee for her life when her vain step-mother orders her death. It's a technical marvel, with iconic imagery and complex animation, but it isn't the most compelling of affairs. Its plot is very light and its music numbers, save one or two, aren't really all that memorable. Still, the picture is enjoyable during its set-pieces and its pacing is about as tight as it could be. It certainly isn't the least engaging film in Disney's catalogue, though it isn't close to the most, either. In general, it's a surprisingly solid experience. Considering that it's over eighty years old, it's pretty darn good. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
First one is the best,"The simplicity and making quality is the speciality of the first full length Disney animated movie. The innocence and kindness of the snow white, lazy and carefree life of dwarfs and a selfish villain all told in fascinating manner. A basic story with minimal character development, I think the only developed character is grumpy, but the film covers all it's negative aspects and still feels like a real fairy tale movie. Film music is still enjoyable. It's one of the most profitable movies in the history and a iconic one. Still enjoyable and doesn't feel like a 1937 movie, so It's a timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A groundbreaking classic with enduring charm,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" released by Disney in 1937, is a groundbreaking animated film that set the standard for future animations. As the first-ever full-length animated feature, it tells the story of Snow White, a princess who flees from her wicked stepmother and finds refuge with seven lovable dwarfs.The animation, especially for its time, is remarkable. The film's hand-drawn artistry brings the enchanting forest and the whimsical dwarfs to life in vivid detail. The character of Snow White, with her kind heart and gentle nature, is endearing, while the dwarfs-each with their own distinct personality-add humor and warmth to the story.The music is another highlight, with memorable songs like ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" that continue to resonate with audiences. The film's blend of lighthearted moments and darker themes creates a compelling narrative that appeals to both children and adults.While ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" may show its age in some aspects, its pioneering spirit and timeless charm ensure it remains a beloved classic in the annals of animation history.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sweetly unassuming, like our heroine","Young princess, the target of envy and malice from her evil stepmother, runs for her life after the queen orders her death, taking refuge in a cottage owned by seven messy little men. The cornerstone of Walt Disney's empire, the first full-length animated feature in Technicolor (though not the first full-length animated feature--that honor would go to Argentina's ""Peludopolis"" from director Quirino Cristiani in 1931, following the director's now-lost ""El Apóstol"" from 1917). Pre-World War II sweetness enchanted audiences of all nationalities, though it creaks a bit today. Mute dwarf Dopey gets most of the big laughs, while the best song numbers are ""Whistle While You Work"" and ""The Silly Song"".

After all, it's a simple story and Snow White is hardly an exciting character, her presence is rather forgettable and most of her songs quite dull.However, there are many memorable parts here that justify its success.The first epic moment comes when Snow White finds out that the Queen wants to kill her, so she tries to escape by running in the forest where things aren't exactly what they look, a scene reminiscent of German expressionism.The dwarfs add a nice comedic touch, the interactions among them provide lots of fun, Grumpy being the one that stands out. Returning home and trying to deal with the intruder is a great example, bath time is another one.And of course the queen, a villain for the ages, she stars in the most iconic scenes. Her transformation to an old witch, the final showdown with the dwarfs, the preparation of the poison, giving the apple to Snow White, her exchanges with the mirror.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

"One of my favorites, maybe Disney's all time best. It proves that beauty defeats the wicked. Heigh-Ho!","From having watched this classic as a kid and to just recently viewing it, I must say that this picture is a timeless classic. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is an excellent moral tale of good against evil, it's a historical film as it was Disney's first full feature animated tale and it's paced along perfect with songs and uplifting scores. This film could be classified as a musical too.Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and ""Heigh-Ho"" while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked. And the animation work was among Disney's earliest this is a highly memorable classic to be enjoyed with a loved one. So ""Heigh-Ho"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Charming Disney masterpiece which is very romantic,"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, in my opinion, is a charming Disney masterpiece which is very romantic. If you ask me, the queen (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. Still, she was very attractive. On the other hand, Snow White (voice of Adriana Caselotti) was very beautiful. In addition, as the magic mirror said, nothing could hide her beauty. Also, she could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Snow White was the best. This would probably be because she did most of the singing. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this charming Disney masterpiece which is very romantic to all of you who haven't seen it.

OK I realize she was like around 15-16 years old, but I mean even women in their 20's and 30's can be this way. I understand we all lose some innocence along the way because that's a part of life.

"""A fine bunch of washers you lot turned out to be!""","I feel ashamed that I only watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order so that my hard, cynical heart could launch itself into an anti-Disney rant. The most sentimental of the major cartoon studios, I was determined to ravage this one after seeing isolated, treacly clips.Yet seen all together I have to admit that I was softened by a talented picture that is genuinely charming. The somewhat dated animation resembles cut outs from a picture book with its pastel hues, and looks and feels more natural than the angular, jerky computerised movement of the modern Disney features. It helps that they also employ someone who can actually sing in the titular role, with an operatic blend to the proceedings. And it would take the coldest of people not to warm to Snow White's genuine innocence. I concede, I did wince a little at the cutesy blue birds, but this is vastly more charming than I had been led to expect.It's pacy, too: whereas some of the older Disney films tend to drag (I remember catching the aptly named Sleeping Beauty one Sunday afternoon), this one is suitably brisk in its portrayal of events. And while modern cartoons (or ""Animated Features"" as they pompously like to be known) blow up the role of the ""director"", this one really has its eye on cinematic technique. Just look at the early wishing well scene, shot from the perspective of the well bottom or the blend of images and dissolves when Snow White's in the forest.Many of the songs are classics, of course. Whistle While You Work is still something you can find yourself humming or whistling while doing the hoovering, The greatest contention for me though was the seven dwarves, who always struck me as far too self-consciously cutesy and grating to really like. Yet, come on  It's Off To Work We Go is a belter, isn't it?The actual plot, which is largely sidestepped to make way for the leisurely song sequences, is more than a little macabre. Even when Snow White's heart (her severed heart!) is substituted; it's replaced with a pig's heart... and all for a family audience. I'm not saying this one is morbid, but they deem Snow White (Or Snow, if we may call her that) so ""beautiful, even in death"" that they refuse to bury her and place her in a transparent coffin. In a parallel universe somewhere there's an offshoot of this movie where the Prince arrives too late and her rapidly decaying corpse turns into a flesh-eating zombie. Maybe they should do that as one of their special straight-to-video sequels  after all, they're grave robberies, aren't they?It's a slightly strange plot, too, with Snow White spending the duration being plotted against by a bitter old Queen. And people say Elton John didn't get involved with Disney until The Lion King. Yet in order to elicit Snow White's trust she transforms herself into a scary-looking old hag? Why not just stay in her own image? And if she can transform her appearance like that, then why not use the same magic to make herself the sought-after ""fairest of them all""? Yet I guess if she didn't then we wouldn't have a story, and the apple ofference does have some religious connotations. This is a one-note plot, though, and subtext isn't the order of the day. Rather, it's the colour and flavouring of the piece that are there to be enjoyed, not the somewhat redundant narrative. And while, after the initial thrust, the film does lose momentum slightly, enjoy it I did, a delightful and wonderfully made cartoon. Yes, you can read into the white = good/black evil assertions, but for me I'd rather marvel at the songs and images, or make cheap jokes about MOR pianists.Just two minor points: why are they called ""Dwarfs"" and not Dwarves in the film's title? And seven dwarves working in a mine? Is that an example of positive discrimination?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Animated Film of All Time,"This is a simple story of friendship and courage brought beautifully to life by the master of animation, Walt Disney. It follows the story of a young girl who doesn't know that she's the fairest one of all. But the evil Queen does know this and will stop at nothing to rid the world of her beauty. Even if it means losing the Queen's own beauty.The Queen sends someone to kill Snow White, but the man who has to fulfill the dirty deed cannot go through with it and sets Snow White free into the forest. She stumbles upon a vacant cottage in the heart of the wilderness. She naps there and is awakened by what she describes as little men.These men learn to love Snow White as a friend and they live together in peace until the Queen learns that the beautiful girl is still alive and must destroy Snow White herself.Even today that storyline is a little complex for most children. Yet everyone who sees it seems to love it and cherish it in their heart. It was the first of its kind and who knew that it would also end up being the best? This put Disney on the map as a major studio and also paved the way for the animated feature film.It's definitely something you can't pass up and something you must show to your own children while they are young. I know they'll enjoy it as much as we all did when we were younger and I know they'll keep a special place in their heart for it because it's not only the best animated film, but also one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Snow White and the Seven Hundred Questions I Have About These Dwarves...,"Furthering my haphazard progress through the AFI top 100 inspired me to take a look at this one again in... Well over a decade, maybe two. It's weird because I obviously remember the broad strokes of this movie but I definitely forgot a lot of the details and little story notes. I find myself experiencing some real Orwellian doublethink now that I watch this. From a storytelling standpoint... This is not good. Yes, there are some dark moments that were surprising but the actual story here is pretty minimal. The evil queen wants to kill the pretty princess, the princess escapes and then just randomly becomes the house guest of these odd little dudes and teaches them to all stop living like pigs, and then she falls for the MOST OBVIOUS EVIL APPLE EVER. Prince eventually shows up, kisses her, and then just... Done? How is that true love? The princess is so young... Are the dwarves all crotchety old men or are they wee youngins with flowing beards? Regardless why is she just breaking into someone's house and messing with stuff? The animation on Snow White feels... Weird and not quite right. It feels so much like a proto-story that acts as the building block for something else but on its own...But that's where the doublethink sinks in. On the surface, just watching the movie and thinking of nothing else, I'm underwhelmed. But when I start thinking of everything this did for cinema, for animation? Snow White really was the foundation that Disney has built itself on. It changed the game with Snow White and by doing that gave birth to one of, if not the, largest and most successful studios to date. How does that stack up? How exactly do you properly weigh the significance of a film that spawned so much even if it's not necessarily amazing on its own? I often make the argument that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie because the whole franchise owes itself to Stark and Snow White is the exact same thing, I just don't feel that same connection to the material here.I really have to put this on that list of films that are fun to watch for historical purposes, for the cinephiles out there, for the impact is has on cinema but I don't actually enjoy it all that much. In that way, I put it in the same realm as Citizen Kane. The realm of films that, intellectually I am glad to have seen but I have no resonance with them, they don't linger with me as anything other than strictly academic achievement. With that in mind, if you're interested in checking out a formative piece of film history? This is obviously available on Disney+, making it pretty easy to find and check out. If you're looking for entertainment or a story though, I'd really recommend one of the myriad other Disney animated films that owe thanks to Sleeping Beauty but also surpass it in a number of ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The First Cel-drawn Animated Feature Film Cartoon; the One That Established the Disney Empire,"Walt Disney took an educated gamble that proved to be one of the biggest success stories in cinematic history. If he had failed, there would not be any Disney Studios, no Disneyland, and possibly no animated feature films. His release of December 1937's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was met with a great deal of skepticism just before its premier. In development for three years, the lead-up to the world's first cel-animated feature cartoon was derided by the press as ""Disney's Folly."" Even Lillian, Disney's wife, coldly told him ""No one's ever gonna pay a dime to see a dwarf picture.""The stress Walt Disney went through during those three years was immense. His brother Roy and Lillian had many extensive conversations with him to dissuade the studio owner from his ambitious project as the bills piled up. Walt had to mortgage his house to pay his large staff of animators. From an early estimate of $250,000, the final costs skyrocketed to an astronomical $1,500,000 to complete ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" one of the largest expenditures in Hollywood's history at the time. Needing an extra $250,000 to push the movie over the finish line, Walt met with Bank of America executive Joseph Rosenberg to secure a loan. When the banker sat through a rough draft of the movie, he told the sweating Disney, ""Walt, that thing is going to make a hatful of money,"" as he signed off on the loan.Rosenberg's premonition proved correct. Hollywood's glitz and glitter showed up at the Los Angeles premier on December 21, 1937, to see history being made. Greeted by a standing ovation at its conclusion, Walt was reassured he had a hit on his hands. A month later ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" opened in New York's Radio City Music Hall to sell-out crowds. 'Disney's Folly' leapfrogged the previous record at the box office for a film with sound, 1928's Al Jolson's ""The Singing Fool"", and remained the reigning champion until 1939's ""Gone With The Wind."" Over the years, with international releases and multiple domestic re-releases, the landmark cartoon has raked in well over $400 million, ranking it in the top ten of all-time American film moneymakers adjusted for inflation. It is the highest grossing animated feature film ever produced.When ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was first released, Variety's review was typical of the accolades of Disney's efforts. ""So perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness."" Today ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" still amazes the critics. Wrote modern film reviewer Adam Kuhn, ""What a great experience this film was. To think it was made in 1937 is astounding to me. Seeing the old animation made the film more romantic to me.""Walt was always intrigued by the Brothers Grimm German fairy tale as early as 1916 when he was 15 watching a special presentation of the silent film ""Snow White,"" with four projectors playing the movie simultaneously on four separate screens. The original Grimm tale didn't attach any names to the dwarfs. Fifty names were submitted by Walt and his team of writers. Once settled, each character was different from one another, each possessing distinguishing traits.The voice of Snow White was spoken by 18-year-old Adriana Caselotti, who's father taught music in New York City. Walt asked him if any of his students had a natural voice. Guido Caselotti mention his daughter, whom Disney loved after hearing her audition. He wanted to keep Adriana name a secret and had her sign a restrictive contract prohibiting her from any further film work. Besides a brief part in 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz,"" Adriana never used her voice for any film role again. Veteran stage actress Lucille La Verne was the voice of the Wicked Queen. She was inside a recording booth working on another movie when she heard Disney was scouting for the voice of the Old Witch and the queen. She excused herself and returned shortly after. Disney's assistants sat stunned as she read the witch's lines in a raspy voice, quite different then her familiar one. Asked how she changed her voice so drastically, she replied, ""O, I just took my teeth out.""After ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'"" run at Radio City Music Hall, the New York City theater's owners noticed a peculiar stench in the theater. During the sequence where Snow White is running through the forest to get away from her hunter assassin, children in the audience, frightened beyond belief, wet their pants. All the velvet seat upholstery had to be taken out and replaced.""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" had a number of admirers, including Charlie Chaplin and Sergei Eisenstein, with the Russian director labeling it the greatest film ever produced. Adolf Hitler included it in his top three favorite films; the other two were 1933's ""King Kong"" and 1941's ""Sun Valley Serenade."" The Academy Awards nominated Disney's motion picture for Best Musical Score, and is one of the first movie soundtracks to be released on a record album. Walt received a honorary award from the Academy, presented during its annual ceremony by 10-year-old Shirley Temple. The trophy consists of a full-sizes and seven miniature Oscars with a plaque stating Walt's ""significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field.""The American Film Institute ranks ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" as the Number One Animated Film, the 34th Best Movie of All-Time, the Wicked Queen as the Tenth Most Villainous Character, and 'Someday My Prince Will Come,"" as the 19th Best Song in Movies. Harper's Bazaar lists Disney's feature as the best animated film. MGM, seeing the film's success, decided to proceed with its own fantasy project by initiating the production of 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz."" The immense profits Walt realized from Snow White allowed him to build an enormous $4.5 million studio in Burbank, California, which still stands today. It also prompted Disney to begin producing further feature length cartoons such as ""Pinocchio,"" ""Fantasia,"" and ""Bambi"" among others. The pioneering film is included in the '1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die' reference book.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The lost Disney movie of my childhood,"Yes,that is what i used to think when i was a child.This movie was not released on TV ,and it only appeared on video in 1994.I remember my wish for seeing the first Disney's masterpiece.Yes,the protagonist of the movie is bland and she's not aged very well,but the dwarfs and the queen are delicious characters.The music is perfect and the hand drawn animation is a perfect example of Disney's golden era.This was the first Disney movie and its success was unprecedented in 1937.It was a revolutionary movie that changed the perception about the animated form in cinema.It's a perfect movie ,although Snow White is not the kind of character a child would desire to be.In spite of this,the historical significance of the film hides the errors and the usual conservative message of all Disney's films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best!,"I would say that Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is one of Disney's best movies. It teaches some good values to young kids. It mixes good and evil so wonderfully. Like some of the other Disney movies, like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King for example. I would recommend this movie to young and old alike.",,Anonymous,Animation
Your original fairytale,"My whole childhood consisted of Walt Disney productions and I've always felt they truly contributed to making me a better person, so I wanted to rewatch them now, as an adult, as a personal project and to see how I view them with my grown-up eyes. I know that there has been quite a fuss upon the Disney old movies in terms of political correctness, body appreciation, beauty standards and all that, but my old soul has always chosen to see beyond that (even when I didn't have the filters I have nowadays).While there are a lot of things that have ""improved"" as the years passed by and technology evolved, my heart still melts eveytime I see scenes from these movies. I believe the nostalgia, along with the purity sense that this movie comes with, really have a lot to teach us. As a kid, I truly believe your untouched eyes and visions only see the good and the beauty (or so I tend to believe) and this kind of movies teaches us the first, most basic and beautiful lessons: to be good, graceful, considerate, to accept others and to love them as they are (of course, exceptional cases not included here), to be in harmony with nature, with other creatures, with yourself, to not harm others, to help them, to do good and be good. Why this urge to ""teach"" children and show them the raw, real world when they are at such little age? Why this hatred on these ""fairytales"" that do not prepare children for the harsh experiences that will face? It's childhood and it's the time we're at our purest for a reason. I grew up watching these movies and reading the stories behind them, as well as other fairytales and ""good wins over evil"" stories and I don't feel like I've been fooled in any way. On the contrary, I truly believe my empathic sense that I have had since childhool was mostly due to the understanding these movies taught me to have over others. And to look up at role models, not in terms of beauty or ""woman's role"" (because I am a young woman), but in terms of what a good heart can do and how it impacts others.Anyway, beautiful movie, beautiful graphic, astonishing music. I truly hope I will get to show all these to my child one day when I will have one (or more).10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lacks Flair but Has Heart,"While it lacks the flair and emotion of modern Disney films, it was interesting to see the initial stepping stones of animated cinema.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had just enough heart and fun to keep my attention.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
And then there was Disney.,"It is not an surprise that I think that Snow White is one of the greatest and most important movies in history. It is the start of the medium animation, and the first of an almost continuous line of fantastic movies by Walt Disney. Does this film still hold up after almost 80 years? Of course it does.Let us begin with the animation. Even after 77 years, it still is one of the best examples of Disney animation at it's best. It is flu- wend, colorful and the use of Walt's multi plane camera (a device that created the illusion of depth) is fantastic.Because this is Walt's first feature animated movie, they use a simple story. I won't tell the plot in this review, because you all have seen this film so it is pointless to tell something that you all already know. There is no point explaining the plot because this is the kind of film in which everything else is more important than the plot.And now the characters. To be honest, Snow White is not the greatest character in this film, even Walt Disney him self sad that she is basically an plot device. I do not say that she is a bad character. she is good, but the only other complain I have with her is that her voice is ridiculously high. I have heard Adriana Caselotti in the Wizard of Oz and there she sounds normal. And now the thing everyone remembers of this movie: The dwarfs. Thy are some of the best characters ever created in any movie. The evil queen is also great, especially when she is turned into the witch.All the songs are great and fantastic. My favorites are: High Ho, the washing song, the silly song and some day my prince will come. For some reason Disney didn't own the rights of the songs ever since 1937, because it didn't have his own music department yet.It still is one of the greatest Disney movies ever, and one of the greatest movies ever. To the one or two people who didn't saw the movie: Go to the store and buy it!!! it is an must own for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually Incredible, Though a Simple Story.","Watching this in 2022 when it was released in 1937 is pretty incredible - it certainly holds its own as a classic and still very enjoyable to watch. While the complexity that is in today's family movies isn't present in this film, and some of its themes may be seen as problematic today, I still think this is a lovely story about vanity, greed and the power of kindness. Visually, it has to be one of my favourite Disney films... It's just incredible. The illustrations of the deer and birds and rabbits has me in a choke-hold. I wish Disney was still creating illustrated movies of this aesthetic.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's one of those films in which everything works,"It's a perfect blend of humor, terror and sentiment so flawless is it in its execution and presentation that it's amazing to realize that it was the first feature length animated motion picture of its kind ever made.Several sequences, fully and partially animated, were cut during production, leaving a finished picture without an ounce of fat on it. The voice casting is also perfection throughout. The combination of design, animation, coloring and the vocal performance of 18 year old Adriana Caselotti meld to make the perfect fairy tale heroine and an unforgettable character. Lucille LaVerne is masterful as both the Queen and the Witch in her final screen role. I can't imagine any other actress even coming close to her brilliant portrayal.The dwarfs are uniformly excellent, with special kudos to Roy Atwell (Doc), Otis Harlan (Happy) and Billy Gilbert (Sneezy). Incredibly, none of the voice actors received screen credit - the first Disney feature to do so was Cinderella, 13 years later.Everything in Snow White- character animation, special effects, backgrounds, the inking and painting of the cels - was created by the artist's hands, flooding the screen with warmth and beauty. When viewing Snow White, one is seeing a lost art form unfolding before their eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"As Pure A Film As Its Namesake (Minus the ""Seven Dwarfs"" Part).","Since the 1930's, Disney animated films have been a strange collection. Some are made to present new ideas in story and animation and push the limits of the genre of animated film.  Others have been purely formulatic and meant as little more than money makers.  But overall, there have been more hits than misses (at least with their feature film animation).  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs really did push the revolution.A few years shy of 70, the film still holds up really well, especially with the remastered print and even moreso on DVD.  It's the other animated character (besides a certain mouse) that built the house of Disney, and it's obvious as to why when seen.  It's a beautiful film, with great animation, a simple story and at the risk of sounding like a press release, truly unforgettable songs and characters.  It's a part of American film history, up there with ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"", and even the more modern classics like ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"".  It's aged well, and it shows why sometimes simplicity is truly the way to go in terms of presenting a story.  It has a straightforward manner with plenty of visual marvels, especially when you sit back and realize how long this film has been around, and how even some animation of today still can't compare.The DVD itself is filled with more background information than a person can watch in one sitting.  It really makes up for the initial discs released by Disney DVD, and bodes well for later classics such as ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Lion King"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" (Can you tell which ones I'm waiting for?).A must see for any film animation fan, but you probably already knew that.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

You identify with its art and mythology. It's the blueprint--both psychologically and creatively--for all that was to come in the animation field.

"Does anyone remember when they performed this on ""The Brady Bunch""?  Or when the title characters watched it in ""Gremlins""?","Since everyone knows what happens here, I'll talk about a few aspects. In the Grimm brothers' original version, the dwarfs didn't have names; Disney added those and the respective personalities. Also, whereas here the dwarfs are slobs, in the original story they were very tidy - so why did they need Snow White to be a housekeeper? Today was the very first time in my life that I watched the whole movie (and I only watched it for a class). The first time when I saw any of it was in ""Gremlins"", when the mean green guys watched it. Also, I remember once on ""The Brady Bunch"" when the Bradys put on a production of it in their back yard to raise money for a retiring teacher.One thing that comes to my mind is the fact that there are seven dwarfs. We all like to say that seven's the lucky number. Considering the names and personalities given the little guys here, one could infer that they represent the seven deadly sins: Grumpy is anger; Sleepy is sloth; Sneezy is greed (maybe he thinks that everyone owes him something because of his excessive sneezing); Bashful is lust; Doc is pride (if he's smarter than the others, he must be full of himself); Happy is gluttony (you may recall that he's pretty fat); and Dopey is envy (maybe he wishes that he was as smart as the others and talk like them). Expanding on this, maybe the dwarfs correlate to the characters on ""Gilligan's Island"": Gilligan is Dopey; the Skipper is Grumpy; Mr. Howell is Sleepy (he'd rather sleep than do work); Mrs. Howell is Sneezy (she seems like the type who's allergic to many things); Ginger is Bashful; the Professor is Doc; and Mary Ann is Happy. Speaking of dwarfs in general, I think that dwarfs are people whose limbs or other body parts are disproportionate to the rest, so the men here would be midgets.Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even mentioned Snow White. Well, we all know that she's benevolent beyond credibility - and she's rather flat-chested for a grown woman. Watching the movie in this day and age, a person may feel tempted to throw out comments like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". When Snow White looked down the well, I said that it was like ""The Ring"", and when she entered the dwarfs' house, I suggested that she was guilty of breaking and entering.So, that's my take on ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

The One That Started It All,"Here is where it all started. This landmark film, the very first full length animated feature, belongs on the short list of the most influential American movies of the Twentieth Century. If Mickey Mouse was the rock on which the House of Disney was built, then SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS was the cement that helped form the Disney conglomerate as we know it today.Rudimentary by today's standards, SNOW WHITE nevertheless remains a masterpiece of animation because it possesses two qualities totally lacking in most of today's computerized works : Heart and Soul. Despite the advancement in technology, regardless of the magic of pixels and virtual imagery, most present-day animated features lack basic storytelling skills, relying rather on the easy clever remark and an annoying tendency to preach than tell a good tale. And nothing can compare to the inspired and solid craftsmanship of Disney's original ""old man ""team of animators who bravely learned their trade while creating this nascent work of art. SNOW WHITE is the cornerstone of all of Walt Disney's greatest animated films : an involving story, characters the audience can care for and identify with, superbly drawn animation put into brilliant motion and heightened by the innovative use of the then revolutionary multi-plane camera ( a device that dramatically changed the look of cartoons, giving scenes a third dimensional look). Added to all these innovations were the remarkable songwriting contributions of Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline, responsible for the superb musical score.""Someday My Prince Will Come"", Heigh Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work' are just three examples of an entire soundtrack that is a model of perfection and to this day one of the great movie song scores of all time. One could go on and remark on the incredible detail afforded the dwarfs' home, the wood sculpturing that adorns everything from the little mens' beds to stair-posts and doorknobs.The detail is astonishing, and the blood and sweat of the animators' labors will forever be enshrined in this lasting work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
On the ground floor of modern animation,"Watching this film you're aware that you're in on the ground floor of modern animation. The first cel-animated feature length film, Walt Disney's team of artists and technicians took an old European fairy tale and delighted audience with groundbreaking state of the art animation techniques that set the storytelling template for the century to follow. One might liken it to the pioneering digital work Pixar achieved in Toy Story in 1995 though, of course, they were building on Disney's foundations.Disney himself was an autocrat and a bully who exploited his workforce. He was the epitome of the American venture capitalist whose Disney empire was always as much about making money as spinning dreams. Adriana Caselotti who voiced the lead role was forced to sign an agreement that she would never work again because Disney wanted to own everything about the Snow White character. Apart from a few very small voice parts and TV appearances she never really had much of a career.Of course the story is a patriarchal stereotype that privileges female physical beauty as the highest value and reinforces the idea that every girl awaits the day when her prince will come and give her new life with his kiss. This reflects 1930s values but goes back much further to the source material in the Brothers Grimm. There's a sweet innocence in the adoration of the seven dwarves toward Snow White and in the touching maternal theme in her care of them.I would think the wicked queen/witch sequences would be quite scary for small children, though my four-year-old grandson coped with it and enjoyed the film, especially the sequence where the seven dwarves washed up in the water trough. The songs are good and the overall entertainment value of Disney's first feature film holds up perfectly well. There's a direct line from Snow White to the Disney empire's ownership of the Star Wars and Marvel universes but in 1937, this was a huge risk, ridiculed as 'Disney's folly'. The subsequent academy awards and box office records it set upon its release as well as its current secure place in the canon of American mythology represent vindication for Walt Disney and his creative legacy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The first ever Disney movie and a technical marvel for the time,"Snow White was a milestone that defined animation as a medium and got Disney off to a great start. It is unfortunately kept from perfection by glaring issues. The story is a classic we have all likely heard before, Snow White is a young women who gets chased from her home and lives in the forest with dwarves.The animation is absolutely stellar for the time and holds up remarkably well today. The movie is full of happy, charming moments and the witch is the highlight of the movie.It has some minor pacing issues The important plot points are rushed and the smaller things get a lot of screen time, now that isn't necessarily a bad thing but watching the dwarves shenanigans for over 15 minutes is probably not up everyone's alley and frankly feels like filler. The music ranges from catchy to an absolute miss, which is likely due to the audio quality of the time. The plot is very similar to sleeping beauty and other later Disney movies and while Snow White gets credit for being the first, later movies did it better.Overall this is a fun, well animated movie especially for its time! Snow White is definitely overrated but I would still recommend everyone see it at least once. Kids are likely going to get more enjoyment out of this one than adults.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's First Full Length animated film...Awesome.,"Walt Disney made several great films to entertain and delight us. One of those films was ""Snow white and the seven dwarfs."" one of the earliest animated films based upon an old fairy tale.

She doesn't really have a name, just the Evil queen. she owns a magic mirror, whom she asks ""Who's the fairest one of all?"" and that mirror is supposed to say ""you, fair queen."" but one day it decides to mention Snow white's name. This forces Snow White to run away.The fairy tale of snow white strikes a chord in everybody's heart, and the film itself is epic, even by today's standards.However, I think it's one of the scariest children's films of all time, and if the Walt Disney company ever made another film like this today, All the soccer moms and high school musical crybabies and fanboys would call for it's boycotting.I give it a full 10/10.

So impressed,Hard to believe this film was made so long ago as it stands up so well to today's standard. Disney debut is still a delight to watch. The artwork is rather special for a film that is around 80 years old now and the songs have become timeless.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
wonderful classic,"Well what can I say,Snow White is a classic in every way because it is so memorable,memorable songs,characters,plot,animated scenes you name it.This is not ONLY due to the fact it was the first of Disney's gorgeous animated features because is also has that little touch of magic that comes along",,Anonymous,Animation
"Magic Mirror, on the wall, which animated feature film is the greatest one of all?","Contrary to common belief, Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is not the earliest feature-length animated film. This title goes to Quirino Cristiani's now-lost 1917 Argentinian film, ''El Apóstol / The Apostle.' Even as far as current availability in concerned, you can turn towards Lotte Reiniger's 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)' for a brilliant animated film, featuring endearing silhouette animation and an exciting tale of heroes, villains and monsters. Released in 1937, 'Snow White' was Disney's first feature-length effort, as well as the first technicolour animated movie, and also briefly the most successful film of all time (until the release of 'Gone with the Wind' in 1939). After the excellent 'Fantasia (1940),' this was the second feature-length film I'd seen from Disney's early era, and I was instantly able to appreciate why it is so revered. One can only imagine how much effort must have gone into the 83 minutes of animation, and, despite this relatively brief running time, the film manages to flesh out so many wonderful characters and effectively evoke a range of emotions.The story is roughly based upon the German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. A beautiful and wicked Queen (voiced by Lucille La Verne) learns one day, through her Magic Mirror, that her stepdaughter  the beautiful Snow White (Adriana Caselotti)  has surpassed her in beauty. Enraged, the Queen orders the princess murdered, but the kind-hearted servant cannot bring himself to commit the act. Abandoned in the forest, Snow White is aided by the gentle animals of the forest, and she stumbles upon the modest dwelling of a group of seven dwarfs, respectively named Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy and Bashful, each with a personality that mirrors their own titles. Though initially hesitant about having a woman in their home, the little men eventually come to appreciate her presence, and all is going well until the Queen learns of her servant's disloyalty, and so crafts a new and terrible revenge for the sweet and innocent Snow White.Visually, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is nothing short of a masterpiece. Compared to the primitive cut-out silhouettes of 'The Adventures of Princess Achmed' just a decade earlier, the animation in this film is nothing short of staggering; every single frame is simply alive with vibrant colour and movement. In fact, the film proved such a monumental advance in the field of animation that it took until the arrival of Pixar Studios and CGI before anybody truly progressed beyond what had been achieved here. Colour is used magnificently to create intense moods, and the chasing of the Queen (transformed into a witch) through a raging thunderstorm is an absolute triumph of film-making, equal to anything produced before or since. Notably, a flawless 1937 Silly Symphonies short, 'The Old Mill,' served as an essential testing ground for many of the techniques used in 'Snow White,' including the animation of animals, rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections. Additionally, 'The Old Mill' also served as the trial-run for Disney's revolutionary multiplane camera, which was also used to remarkable effect here.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Granddaddy of Animation - Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"I refuse to use the illiterate term ""drawfs"". The correct usage is ""dwarves"". The Disney studios were great artists, but lousy grammarians. This is the granddaddy of all full-length animation films. It was wildly successful and made (and still makes) a fortune for Disney Studios. The story of seven miners who take in Snow White to avoid the Wicked Queen and to keep house for them is a timeless classic. Almost everyone in the US has seen this feature at least once; and several more than once. The characters created in the film are classic and timeless. The film is just as entertaining today as it was over 80 years ago. The Wicked Queen sequences are quite intense for young children, so be aware they may scare the devil out of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For a film now some EIGHTY FIVE years old, it's incredible that it is still so watchable and inspirational to this day.","An evil Queen becomes obsessed with being the most beautiful woman in all the kingdom and vows to kills her stepdaughter Snow White when she grows to take that place.Snow White flees into the woods, where she is found by a gang of friendly dwarfs.It doesn't matter how much I see this Walt Disney debut, I'm always in awe of what the studio managed to achieve in 1937.Sure the characters are deeply rooted in the melodrama style of the time and it may seem cliche in comparison to modern animated films. But it's important to keep in mind that the reason for this is because it invented most of those cliches in the first place.And for a film now some EIGHTY FIVE years old, it's incredible that it is still so watchable and inspirational to this day.

My Favorite Movie PERIOD,"This movie is truly a masterpiece for its time and a pure classic. Without the accomplishments of this film, we wouldn't have the great animated films like Lion King or Moana. Ever since I was little, I just loved this movie and called it my favorite whenever I was asked. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? The story is well-done, the animation is gorgeous, the characters are charming, and the songs are PURE DISNEY GEMS! Also, Snow White is actually my second favorite character OF ALL-TIME, mainly because she's the person I aspire to be. Someone who's optimistic and sees the good in everything, and is very kind. She's not perfect but really who is? Her qualities are overlooked nowadays and it's very disappointing as the morals she teaches us are the ones we should be telling our children and not JUST to do everything independently. Overall, this will forever hold that place in my heart as my favorite movie of all-time. Bravo Walt Disney, and everyone who was a part of this phenomenal film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Still the ""Fairest of them All""","It's always a fear of mine when I go back to visit a beloved film of mine - especially a film that was beloved to me in my childhood. Will it hold up? Is it as good as I remember it? Will the re-visitation tarnish the precious memory of this film that I have?I am happy to report that, upon a fresh viewing of the first full length animated film every, that I can still declare SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS ""the fairest of them all"".Made in 1937, by the visionary Walt Disney, this film defies the odds - many calling it ""Walt's Folly"". No one had attempted a full length animated film before and the skeptics were many, but what Walt knew is that he had all the standard elements of a good story - a heroine we can root for, an evil villain, some comic characters that can help us laugh (and cry) and, more importantly, he had the skillful craftsmen of the Walt Disney Studios that can pull off such a feat.And...pull it off they did! This film is gorgeous and lush to look at. Upon this viewing, I was drawn to the background, and the edges of the frame, marveling at the detail that was interwoven into each, hand drawn imagery - giving this tapestry a lushness and thickness heretofore unseen on the screen.As for the story of the film - and the film itself - Disney was smart enough to know that ""less is more"". The film is compact - running a relatively quick 83 minutes - this was a two-fold solution. (1) It helped move the film along at a sprightly pace, never once resting or losing energy and (2) this means that the artists only had to draw what was necessary for this streamlined story.The music, of course, is wonderful and important part of this film. This was one of the first movie musicals, and was the first film to release a Soundtrack Album. From ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" to ""I'm Wishing"" to ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"", the songs moved the story forward and added depth to the characters portrayed on the screen.If you haven't caught this film in awhile, I heartily recommend you check it out - it works for young and old alike. A good film to share with children of today, to show them what lush, hand drawn animation looks like. Come for the fun of the Dwarfs and the Villainy of the Evil Queen, stay for the richness of the tapestry and the attention to detail that a true classic film portrays.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)Next Month: WRECK-IT RALPH and (of course) the sequel RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET (coming to theaters in November).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mirror mirror on the wall.......,"Disney's first feature film!! Hard to believe this thing was released in 1937 when my grandparents were just toddlers. This classic is of course the story of princess Snow White, the FAIREST in the land, and her being on the run from the evil queen who desires to be the fairest in the land. She plots to kill Snow White so that she can be the fairest, but as in all Disney animated classic, good will always win, and there's a handsome prince to help. This classic fairytale still holds up today, it's great animation, ESPECIALLY for 1937! It's very fun and entertaining, complete with catchy songs and well written characters like the dwarfs. The dwarfs are: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. They all of course behave exactly like their name and they work in a nearby mine, they stroll in single file every day singing their work song, hi ho hi ho..... Snow White stumbles upon them and their cottage and she begins to stay there with her while in hiding from the evil queen. The evil queen, who is a FANTASTIC Disney villain all the while is plotting a way to kill Snow White. I love the scene where she creates an elixir that will transform her into an ugly old hag so that snow will not recognize her as she offers a poisoned apple. One of the best scenes in animated movies if you ask me. Overall everyone knows about this Disney classic and if you or your family have not seen it then what are you waiting for lol. I highly suggest watching if you if you have younger children because they will LOVE it! Perfect for a family movie night with young kids. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's first true masterpiece,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is for me Disney's first true masterpiece and that for me is down to the animation. This film is 86 years old now yet it holds up better than most modern animated movies. I simply cannot get over the visual beauty of this hand drawn gem. If I sit and think about how much detail the squeezed in my little head would explode. Full kudos to all the animators and colouring folks that were involved, they truly did create something that is timeless and will live on for generations to come. I truly don't think this or some of Disney's earlier work like Bambi, Dumbo & Pinocchio get enough credit when talking about animated masterpieces. They've often overlooked in favour of Disney's renaissance in the 90's. Just think how truly limited we were in terms of film and animation capabilities back in the 30/40's and yet this studio pulled off several excellent projects with true hand drawn precision.The story itself doesn't really do it for me but as a dude it wasn't really targeted at me. Having said that it's obviously still very watchable and any scenes with the dwarves were just superb. There was enough overall for me to enjoy but still the best thing about this film is the sheer beauty and genius of the animation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The one that started it all,"Let me start off with this: the visuals are amazing, the characters are likable and the emotional scenes really work.I have asked myself the question ""is this movie really 80 years old by now""? and the fact that it actually is still astounds me. In my lifetime the company has made movies which looked less than half as good as Snow White despite the available technology, therefore it has a special place in my heart.But that said, I honestly think that Snow White as a character is quite a bore. She surely has the beautiful singing voice of Adriana Caselotti, but she is too cute and innocent to be interesting. In addition to that, the scenes involving her and the prince are just awkward, both of the times they meet. The dwarfs and the evil queen are by far the greatest characters in this movie.""Snow White and the Seven Dwafs"" is highly recommendable if you like animation as a craft.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Snow White is a visual and audio wonder, even over time.","This cartoon took much painstaking effort and planning to create. It is a delicately and carefully made masterpiece of animation. The film used an old-fashioned way of drawing each little movement of the cartoons many different separate times and then it was all blended together as one whole. The characters win you over and the story is heartwarming. This full-length movie was a plan of Walt Disney's to make after he and the studio earned enough revenue to pay for its production by many cartoon shorts with some including Mickey Mouse, known as the ""silly symphonies."" The movie/cartoon Snow White is a very special family film intended for children of all ages. I would count it as a great classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly A Disney classic and can't remake it.,"If Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" had been primarily about Snow White, it might have been forgotten soon after its 1937 premiere, and treasured today only for historical reasons, as the first full-length animated feature in color. Snow White is, truth to tell, a bit of a bore, not a character who acts but one whose mere existence inspires others to act. The mistake of most of Disney's countless imitators over the years has been to confuse the titles of his movies with their subjects. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is not so much about Snow White or Prince Charming as about the Seven Dwarfs and the evil Queen--and the countless creatures of the forest and the skies, from a bluebird that blushes to a turtle who takes forever to climb up a flight of stairs. So complex were his frames, indeed, that Disney and his team of animators found that the cels they used for their short cartoons were not large enough to contain all the details he wanted, and larger cels were needed. The film's earliest audiences may not have known the technical reasons for the film's impact, but in the early scene where Snow White runs through the forest, they were thrilled by the way the branches reached out to snatch at her, and how the sinister eyes in the darkness were revealed to belong to friendly woodland animals. The trees didn't just sit there within the frame. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. (The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein called it the greatest movie ever made.) It remains the jewel in Disney's crown, and although inflated modern grosses have allowed other titles to pass it in dollar totals, it is likely that more people have seen it than any other animated feature. The word genius is easily used and has been cheapened, but when it is used to describe Walt Disney, reflect that he conceived of this film, in all of its length, revolutionary style and invention, when there was no other like it--and that to one degree or another, every animated feature made since owes it something.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An early animated classic,"This animated classic is set in a kingdom ruled by an evil queen, who is obsessed with being the most beautiful person in the land. Her step-daughter, daughter of the late king, is Snow White and she is forced to work as a lowly scullery maid... that is until the queen's magic mirror tells her that Snow White is now 'the fairest in the land'. The queen can't have that so send orders a huntsman to kill her. He can't bring himself to do it and Snow White flees into the forest. Here she meets friendly animals that take her to a small cottage where seven dwarfs live. While Snow White gets to know the dwarfs the queen concocts another plot to get rid of her.This film is a must see for any fan of animation. It is obviously important as the first ever fully animated feature film but it also retains a charm that enables it to entertain generation after generation. The story provides humour, mild scares and plenty of now famous songs. The animation looks fresh thanks to the digital restoration of the faded prints. The characters are a lot of fun; especially the dwarfs who's names reflect their characters. The queen is suitably evil and provides many child-friendly scares. Given that it is well over eighty years of age it isn't surprising that some elements show their age a little but that doesn't detract from the film. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody with young children, those feeling nostalgic or fans of animated film in general and Disney in particular.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The start of something wonderful,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the most influential films in history. The first full-length animated film, for a few brief years the highest-grossing film of all time and still to this day one of the most successful films in Disney history. Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it. And sure, the dwarfs are great character, each a unique personality with hiccups and all, so the viewer doesn't really mind that the plot is pretty much forgotten much of the time, but you can nevertheless see that it's a work in progress as far as feature length storytelling is concerned.Luckily we have the Queen. And oh, what a way to introduce us to Disney villains. To this day she's one of the greats and it can be argued that the movie is actually about her, not Snow White nor the dwarfs. She's the first character we see, has pretty much the most dialogue and her scenes are the most captivating and actually move the plot forward. And she's a menace. Always plotting, scheming, cackling, being absolutely terrifying. The first look she gives us after her transformation is one of the scariest looks in cinema history.You've all seen this movie already. It's one of the most well-known pieces of art there is and has absolutely held up its charm to this day. Not the best film Disney has ever done, but for their first, it's unbelievable.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well, here is the film that started an empire.","Well, here is the film that started an empire. Not only was it Walt Disney's first foray into feature length animated films, it was also the first full length cell animated film ever attempted. I suppose it's needless to say that the gamble paid off for him. Especially when you take into account the fact that Disney, after just buying 20th Century Fox entertainment, now technically owns about a third of the entertainment industry.Walt Disney first came across the tale of Snow White when he was about fifteen years of age after reading The Brothers Grimm tale of the same name. He later stated that he couldn't get the story out of his head and he would be constantly playing the story over in his mind. After the success of his Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies series, Walt pooled everyone together and started work on Snow White in early 1934. The film was finally released in December 1937, and received a standing ovation from an audience containing that of Judy Garland. Snow White went on to do exceptionally well at the box office, and in 1939 became the top grossing sound film of all-time.Snow White at the start of the tale has been forced into the life of a scullery maid. This is being enforced by her incredibly jealous and equally vain stepmother, the Queen. This obstinately vain monarch is particularly fixated with being the fairest in the land and believes her beautiful stepdaughter, Snow White, to be a growing threat to her. Her worst fears are realised when the Queens magic mirror declares Snow White to be the fairest in the land. Overcome with jealousy, the Queen hires a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. The huntsman however is struck by Snow White's innocence and beauty, and tells her to flee into the forest in order to escape the Queens wrath. There she bumps into a company of dwarves, all with distinctive personalities and loveable quirks. The dwarves allow her to stay after learning she's on the run and especially after learning that she can cook and clean (I don't think sexism was a big thing in the 1930's unfortunately). Meanwhile, the Queen is hatching more maniacal schemes to find and kill Snow White.Snow White as a lead serves her purpose well enough. These days however she pales in comparison with Disney's latest and more stronger and self-sufficient movie heroines, such as: Moana and Frozen's Anna and Elsa. Since Snow White's only noticeable qualities is her uncommonly kind nature, naivety, and Betty Boop esc singing voice (which is also a little dated). She tends to come off a bit bland, but fortunately the dwarves more than make up for the leads short comings, and outright steal the show. The dwarves themselves all have different personalities, which are reflected in their names, in their timeless designs and exquisitely differing animations. The stand out has to be Dopey, his animation and musical cues made me chuckle a good few times. The dwarves serve as the charm and heart of the film, of which I am sure, has played a big part in this films continued success amongst children even today. I've heard a few people say in their reviews that they didn't think the Queen was a very effective villain. I can understand that point of view, especially since some of her schemes are not the cleverest. However when I watched the film as a kid I found the Queen to be absolutely terrifying, especially when she disguises herself as the old crone. I am pretty sure that I had nightmares over that old crone, and that for me has to show a definite level of effectiveness to a villain. The first thing for me that stands out is the terrific design. She looks menacing and intimidating as the queen, with her tall slender frame and pointed features. While her truly frightening design, as the old crone, allows the character to reveal her evil and deceitful ways. There is one character who gets cast aside and receives basically no development at all, and that would be the prince. He shows up a bit at the beginning and then again for the finale at the end. The problem with this is they have no interaction with each other in-between these events. This makes the relationship between the two characters very unbelievable by modern standards. Perhaps if he was given some more scenes to expand his personality a bit, or maybe even a name, his appearance at the end would not have been so jarring.The musical numbers for the most part are brilliant and truly timeless; such as ""Heigh-Ho"". This particular tune is extremely hard to get out of your head once it's ingrained itself in there. However the ""I'm Wishing / One Song"" and most others sung by Snow White herself have a tendency to sound a little dated, and as I mentioned before, a bit Betty Boop like.When I re-watched the film for this review, I couldn't help but be amazed by the extraordinarily lifelike animation that Disney and his incredible animation team had achieved. I hadn't watched the movie for a very long time and for some reason expected the animation to be, not bad, but dated compared to the more recent animated movies. Boy was I wrong. Eighty years on and it still looks practically flawless. There's nothing better than watching true masters of their craft and Disney's animators are in top form here.Apart from occasionally showing its age and having some key characters shockingly underdeveloped. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an enduring classic that will most likely be passed down for generations to come. If you're looking to entertain your nostalgic side a bit. Or perhaps looking into the origins of modern day animation and cinema, or maybe even trying to entertain your children for a couple of hours, there is not many finer options out there than this Disney classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Walt Disney started something great,"Where do I even begin? During the opening credits, there's words of thanks from Walt Disney to the crew for the hard work and love put into the film. Watching Snow White - I feel that hard work and love. I feel the dreams Walt had when this movie was made. Aside from Mickey, it was Snow White that kick started the Disney Company as we know it, for better or for worse. If this movie failed, whose to say where we would be with out Walt Disney and all the achievements that came from his life and success - from film & animation to engineering to tourism. This was a beginning.I know that these days, we all wanna be progressive. We're tired of seeing the damsel in distress. The guy doesn't have to get the girl every time; cut the romance. Give us a story, not a fairytale. And Disney films as of late have done such a good job of this, from Frozen to Zootopia to Turning Red.

She's so precious, pure, and lovely. I just wanna give her a big Hufflepuff hug. The Evil Queen also remains my favorite villain. Disneyland character interactions & Once Upon a Time have totally solidified this for me. The music is also iconic. One Song is amongst my favorites and Heigh-Ho is still a bop.

Disneys ultimate classic,"""Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs"" was in 1937 a great leap forward in animation. It was the first feauture length animation movie and there were also some technical innovations. Not the least of them was the multiplane camera, which made it possible to film up to seven layers of animation at the same time. These layers could even move at different speed. As a result is was possible to make animation movies with much more visual depth.Snowwhite and Prince charming maybe the main characters, they are too perfect to be interesting. The seven dwarfs, with al their (all too human) imperfections are much more fun to watch. In this respect they resemble the travel companions of Dorothy in ""The wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming & King Vidor)Just like in the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood Snowwhite contains symbolism that stand for the sexual awakening of a young girl. Think of the magic sleep and the kiss of the prince that breaks the spell. We also see the same symbolism in the Wagner opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" (Brunhilde = Snowwhite and Siegfried = the Prince).Apart from the sexual symbolism there is also some Biblical symbolism in the movie. Think about the number of dwarfs. Seven has always been a magical number in the Bible (the creation of the earth in seven days, the seven seals in the Book of Revelation). Even more obvious is the apple, hinting at the story about Eve and the apple.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Set the standards for all future animated movies.,"Of course one of the things about animated movies is that no matter when they got made they never look old. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" got made in 1937 but it looks just as good and the same as Disney movies- and other full length animated movies that got made in much later decades. You can say that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was the movie that set the standards for animated movies and was a sign of things to come. It's also the reason why the movie won a special Academy Award for 'pioneering a great new entertainment field'. It was not awarded on simple Academy Award but also 7 smaller ones along with it. A nice and fitting tribute.Even though it's the very first full length animated Disney feature it's also actually one of the most daring ones. Some moments are truly scary done and the movie features some real horror like moments and even a skeleton in a shocking scene. No way Disney movies would allow these sort of imagery these days. It shows they were still looking for the right style and approach for their movies at the Disney studios.But it's funny to note how little the animation style had actually changed for the Disney movies over the years. Right till the '90's Disney movies used the same animation style and were just as good and smooth looking as this movie. It makes it all the movie obvious what a great accomplishment for 1937 this movie was. Not only the characters and their movies are looking fine but also the backgrounds and all of the other little details in it.So it's not a movie that is outdated with its style but it of course is with its story. As a matter of fact ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" story is shockingly simply and there hardly is any story development. It also is disgustingly happy and friendly with all of the cuddly animals in it and the sweet character of Snow White herself. But yet this at the same time is definitely part of the charm of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".While the comedy is not as good or much present as would be the case in a Disney short, featuring Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse for example, it still is a very fun movie to watch, which is due to the overall atmosphere of the movie and the likability of the characters.The characters from this movie are still among the best and most memorable ones out of all Disney movies. Not just Snow White herself but also obviously the seven dwarfs, who also make the movie mostly entertaining to watch. The Queen/Witch is also a good memorable Disney villain, even though her role is actually quite small in the movie.Also this earliest Disney movie already featured songs in it. Some of them are still classics and it's must better stuff when compared to some Disney movies which got made in the first years after ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", with the exception of ""Pinocchio"", which was the first next big Disney project after this one.Still just as good and watchable as it was at the time of its release.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The beginning of the Disney motion pictures,"Walt Disney produced many full-length animated features during his long career, and many more have come from the Walt Disney Company since his death in 1966. However, the very first of them all was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", an adaptation of the version of the story from the Brothers Grimm. This 1937 motion picture turned out to be groundbreaking, and although seven decades have passed since its original release, it is still remembered as a classic, well-deservingly!Snow White is a princess, and the stepdaughter of the evil, vain Queen. One day, when the Queen asks her Magic Mirror ""Who is the fairest one of all?"", she doesn't get her usual response! Instead, she learns that Snow White is now the ""fairest one of all""! The Queen immediately grows jealous, and sends a hunter out to kill Snow White! Luckily for the princess, the hunter decides that killing her just wouldn't be right. Wanting her to live, he tells her to run away, which is just what she does. Looking for a place to stay, she ends up in the house of the Seven Dwarfs (Dopey, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful, Grumpy, and Happy), and begins to live with them. Meanwhile, after the Queen learns that Snow White is still alive, she intends to do the killing herself!This was one of many Disney films that I saw when I was a kid, but my memory of it wasn't as clear as some of the others. A few months ago, I watched it for the first time in many years, and didn't think much of it. However, I was more impressed when I watched it again shortly after, and even more impressed with a third viewing! I found Snow White's singing voice somewhat annoying at first, and with more viewings, I still didn't become a big fan of it. However, this certainly didn't totally ruin the film for me. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" has some good dialogue (some of which I may not have noticed before), excitement, and memorable characters (including Snow White, even if she's not the greatest character in Disney history, along with most of the Dwarfs, who often add humour to the film).After my most recent viewing, I'm not sure whether to give ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" an 8 or a 9 (out of 10, of course). I certainly wouldn't give it a 10 (it's not absolutely perfect in my book), but I was very impressed with most of it. I don't know whether it was enough for me to give it a 9 rating or not. Well, nonetheless, I can still understand why this first full-length piece of animation from Disney has been labelled a classic by so many people throughout the decades! For hardcore fans of Disney or animated family adventures in general, and probably for some moderate fans as well, there's lots of fun to be had!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Once Upon a Time,"Walt Disney was only 14 when he saw ""Snow White"" for the first time. The year was 1915, and the black-and-white silent movie made a profound impression on him. So Disney took a correspondence course in cartooning. A few years later he moved to Los Angeles: the city at the center of the animation industry. It was here that the first official Walt Disney Studio was established in the early 1930s.The story in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" originated in Europe during the Middle Ages. It tells the tale of a wicked Queen who tries to kill her beautiful stepdaughter. Fortunately, the girl manages to escape into the forest, where she seeks refuge with seven dwarfs in a small cabin. But the evil Queen doesn't give up that easily...In the mid '30s Walt Disney ran the most successful animation studio in Hollywood. With ""Steamboat Willie"" he had made the world's first talking cartoon, and with ""Flowers and Trees"" the first one in color. Now Disney aspired to try something new. He wanted to make a full-length animated movie. And he had an old favorite in mind. Walt Disney Studios was to film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".It turned out to be a shockingly complicated venture. The costs soon broke all calculations, and Disney had to mortgage his beloved home to be able to pay the large staff of cartoonists. When, after three years of hard work, they were finally finished, the project was widely known as ""Disney's Folly"" in Hollywood. No one thought the film would ever be able to recoup the money Walt Disney had put into it.Luckily, they were all wrong. The movie became a global sensation. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until ""Gone with the Wind"" displaced it in 1939. ""Snow White"" was also the first movie to release a soundtrack album. At the Academy Awards that year Disney was given one normal-sized, and seven miniature Oscar statuettes.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,"watching this for the first time recently, I was struck by the feeling of watching a dream in motion. It's so simple, but it has a quality of pure artistry that goes well beyond the narrative. In fact, the films true strength is heightened by the simplicity of the story because it allows the film to communicate on a deeper level. The story itself can almost be followed without thinking at all, which lets the subconscious mind grab the film and run with it. One of the best films I've ever seen and currently my favorite Disney movie. It's missing some things that other Disney movies have, but it replaces those elements with something more primal and harder to define.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The movie that started it all,"Being the first animated film ever made, it was boom or bust for Walt Disney, and BOY did it boom. Even over eighty-five years later, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs holds up remarkably well. The animation is vibrant and expertly drawn, especially for 1937. The music (both the songs and the score) helps to move the story along and/or reveal information about the characters. All of that is great, but if the story and characters weren't good, it wouldn't have been the revolutionary masterpiece that it is. The story, while simple, is very engaging and well-paced. The characters are all identifiable with clear personalities from the sweetheart that is Snow White, to the seven unique, charming dwarfs, to the wicked Evil Queen. If there is anything I'd change, it's that I wish the Prince had more personality. He's not unlikable, just a little bland. Overall, the world of animation owes everything to this film. Without it, we wouldn't have some of the animated masterpieces that would follow. Snow White walked so the following could run. It's a wonderful film for all ages, and it's one I love starting every Disney marathon with.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The essence of a timeless classic,"The first animated feature of Walt Disney is remarkable in many senses. For one, the technical aspects: surely the animation style is different than that of today, in some ways even superior, being aesthetically more appealing and detailed. And second, the truthfulness to the source material and its take on it transcends the time that has spanned since 1937. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is timeless, and just about as timeless as a movie can become. The character designs, the voice acting, the beautiful set pieces, the cartoon humor, and the tremendous amounts of charm makes it one of few films that could be watched in 100 years, amusing just as much as when it was first released.

A beautiful movie with great set pieces,"I'm with a lot of people, in that I think Snow White as a character is too much of a stereotype to be really interesting, but at least she's not the princess in Gulliver's Travels!What really makes this movie is the artistic animation, which does exactly what animation is supposed to do: create feelings through moving images, not create a realistic world.  When Snow White flees into the forest, we see what she sees--that the whole world is suddenly out to get her.  The trees come to life in demonic fashion, and the floating logs become crocodiles.A note on the songs--while today in America it seems kind of silly to have songs about working and cleaning, work songs have been a part of nearly every culture throughout history.

there is something timeless and everlasting about movies like this,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", a film that has long been treasured and regarded with awe and amazement by audiences for seventy long years. Whether or not the viewer knows about the incredible painstaking work it took to make the animation in a film like this convincing enough for us, we do still look at the film and enjoy it despite the fact that its animation and style is far outdated. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is short, wonderful, and unique. Had it been made today, it may not have worked out. First of all, it would have had to be longer and with more interaction between several of the characters.However, there is something classic and timeless about ""Snow White"" which still works today. While I do strongly believe that the love story, although a major point in the plot, was exercised weakly onto the screen. The real reason for this is that the prince, whose name is never revealed, has such little screen time. I estimate about three minutes, maybe less. In my following research, I discovered that it was because of the incredible difficulty the animators found in drawing in frame-by-frame. That's how it was done back then.Putting aside the flaw with the character of the prince, the other characters were very well-done with both animation and development. Snow White is well-realized in looking innocent, kind, and depending on one's point-of-view, a beautiful Disney character. The seven dwarfs, the other title characters, were also well-done and they are the real stars of the film. Snow White provides the drama and heart-felt sympathy, while the dwarfs provide everything else except for antagonism. But they are the characters who make us laugh, or at least grin. And each is given a specific personality which makes them memorable. The evil queen, the villain of the story, is one of the coldest that Disney studios ever pulled out. Whichever physical form she is in, the queen, also unnamed, is a ruthless baddie. Her horrifying personality and decisions ultimately earned her a place in the Top 50 Villains of film history.So while ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is an old, outdated film which does not always meet the expectations of audience members today, there is something about it that does work. It has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. I myself think it is worthy of such a position. I don't really know why, it's just a wonderful animated film in its own right. I liked it as a kid. And recently, I saw it again for the first time in years. It proved out to be more effective than I thought it as going to be. It just shows that films like this will probably last forever.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Ever!!,"Snow White is easily the best animated feature ever produced. Spectacular animation, good, evil, romance and the best music ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
And I suppose `The Pickwick Papers' was Charles Dickens's best novel,"What was the first X-rated animated film?  Most people who have any kind of clue at all would say `Fritz the Cat', but they'd be wrong.  It's `Snow White'! - which received the equivalent of an X-rating in South Africa. (Parts of it ARE grisly, even if the Grimm brothers' story was more grisly still: in the story, the Queen asked for Snow White's lungs and liver - with the intention of eating them.)  This should dispel anyone's idea that the film is all cloying sentimentality.Here's another one: `Gone with the Wind' was the biggest box office hit of the 1930s, but what was the second biggest?  Oh, well, I guess everyone here knows the answer to that one.  It must be said that the second-biggest hit deserved its success far more than the first.`Snow White' can boast other things, too.  But let's not get carried away and say that in addition it's the BEST film of the 1930s, or the best animated film of all time, or Disney's supreme masterpiece, or something silly of that kind.  It clearly isn't any of these things.  Let's distinguish between `good considering that it's a first effort' and good simpliciter, and see how `Snow White' rates.Many things are good simpliciter.  Although the visual spectacle is dwarfed by that of `Pinocchio' and `Fantasia' - to name but two - it's still visual spectacle, and it still works.  Some of the special effects can still startle us.  (I have absolutely no idea how they managed to get that shot of Snow White's reflection in well, for instance.)  The art direction vividly creates a world of cosy dwellings surrounded by choking forest.  The use of colour is as marvellous and subtle as anything the studio produced after 1942 (if not quite up to the standards set by `Fantasia' or `Bambi').  In fact, every single feature after `101 Dalmations' (1961) fails to measure up to `Snow White' so far as colour is concerned.  A muted, watercolour effect (achieved WITHOUT actual watercolours) is enlivened by the rare splash of brilliance on the Queen's cape or on the poisoned apple, but there's more to it than that.  Note how we're not shown a wide palette of colours until the dwarfs appear, when it seems that every hue under the sun makes its way onto the screen.  The dwarfs are the only rounded characters, representing, between them, all aspects of humanity.  (Brilliantly animated, by the way.) It's surprising, or perhaps it isn't, that in an age in which computers allow art directors to fiddle around with the colour balance as much as they like, no-one seems to be able to use colour nearly so effectively.But there are also signs that the art wasn't yet ripe.  The most obvious one is the limited range: `Snow White' never does anything more than a particularly good pantomime might do (which is more than you might think), and while this isn't even a flaw, it does mean that the film simply can't compare with the broader masterpieces Disney produced immediately afterwards (`Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo', `Bambi').  In 1937, Disney (and Hand and everyone else at the studio) still didn't know what to do to make a well-proportioned cartoon over an hour in length.  After the dwarfs have been around for a while the film starts to lose its way.  It even has to resort to title-card narration, indicating that while the first part of the story had been thought through properly, the rest hadn't been.  And there are minor technical difficulties throughout, with awkward animation of Snow White here, a clumsy use of the multiplane camera there.Don't get me wrong.  It's a lovely film, among the better ones the studio has produced.  We do it no service when we exaggerate its virtues.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's true, I think that the first movie Disney made was and remains the best.

Also they should have credited the actors. Their hard work just goes for nothing; at least no one knoes who they are.Snow White and the seven dwarfs is still the fairest of them all!

An Achievement,"The fair Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but the handsome prince has other ideas.Looking back now (2015), after 75 years, you could be a bit critical of the film.

But put it all in context.This was, for all practical purposes, the first full-length animated feature.

One of the most revolutionary films ever created,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is at the same time the first Disney animated feature and the first feature-length animated film of all time. Without it, who knows of we'd ever get animation as we know it today, since these things were unimaginable back then. And that alone makes it worthy of some mad respect! And the fact that it holds up so well to this day only furthers that point.Now, I like 3D animation, but I prefer the old-school, 2D animation style. And this really looks gorgeous, especially considering the time it was made. There's not as much work put into backgrounds compared to some later Disney films, but the backgrounds still look like paintings anyway. The movements look pretty nice too, except for the prince looking a bit odd, but supposedly he was really hard to animate. The characters themselves are pretty likeable too. Some might find Snow White annoying because of her high-pitched voice, but I think she's adorable. This Snow White is THE Snow White, as she will probably be the first to come to mind when you mention the character. And while there might be seven of the dwarfs, not one of them feels pushed aside and each one manages to have his own distinct personality in less than 90 minutes, which is kind of an amazing achievement when you think about it. One (Grumpy) even has a character arc which actually enhances the emotion largely in some scenes near the end, I'd go as far to say that he's the overlooked emotional drive of the third act, just not put into focus of the situation. Let's take a look at the human characters now. Snow White is a Mary Sue, there's no denying that. But this was the first Disney princess, I think we can forgive that. Same goes for The Prince, but he's actually barely in the movie, so does it really matter? The Evil Queen is such an iconic villain in both of her forms throughout the movie and sets a high bar for Disney villains yet to come, a bar that still managed to be surpassed. The Huntsman has something unique to him as well, but he's not much in the movie either. There is, however, one side character that I found very mysterious and intriguing: The Magic Mirror. It's creepy, has an incredible design and oozes with mystery. The story is pretty thin and slowed down by random scenes that feel like filler, but hey, they are a fun filler that helps develops the personalities of each of the dwarves. And keep in my mind that Disney was starting out with storytelling, so it needed some time to improve. However, this movie isn't so much about what is done, it's about how it's done. And don't even get me started on the ending, which I consider among the greatest of all time. With barely any talking at all, it mostly relies on the technical aspects. Haunting music leading to a triumph and heavenly imagery that makes the eyes pop out, it's a thing to behold and might even tear you up a bit if you're a nostalgia freak.While it's not a perfect movie and it has its flaws, its charm and the fact that it's a cinematic milestone makes it more than deserving of a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Landmark,"What else can be said about this film? Much more than the first full length animated motion picture, it is a testament to the will and vision of Walt Disney.

There is so much love and devotion thrown into this film, I severely doubt it will ever stop being such a classic (that is, not considering the beautiful animation, drawings and songs, which easily put to shame many modern animation films).And Adriana Caselloti's voice... wow.

The animation and visuals are way ahead of their time. I'm still trying to figure out how they achieved certain scenes. The most astonishing aspect of the visuals is the use of shadows. It's a Technicolor masterpiece that should be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Although I must admit, some parts of the film are dated, notably the dialogue and the storytelling and the fact that Snow White is a stereotypical housewife. She cleans the house, cooks dinner, makes pies, and is not very bright. Nevertheless, she kicked off the Disney Princess trend as well as the animated film trend.

A good fairy tale,"dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
the best movie of all time!,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is by far the best movie that Disney has ever released... funny that it was also their first.

Ahead of its time,"Imagine traveling back in time to the 1950s and going to a movie theater that's playing some awful z-grade sci-fi/horror film. Now take that film out of the projector and replace it with Jurassic Park. Can you imagine the absolute terror and panic that would grip the audience? And they thought Frankenstein was scary!While people may not think much of Snow White today, and some even find it offensive, it's best to try to imagine yourself, not at home in front of your giant TV streaming it on Disney+ and quietly (or loudly) judging it, but as part of a cinema crowd in 1937, who has only seen mostly black and white animated shorts, and not a feature length animated film in full color and what seem to be real life three dimensions. For a 1937 audience a movie like this may have caused some anxiety and panic, as well as excitement and a sense of wonder that every good filmmaker aspires to. It may have felt like Walt Disney had brought this film from the future, but we now know the he was pretty much inventing the future of animated film.Because he took a short fairy tale and lengthened it out to a feature film, Snow White had a lot of ""filler."" But that filler, for me, makes up the most memorable parts. My favorite example is the washing up before dinner scene. It comes with a cute and catchy song and a dozen sight gags. It didn't really move the plot forward, but who cares? It really let you know a lot about these hardworking mine workers.If you're a fan of Encanto or any other modern animated Disney (or Pixar, or DreamWorks) film, just remember that none of them would have happened without Walt Disney first breaking all these technical barriers and bringing the simplest of fairy tales to life.Maybe it hasn't stood the test of time in regards to modern sensibilities (the stolen kiss, for example), but it still looks as good as, and sometimes better than, traditionally animated films of the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superior to the Cartoons released today by Disney Studios,A beautifully colored and wonderfully depicted story of the Snow White tale. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs(1937) is one of the few Walt Disney pictures that I think is any good.  Tends the water of fairy tale and horror.  This is the film that is what many Disney films have tried to live up to and some failed.  A very good film that is made special by the early use of Technicolor.  Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs(1937) made an impression on many Italian horror filmmakers who would use this impression to do some of the best Italian horror films ever.  The use of color in here would influence Dario Argento to fashion his film Suspiria(1977) after the style and look of this animated feature.,,Anonymous,Animation
An Entertaining Classic,"Disney's first Full-length animated movie is still enjoyable to watch in the current year. Since it's set in a fantasy setting in the far past, combined with just how much passion is visible, it's guaranteed to be a timeless classic to show to your kids. Snow White is filled with kindness and generosity, and aside from the infamous Apple scene, she's a great roll model for any little kid! The Dwarves are entertaining in a classic slapstick way, and yet it almost never feels mean spirited. None of the characters have incredible depth or anything like that, but the movie is a simple and fun adventure for anyone who is a fan of fairy tales.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
WOW,"Before we go into any details, I suggest you put on your protective goggles, strap in, and go for the main feature. Prepare to be dazzled with sharp images and excellent sound that stay true to the original film.As with all Disney products, there is a lot of schmaltz explaining to themselves how great they are. In this case, I will have to agree with them. The platinum edition of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" makes it well worth trading in your old version or just retiring it. The two-disk edition has more information than can be absorbed in one sitting.There are a lot of DVD's goodies or extras. I must mention a few. This takes advantage of your remote control for navigation. To help you decide you have the magic mirror as a guide through both disks and all the feature sections. The magic mirror reminds me of the morose robot in Douglas Adams' ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""The only negative comment I have is on the second disk as you navigate the menus do not highlight like they should and leave you guessing as to what you have selected until you press the OK button.If I had looked at the features first, I would have found a game. ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"", which required me to go back to the feature, as I could not remember all the details it asked about. Some of the feature information is redundant. Some will require reading. One of the posters that were displayed looked like an advertisement for ""Campbell's Cream of Dwarfs Soup.""There is a Barbra Streisand version of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" which was distracting (no offense Barbra) and would have been much better left sounding like Janet McDonald.The printed Grimm's version of the Snow-White story was an eye-opener.You know when things are not as good, exciting, or scary as you remember.

Stepping stone for more animation features to follow,"(1937) Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs
FAMILY ANIMATIONFirst Disney theatrical cartoon ever shown and from Walt Disney, a concept from a popular fairy tale written by the Brothers Grimm in the early 1900's! Story has young girl searching for her identity, oblivious that her mother was once a queen but died upon giving birth to Snow White, eventually would have to cross heads with the other evil queen who has attempts to take her life since according to her magical ball, Snow White is the fairest one of all- people pretty much know the rest and to explain anything more is kinda pointless! I liked this cartoon when I first saw it and still do, except that it's slightly outdated when the amount of animation has become so sophisticated and shown a lot, all the time with cartoon channels running 24 7, and then theirs the Japan animation stuff ( when a percentage for aimed for adults).

Phenomenal,"One of the most important films of all time, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", is,now, often denigrated as old-fashioned and kitsch. But at the time of it's release, Snow White drew in more customers than any film ever made up to that point. And, if we are to believe Roy Disney, it made more money that year than all other films released that year combined. It was bigger than ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"", and everything starring Pauley Shore.But, then, it was released in 1937. In 1937, these other films were released. (And I love them all.)The Awful Truth, A Star Is Born, The Good Earth, Camille, The Life of Emile Zola, Dead End, A Day At The Races, and Stage Door.Snow White, like it or not, was the beginning of a new genre. And it is a genre unique in that it is limited to film, not theatre. Though it utilizes actors in it's beginnings, the imagination of the artist takes over in it's ultimate realization.And,frankly, I don't have a problem with that.A phenomena.

The characters are cute and comical, and their features are well drawn.And we must not forget the animation. The carefully drawn trees are impressive, and the roughness of the rain is astonishing. The reflections of the water and the bubbles are so well drawn that it is hard to believe that they were drawn by hand.It is a good work that teaches us the importance of living life without giving up in order to make our dreams come true.

"A Timeless, timeless classic, a must see.","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of generations of viewers since its release in 1937. Despite being nearly a century old, the film's enduring popularity is a testament to its remarkable storytelling, unforgettable characters, and stunning animation.At the time of its release, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a ground-breaking achievement in the world of cinema. It was the first full-length animated feature film ever created, and it set a new standard for the art form that would influence generations of animators to come.But even beyond its historical significance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remains a truly great film. Its timeless story of love, jealousy, and redemption is as resonant today as it was nearly a century ago. The characters are memorable and lovable, from the innocent and kind-hearted Snow White to the mischievous and endearing dwarfs.The film's animation is also a marvel to behold. Despite its age, the artistry and attention to detail in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remain impressive, with vivid colours, fluid movements, and expressive character designs that still hold up today.In short, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be an old film, but it is one that has stood the test of time. It is a true masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and it will continue to capture the imaginations of viewers for generations to come.The story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has several psychological aspects that are worth exploring. One of the most interesting is the dynamic between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Each of the dwarfs has a unique personality and represents a different aspect of human nature, making them intriguing psychological archetypes.For example, Doc is the leader of the group and represents wisdom and order, while Grumpy is stubborn and resistant to change, representing the resistance to new experiences. Bashful embodies shyness and insecurity, and Happy represents joy and contentment. Sneezy and Dopey represent physical limitations and mental challenges, respectively, while Sleepy represents rest and the need for rejuvenation.Snow White, on the other hand, represents purity, innocence, and beauty. Her relationship with the dwarfs highlights the power of human connection and the importance of different personalities coming together to form a supportive community.The film's villain, the wicked queen, also has psychological significance as a symbol of envy, vanity, and jealousy. Her obsession with beauty and youth is a common theme in psychology and can be seen as a warning about the dangers of superficiality and the pursuit of perfection.Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a rich psychological story that explores a range of human emotions and behaviours through its diverse cast of characters.

Presenting the First Ever Animated Biggie of World Cinema and Biggest Animated Hit of All Time with deserving Legacy,"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937) :
Brief Review -Presenting the First Ever Animated Biggie of World Cinema and Biggest Animated Hit of All Time with deserving Legacy. I don't know what achievements world cinema had seen in Animation by 1937 when Talkies were running riot at Box Office and Award shows but i know this that Walt Disney brought Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and changed Hollywood cinema forever. I don't need to mention how Animated classics have been loved over the years but it is important to acknowledge that it all begun with this film. Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is so amazing, beautiful, amusing and sweet film that i just couldn't hate it for moment. A fairy tale with fine touch of realistic world doesn't fumble at all and becomes a nostalgic mania. The story itself is so fascinating as we meet a Young and charming Princess who works as a Maid in her own palace because of her stepmother, a vain queen. She falls in love with a handsome Prince then runs away and starts living with Seven Dwarfs in the hills but cruel fate doesn't stop chasing her. I must say, the originality and completeness of the writing made many people to borrow the elements and bring stuff inspired from it. It has been influential for years and will remain so forever because such captivating stories will always work in any era. Creators put all the creativeness and innovative ideas into presentations and how? Possibly upto the last level of thinking of how could you present this scene with magical yet fascinating way. I genuinely felt what else could you derived in cinematic Liberty than this? So freaking awesome it is. Music is fantastic and pleasing which has the legacy for valid reasons. One of the biggest victory for the makers is speeding of the film because audience was experiencing something like this for the first time and if it had been slow and glide then engaging factors would have faltered. Fortunately, the film doesn't have a single useless and boring scene that can be overlooked or skipped even in repeat watch. Direction is just perfect I don't know how to explain it as i am not a kid but still enjoyed it like a kid. The commercial succe of this film was needed or else Hollywood would have never dared to make more Animated flicks and we would have missed many classic films. Nowadays we have so many animated films with innovative and highly intelligent ideas but what Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs archived 8 decades ago is REMARKABLE ! Disney kick-started the animated fantasy world with the bang and with and unforgettable experience. A Must Watch for any age, on any day and any time.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

First but not best,"One thing is for sure, that this is not ""The Greatest Animated Film Of All Time"". I mean, it definitely used to be but just for 3 years, until the second Disney animated movie came out.I'm adding at least one star because of the historical significance of this movie, and another one for the songs that became universally recognizable. This movie is a prodigy for the time, but for today's standards it's quite boring: dated dialogue, dull color palette ranging from browns to greys, and for more than half of the movie nothing happens. Most of the characterization is reserved to the dwarfs, while the ""humans"" of the story are left quite undeveloped.However, we owe so much to this movie that it would be improvident to bash it too much.

THE INCREDIBLE BEGINNING OF ANIMATION,"I think ""Snow White"" is very underrated. That is, practically all of Disney's filmography and animation in general is based and influenced by ""Snow White"". I have seen films since 1915, and even before, also many short films. And when you see a full-length color film, just for that simple fact, it is already a fundamental milestone. In addition to that, the not-so-easy adaptation of a story into something animated is quite good indeed. You have a smile throughout practically the entire film. I think that trying to make a critique without taking these details into account is a total lack of common sense and respect for this work. It is true that later on many of the scenes presented here would end up being movie clichés, but seeing this in 1937... you left the movie theater unable to believe how magnificent it was. They surely felt like they were in the future, incredible!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Review: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is more than just an animated film-it is a milestone in cinema history and one of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Released in 1937, this movie was the first-ever full-length animated feature, and even after so many decades, it remains impressive. I loved every detail of this animation, and I can confidently say that it is one of Disney's best works.A Revolution in CinemaFirst and foremost, it is impossible to talk about Snow White without acknowledging its technical and historical importance. Until then, animation was limited to short films, and no one believed a cartoon could hold an audience's attention for over an hour. However, Walt Disney defied all expectations, investing years of work and millions of dollars to create this classic. The result? A film that moved audiences back then and continues to captivate children and adults today.The visuals are incredibly well-crafted for their time. The animation was hand-drawn with an impressive level of detail, and the use of Technicolor brings each scene to life. The characters' movements are fluid, and the backgrounds are stunning, with a depth that few animated films managed to replicate until much later. The use of rotoscoping to give Snow White's movements more realism adds an elegance that makes her feel almost lifelike.A Simple but Powerful StoryThe story itself is based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and follows young Princess Snow White, whose beauty sparks the envy of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Consumed by jealousy, the Queen orders her to be killed, but the huntsman assigned to the task refuses to go through with it. Snow White flees into the forest and finds refuge in the home of the Seven Dwarfs. However, the Queen discovers her whereabouts and poisons her with an enchanted apple, leading to the iconic scene where the prince's kiss awakens her from deep sleep.What makes this story so special is how it is told. Even with a relatively simple plot, the film balances humor, emotion, and suspense masterfully. The forest scenes, for example, are genuinely frightening, especially for a child. The moments with the dwarfs, on the other hand, bring levity and humor, while Snow White's relationship with the animals reinforces her charm and kindness.Memorable CharactersThe characters are another highlight of the film. Snow White is sweet, kind, and full of innocence. Some people today might see her as somewhat passive, but that is part of her nature and the context of the time. She wins over audiences with her heart and kindness, and it's impossible not to root for her.The Evil Queen is simply one of the best villains Disney has ever created. Her presence is intimidating, her coldness is terrifying, and her transformation into the old hag is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Her death, falling from a cliff, is one of the darkest and most dramatic moments of the movie.The Seven Dwarfs provide the film's comic relief and charm. Each one has a unique personality, making them easily recognizable and lovable. Dopey, for instance, is hilarious without saying a single word, while Grumpy has a subtle yet touching character arc, shifting from grumpy to showing he truly cares about Snow White.An Unforgettable SoundtrackAnother aspect that makes this film so incredible is its soundtrack. Songs like ""Heigh-Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", and ""Whistle While You Work"" are timeless. Each song fits perfectly within its scene and contributes to the overall mood. The original voice acting is also outstanding, with Adriana Caselotti's (Snow White) sweet voice adding even more charm to the character.Cultural Impact and Disney's MagicThe impact of Snow White on cinema and popular culture cannot be overstated. This film laid the foundation for everything Disney built afterward. Without it, we probably wouldn't have movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or Frozen.Additionally, the movie helped solidify Disney's image as the home of magic and fairy tales. Many of the elements we now consider classic in Disney films-such as the princess, the iconic villain, and the unforgettable music-began here.Final ThoughtsUltimately, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not just a movie-it is a work of art. It features stunning animation for its time, a memorable soundtrack, unforgettable characters, and a simple yet deeply emotional story.Yes, some aspects might feel outdated, such as the protagonist's more passive role and the whirlwind romance with the prince. But none of that diminishes the impact and beauty of this classic. For me, it remains one of Disney's finest works and one of those movies that never lose their magic, no matter how many times you watch them.If you've never seen it or haven't watched it in years, I strongly recommend giving it another chance. This film is the definition of Disney magic in its purest form and proves that even after almost 90 years, animation has the power to enchant every generation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Every Disney Movie Reviewed (#1),"As you probably know, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves was Disney's first dive into the world of feature-length movies, and for what it is... it's pretty good. I'm not head-over-heels in love with this movie like some other people may be, mostly because Disney didn't really master stretching a story out to a full hour-and-a-half as they would later on, but I still think this movie's great. The animation has aged incredibly well, especially considering this was only 9 years after Steamboat Willie, you can definitely see the improvements. As for the story, it does have one, but a lot more focus is put on admittedly entertaining scenes that really only exist to pad out the runtime. The pacing is definitely the movie's major problem, as you've probably heard a lot of others say. The characters are alright. The dwarves are definitely the most entertaining and dynamic characters, a lot of the movie's comedy come from them. But Snow White and the Queen are pretty bland. And Snow White's rotoscoped face is the only bit of animation that has not aged well here, it just looks uncanny. Music has always been a staple for Disney movies, and this one has some pretty good songs, especially Whistle While You Work and Heigh-Ho. Oh yeah, and the ending is really abrupt. But honestly, despite its flaws, this was quite a strong start to the Disney Animated Canon, and to Disney movies as a whole. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pale face. She must have the cold sun.,"Disney was known for ripping off other stories and turning them into Disney Hash. Stories like Snow White, Lion King, Princess and the Frog to say a few are all unoriginal stories that Disney used. I want to say steal, but I'm not sure of the Copyright rules for such stories. Most of the original stories were very dark and Disney gave it a lighter tone in order to deceive, manipulate children.Snow White was another unoriginal stories. At face value, the movie was pretty solid and looks innocent to say the least. The music, characters, were wonders. I'm a str8 dude and I would choose to watch Snow-White 37 than current animation nonsense because the movie was so calming and not annoying.The Story is of a damsel who likes singing to little critters, meets dwarves, and she falls into a deep sleep and only a chad can wake her up.A story that may have been unoriginal turned into Disney Hash was a solid film, no doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's First Film Is So Wonderful That Even Hitler Loved It.,"A long time ago, a man named Walt Disney entered Hollywood and made cartoon shorts with an animated rodent named Mickey Mouse. A few shorts later, he proposed an idea of making a feature length animated film. This was deemed ""Disney's Folly"", after all, who would want to sit through a 90-minute cartoon?Walt proved the hecklers wrong, and he made one of the greatest movies ever made, which the American Film Insitute calls the #1 animated film of all time- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It's one of my Top 10 favorite Disney movies, and even Hitler considered it to be his favorite movie. When your movie can win the heart of a wicked dictator like Hitler, you've made something special.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has a pretty simple story. Snow White is a princess, named after the color of her beautiful skin. Her evil stepmother becomes envious when her magic mirror tells her that Snow White is the most beautiful in the land, and she plots to kill Snow White to take that rank. For her safety, a huntsman warns her to hide, and she finds shelter at the cottage of 7 little men, who mine diamonds in the daytime.Snow White is beautifully animated, using paints and still images combined to make consistent images- like a sheet for Snow White's hair, her head, her dress, etc. Considering that this is the first animated feature film, it's impressive to see all the detail put in, like the walls of roofs of buildings, and spiders crawling out of a dusty container that the Queen kicks.The songs are nice as well- Heigh Ho being the catchiest, and I'm Wishing, The Dwarf's Yodeling Song, and Someday My Prince Will Come being other notable ones.The cast works well too- Adriana Caselotti voices Snow White and her high pitch gives her a sweet personality. Sadly for her, she struggled to find work after this because her voice was too recognizable- any role she did, she would have been seen as ""Oh, that's Snow White"" not ""That's Adriana Caselotti."" (That said, she does say ""Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"" in The Wizard of Oz.)Harry Stockwell has a strong voice singing as The Prince, and Lucille La Verne does an excellent job as The Queen, with her envy flowing through her vocal cords. She even offered to voice the Old Lady that she transforms into, and after a few failed tries, she excused herself and returned with the right voice. When asked how she did it, she simply responded ""Oh, I just took my teeth out."" The dwarf actors, deserve praise for their voice work as well- as do the other performers.Like I said, this was deemed to be Disney's Folly, and it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to make- causing Walt to be in debt with the bank. Luckily, those critics were proven wrong. The film was a huge financial success (with adjusted inflation, it is still the highest grossing animated movie of all time, and it's considered by many to be the greatest animated film ever made. And rightfully so.)Think about it. What's your favorite animated movie? Mine is The Prince of Egypt, but my favorite Disney movie is Toy Story. Whether you love The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, or whatever else, that movie exists because Walt didn't give up on his passion and gave us Snow White on December 21st, 1937.And for that, we should all take a moment to thank Walt Disney. Because of his passion and hard work, we have one of the finest movies ever made, regardless of the fact that it is animated. Or- maybe because of it. In fact, even if another animated movie had never been made, it would be worth it, because it is a glorious piece of filmmaking.There is talk of a remake of this movie in the works- with a Colombian-American playing the princess with skin as white as snow, where she is a feminist who makes the men clean the house and isn't saved by The Prince.Such a film is not only unnecessary, but spits in the face of the legacy of Walt. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not even about a servant turned princess- but one of a kind girl who finds her true love. And for Walt, it is a story of proving those who discourage you wrong and succeeding in your dreams.Snow White and the Seven Dwrfs is what started Disney and I fear that the remake might be what ends it. I hope that those who have been making it consider this and end the production and leave Walt's masterwork alone.This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made, not only for being the first animated movie ever made, but for being a story that has endured and been beloved by many for the last 87 years. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs isn't Walt's Folly, it is his masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Movie Milestone,"Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland. Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project. Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint. The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy. In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect. It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often). All the songs stand out in their own way. 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad. 'Heigh-Ho,' 'Dig, Dig, Dig,' and 'Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework. And my favorite, 'The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song. As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced. The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world. Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A review on all three classic films of the Disney ""Triangle""","With all the films I've commented on, I'm running out of available comments. Now I'm resorting to commenting on Disney films, and I'm commenting on all three of the Disney ""triangle"" as I call it. So here it goes-The Disney triangle which I'll explain later, are all three classics. I think they should all be at least somewhere on the top 250 but 2 of them are not. Too many people just don't get them. But regardless of what it's rated, everyone knows famous Disney classics like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Alice in Wonderland are the classic Dinsey triangle. So if you need a true family entertaining classic, rent one of these truly classic films. They're all great, and carry wonderful hidden messages.JOHN ULMER",,Anonymous,Animation
Snow White and the Secen Dwarfs,"I thought this film was good considering it came out in 1937. The film is centered around a innocent girl that just wants for a prince to fall in love with her and come take her away. Which is the dream of several young girls. But the girl falls victim to a evil queen that does not want her around so she casts her out. The girl is taken in by seven, well, Dwarfs, that all have a different personality. The are good and funny. They treat her very well and make her feel welcome. This film is a fun American classic. I love the drama with the music score as well, it really helps move this film and make it fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Revolutionary,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is one of the most important films of all time. As the first ever full-length animated feature, Walt Disney was continuously mocked by the press for risking the future of his studio on such an experimental project. Luckily for Walt, ""Snow White"" shines as a marvel of animation, and is still a heartfelt viewing experience over eighty years after its release.Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a scullery maid and the step-daughter to the evil and vile Queen (Lucille La Verne). The Queen is told by her Magic Mirror (Moroni Olsen) that Snow White is ""the fairest of them all"", which prompts the Queen into getting a huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) to kill her. Snow White flees and finds solace in the home of seven dwarfs who mine gemstones.It's a pretty simple story. The movie is only 83 minutes long, and much of that run time is merely music and dancing characters. While it lacks much substance, it is the style and beauty of the animation seamlessly blending with sound effects and music that make this little movie such a treat. The dwarfs and the forest animals are also cute and funny as more comedic characters. Particular favorites of mine are Dopey and the tortoise.Overall this comes as an absolute recommendation for anyone who is in love with animated film and fairy tales. Although the Disney formula and the art of animation would both improve and be refined in later works, this is an essential jumping off point for anyone who wants to get into these movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Holds a special place in the history of animation,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved animated films of all time. Released in 1937, it was the first full-length animated feature produced by Walt Disney Productions. The film tells the story of Snow White, a beautiful princess who is forced into hiding from her evil stepmother, the Queen, who is jealous of Snow White's beauty.One of the standout aspects of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is its stunning animation. Considering it was made over 80 years ago, the level of detail and artistry is remarkable. The hand-drawn animation brings the characters and the story to life in a visually captivating way. The use of vibrant colors and intricate backgrounds creates a magical and enchanting atmosphere that draws viewers into the fairy tale world.The characters in the film are memorable and endearing. Snow White, with her kindness, innocence, and beautiful singing voice, quickly becomes a beloved heroine. The Seven Dwarfs, each with their distinct personalities and humorous quirks, provide both comic relief and heartwarming moments. The villainous Queen is also iconic, with her menacing presence and her transformation into the wicked witch adding an element of suspense and danger.The music in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is another standout feature. The film features several memorable songs, including ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" which have become classics in their own right. The music enhances the storytelling and adds to the overall charm of the film.The story itself is a timeless fairy tale with themes of love, jealousy, and the triumph of good over evil. It captures the imagination and appeals to audiences of all ages. While some aspects may be seen as dated by today's standards, such as the portrayal of gender roles and the somewhat simplistic narrative, it's important to remember the historical context in which the film was made.Overall, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its beautiful animation, memorable characters, enchanting music, and timeless story continue to captivate audiences of all generations. It holds a special place in the history of animation and remains a must-watch for any fan of Disney or animated films in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Teen Moves in With 7 Middle-Aged Men...,"Yeah, this is a weird setup, but it's pure unalloyed fairy tale par excellence. It's not meant to be taken seriously.Snow White is a cheerful and innocent girl who can talk to animals and convince them to do chores for her. Her stepmother hates her guts because she has a magical mirror that says Snow White is more attractive than her, so she puts a hit on her head. The guy who's supposed to make her sleep with the fishes can't do it and tells her to shove off and never return.Well, she runs into the forest and meets 7 dwarves who work in the mines and the dwarves grow to appreciate having a feminine presence around the house.This is a visual feast. Not only is it superbly animated, but most of the characters, particularly the dwarves, are very expressive (in fact most are named after their most salient characteristic).Oddly the three main human characters' faces are ill-defined. Perhaps that was on purpose as they just represent archetypes? (Snow White representing ebullient feminine youth, the queen representing female jealous a la Hera, the prince just a deus ex machina). Nevertheless, it doesn't extend to every human. The scene with the hunter unable to deal the coup de grace is superbly dramatic and the queen's face comes alive with giddy wickedness as the old hag.As for the backgrounds and settings, they're full of grand scenes you won't soon forget. The dungeon scene and the final confrontation on the cliff might just stay with you permanently.The plot is pure fluff but this movie isn't about plot. It's about recapturing the wonder of traditional European fairy tales, which themselves are only rough outlines of the most primal of human archetypes and the barest of universal human scenarios.It's a brick house. Built to last.Honourable Mentions: Game of Thrones (2011). Peter Dinklage brings the character of Tyrion Lannister to life. Without a doubt the most serious and nuanced representation of a dwarf character I have seen in a work of fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Someday My Prince Will Come""","This is one of the first Walt Disney fairy tales of my childhood. Every time I rewatch the film I fall asleep. I really like two songs in this fairy tale. The first song is the dwarfs' song when they work in the mine and then get ready to go home. The second song is Snow White's song. ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is perhaps the most beautiful and gloomy song. Gloomy, because in real life the Prince will never come into your life. Real life is not a fairy tale. But when you listen to the song, you begin to believe in it, because it is a fairy tale. This film has a huge history and legend, it has a huge meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic,"Review By Kamal KFor Disney's Very First Animated Feature & also the Very First Animated Movie in the Existence of Family Entertainment, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.Despite it being a Romance with the Main Character, Snow White & The Prince but overall i Mostly Enjoyed the Scenes with the Forest Animals cause their Cute & the Dwarfs cause their Hilarious & Entertaining throughout, And their Essential to the Entire Movie until near the End when Snow White was Awakened by the Prince's Kiss & Off to the Castle which we only get a Glimpse of from a Distance where Snow White & The Prince & his Horse stood Looking at.And my Top Favorite Part was the Climax of the Movie near the End when the Witch Walks out from the Dwarfs Cottage & The Dwarfs & Forest Animals Immediately go after Her & Chasing her up a Rocky Cliff where she couldn't go any Farther & is Eventually taking down by a Bolt of Thunder which cause's her to Fall Down & also having the Boulder Fall on Top of her to Insure she Died from the Fall.Anyway's i Liked the Movie, Mostly Because it was Disney's First Ever Movie which also Happens to be the Worlds First Animated Feature Film in the Existence of not only Theatrical Movie History but also Family Movie History.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Important from a Historical Perspective, Impressive from a Creative One","Disney set themselves a tough act to follow with their first-ever animated feature. An ambitious blend of wacky, stylized cartoon action and smooth, roto-scoped realism, Snow White still serves as a lovely slice of bright, cheery, kid-geared fantasy. Just seeing the whole thing through to the finish line was a significant achievement, amidst all the mainstream doubts and staggering financial risks. But it also stands tall on its own merits, from the bold, unforgettable character designs to the lasting, catchy musical interludes. I'm not sure the studio has ever matched this soundtrack, actually, both in terms of staying power and sheer sing-along-ability.A few unsightly seams might show - clumsy little tricks to avoid the difficult camera angles and puzzling plot machinations to trim troublesome characters (which explains why the charming prince disappears for most of the film) - but animators were literally flying by the seat of their pants here, experimenting on-stage to test the viability of their chosen medium. I could nitpick about a whole lot of small items, but in a broad sense, it's the rare film that can still easily captivate a willing audience after eighty-plus years in the can. That alone is an incredible testament to the dedication, tenacity and enduring skill of the whole team, and the quality of the finished product. Not perfect - in fact, this team would drastically improve the formula in subsequent efforts - but quite a first step.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It all Started with a Mouse, or Snow White?","Even though Mickey Mouse is Walt's creation, and Mickey is the symbol for everything Disney related, it was actually Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that was Walt Disney Studios' first fully animated feature film.I grew up with a big love as so many of us for Disney, especially Pixar movies. Growing up streaming services like Disney + weren't a thing, not even dvd's and later on blu-ray existed when I was just a 5-year old watching Disney classics with my mom on a Sunday afternoon.When the cinema around the corner from where I live announced they were doing a """"Disney 100"" ''marathon'' and announced they were going to show some of Disney's best and most classical movies I knew I had to go and try and watch them all (even though they are literally free and I have a big tv right here at home).Throughout the movie I was fascinated with how much everything has changed throughout the years but also how good the quality is thinking this movie is years and years old, it first came out when my grandfather was born and he is now 86!Snow White will forever be my favorite princess and of course the best thing about the movie are her 7 friends! I would have quite liked to have had a second movie to see what happened next with Snow White but especially with the dwarfs.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Magic Around Her: Why ""Snow White"" Still Shines","""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" isn't a classic just because it was the first full-length animated feature in color with synchronized sound-it's a classic because Walt Disney understood that telling an animated story goes way beyond bringing the main characters to life. The real heart of the film isn't Snow White herself, who's a sweet protagonist but almost feels like a supporting character in her own story. She's there more to inspire the actions of others than to actually take action. What makes the film beat, what keeps it fresh and fascinating even today, is the vibrant universe Disney built around her-the quirky seven dwarfs, the Evil Queen with her sinister aura, and, of course, the enchanted forest that breathes, haunts, and dazzles in every frame.Disney's greatest achievement was realizing that animation had limitless potential to create entire worlds. While most cartoons of the time were limited to quick gags with characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, ""Snow White"" expanded the very idea of visual storytelling. Every frame is a spectacle in itself, packed with meticulous details that make the scenery feel like a living organism. The use of the multiplane camera was a game-changer: by creating layers of depth, Disney gave animation a three-dimensional feel, where the trees in the forest aren't just part of the background-they seem to lurk, reach out, and take part in the action. This visual dynamism transforms even simple scenes, like Snow White's frantic escape through the woods, into moments of pure, dreamlike terror, where the environment is as much a protagonist as she is.Another brilliant aspect is the design of the supporting characters, especially the dwarfs. They're the soul of the film-not just because they provide comic relief, but because each one is a distinct visual and behavioral entity. Doc, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, and the gang aren't just ""types""-their personalities burst through thanks to the exaggerated animation of their bodies, their unique mannerisms, and even the way their clothes move. This kind of physical exaggeration, centered on gestures and body language, is a hallmark of Disney's style, working almost like choreography that ties the physics of the animation to the essence of the characters.The contrast between the dwarfs' lightheartedness and the Queen's almost gothic horror vibe is another of the film's strengths. The villain, with her angular face and imposing presence, is pure psychological terror-especially when she transforms into the old hag. The poisoned apple sequence feels straight out of a suspense thriller, complete with dramatic lightning and intense close-ups that ramp up the fear. The fact that the film doesn't water down these moments for its young audience is, ironically, what makes it so unforgettable. Disney knew that fear is part of the magic of fairy tales, and ""Snow White"" understands that enchantment comes from balancing the sweet with the dark.Even with all its technical and aesthetic innovations, what really makes ""Snow White"" stand the test of time is its narrative rhythm. The film rarely lets a scene sit still. If Snow White is singing, birds are dancing along with her; if the dwarfs are marching home, each one has a walk that reflects their personality. This constant energy is what keeps viewers-kids and adults alike-completely hooked. It's a film that never settles for just ""telling"" a story-it lives it in every animated detail.All in all, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" isn't just a historical milestone; it's a masterclass in how animation can be a complete art form. It's not just about nostalgia or paying homage to the past; it's a film that, even compared to today's cutting-edge technology, still impresses with its creative boldness. Walt Disney's genius wasn't in creating the perfect princess-it was in building a world where even a squirrel's blink or a turtle's stumble tells a story. And that's exactly why it lives on in our collective memory-a fairy tale that, ironically, survives not because of the princess, but because of everything happening around her.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpiece and watershed moment in cinema history.,"I've recently finished my Disneython (Disney marathon) where I watch Disney films back to back. It's something I do every 5 years or so. At 62 movies so far, that's a lot of movies. But one thing is certain. Disney has been a constant throughout film history and even through our darkest times.It's hard for me to even rate the first full length animated movie. This was a watershed moment not just in Disney history, but also in cinema history as well. This was the moment that proved to audiences that full length stories could be told just as well in animation. The benefit of an animated film is that it can tell great stories and display abstract ideas in a way that live action can't. It's one of the reasons why animation is very underrated as a cinematic art form. But I'm losing track of myself. I'm here to say whether or not ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is not just a classic film, but a masterpiece in animated storytelling. In short, it is.It's hard to believe that this movie is over 85 years old. The fairytale story of a young girl running away from her evil and vain stepmother only to befriend 7 dwarfs with names that match their personalities has continued to entertain audiences for several decades and it's timeless. It's not a bore and still remains one of the most iconic movies ever made.This was made at a time when animation was still hand drawn, and it took days or weeks just to draw one scene of animation. Walt Disney himself wanted a movie where every corner and dimension was alive and moving and he got just that. From top to bottom and from front to back, the whole frame is filled with beautiful watercolor inspired animation that still looks breathtaking more than eight decades later. Just look at the detail in the scene where Snow White is guided by her new animal friends and they pass a river where their reflections are shown in the water as they move. It's a testament to the talented animators at Disney Animation.There was nothing like ""Snow White"" at the time. Animation was still considered entertainment for young children which were typically six minute animated shorts with gags every minute before the main movie even started. This was the first time an animated movie was told in a three act structure and with pathos and emotion. Something that could appeal to all ages and not just children.""Snow White"" is without a doubt a masterpiece. Even famous filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein called it the greatest movie ever made. It's the shining jewel in Disney's crown and the foundation for even better movies to be made under the Disney label. To call Disney himself a genius would be an understatement and every animated film that has come out since then owes a debt of gratitude to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Alas, there's a lot of padding as time is spent on some cute forest creatures. The film picks up again with the entry of the seven dwarfs.

Little Diane cried uncontrollably but instead of Walt turning off the film and taking care of his daughter, he asked a Disney employee to take the girl outside so his employees could see the end of the film.

"It's not fantastic, but it's the first Disney classics","I enjoyed watching this movie as a kid and it looked awesome! When I watched it with a friend, it just sounds so cheesy and predictable. It's the first animated movie ever so I give them credit for it's creation and dedication. It won't be all adventurous and complex like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but it's simple and lighthearted (a good path for Disney's first movie).I got to be honest with you, but I can't stand Snow White! Her voice is do pitchy and annoying. She's so naive and sweet ugh! If I want a princess being my role model; I would turn to Belle for a Disney princess. I just don't like her. The Evil Queen is a lot prettier than Snow White. The Queen is one of my favorite Disney villains alone with Scar and Ursula. The Queen may have awful plans to become a hag (she should have turn Snow White into a hag instead of herself), but she's a ruthless and cold person in and out. She's arguably the best character that this movie has to offer. Second place are the woodland animals and third is the boulder.The animation looks really good, even from 1937. I really like the colors that the animators used and it looks nicely done. No CGI was used to animate this movie so don't expect Snow White to look like Rapunzek or Princess Fiona from Shrek (her ogre form is prettier than Snow White is). And the scene with the Queen's transformation is nicely done- if this was done by hand, why can't animators these days draw backdrops and things and such? As you read my reviews, I'm not a fan of CGI except Tangled and a few other films.Snow White may not be Disney's best work, but it is the first animated film ever created.

Its songs are totally unforgettable such as Heigh-Ho (which is one of my favourite Disney songs of all time), Whistle While You Work, Silly Song and Someday My Prince Will Come. It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic.I know it is the first animated film to be ever made by Disney. Disney are a total geniuses.My favourite characters are Grumpy, Doc, Sleepy, Dopey, Snow White and Evil Queen (she's also one of my favourite Disney villains of all time).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

great movie,"Its a great movie. If you have never seen snow white and the seven dwarfs you need to watch this movie.Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland. Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project. Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint. The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy. In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world. Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Where it All Started,"Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" succeeded even though Snow White herself is a bland character who primarily serves to inspire all of the fun side characters. She could be more expressive and funny, and other than being happy and cheerful doesn't offer a ton as a character in terms of personality or character development. The prince, suitably named The Prince, gets the same amount of background and character growth as thought that went into his name; none. At least Cinderella got Prince Charming. The Prince only shows up a few times in the movie and doesn't speak once. On top of that, Disney hardly follows the source material from the Brothers Grimm. This film was also very experimental, being Disney's first feature-length animated film and the first ever full-length animated feature in color. These aspects should have spelled disaster for this movie, but Disney knew what he was doing.""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is as much fun as it is because Disney made sure to build the world of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" without worrying too much about the story. Of course, the story is a classic fairy tale with a jealous evil witch, a prince and princess, and danger to overcome. Still, the fun side characters and cute animals make this film a classic and not just a historical milestone for animation. All the dwarfs aren't just given their personalities with their names but express them exaggeratedly and charmingly. When things get scary or tense for Snow White, the cute forest animals help her and provide relief for the kids watching. This movie moves briskly and doesn't waste any of its 83-minute run time, filling every frame with detail and moving swiftly from one classic song to another (""Heigh-Ho"").Some of that detail was realized due to Disney's innovation of the ""multiplane camera,"" simulating depth in animated films by having multiple drawings at different levels and moving them at different speeds and directions. This technique would be used for animated films for the next 60 years before computer animation took over. While ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" may feel cliché upon viewing in 2022, this all-time classic is what helped create most of the fairy tale movie tropes and clichés we've come to know, and the impact Disney made on the animation industry with this film in 1937 will be felt forever. 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I cried in the Sing A Little Song scene,"I don't even know why, but that song was incredibly moving to me. There wasn't even anything sad in that scene, just pure beautiful imagery. I never really watched this movie when I was a kid, but I wanted my little sibling to watch it because she likes princesses (she didn't care for the movie). But watching this film gave me a warm sense of comfort, like a bowl of warm soup in the dead of winter.The characters, while being very simple, are very effective in their roles. Snow White is the most generic out of all Disney protagonists but she's still a very fun character.Stunning, beautiful, inexplicably made me cry - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Iconic,"Based on a Grimm Brother's tale, this film tells the story of Snow White, a princess forced to hide from the hatred of her stepmother. Directed by David Hand and produced by Walt Disney, it has the participation of great voice actors. The soundtrack is a responsibility of Paul J. Smith, Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Soundtrack, this film earned to Disney the honorary statuette the following year.This film immediately won a place in history. Having been the first Walt Disney feature film, it was decisive for the evolution of what we know as animated film. Since the thirties, this movie has been in the lives of successive generations, despite having had few awards. In fact, its the definitive proof that awards don't immortalize a movie. Its ability to win public every year and persist in people's lives is, ultimately, the absolute consecration of a work of cinema.The script is simple but extraordinarily effective, adapting (almost rewriting and polishing) Grimm Brother's story. Snow White is a pre- teen girl, very naive and pure, as it was considered correct at the time (current audiences prefer a less candid approach). The Queen is the incarnation of evil and the perfect antagonist. The prince is the representation of the honest and faithful man, who saves the girl. And of course, we have the famous Seven Dwarfs, supporting characters who serve as comic element and come directly to the hearts of children, with their defects or characteristics, a rather clumsy way and a huge sense of generosity.The drawings are not as visually pleasing as will become in future films. Pencil lines are quite obvious and the colors are slightly alive. However, this technique was starting so that's something natural. The soundtrack is essential for any movie lover and contains one of the most famous songs from Disney films, ""Heigh Ho"", sung by the dwarfs when they return from their mine. The music perfectly accompanies the film and speak to the public with the same eloquence of the drawings.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless and great,"I first saw this as a child in the 50's, but recently bought the digitally remastered DVD. I bought it before it disappears forever in a cloud of Woke thinking. I hear that the Disney Studios are going to 'bring it up to date'. That fills me with a chill, because in the current climate, we are going through another McCarthyism that the Disney Studios themselves endured back in the 50's, but this is the opposite of the right, it's now the woke left subverting our thoughts. I wonder what the new version will be called. 'Gender Neutral Caucasian Monarchist and the Seven Vertically Challenged Non Gender Specific Mine Workers'? I dread to think what they'll call them. I will keep my DVD as a treasured memory of what was, not a fear of what is coming.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everything,"I love how the music tells the story as much as the animation and script. Used as beautiful punctuations throughout, it creates a visual and auditory feast, capturing the attention of even distractible little ones. I love the innocence of not only Snow White, but of ""The Prince"". I can't decide what my favorite part is.. when she sends the Prince a kiss via a dove.. it blushes, kisses him, then shows Snow White beaming as she shuts the curtains...I laugh every time. Or when she shrieks ""oh!!!"" in the cottage, scaring away all her woodland creature friends; then continues; ""what a cute little chair!"" as she settles down into it. Of course, not all of it ages well, but it is delightful every time I've watched it. Beloved classic. What a gift from Mr. Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A milestone in film and animation history, as well as a strong emotional story with strong resonance.","In a beautiful kingdom lives a vain Queen who everyday reassures herself of her status as ""the fairest of them all"" by asking her magic mirror to confirm it. When one day the mirror answers that her stepdaughter, Snow White is now the fairest of them all, the enraged and jealous queen sets forth her Huntsman to kill Snow White, unable to kill her the Huntsman begs her forgiveness and tells her to run as far as she can. Snow White befriends the forest creatures who take her to the cottage of Seven Dwarves named Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, Grumpy and Dopey who while initially reluctant to have Snow White in their home welcome her once they learn of the Queen's intentions to kill her. When the Queen finds out Snow White is still alive she enacts a plan to get rid of her forever.Released in 1937, Walt Disney's ambitious adaptation of the Grimm Faerie Tale Snow White was met with skepticism from many, including Walt's brother Roy. With the exception of a aborted animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter novels at MGM, animation was mostly used for short subjects or featurettes, such as Disney's Silly Symphonies and Alice Comedies. Production was rife with obstacles to the point Disney ended up taking a second mortgage to cover the film's budget. Many Hollywood insiders at the time predicted the film would flop nicknaming the film ""Disney's Foley"", and upon it's release became the highest grossing sound film of all time until it was displaced by Gone with the Wind. All these years later, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves still carries with it the same glorious animation and emotional resonance that helped redefine the capabilities of animation.It's pretty pointless to critique the plot of something like Snow White (down to the fact Disney themselves seem to do it every other day) and much like the source material from the Brothers Grimm story, you can point out logical leaps, plot holes, or any number of things you can read ""too deeply"" into for the sake of a smug laugh (as the Shrek franchise has built itself upon). The reason the story in Snow White works is because it plays on an emotional level. Snow White representing goodness, kindness, and humility in the face of a queen who's cruel, vindictive, spiteful, and sadistic creates the right dynamic for this type of story to work and draw the audience in making them forget about the fact they are watching a movie let alone all the technical details that have gone into the animation.The animation in Snow White is a gold standard for a reason, and a big reason for that is in how dynamic and versatile it is. The animation is beautiful, it's funny, it's intense, it's atmospheric, and covers pretty much all of the emotional spectrum getting all manner of reactions from audiences which helps create the needed audience investment. Every scene is rich in detail from the first frames with even scenes as seemingly minor as watching the Seven Dwarves sleeping filled with detail and vibrancy. While the dwarves are more rubbery and typical of animation standards, they serve as good points of balance against the more realistic looking woodland creatures or human characters that helps give the film a dynamic movement of all varieties. The animation on the Queen in particular is great because there are two versions of The Queen with a beautiful but very hardened starting model that oozes contempt and superiority, and a disguise model used later that works at bringing the ""true"" form of her character to light.Snow White and the Seven Dwarves along with Wizard of Oz is not just an important film in history, but also an enjoyable and emotional experience that you can't help but get wrapped up in. While years of homage, parody, and nitpicking have etched their ways into our collective minds leading to of course Shrek and its many, many, many clones, even after nearly 90 years its still left an impression and it probably still will for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The first animated movie,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) was the first animated movie in the history of cinema and it is one of the best animated movies of all time.Positives for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937):
The hand-drawn animation looks beautiful and it still hold up to this day. The movie has a simple story that is executed to perfection here. I love all the characters whether you're talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Evil Queen is one of the best villains in the history of cinema. You get a lot of cute and funny moments with Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs and the animals. There are also moments that are genuinely scary and this was when Disney used to have balls. The movie is short and has excellent pacing. And finally, the ending to this movie is one of the best endings ever.Mixed for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937):
The Prince has aspects to him that are very dated by today's standards, but they don't bother me.Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is is one of my favorite Disney movies and one of my favorite animated movies in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disney animation from the age before they became dull, predictable and saccharine","I watched this very soon after watching what was considered one of their 80s high points (though largely now forgotten), The Great Mouse Detective. I've also been forced to watch recent Disney fare like Frozen in recent times and can remember my feeling about them. It is years since I've watched Snow White.What a difference!This is an actual, proper attempt at a meaningful film, not some marketing or pandering exercise with paper thin intent, tiresome & predictable design & characters, and an OD of sugar or saccharine. Very refreshing.It feels far more like the masterpieces of animation that are still possible in Japan and were possible with Pixar but which Disney's shallowness has made impossible from them in decades.The quality of animation of figures has a naturalistic movement that is simply so far ahead of current Disney it isn't funny. And the backgrounds. Even with modern day computing power recent stuff is weak, while the second half of the 20th century stuff is just plain cheap and childish in comparison.There is also actual atmosphere. The noirish shadows, the angles, there is genuine foreboding.Pus it thankfully, so very thankfully, doesn't suffer from the pregnant pause face shots and poses that plague ends of scenes of so many of today's productions, animated or live action. If anything the transitions move a couple of seconds too quickly. But I'd still far rather have this older style of film making than the soapish current vogue.The music is also wonderful. I don't know whether they work because I've heard them all my life or because they are actually good. But they do.So, after all that, why not a 10? For 2 reasons.1) Snow White herself. She is so matronising and privileged. Not a pleasant characterisation. The singing voice is also rather twee.
2) The denouement simply isn't believable.If this film was made today like this I'd probably mark it 8, but given when it was made it deserves more, so a 9.Wonderful.",,Anonymous,Animation
In the Beginning,"""Before a young lion became a king, before a beauty tamed a beast and before Aladdin unleashed a genie there was a little mermaid who dreamed of something more..."" AND before all that...was this, the very first and still one of the very best.Snow White when held up to today's supposedly superior digital animation, well it may not be as glitzy but it definitely holds it's own especially against something like A Bug's Life (I hate computer animation)...what makes this film hold so well, is the love that can almost be seen in every frame, every tiny movement is a hundred HAND DRAWN animation drawings, hours and hours of work to create a masterpiece that is not really a child's movie.Today Disney is almost synonymous with childhood, but in the beginning it wasn't the case. Snow White wasn't really made as a kid's movie it was made as a family movie perhaps, but was definitely aimed at a more adult audience (and parts of it are scary for kids) with the peculiarity that it is animated. When you watch Snow White you are watching an art that was almost better in it's infancy that in it's so called adult hood, now there are few hand animators left and instead of sweating over a flip board they are hitting buttons on a computer...and it's missing something somehow. This will always stand out as a dedication to Walt's true dream, and hopefully it will hold forever.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Tiresome, Boring & Tediously Paced","Disney's first foray into feature filmmaking finds the now legendary animation studio scripting history, for Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs was the first full-length traditionally animated film back then and is still counted amongst their crowning achievements. Its creative brushstrokes, simplistic storytelling & childish humour does have a charm to it but this was still a chore to sit through.Directed by David Hand, the story is based on the German fairy tale of the same name but this adaptation is a tad too simple, sugary sweet & excessively juvenile for my taste. And while I do appreciate the craft behind every frame rendered on screen with care, colours & creativity, the bland storytelling & saccharine execution is just too much to handle sometimes and makes the ride almost unbearable.Considering what the premise is all about, its 83 mins runtime is rather overlong & spread out to allow the animators to conjure their hand-crafted magic on screen. It is visually arresting at first but the interest begins to fizzle out soon & patience also starts to run thin, for there isn't enough material to keep it afloat and even the gags don't have that amusing quality to them anymore. It is tiresome, boring & tediously paced.Overall, Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs is no doubt an aesthetic & artistic triumph and can still surprise some newcomers but it nevertheless left me unmoved & unstimulated for the most part just like few other classics of the same era. While there is beauty in its simplicity & innocence on its surface, there is also boredom in its drawn-out narration plus the film hasn't aged well either. In short, one time viewing is more than enough.",,Anonymous,Animation
