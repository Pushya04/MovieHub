Should have been better,"The idea is intriguing. For twelve hours a year all crime is legal, including murder; do what you want and face no consequence. All emergency services are suspended and with the exception of an unexplained restriction on weaponry, and certain members of the public being out of bounds as targets, there is nothing to stop you doing what you wish. The result is a venting of frustration and anger, a purging of demons, as well as the eradication of the poor and those unable to defend themselves. The end result of this annual purge is extremely low unemployment and crime, and a fantastic economy; ""a nation reborn"", where the weak are prey and the strong survive. One of the strong is James Sandin, who sells security systems to fellow high-flyers; these obviously come in most useful on the night of the purge. Of course on the night in question, things go rather wrong and the Sandin family find their home under siege, following their son Max's generous act of letting a victimised stranger in.For a second, put aside the rather obvious holes in the idea when considered as a practise encouraged at a national level, even put aside the cynical nature of the movie, and we can see the idea may have started out as a distressing vision of a near future, a terrifying ""other reality"". Indeed, 'The Purge' takes its cue from a lot of previous work that has done similarly; you don't have to look too hard to see various elements of 'A Clockwork Orange', '1984', 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Battle Royale'. The problem is that unlike those works, and unlike 'Straw Dogs', with which it shares more than a little DNA, this story has been watered down to a locked room domestic thriller; a potentially incendiary political fable is devoid of most of that which would have made it so. This is actually typical of writer/director James DeMonaco, who is responsible for the screenplay for the remake of 'Assault on Precinct 13', a film which again extracted a lot of the original's rough edges and tough moments to leave a flat, action driven thriller. Similarly, the scope of the film is rather narrow; with early implication that there will be a study of repressed violence and how the night is used as an excuse, it is then disappointing to see the story steers frustratingly wide of all matters other than murder. The film lacks the gumption to tackle the disturbing elements of our unchecked nature in a way that Cronenberg would have done.So what we're looking at here is a film which, in different hands may have proved to be a controversial and stirring piece of work, but with DeMonaco scared to grasp the nettle, we end up with a flat, rather tame film, which is given some lift by its better elements, such as the performances and some of the fight sequences. Lacking bite, with a frustrating amount of exposition and not enough dissection of issues, 'The Purge' falls short of what it should have been.This is not to take away from Ethan Hawke's solid performance, or some of the more effective scenes, but what we would give to have seen this in the hands of Michael Haneke.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Purge, great concept....not so great film","Humans have a natural instinct as predators to kill, but society forces us to repress these feelings by living in a ''civilized'' way....according to new Ethan Hawke led film The Purge, a very interesting concept of a film, which explores a future society in which all crime is allowed for one night a year...It's 2022 (not actually that far away), and unemployment in America is 1%, crime is at an all-time low, and generally, everybody seems happy, especially James Sandin (Hawke), a rich citizen who makes his fortune selling security systems for houses to use during the annual Purge. Basically the reason why unemployment and crime is so low is because, for one night a year, a Purge occurs, where all crime (murder, raper robbery, the whole lot) is made legal, and no police or emergency services are allowed to interfere. Mad. But also intriguing. James and his family happily avoid the Purge by using a security system outside their large house while the rest of society kills each other, but all that changes when their youngest son Charlie decides to let a stranger into the house......This starts off as a really captivating film, the concept of legal crime kept me hooked, but soon enough, it descends into a stereotypical action film where Ethan Hawke fights off gangs from his house with a variety of handguns,and all originality gets lost in a haze of bullets (literally). The short running time (85mins) and variety of twists every 5 minutes makes sure that it doesn't get too boring, so overall a decent watch, but nothing that provokes any thinking afterwards.6/10- A lesser version of Panic Room",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent,"I am a movie theatre employee, so I saw this film last night at an employee screening. Going into the movie, I was rather excited. The concept is interesting, and has never been done before. While this movie was not as scary as I had anticipated, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The antagonists were disturbing, and the movie really shows the struggle between self-preservation and what's right. It is somewhat short, but the makers certainly do get the job done. Plenty of flashlight-and-pistol standoffs and suspenseful scenes make for a movie with an interesting plot, and good acting. The ending was a bit predictable, but did not ruin the movie in my opinion. Not the best that I've seen, but overall a decent flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting horror premise needs to be worked out more,"It's 2022 in America. Unemployment is at 1% and crime is at an all-time low except one night every year. The law allows many forms of crime including even murder in that 12 hour period. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) sells home security and is having his best year. He has gathered his family (Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) to wait out the night. Things don't turn out well starting with the daughter's boyfriend. Then the son allows a vagrant to enter their house who is followed by a mob intend on killing that homeless person.The premise is interesting and original reminding me of Sparta and the Helots. It's certainly a good way to get into a horror movie. However there are a lot of aspects that went uninvestigated in this movie. Everybody has enemies and it's an obvious avenue to go for. For example, he's the best salesman which seems to me to be an obvious reason for other co-workers to kill him. Writer/director James DeMonaco just didn't think through all the possibilities in this world.The obvious fix is to make the purge be only against the poor and the helpless. There could be rules about harboring the hunted. The family lets in that homeless guy which could make them fair game. I'm willing to not harp on it but I must deduct a point for the mistake.When the power goes out, the darkness is not a good way to shoot a film. However when the mob gets vehicles which could light up the house, the lighting looks good. All the light and shadows provide great horror opportunities. I wish more of the movie take place in that lighting scheme.Another missed opportunity is the ticking clock. It could have been a great vehicle for raising the tension. Instead the movie wastes this away by sitting around to run out the clock. It's not the most compelling climax.It's a great original premise with loads of opportunities. With a few more tweaks, this could be a great horror franchise. It has a built-in morality play. The premise doesn't even need any one particular character to carry it either. This could run for a long time if they put in a few fixes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well I liked it,"America—the near future: the annual 'Purge'—a 12-hour period where all crime is legalised—turns into a nightmare for a wealthy family who had hoped to spend the time in the safety of their heavily fortified home.The Purge has been the victim of a lot of negativity, but I found it to be a well-executed thriller with a satirical edge that deliberately adopts a far-fetched premise in order to take a pop at the USA's culture of violence, its undercurrent of racism and a legal system that favours the rich.I imagine that much of the hate comes from Americans who simply don't like the messages the film so effectively illustrates—an understandable reaction, perhaps, but sometimes its good to take a long hard look in the mirror, and if you don't like what you see, do something to make a change.On a more shallow note, the action was suitably hard-hitting, with the snooker room fight being particularly bad-ass, and both Lena Headey and Zoey Sandin are total babes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Too Many Dumb and Annoying People/Situations,"The Purge (2013)* 1/2 (out of 4)Annoying, dumb and eventually cruel film dealing with the one day of the year when America allows you to kill anyone who want without being punished. This ""purge"" is supported by a security system seller (Ethan Hawke) and his wife (Lena Headey) but during the 12-hour period they find themselves the target of a gang of murderers. THE PURGE pretty much gave away its story during the theatrical trailer and I thought to myself that we were going to get something fresh or something that has a few interesting ideas but just didn't work. Sadly there are some interesting ideas floating around but the screenplay is simply so bad and so clichéd that it pretty much kills anything positive. The biggest problem is that the film is never scary, which is just downright disappointing. Another problem is that the film itself doesn't know what to do with its ""free day to kill"" idea. It takes a while for the viewer to warm up to this futuristic world where we can kill but as soon as you accept this ""law"" the screenplay then pulls a quick one and starts to challenge the morals of such a thing. We then get a bunch of political non-sense thrown in just to make us question the whole thing. Why sell a film on an idea and then not know where to get with it? Even more annoying is that this film contains some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of cinema. Yes, the history of cinema. The couple's young son is someone I wanted to be off the screen ASAP. The daughter isn't much better but just wait until the two twists that happen. Both Hawke and Headey give good performances as does the rest of the cast. If you're expecting a horror film then you're going to be disappointed because even though there's quite a bit of violence, for the most part this is nothing more than a rip-off of STRAW DOGS but set in the future with this one ""change."" Sadly, THE PURGE just never works and in the end you're left with a major disappointment and just a cheap excuse to kill.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Wasted potential, just a generic home invasion film.","From the producers of Paranormal Activity (as is all horror films these days) The Purge tells the story of a near future were crime is at an all time low and unemployment stands at under 1% of the US population, to compensate for one night a year all crime (including murder) is legal for 12 hours allowing society some kind of release.The film revolves around the Sandin family who are confronted by a group of college students hunting a man on the night of the Purge who the family had allowed into their home after lockdown. The Purgers (lead by Rhys Wakefield) drastically try to break into the family's home causing James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) to protect their children from the invaders in order to survive the night.The main problem with the film is the premise itself, whilst interesting is filled with flaws and holes that just make the whole idea ridiculous. Such as what happens to the serial killers and career criminals of this world? Do they just control their urges to kill or steal for the other 364 days until the next Purge, as well what if someone has a heart attack on the night of The Purge? Is it just a case of bad luck you chose the wrong night to need medical care?Despite the flaws of the premise, the film repeatedly ignores the possibilities of the premise, instead of exploring the ideas behind the Purge or the events that occur on the night of the Purge from different perspectives and situations. Instead the film settles for a typical home invasion story that although done well, is nothing we haven't seen done in many other films. The Purge in the end seems to only be the premise of this film to stop the age old question of ""Why don't they just call the police?"" in home invasion films.To the films credit it is quite subtle, there's a running theme that the Purge is just an excuse for the upper classes to exterminate the poor, driven by all the attackers wearing prep school blazers and the person they are chasing wearing dog tags around his neck. The film also contains some strong performances, especially from Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Lord of War) and Lena Headey (Dredd, Game of Thrones) who carry the film throughout. The film also has a twist near the end which allows the audience to get inside the heads of the people during this night.That cant be said for the leader of the Purger's played by Rhys Wakefield (Sanctum, Home and Away)whose performance is slightly cringe worthy, hes trying to be psychotic yet in control of the proceedings but it just comes across as a amateur dramatics' version of The Joker. He just never seems like a really threat and just a creepy next door neighbour.The film also contains some bizarre and just plain weird set pieces, such as the families' son who builds a spy camera on a chard baby doll on the top of a rhino tank from Warhammer 40,000. The thing looks like a demented contraption from Sid's bedroom in Toy Story.Overall, The Purge is an OK home invasion film, there are moments of suspense and a couple of jump scares are effective. The wasted potential of the premise is the films main downfall which could have lead to a more effective and possible original film then what we got in the end.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Nothing special, but fun to see with friends","My summary says it all, I went in to this movie without high expectations. When I came out my expectations were pretty much right on the dot. I knew this would focus more on being a survival/thriller movie rather than something that would be in depth and lets be realistic people-does this really look like a movie where you need to care about the characters? WELL ITS NOT. The family members are all stupid and constantly change their moral values (all of which are questionable). With that being said it was still fun to watch, it has tons of satisfying kills to enjoy on screen so some awesome revenge scenes.

To Purge or Not too Purge...,"Ever been so angry you wanted to murder someone? Apparently director James Demonaco has because today's review is all about the latest horror/thriller to grace the movie theater entitled The Purge. The concept of this is intriguing in which every year for twelve hours the government legalizes all crime, including murder. Such an idea allows for an ultimate game of cat and mouse, which if done right could allow for some scares and spine chills Of course with the countless horror movies that seem to pop up every month, it's hard to find one that is actually worth a trip to the theater. Has this movie scored a place in the hall of horror fame? Read on to find out.Despite the promises of the trailer, the Purge was not as exciting/interesting as I had hoped it would be. The explanation for the festival of the beast is rather lame as it really involves feeding the psychopath's hunger while also serving as population control. Yet for a horror movie the plot is often not what people go for, it is more so the scare factor. I'll give this movie one thing it has diversity in their attempts to terrorize the audience. For those who like a good jump, this movie has plenty of ear drum shattering sounds to try to make your body jump. The quiet halls of the house with the steady breathing of the characters sets it up perfectly, and if you don't see it coming then the sudden discharge or appearance of a hunter might make you squeal. Those who are immune to this tactic have another challenge to face though in which they are to resist the creepiness of the dark. Early on in the film the power gets cut, casting a veil of shadows in every room that seems to suck the all light and sound out. Seeing as the halls are rather spacious, well the simple suburban setting becomes a hunting ground that has you wondering what is behind every corner, until it gets overdone. Finally the last factor comes in the form of how realistic these killers are, for The Purge has ditched the zombified chainsaw wielders, aliens, and supernatural murderers for average people. While these killers are indeed overacted, more on that later, there is still something that sends chills down your spine when the killing crew arrives, especially those odd masks.Although I applaud their diversity though, the movie has a lot of downfalls that counter the angle they tried to take. For one thing, they overdo a lot of the scare attempts that it becomes rather boring and predictable. How many times am I supposed to be freaked out by a mask man or woman getting a close up? As for the darkness of the house, well that gets old too, because the size of the house is ridiculous and they tend to revisit the same rooms numerous times to again get things stale. Yet the biggest thing that I got tired of was the fact that the same dilemma happened not once, not twice, but at least three times in the movie. Kids ran off into the dark, the dad and mom got into shouting arguments, and I the constant monitor watching made it feel like I was in Safe house except without as good of acting.Despite the challenges this movie had though, there were some very symbolic messages in the qualities of movie setting. Perhaps the biggest message was the animalistic and barbaric nature that can overcome any human. The evolution of the characters into releasing their savage side as the situation gets worse brings up the question of how much does it take to give in. A battle of morals and ethics is fought at various points, mainly between the youngest member of the family and the adults who are years older than him. While a bit cheesy, overacted, and sometime pathetic, the points they raise are ones that many of us should continue to examine ourselves. Unfortunately a piece of you might die with this film as well, especially when the torturing and soulless decisions come on screen that, for this reviewer anyway, made me not only uncomfortable but pitying a lot of characters. Pushing past the morals and tests of whether or not you have a conscious the ending revs up the excitement to finish the movie fairly strong. There is some action, a few scenes that make you cheer, and some nice ties to the loose ends that form over the course of the movie, though it is not too hard to guess what is coming.Finally I'd like to make a few comments on the acting of this movie. In a nutshell most of the characters/ parts are rather shallow and simple involving nothing more than screaming, crying, and occasionally some actual dialog. Ethan Hawke was one of the better roles, had a combination of elegance and ruggedness needed for his transition. Max Burkholder was the moral driver of the story, and played the frightened kid who had a strong moral obligation to do the right thing. Rhys Wakefield had the creepy and psychotic role down pat, and despite how polite his character was, managed to drive some anger towards his character, which was I believe the intended goal. As for the rest of the cast, some aren't bad, and many of the killers/hunters are very disappointing, who at first are creepy but quickly devolve into mentally imbalanced teenagers who get rather annoying.In a nutshell, The Purge isn't necessarily the scariest thing to grace the screen. Those looking for a more realistic thriller will get their fill, but if you're looking for a quality film, avoid this until it hits Redbox. My scores for the following are: Horror/Thriller/SCi-fi: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",,Anonymous,Horror
Wasted potential,"I saw this movie with basically no expectations, yet I managed to be quite disappointed. With competent actors such as Ethan Hawke and Lena Heady, and a premise that (at least to me) sounded exciting, I don't really know how they managed to ham it up this much.It's' predictable to the point of being laughable, and the family characters seem cut out of some template on basic movie-making. And the ""villains"" brings little new to the table, copying the home-invasion-psychopaths of Funny Games, The Strangers etc. (2 examples of it being done right, in my opinion).I think this movie got a free ride on the hype it garnered online, with a sleek campaign and major buzz on Twitter, proving that all a movie really needs to make it is a brief, smart slogan and peoples imagination and anticipation creates the rest.Too bad for an interesting idea. Can't help to think that maybe another director could've done something memorable with this.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Violent and thrilling film that created a successful franchise directed or produced by James De Monaco,"Typical futuristic movie of the Invasion Home sub-genre with a lot of trills, chills, fights, slaughter, and violence. This moving picture turns out to a futuristic tale with plenty of kinetic energy, noisy action, struggles, shootouts, though extremely claustrophobic. It displays a strong social critical against dictatorship and use of violence , including a weird atmosphere and a surprising ending. As there governs a dictatorial government though elected by democratic means : The New Founding Fathers of America that imposes a revolutionary rules of citizen conduct . The known premise is the following one : The idea behind this whole peculiar America is that crime is up and economy is down, as government put a lot of emphasis on killing being legal, that's why they think of murders would get better common problems. It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these problems results to be built up agression within population. In order to correct this, the rulers decides that it would be a good idea to give the people a day to release the agresssion. Because if people get out all that anger in one day, they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year.There a wealthy family formed by father James Sandrin : Ethan Hawke, mummy named Mary Sandrin : Lena Headey, and children Zoey and Charlie live at a luxurious mansion when The Purge Day takes place. Then a bloody stranger : Edwin Hodge, asks for help, and he gets inside the impregnable home thanks to the youngest son. But things getting worst. As all of them must survive and stay alive until dawn, or both be sacrified for their sins against the state. For one night only, America invites you to its annual tradition. I purged. Keep America great. Purge for the people. Purge for the nation. Purge for your freedom. Purge for the glory. Witness the birth of an American tradition. Citizens join the purge. A nation reborn. It changed our country. It challenged our beliefs. Now witness how it all began.This movie is well set in a dystopian and nearly future society in which violence predominates when at night the criminal instincts are freed, leaving population carry out all kinds of mayhem, destruction, murders and grisly massacre. This first picture of the big boxoffice franchise contains thriller, extreme violence, crossfire, fighting , surprise-filled entertainment and high body-count. Being a strange mix of dystopian Sci-fi, thriller, drama and Invasion Home. As it is nicely set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future in which a family attempting to survive on a night where it is all-out war on the streets and in home . The nail-biting action scenes, mostly shot at home, are uniformly well made, and suspense, tension and intrigue are enough to keep interested throughout the movie runtime, even in the low parts of the picture.This The Purge 2013 turns out to be the first installment, being followed by various sequels : The Purge Anarchy 2014, The Purge Election year 2016, The First Purge 2018 and a TV series The Purge 2018. All of them are set in different locations, The first Purge set at a lush mansion, Purge Anarchy is set in the streets, Purge Election is set in official location and D. C., while the recent First Purge 2018 takes place in Staten Island. Rating 6/10. Decent action film and it is well worth seeing.

"Good Concept, Poor Execution.","This movie stared off good, but halfway through it goes downhill.It goes from being horror to action/thriller and the ending felt rushed with a few predictable twists.If I'm feeling generous I'd give it a 7/10. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype. I was a really excited to see it but came out a bit disappointed. Good concept, poor execution.See now, what they SHOULD have done is make a movie about the Purge itself and the political, moral, and emotional implications it had on society as a whole, with maybe some character being an an-hero and trying to shut down the corrupt government and their ""purge"". but no... they made into some ""been there done that"" home invasion flick.Remember during the beginning when some guy on the radio was talking about how the purge is really just a way to exterminate poor people? This movie had some much potential, they could have gone 100 different directions with it, but they chose the least interesting route.I expected more from the makers of ""Insidious"" that's one of my favorite horror movies.The ONLY horror in this movie was the intensity felt when the purge starts and possibly the creepy guy on the camera (his smile gave me the chills) but it quickly derails into a fast paced shoot 'em up.Save your money and wait for a DVD release.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Purge,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, this film could have been amazing. The plot and premise are very original and had a lot of potential. But sadly, the story is full of clichés such as stupid teenage kids, bad decisions, and clueless villains. If they had only made the film in a way that we could see multiple Purge stories, it would have been better. The ending is the probably the best part of the story.The acting is okay at best. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey perform the best. Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane play two of the most annoying, stupid, and idiotic characters I have ever laid eyes on.The film starts off very slow and continues to have slow pacing until the end.The blood and gore aspect of the film is very good. This is one of the highest points about the film.Pros: Very original story, the ending, good acting from Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, and a good use of blood and goreCons: Slow pacing, wasted potential with the story, annoying characters, Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane and their terrible performance, and a lot of clichésOverall Rating: 4.3",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Consider me purged,"I may be a little bit biased in this review, because I am a horror nut who has a passion for the home invasion sub-genre. I find these films very tense, involving and thought-provoking because it could happen to anyone. Yes, it could happen to YOU! So when I saw the trailer for The Purge which seemingly burst out of nowhere I was incredibly excited! Firstly, the concept is highly original and very interesting. It's an idea I've never come across before. People have expressed concern about the annual purge just being a set-up for a home invasion movie, but the idea is extremely relevant throughout and serves to make the film even for thought-provoking. Whilst the idea, if it were really carried out, is totally bonkers and dumb, the film convincingly shows it as a good and helpful tool in helping the country that God really loves!People have also expressed concern about the film showing no other purge-related events outside the Sandlin family's attack. Well here I'm going to have to disappoint you, because apart from some CCTV footage for the opening credits to play over, you don't get to see very much else at all. However, I am actually very for this decision because it makes the film much more focused and makes the audience involved with the characters, so when the attack finally does arrive, it makes everything that much more intense. It's very hard to balance a film if its concentrated in several areas, and I think it would've been a bit messy. Sorry if you wanted to see more purge action though. Perhaps they will in the sequel.The lead up to the purge is done brilliantly. There's a great sense of anticipation and fear as we wait for the sirens to commence the purge. I also liked the emergency broadcast, which played out rather realistically. In fact, once the purge begins the film doesn't really stop being a tense and marvellously entertaining thrill ride. Some people say that the film isn't horror because they use guns. I'm sure if they didn't use guns people would be moaning about how it wasn't realistic because they didn't use guns! OK I admit guns were over-used because the horror hound inside me would've preferred some more decapitations with the axe and machete, but do not worry because they are still there! The film first and foremost is horror. You can't deny the creepiness of when the masked folk arrive, along with Rhys Wakefield's 'Polite Stranger'.Also, the masks themselves are brilliant! They have a creepy Strangers-esque vibe to them, and certainly set the horror tone. I've never seen or heard of Rhys Wakefield in anything else before, but the former Home and Away actor puts on an extraordinarily creepy performance, evoking Michael Pitt from Funny Games US. He has a seriously scary smirk that reminded me of Heath Ledger's legendary Joker. Rhys Wakefield could've made an even more memorable villain if he was in it more. Although, he completely stole all of the scenes he was in, I would've loved to have seen him play a bigger role with more screen time.The film isn't shy of throwing up moral dilemmas. It had my brain jogging about what I would in the situation, and we see a lot of interestingly dislikeable sides to Ethan Hawke's smug security expert, which isn't even strong enough to protect his own house! The final 30 minutes or so are incredibly entertaining. It's never short of a tense thrill and there is also one stand-out fight sequence that put a sadistic smile on my face (don't worry, I'm quite normal really). A nice surprising twist tops everything off and by the end of it you really do feel like you've been through quite an ordeal.The Purge offers a creepy, thrilling and innovative slice of home invasion. Whilst obviously not as amazing as Inside, or even Funny Games and the remake of Mother's Day, I think I enjoyed it more than The Strangers and to compare it to a more recent horror film, I liked it about as much (or maybe ever so slightly less) than Evil Dead. The Purge certainly doesn't deserve the knocks it has been getting from a lot of people. I do think it could've been longer as I couldn't get enough of the action-packed finale, which surely isn't a bad thing is it? I enjoyed it a lot and I think a lot of horror fans are going to enjoy it too. It's an under-valued film with a fantastically original concept, which deserves more views!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
People obviously don't get this film..,"Read a lot of reviews that pan this film as dumb, criticize the plot, and hate the characters.

Seen a lot of stupid movies I'm a horror thriller film enthusiast and The Purge was amazing. It's about morals and the limits people are willing to go to. When I first saw this film I found I was asking myself ""would I condone one night of any and all crime if it meant the rest of the year my loved ones would be safe?"". Part of me screamed yes then I was horrified with myself for even considering such an idea. The movie is well acted, scary, philosophical and is full of ethical lessons, lessons of moral and lessons of survival. One thinks about the possibility of sinking so low as to murder innocent people whether for fun or to save your own life or your families. Really terrific film",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocre,"The film the Purge was an alright film. The idea and gist of the film is not original, taking the idea of one night where all crime is legal from an episode of Star Trek, 'the Red Hour' (ep. 45. Season 1). The very execution of the idea in a more modern setting is exceptionally well.In this dystopia and modern future, a day known as the 'Purge'. There is one full night of crime as crime is legal to 'cleanse' the evil and stress inside of themselves. After finding a homeless man on the streets and picking him up, the 'Strangers' come to the Sandin house to reclaim the already wounded man that they claim is theirs to kill. The Sandins are then faced with the decision of bringing the man to them or keeping him safe.There were a few things that I did not like about the film, the way the characters acted. The characters acted like they were in a bad horror film. The choices seemed a bit too...well, stupid. Stupid meaning they were unrealistic and seemed a little forced. I would have also liked it if the film had been more built up to the 'Purge' rather than the whole film being during the 'Purge' itself. That way, we could have liked the characters more and known more about them rather than their small traits. We are introduced to our main characters a bit unexpectedly and were told to react to the happenings and mishaps of the 'Purge' as told by the actors or the music.The actors give a wonderful and thrilling performance in the film. Max Burkholder as the son, Charlie Sandin is quite good as a child actor, but I feel that Rhys Wakefield, pulls out the starring role as the unnamed villain. All other actors give it there all and were fairly well. Amazingly, I found myself liking some of the characters and wanting them to meet there struggle and make it out.The action in the film, what little there is, can be quite suspense-filled. As I had already stated, I felt for the characters which was quite rare.Overall, the Purge is a well-made movie and quite original compared to the other films released before it, (not counting 'Now You See Me' or 'After Earth'). Regardless, of the way the characters acted and the way we were introduced, I couldn't give it a one or a four. Truthfully, I simply give the film a six out of ten for at least trying.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge,"The PurgeLuckily, those in cold climates are protected from home invasion by thin layers of clear plastic film insulating their windows.Regrettably, the family in this thriller lives in sunny California.One day of the year the new leaders of the US government make it legal to kill anyone you wish, so long as it happens within a 12-hour period.While it's characteristically the homeless who are purged, this year a home security salesman James (Ethan Hawke), his wife (Lena Headey) and two kids, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder), are the target of a gang of affluent attackers.When Charlie provides shelter for an injured stranger (Edwin Hodge), their high-tech home can't protect them from the human animal.Spoiling its philosophical merits with an unfocused story and clichéd gunfights, The Purge never reaches its full potential.What's more, family members are the most likely to want to kill you.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The other reviews aren't wrong, but too critical.","I honestly think people are wrong to judge this movie with such harshness. I enjoyed it tremendously. It kept me on my toes, and was a brilliant new concept for a horror movie. I haven't seen anything like this. It might just be me being naive or something, but I doubt you have either. Sure, there were shallow characters, but there was so much symbolism compacted into a single movie it really blew my mind. I'm not going to say its the best movie I've seen in the past month, but I'mm also not going to give it a crappy ratting because I was feeling negative towards the movie the whole time I was watching it like the other reviewers on this site. I swear to you that this was a pretty neat movie, and may or may not be worth your time, but if you have any spare time, it'll probably be worth the watch.

Philosophical Horror. Low Budget Brilliance Exploits Timely Income Disparity To Create Authentic Fear.,"I first saw this movie advertised in a pile of DVD's in the power aisle in front of the electronics department, as I held my breath and tried to escape a WalMart one afternoon. My first impression - probably another ****** low budget horror film that scored a PG-13 rating and got to hang a sign in 1000 WalMart locations for a couple of weeks. As the years went on, I saw more Purge ads for more films. I saw them on Netflix. I saw trailers for sequels on television and on YouTube. 'The Purge' seemed to be everywhere. It took me 5 years to finally watch the first film. Although I knew it wasn't a great movie, I became obsessed with the theme and quickly devoured the rest of the films and the season of television. So, what is it, exactly, that makes all of those WalMart customers and I so crazy for these movies?'The Purge' series is 'Thinking Man's Horror', or 'Philosophical Horror'. We live in an era of political extremism, cultural intolerance, and income disparity. Our government admits that it drastically underestimates the true unemployment rate, by excluding entire groups of the population and placing a time limit on how long a person can look for work before they disappear from the government reported ""total available workforce"". So, if you happen to find yourself on the bottom end of any of these themes, or if you happen to be a member of a group that has been targeted by right-wing extremist politics, then you might find this future scenario quite possible.'The Purge' series creates an almost universal appeal by leading each viewer to consider their own Purge behavior.Would you go out and commit crimes on Purge Night?Would you steal?If so, what would you steal?Would you do something worse than stealing?Would you purge?Would you purge someone you know?If so, then 'The Purge' becomes more about criminal fantasy than political commentary. Tales of revenge are as old as the film industry, and they are ubiquitous. Most people have lottery fantasies, about what they would acquire if they suddenly didn't have to work for anything. My thoughts on my own personal Purge behavior have evolved over time. I have had discussions with many people that spoke passionately about their ""Purge Fantasies"", and they all seem to have put a great deal of thought into the subject... WAY more thought than most low budget horror films are able to inspire.This isn't a perfect horror film. More people would use Purge Night to rape and pillage than to murder, and no theft or sexual crimes were depicted (or even implied) in the film. Boooo. Rule #1 in low budget horror - Nudity Is Necessary. Shame on you, Cersei Lannister... Shame.This film is another example of how I was wrong to have prejudged a movie based on marketing.

It's great concept but could of been better,I liked the concept of this movie it was engrossing and made me really think. I had hoped this movie would push above average but with certain plot holes and a story that gets weak towards the end it fell within this category.

Not for Americans...,"I was actually kinda surprised by all the bad reviews after the release... So I got to watch it anyway and I have to say, I understand why Americans can't like the piece. It represents all the excess they are known for. I am french and even the fact that you can have a gun so freely is beyond my understanding, even though I get that it's in your culture, your pride or something like that. Anyway, as a European, I see The Purge as a satyr or something like this. Authorizing crime/murder one night a year is here seen as the solution for all the problems ( and it clearly worked ) and it kinda works in a weird sense. After a little slow first half that allows us to ""learn to know the characters and what is their point of view on The Purge"" , the action enters and never stops until the end. We even have a few twists all over the place so it was really enjoyable. Totally recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The message is that rich white people are evil,"Good premise, good suspense, good pacing. In the short span of time we go from an idyllic neighborhood to war zone. I wish the premise had been explored a bit more in depth, although I know the sequels do that. But the characters are a little stereotypical.

Criminal survival,"Saw 'The Purge' due to being really intrigued by the concept, having seen home invasions being handled well on visual media and finding Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey dependable actors. Saw it without seeing reviews beforehand in order to see it with an open mind, as is always my intention.Count me in as another person who found 'The Purge' poorly executed in almost every way. Can completely understand the mildly mixed to very negative reception and find the criticisms very similar to mine, just for the record what will be covered in this review is my personal opinion and nobody else's with the flaws being so obvious you don't need someone else's opinion to base yours on. The concept was handled in such a dumb and dull way, to near intelligence-insulting degrees, and 'The Purge' is in no way a good example of how to do a film about a home invasion.There are a few strengths. 'The Purge' doesn't look too bad, it has a gritty and slick look that doesn't look cheap and there is a little atmosphere.Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey and Rhys Wakefield give reasonable performances which is better than what their characters deserved.However, nothing else worked. The rest of the acting is weak, with the two young actors Adelaide Kane and especially Max Burkholder being terribly irritating as characters that are impossible to get behind in a film full of shallow and unrelatable characters that behave so stupidly and illogically.No tension or suspense at any point and nothing scary or thought-provoking, got nothing enlightening about the social allegory aspect. The pace dragged badly, which undermined the suspense, likewise with the excessive predictability and clichés that were tired well before the film was made. The scary aspect is cheap and never surprising, creative or scary, the violence being gratuitous, the situations so ridiculously dumb that it insults the audience and the villains are goofy and flat caricatures, nothing menacing about them. The direction is generally indifferent.In summary, lame and not recommended if not without redeeming merits, namely the leads. 3/10 Bethany Cox",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's the worst of the Purge flicks because of some annoying bits,"This one is the film that started it all, we have a great scary & exciting concept with a solid cast, here we get the always good & intense Ethan Hawke as the main lead as he stars as an ordinary family man getting ready to lock up for the scary night ahead.This is an intense home invasion style Thriller with an old school siege feel, it feels low-budget & very B-movie but in a great way, like the type of indie type that John Carpenter may have made in the 70's abit ""Assault on precinct 13"" in it's low-key & cheap approach with it being set in one location & a it's small cast.Ethan Hawke is good & intense as James Sandin the dad of the house they are holed up in, we also have the excellent Lena Heady as his wife Mary & the two teens Charlie & Zoey, all well cast.A cool standout character is the homeless bloody stranger who ends up at the Sandin's house wanting help, he's played by the good Edwin Hodge & becomes a good unlikely hero of the film.The purge night starts & the atmosphere of dread is present & everything goes wrong when ""The Stranger"" is let in to the family home, a deadly siege is commenced on the house it becomes a fight to survive the night!!!BUT there's still those annoying & STUPID bits that characters do such as the young boy whilst hiding in the dark from the purgers, he's so dumb that he hides in the dark with his TORCH on & keeps shinier it at the door to see if anyone is there!!! How Dumb could you be!!!! Talk about giving away your position. That scene really annoyed me & made me take some points off the movie & the mum (Lena) was far too nice at the end, i mean they come to slaughter her family!!!!

One Night special,"The premise is pretty simple but very effective. It's supposed to say something about society overall, but is still a fun movie to watch. Well let's say entertaining, because fun might be stretching it for some. I'm surprised about the current 5.5 this movie has here though, especially because this was a big success in America. So big in fact, it will spawn a sequel in (probably) 2014.The movie treats the idea as if you might not have read the reviews, so you won't get thrown into the mix right away (maybe the sequel will do that). It will tell you what you are about to watch. The really amazing thing, which might have elevated the movie a lot more, is Ethan Hawkes character. The way he portrays him and he is written, with an arc and a clear structure is not something you get to see often in movies like this one. It's refreshing and a nice touch to the whole thing. Having said that, the movie is not entirely without surprises. Good Night and Good Luck indeed!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Subtlety? Never heard of it.,"Despite its less-than-stellar reputation, 'The Purge (2013)' is surprisingly solid. Of course, its premise is totally absurd and its satire is as blunt as a sledgehammer. It's perhaps a little too serious for its own good, too, and its subtext isn't as deep as it thinks it is. However, the picture is actually rather compelling for its majority. Most of it plays out as an insular home invasion thriller, and it's relatively successful on this front. There are several suspenseful set-pieces, with viscerally exciting action and dependable performances. It's a little slow in places and there are some odd narrative decisions sprinkled throughout, but there are also a handful of inspired moments and the piece is propulsive enough that even its worst moments don't linger long enough to have a major impact. Even if the characters make some frustrating decisions and the climax is more than a little strained, the flick remains fairly entertaining for its duration. It isn't great, but it's good enough for what it is. I wish the director would stop trying to slide the camera up the skirt of the family's teenage daughter, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Painfully disappointing despite some curious beginnings...,"The Purge (2013)Well, this is either the stupidist movie ever or it's a mishmash of something audacious and creative and a slasher film with campy expectations. It doesn't make the grade as a great movie mostly because of an hour of redundant ax-wielding around a big suburban house. But the first half hour is really great—some potential here that went aground fast.The premise is clear right away: it's the near future, maybe 2021, in the United States. Once a year for twelve hours everyone is allowed to be an ultra criminal without repercussion. None. Kind of like Devil's Night in Detroit without any cops. You can murder, destroy things, be a general naughty boy or girl, and have no criminal consequences the next day. Hurray!Everything is just okay! Or not.Well, the reason this works in the first half hour is the calm, steady, well appointed believablility of the acting and scenario in this fancy (upscale American) house. Ethan Hawke plays a great regular, successful, nice Dad. His wife (Lena Headey) is a sweetheart in the clichéd way (she is sadly the typical Hollywood female, incompetent but nice to have around). They have two children in the standard mode, talented and slightly disaffected.So 7pm rolls around and the family has a fortress of a house (steel doors drop down in front of the windows and doors). So they watch on their monitors the calm and then the lack of calm on the nice street outside, at night. And things go sour badly.Okay, so a great set up. Of course, if you think about it, it's about as believable as zombies. And so therefore you can go with it if you decide to. So the public can expunge their violence by killing a few people and the other 364 days are crime free. Great. Except, well, uh, really?? Yeah, it implies that we would kill without compunction, and that the next day you would walk by your neighbor, who just killed a few people during the Purge, and say, ""Good morning Mrs. Johnson,"" as if all was fine. And there is no guilt. Or feeling. Or morality.But that's if you think about it. A lot of Hollywood's idea of the future is not meant to be parsed out and logical. Look at ""The Giver,"" or even (yes) ""Avatar."" Etc.So on a simpler level we have the problem of a movie that turns into a slasher film. Because the bad people do, of course, get into the house (you saw that coming) and the family tries to defend itself. This part of the movie is not especially well made, or well acted, or original. It destroys all potential, and makes it a disturbing bore.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Unique Premise, Spoiled By Descent Into Idiocy","Even with an extremely strong and enticing premise at the forefront to paint over the array of farcical stupidity and predictability, The Purge's core foundation that caused audiences to stop and stare is unable to completely gloss over the film's plethora of flaws as they seep through the cracks. The finishing coat that is the idea behind the film does just about enough to prevail and not fade away to the questionable layers beneath it. The Purge follows a family's struggle on one very 'special' night of the year; a night in the near future, where all crime is legal (including murder) and emergency services are disbanded for a period of twelve hours, which has radically reduced crime and allows for economic prosperity throughout the rest of the year. That premise alone intrigues via only a simple synopsis, and in the film, this fascinating night just about maintains what could have been a disastrous and laughable trip to the cinema, as a moderately enjoyable one.The Purge successfully creates its world in the opening title sequence. You instantly believe and accept the film's set-up and despite some annoying characters, the film undeniably has your attention, if only for a little while longer. The greatest feature of The Purge is its ability to remain relevant, before, during and after seeing it. While many may remember it for the wrong reasons, it can certainly impress by encouraging the audience to consider during to themselves, and ask aloud to those around them after, ""What would you do in that situation?"" The trailer reveals the family's son as a young and somewhat idealistic figure whom opens the family's security system to allow an unknown victim of the purge to find solace in their home. Would you risk your own safety for the potential rescue of a wounded stranger? These are the kinds of questions that The Purge elicits very triumphantly, and it is nothing but a shame that these social, moral issues were not delved into more critically. The Purge is a film that should be remade into a drama/thriller piece, taken more seriously and produced more coherently to restore its purpose that got lost along the way of this 2013 supposedly 'horror' effort. It doesn't really warrant the categorisation of horror, due its lack of fear inducing power other than a couple of jump scares.The Purge manages to defy logic and reason on multiple levels, and not the levels that one would expect it to. The film in fact has a very convincing, albeit radical, premise that you adopt as reality, and with its rising action to maintain a sense of intensity rather than fear, The Purge disappoints by behaving foolishly elsewhere. First and foremost, the decisions of certain characters make little to no sense, leaving the audience to ponder over their judgement, rather than remain engaged with the film itself. Additionally, The Purge treats, or more so mistreats its audience very condescendingly, to the extent that you actually question whether the filmmakers just gave up trying to convince anyone of anything half way through production. There are countless instances of characters being save 'just in the nick of time', and it becomes frustratingly disappointing as after the first successful try, they just continue to demean all viewers by creating a idiotically predictable plot that a toddler could decipher in seconds.On the arrival of that moment in The Purge when you come to the realisation that it failed to live up to expectation and is disregarding so much logic and reason that you think at any time gravity might be dismissed, then you can finally just have fun with the film. Despite its refreshing premise, The Purge breaks its promise of being an inviting social commentary and becomes a simply disappointing yet watchable slasher-like flick.Oddly, I would have to concede that in spite of all of my hate for The Purge's silliness, woeful acting by some, and the frustrating delusional mentality of many of its characters, the film is overall still reasonably enjoyable and not completely worthless. In fact, it is certainly worthwhile, which is exclusively attributable to the conception of the foundational idea that is required to juggle the remaining frightful (not in the intended manner) features of the film, whilst balancing itself. Unfortunately, many of these features are such abysmal that The Purge's premise can only handle so much responsibility, and many of these disastrous elements of the film fall to the ground, in the mud, where they belong. Nonetheless, The Purge is memorable for its highly unique criminological approach that maintains intrigue throughout most of the film, and shall perhaps linger importantly for its impressive aptitude for giving the audience something to debate amongst themselves after walking out of the 85 minute feature.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Way to Blow a Great Opportunity,"Once a year laws do not exist. Once a year you can do anything you want for twelve hours and not get in trouble. This is called The Purge and it is designed to let humans let out their frustration on the world. This apparently keeps society healthy, the economy up, and crime down. I'm here to tell you that The Purge is a waste of time. A Waste of money and should not be viewed by anyone with half a mind.I don't even know where to start with this mess. Let's start with the idea of the purge. In 2022 the idea is that if we let people go crazy for 12 hours they will be calm for 364.5 days. The logic and science behind this is beyond far-fetched and it is really laughable. The fact that anybody believes this works is out of their mind. Think about this. Somebody pitched this idea to a group of people and those people said, ""yeah I believe that, we could make millions."" Well I'm here to say shame on you people and how dare you try and convince audiences across the country of this crazy premise. To make it even worse scientists and other people try to say the purge is an excuse to kill the homeless and people who cannot defend themselves. It is an excuse to get rid of the weak and allow the strong to survive. I don't like the idea that this movie supported the idea of killing weak and poor people is OK. The first half of the movie really focuses on these crazy people trying to find this one particular homeless person. It allows them to cleanse society and themselves. It makes zero sense and this movie had potential and it was wasted on this piece of garbage.The story is basic. There is a family with a lot of money and they sell security systems for the purge. Their house is huge and I will say I would love to live there. So the purge is going on and their youngest son sees a man in the streets calling for help and of course he lets him in. Shortly after a radical group of lunatics come knocking at the door looking for him and if they don't get him in a certain amount of time then they will come in and get him. While they waste time at the house they could have been running wild and cleansing the world of more poor people. Instead they waste time on this one person.These people are completely out of their mind and it is impossible to believe they are normal for 99.9% of the year. There is no possible reason why they go nuts for 12 hours and go on a murdering rampage. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be funny or scary either. While they are outside they are dancing and prancing around being stupid with their stupid masks. One is on the others back running around. The masks are on and they pretend to make out with one another and it was really failed comedy or an even bigger failed scare. I just sat in my chair and laughed throughout the entire movie. I don't know if its horror movies or me but I find them really funny. I laughed more during this movie then I did during The Hangover 3.I will be honest, I did hate this movie but I don't regret seeing it because I did have a good time and enjoy myself. I sat in a full theater and listened to the crowd tear apart the movie. People hated the daughter's boyfriend and the son's stupidity and the craziness that was happening. Every time somebody died the crowd burst into cheers and applause so that was awesome. I liked ripping the movie apart in the theater. There was a scene where there is a giant glass bowl filled with dominos and for some reason I thought it was the funniest thing.Other than the crowd I was entertained through this disaster of a movie. The action scenes where bodies were flying and people were dying were cool to see and what the movie should have been about. The selling point of the movie was 12 hours of lawless mayhem. I wanted to see chaos and the world go to hell. Instead I got a stupid story about a family I didn't really care about being tormented by people out of their mind. This movie tried to touch on human nature and how they change in the heat of the moment and how they do things they won't normally do. It doesn't work. The movie gives the wrong message and the wrong counter argument to the message.Overall The Purge is a mess. The lame jump scares I saw coming thirty seconds before they happened were not scary. The lunatics were not scary or believable and reminded me of a silly version of The Strangers. That movie was scary and the stuff they did made me scared. The stuff these guys did made me laugh. I wanted something 100% different from this movie and I got boring characters, a terrible story, and a disappointment. This movie fails at almost everything it attempted. It doesn't get a recommendation, it doesn't even get and A for Effort. I haven't don't this in a while but The Purge gets The WillyT Seal of DISapproval. Don't waste your time. Take my advice, save your money, save your time, save the gas in your car. If you really have to see it, wait a few months and get it off the internet for free. You're welcome.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Troublesome legality.,"When the state began to establish lawless freedom for 12 hours, that's where human nature went wild. There is no law, free to commit criminal acts and commit crimes into legal activities. A wealthy family faces a dangerous attack and must survive the attack.It can be said that this is a film with new innovations, but it is deadly and dangerous. But it doesn't hurt. In fact, this is a picture of human beings who if given the opportunity to become 'wild', then wild and savage are them. The Purge tells the story of a family who are in a dangerous state due to the arrival of a 'cleansing' victim who was rescued by his son. The Purge has a flat story premise. The film seems to just flow. A film conflict that doesn't build a suspenseful or gruesome atmosphere. The film is entirely flat-footed. Dialogue that does not build the atmosphere much, looks weak, does not give enough emotion. The acting that also seems to me to me to be ordinary. Did not perform to the fullest. Overall, The Purge doesn't provide such a strong tension and tense atmosphere. Film tensions that do not increase in terms of story and conflict. To be honest, I love Ethan Hawke's acting, but it doesn't help much of the film. A bunch of young people who look crazy but seem to me annoying in terms of acting.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Literally, this movie made me purge","So, from where shall I begin? When I saw, for the first time, the trailer, I had big expectations from this movie. The idea seemed to be original, the trailer looked good, 2 great actors were in there. what more could you ask for? But, apparently, even after I saw its rating on IMDb and most of the critics categorized this movie as one of the worst ones in this year, I still had a little hope that they might be wrong and I'll enjoy this flick Nope, that wasn't true at all. After first 30 minutes, with a slow pacing acting and flawed situations,with unbelievable plot holes, I just gave up. I was convinced that this movie is one of the biggest failures of this year, standing next to After Earth. The acting, which is one of the main things in a movie, was so unconvincing and stupid, with pretty much lame dialogs.. oh god, I can't even talk about it. Plus, the situations the characters were involved into, were so illogically dumb and mediocre, which would make you feel like throwing up. And, of course, the ""purgers"".

Should have been better but still enjoyable,"The Purge has a pretty intriguing and well executed premise, but falls down in the painstakingly annoying actions of its characters.Ethan Hawke is great in this as is Lena Headey, and their characters are pretty solid, but boy oh boy are the kids annoying. If they had figured out a way to create the same scenario but without the moronic character decisions this film easily could have been an 8/10.This is because everything else about it is very solid. Its a neat twist on the home invasion genre, framing it against the backdrop of a dystopian US where all crime is legal for one night a year. It has some decent scares. Some cool action. A creepy tone and vibe.The final 10 minutes or so are slightly clunky from a story perspective, but at only 90 minutes long thankfully things never drag.Its a shame because all the pieces were there to make this an above average film, but frustrating plot decisions make it a decidedly average but not unwelcome horror/action blend.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Possibly, the stupidest movie of all time.","You know the infinite monkey theorem? If you don't, it's a theorem that states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, being Hamlet the most notable example. I actually think that such thing it's entirely possible, but let's not go as far as saying they could write Hamlet, no no no, I think that this thing is true because this giant piece of s*** exists.
If you haven't watch The Purge, please don't, it's not even funny bad, it's enfuriating bad. If you have and if you're more intelligent than a monkey, then you know this thing has the most stupid premise, characters and dialogue than most of the films you have watched on your life. That's why I give this monstrosity a 0/10.P.S.: Maybe the only good thing that happened because of the release of this movie, is that my mom found a cellphone at the end of the screening... not even that made her happy after seing this thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why You should not be tricked by low IMDb (5.5) point,"If you are wondering about the film and worried about the low rating, please don't mind the people who seriously underestimate the quality of this film. The reason is that everyone thinks that they can write a better scenario than that and characters are stupid. They expect characters with no emotional dilemmas, they expect people who are doing the most rational thing with no human element, as in every Hollywood film where the cool hero kicks the a** of the bad guys in the brightest way. DO NOT expect that too much in this film. This film is not a typical thriller film that approaches killing very lightly and easily. Every time you feel a character is about to die, it makes you think its moral sides. This film has many very good messages and it delivers them very well. It is trying hard to reflect on the emotional dilemmas and morality of killing rather than keeping it as a satisfaction element for the audience. So If you want to watch a film with a very good story and messages about morals, this is the right film. If you wanna see a blood bath with coolest and brightest characters dealing with a meaningless gore, then find another film.Briefly, this film is for you, if you are looking for a good story that will make you think. If you are looking for a typical film like ""panic room"" etc. then turn your face to another film. IF you think the characters could behave better and more logically, without any emotions, then you better start writing your own scenario and good luck in finding some readers, you will need it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A strong concept with weak execution.,"Centred on the concept of an annual twelve-hour window in which all crime, including murder, is legal, The Purge is one of those rare franchise starters, like Saw or Final Destination, that takes a seemingly simple scenario which then captivates the imaginations of the movie-going public. What if our lives and our homes were defenceless for one whole night, and worse, what if it was encouraged by the state? What if you couldn't afford to install a high-tech security system to protect your family? What if you were homeless, or in need of emergency medical care when, by law, there was none available?The Purge fails to do anything other than briefly consider the implications of these issues, and for that it is a massive waste of an opportunity. Although our main characters are an affluent family who have made a small fortune by selling vital security mechanisms for The Purge, the ethics of such are barely argued. What follows instead is a familiar home invasion narrative that borders on nonsensical, as a family of four manage to lose track of one another within a relatively small suburban household as they come under threat from the 'Purgers' threatening to invade their residence.The core conflict of how a pacifist chooses to act in the face of a life-threatening situation is certainly gripping, but the film subsequently aims to distract you from thinking about it too much. The Purge is a film that has much to say about the politics, economics and morality of such a situation, but mistakenly assumes that the audience would rather ignore them in favour of watching a cliché game of cat and mouse unfold. A damning consequence of this miscalculation is that the drama is then confined to a limited setting while we are left to picture what horrors are most certainly occurring outside, beyond the walls.Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey portray the social ambiguity of their idyllic married couple well, but by the end they are anticipating the end of The Purge just as eagerly as the audience is anticipating the end of the film.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Entertaining, but nothing special.","The filmmakers here, led by writer / director James DeMonaco, get your attention with an effective ""hook"" but then don't develop things as interestingly as one might hope. It's too bad, because as others have said, the material *did* have potential, but ultimately this is a Hollywood product where nuance is shoved aside in favour of a familiar siege / home invasion type scenario. That's not to say that the film is incompetently made - it's slick and watchable, with some decent suspense and jump moments, as well as a bit of gore - but the viewer will likely end up thinking that they've seen all this before.Ethan Hawke, who'd starred in the ""Assault on Precinct 13"" remake that DeMonaco had written, is front and centre here as James Sandin, a salesman for a security system company. He and his family live in a future year (2022, to be exact) where the government thinks it's figured out how to channel the aggressive instincts of its citizens - allow them a 12 hour period once every year, dubbed a ""purge"", where all crime is permitted and people can release all of their pent up hostility. Sandin and his loved ones get caught up in an untenable situation when his son Charlie (Max Burkholder) gives sanctuary to a wounded stranger (Edwin Hodge), whose tormentors, led by a well spoken young man (Rhys Wakefield) soon come calling.What's going to lose some members of the audience is the fact that, as in so many films of this kind, the characters act in order to serve the purpose of the story rather than act sensibly. Still, it does get ones' bloodlust boiling; people may end up wishing that this dumb family bites it as violently as their enemies do. By the end, it's hard not to be yelling at the screen.The actors do what they can with the script and dialogue. Co-starring are the always watchable Lena Headey as the wife / mother, Adelaide Kane as the bratty, sullen daughter, Arija Bareikis as annoying neighbour Grace, and veteran Chris Mulkey as area local Mr. Halverson. The standout is clearly Australian actor Wakefield, who's chillingly civil as the leader of the gang.This film does kill time fairly well but it's inevitably going to let some viewers down. Maybe things will get a little more intriguing in the inevitable sequel.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good concept however lacked delivery,"A day in which crimes are all forgiven, for America has found new refuge under the tradition of the annual purge, a concept which toys with our inner primate selves. The Purge begins very slowly setting the scene in an eerily fashion, viewers are introduced to the normality of the purge quite quickly and it is this normality which then makes the later developments in the plot so shocking to an unsuspecting viewer.The concept is one which could of probably been delivered to a higher standard however the movie to an extent does give it some justice, with it only being 85 minutes in total leaving you hungry for more it immediately becomes apparent that ""The Purge"" is a short taster to a number of following prequels,it provides an insight into ""home invasion"" one aspect of many which could be exploited in the concept of ""The Purge""With the whole movie being set in the house like movies similar such as ""panic room"" the director has chosen to diversify the film by using a number of different rooms on screen within the family house however due to it being set in the early hours of the morning and later developments leading to low level lighting it means that most of the movie is quite dark.Ethan Hawke plays the patriotic father of the family, an upper class family which strongly supports the annual purge however when they become involved stumble upon choices they must have to make in order to protect there family from the threat outside. The family and neighbours were poorly portrayed by their actor counterparts, it really took value away from the movie and made you want to question were they acting with the boy child being emotionless throughout the film and the neighbours being gormless in some scenes.Despite this I was glued to my chair throughout, the movie started slow however became quite fast moving. With me not seeing the trailer beforehand the movies events were more of a shock as they came to play and allowed for me to be more gripped. Following the credits the general consensus was positive for being such a low budget film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll be checking all of your doors and windows mid way through this film!!,"The Purge has got to be one of the best low budget horror movie I have seen in a long time. It's an intense film that really gets the audience thinking ""what would I do"" if put in a similar situation. Despite what a lot of critics think, this film really delivers an emotional ride from start to finish. The acting and directing are superb and the storyline is quite believable.Rhys Wakefield as the leader of murdering marauders is wonderfully cast given his boyish charm and good looks combined with a wicked smile. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great are the all American couple who really just want what everyone wants: a good family, a nice home and money.

Mediocre but enjoyable nonetheless,"With an unusually short screening time, The Purge fulfills its objective. Despite the substantial amount of cliché's and recycled conventions typical to that of horror, the film sparks attention due to the originality of its premise. I suppose the producers could have delved further into character and plot development, but the film achieves what it set out to do. Yet it made me wonder what my country would be like if the government sanctioned one day a year merely for bloodshed. It's not entirely a memorable film , alas I will recommend it to other film enthusiasts. With a sequel already in the pipeline, I look forward to the directors delivery",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Social Consequences,"The social consequences of permitting murder and unrestrained violence one night a year would be very far reaching. Although we get some info on that via background newscasts, the film focuses on what this very night brings for a certain family. Produced by Jason Blum, who very successfully launched a series of scary movies (Indisious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity,...) who all made a ton of money, but were made for a budget no higher than 5 m$. I liked the movie, it was well made, but it could have explored other interesting aspects of this premise. The Purge 2 is already announced, but they will probably make a similar movie with other characters instead of trying to expand this interesting fictional world.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Worst movies I have ever seen...,"Where do I begin? This movie was such an absolute waste of my time it is ridiculous. I have never been so frustrated after walking out of a movie. This movie had so much potential with such a solid idea and such a great premises that was all thrown to absolute crap with this story line. There was no character development, no back story, no details about the events of the day, no history, and nothing to build on for the whole movie. The events that occurred were so unlikely yet predictable that the movie was not even enjoyable to any degree. The entire audience was laughing almost the whole time and seemed to be entertained only by their fellow audience members, not the movie. By the end of the film I was in need of medical stress relief and a good purging myself because of how angry and frustrated I was at not only the unlikeliness of every action and emotion in this movie, but at the absolute waste of such a genius idea that the film was based on. I felt no relation to any character and thought the entire movie was just garbage. The best actor in this movie by far was Rhys Wakefield, and what a waste of his talent it was. If there was a way for me to destroy this movie as to stop anyone else from wasting valuable life time on this garbage, it would be my life mission. I cannot describe my hatred towards this ""film"" enough. I put quotes on film because it is almost a joke to call it that. Bottom line, please do not waste your time on this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Passing but not quite satisfactory.,"After watching this movie I felt compelled to right my first and maybe only review and the way I see it is that there are two ways to go into this movie.First, as a movie goer that believes the plot is what defines the movie. Well if this is the case, let me say, save the however many dollars you'll have to spend. In a nutshell, the government has found a way to boost the economy while also reducing crime, and this is through the annual 'purge' where all crime is legal for 12 hours. There are several major characters and a lot more minor characters in this movie. Obviously there's the family that consists of the mom, dad, son and daughter, and the minor characters that I want to refer to as the purgers. Many possibly interesting conflicts emerge and a few, if not none at all, get resolved in any meaningful manner. There is little to no character background; the only person there is the slightest background for is the dad, everyone else's background is literally only shown in small 10-20 second clips and cut-scenes through the beginning of the movie, and we know even less about the purgers. If you ever do find yourself getting somewhat into the plot a character does something completely ridiculous and you find yourself loathing the movie again.If, that's not what you came for, and you've came to just watch the film it'll somewhat be worth the money spent; but only a little. The moment you decide to not care about what happens and what lead to these certain situations you can get pretty interested. As the movie trots along the action builds up, but then just stops... There are several points in the movie where something happens and you just expect the movie to end at a point where it would actually make sense but doesn't, then it continues, you think it's going to end again, it continues, then it ends in the absolutely worse way, at least in my opinion.Plot - 4; Interest Level - 7; Overall - 5.5 (F grade): Applaud the effort but still a fail. Giving the benefit of the doubt and rounding up, it's a D; below average... it'll get you by but isn't necessarily a good thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Idea, Poorly Executed.","The Purge! An annual event in which criminal acts, including murder, are permitted by the government thus allowing all good American citizens to 'cleanse' themselves of their negativity and hatred without fear of consequence. What a great premise for a film!Sadly, the potentially thrilling idea is poorly executed across the 1 hour and 25 minutes of this first in a series of films. Its main downfall is its predictability. I won't go as far to call them 'twists' because the plot is painfully straightforward but you will certainly see the two big plot points coming before they occur in the later part of the movie. The casting and acting varies from adequate to weak, but then the characters themselves are overly generic and uncomplicated.I guess the real draw of The Purge was supposed to be its violent scenes, but even then it does nothing new, exciting or shocking. I can't help feel that in the hands of another Director/Writer the concept could have been something very thrilling indeed but since there are a couple of sequels, maybe the next in the series might deliver? Maybe a future instalment will take a deeper look at the moral implications of the annual event? Or, more likely, they will just be repeats of the same idea in varying locations. I shall see.The Purge then; great idea but ultimately forgettable. Not badly filmed, mildly entertaining in places but overall a bit of a missed opportunity. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not perfect,"First of all, If you're not a big fan of horror movies like me, you can watch the purge, it's not very scary nor gory, it is just supposed to be nerve-wracking. I'm not saying it's not but it could be better. I think if it was a little longer, the movie would've had the time to set the scene better and to introduce us more to the characters in order for us to connect with them, which is not the case here. The problem if you don't care for the characters in a movie in wich they suffer, is that you don't, and so it is kinda pointless. Furthermore, everything is happening too fast so you don't even have the time to fear the threat.
What a shame for such a good idea of concept which in itself is very interesting and scary, I would'nt like to live in a society which allows this kind of brutality even tough it's just one day in a year.
But finally, I couldn't say I hate this movie or that it is bad on all points because it did scare me a few times and it was dealing well with fear. There was no big mistake for me.
To put in a nutshell, it could have been a great movie if it lasted 2 hours or more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sequel is in order to rectify some things,"Imagine one day of every year in which all things are legal, including murder. Imagine being allowed that one day to act upon your frustration, rage, hatred, curiosity? Would you do that? Most people, including myself, probably would not because of their core beliefs; whether it's God, Love, Karma, the Golden Rule or other than that. But, what would it look like if people did act upon those base desires? The Purge explores that. It's a novel concept but the execution wasn't that great. Granted, this movie could have been done a million different ways, but they chose to focus on one family. Unfortunately, it was this family that took a potentially classic movie and made it simply another movie.Every movie needs, as TNT says, drama. There has to be a conflict and usually a resolution. The drama in this movie was borne from the acts of two children. The children and their roles in this movie were very cliché. How many are the movie children that create issues because they are either rebellious, naive, curious or just plain vulnerable. This movie had the rebellious and the naive. The actions of the rebellious, smart-mouth daughter brought about a certain fracas and likewise the action of a naive, well-meaning son brought about conflict.After a slow start the movie kicked into gear with the dramatics and the action. Whether or not you can get behind the individual family members in this movie or get behind them as a whole, this movie does cause you to pick sides, so to speak. The Purge does cause you to ask yourself questions pertaining to the entire event and just where you stand or what would you do.All in all, this was not a great movie but I'd like to see a sequel. Perhaps with the right feedback they could make a better part two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

In fact, almost all of the countless remakes of 1970s films are abysmal. Why not just watch the original? ""The Purge"" SUCKS, and I have not seen it. I don't need to - from the ads, it is clearly modern Hollywood garbage, with a premise SO ridiculous I can't freaking believe it. In a crime-free society (like that's possible), citizens are allowed to ""purge"" one night of the year. Yeah, okay! Then, (I guess the brain-dead filmmakers didn't realize) the remainder of the year will be spent rebuilding smashed and burnt out buildings, providing physical and psychological care for countless victims, etc.... I am so disgusted at the state of cinema today it makes me want to puke.

Disappointing,"The trailer and the general idea of the movie seemed original and quite interesting. After the first 20 minutes I began to question my decision to watch the movie. The characters seemed completely fake and made up. They lacked logic and general realism. For example, when the bad guys wearing stupid masks (supposed to look creepy) made the family start looking for the homeless guy, they shut down the power. WHY? If you want someone to find someone else why would you shut down the power. Another example is when Henry got shot. His girlfriend didn't seem to care about what happened at all. Her boyfriend just tried to kill her dad and ended up getting killed himself. Yes, she did cry but it just didn't seem believable.

A movie that keeps you tense and on the edge of your seat the whole time. Much better then I expected. I recommend this. I say A-,"""This is the Emergency Broadcast System announcing the commencement of the annual purge as sanctioned by the US government. Commencing at the siren any and all crimes including murder will be legal for twelve continuous hours."" In the future America is flourishing. Almost no un-employment, crime or homelessness due to the fact that one night a year crime is legal. When the night rolls around again the Sandin family settles in inside their protected house and starts to relax. When the son, trying to do the right thing, protects someone in trouble it puts the entire family in danger and the house doesn't seem so safe. While this is a horror movie I do have to say that it's more along the lines of The Strangers then a typical horror. The plot of the movie isn't really that far fetched which makes it a little more terrifying. While I wouldn't call the movie scary I do have to say that it made me feel tense and edgy for almost the entire time. This is a movie that kept me interested and intrigued the entire time.

Actually quite good,"Set in the distant future of 2022 (!) I went into this film knowing very little, simply assuming that there is a purge, probably involving killing lots of people. What I got was The Strangers (2008) but with an actual story. So it was actually quite good. It starts with the social commentary and questionable morals that you would expect from a Blumhouse film. The ending was a glorious orgy of violence. I'm surprised that they didn't even imply that some people are involved in the purge for sexual violence. I was engaged for the film and liked the focus on the family but couldn't help but hope that at least one of the many sequels focuses on the morals and the reasoning and the consequences of someone doing the killing rather than just those trying to make money from it.

Ignores the large scale  just a basic horror flick,"On the large scale, allowing anarchy to reign in any country would just encourage revolution and insurgence. Gangs of dissatisfied citizens would plan every year to sow anarchy during the time they know cops aren't going to be around to enforce the laws. If they start eliminating all the cops in large regions, as they do in revolutionary and anarchistic countries, then after the purge is over, who is there to restore order? This is the problem we are seeing in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the new cops are killed off at graduation ceremonies, and police stations are bombed. What results is a perpetual anarchist state, ruled by warlords and gangs.Well, its against the rules of the purge to use automatic weapons or to go after cops. Again, people who like hunting other people aren't going to just follow the rules because they are docile and easily controlled. They'll probably just do as they wish, eliminate the cops and the authorities while they have a chance, and cause the downfall of the government.Any society is just a few days away from revolution. Take away basic services over a large enough area, take away emergency and policing, make it hard for people to get food.Overall, this is just a childishly silly premise for a basic horror movie.

The movie surprised me on one fact how many douche-bag bros and people who tend to love the worst movies. I was in a theater with these people and it was the worst I used to think old people were the worst movie goers. I was dead wrong the Bros are without a doubt the worst movie goers they should never be allowed in the theater unless they are alone. The movie isn't about the no laws the movie is truly about the rich vs. the poor. It makes sense because the rich can afford the big old security systems, but the homeless don't even have homes so no wonder they are targeted. I will have to say if you think this movie is a horror film it really isn't this is a survival film. For those of you who don't know the movie is about this kid lets a hunted homeless man into the home and the people trying to kill him are breaking in to kill everyone. The family must survive the night to live to see another day.The biggest name in this movie is Ethan Hawke who plays the father of the family and he does a great job. He is the most rational member of the family for the most part even more important he has one scene in this movie where he is just a complete bad mother f*****. I do have to say his daughter in this movie is drop dead gorgeous, Adelaide Kane is so freaking hot in the movie it made me a happy camper sitting in that theater. No need for me to say what is truly going on in my head during those scenes with her. I will have to say the James Sandin and Mary Sandin (the parents) would have been much better off if they never had kids. There son may have rational views but he is too damn compassionate with the fact he lets a man being hunted into the house and when the family is looking for the man he hides him. His daughter as fine as she may be is a moron to say the least I won't say what happens but damn is she a dumb son of a b****. The performance I thought was very well done was Henry (Tony Oller) he was the leader of the group trying to kill the homeless man. The guy was clearly nuts but he was so polite you almost could have been like well let him kill the homeless man he said please.This movie was directed and written by James DeMonaco he is a big TV writer, he wrote The Killing Point and Crash. I liked the Killing Point a lot as a show and I think he did a great job with the dialog and the overall pace of the movie. It is paced perfectly once it gets going it's bat s*** crazy. I hope to see more movies from him because I believe James did a great job with this movie and how everything plays out.Overall this isn't a deep movie as it might at times try and be but it is a fun movie and if you are a jumpy person this is the movie for you. This is just a really goo thriller, survival horror whatever you want to call it, it is well worth the price of admissions. I'm going to give this a high C+ see this on the big screen it's well worth it.go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exercise in poor taste,"Starting out with a silly basic premise of allowing anarchy to reign unchecked for 12 hours once a year, this film has reasonably decent performances from its cast but is sold out by generally dull writing and consistently mediocre and uninspired direction. The idea that crime can be controlled by allowing a free-for-all one night a year is ridiculous, and it says much about a society which is so incapable of controlling itself that it needs to resort to a purge instead of finding healthy ways to channel aggression.The writer/director relies far too much on stupid choices made by the characters (I counted four from the son before I just stopped counting) for his plot twists, and also far too much on last second saves of someone's life when all seems to be lost (again, I counted four separate incidents before I stopped counting). The cast works hard, but there's zero chemistry between the parents and nothing but smirking, mincing lunacy from the main antagonist. The fixed, passive-aggressive grins as everyone wishes everyone a safe night became simply annoying.People who don't mind a bit of barely-motivated gore and violence will likely enjoy this without caring about the poor quality. People who want some intelligence in the films they watch would do better to look elsewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anti-climax,"I really was looking forward to this film, it seemed like the perfect combination of violence and drama. I hyped myself up to it being amazing after reading several good reviews explaining how spine-chillingly good it was but I have to say I was rather disappointed. Not only did the film seem rushed the acting had a lot to be desired. I really enjoyed the film, don't get me wrong. The entire concept of it was unbelievable, quite frankly whoever thought of the storyline deserves an award because it was so complex but simple to understand for those who aren't massively into films. However, I came out the cinema feeling disappointed. It was probably one of the most anti-climatic films I've ever seen. I was really looking forward to some good old-fashioned torture scenes and grimy violence (as sadistic as it sounds) but it just didn't happen. Everything happened at once, with barely a build-up to it. It's as if the producers said ""Look, you've got 85 minutes to make it work. No less, no more."" It was so crammed into a short period of time that the audience didn't have a chance to sit on the edge of their seat, shaking with tension. Not only was the timing an issue for me but the storyline was PREDICTABLE. Now, I'm pretty good at guessing story lines to films just because of my interest in them but seriously? This was like elementary guessing. You could see a ""jump-out"" scene coming from a mile away, so when it actually happened you all but skipped a breath. In addition to this the acting was just... Well for those of you who're planning to see it you'll understand. I would recommend this film, but don't hype yourself up for a thrill ride of a lifetime because it's far from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not exactly a Purge. More like a dry heave.,"The Purge is an interesting and horrifying concept. Initially the movie draws you in on a government holiday where for 24 hours no crime is punishable.The basic problem and missed opportunity is the film doesn't explore and tell a more in-depth story on the origin of the Purge, including why the US has ""new founding fathers"" and overtones of Christian religious domination.This worthy origin is instead implied thru really brief radio and TV clips which never fully explains the ""why"" and ""how"".Instead the film devolves to affluent family trapped as their high security home is being breached by Purge participants outside. The movie is worth a single viewing based on the creative premise and helped with solid performances by Hawke, Hedley and the rest of the cast. Unfortunate missed opportunity in story telling.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge (2013) Movie Review,"*Director - James DeMonaco*Actors - Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane, Edwin Hodge and Rhys Wakefield.*Synopsis - Set in the year 2022, ""The Purge"" is about a family's fight to stay alive during the annual purge - a 12 hour period in which all crime is legal.*Review - I came into this movie with relatively low expectations. The trailer looked promising, but what can one expect from modern day horror movies but disappointing clichés and poor acting? To my great surprise, ""The Purge"" turned out to be a frightful ride that showcased the immense flaws in a supposed Utopian society.All of the actors shined in their roles. Ethan Hawke was amazing at portraying a protective matriarch. Lena Headey and Max Burkholder showed an honest portrayal of characters at odds with their morals. Adelaide Kane and Edwin Hodge, while both adequate actors in their roles, didn't really wow me in their performances. Finally, Rhys Wakefield was truly extraordinary in his role of of the polite sociopath.I enjoyed James DeMonaco's style. In the beginning, he chose camera angles that one would see in any film. However, as the movie progressed, DeMonaco used jerky and fast camera angles and shots that reflected the characters moods at the time: completely disoriented and unprepared. Scary scenes during the purge were sudden and intense, which definitely upped the scare factor for me. The script had smooth dialogue throughout that didn't venture into unrealistic territory. The only thing that really bothered me was that the film seems too short, with the actual action occurring late into the film. And unless the world changes drastically in the next nine years, ""The Purge"" would be more effective if it took place in an unknown time in the future, so that humans could truly question whether this would become reality.The soundtrack was also good. I particularly enjoyed the beginning credits, which played soft music over horrific crimes. It was such a raw and sharp contrast that it got you thinking of what the purge really does to people. Besides that, everything else seemed to fit the movie pretty well, although no other effects really amazed me.""The Purge"" is a terrific film if your ever in the mood for thought provoking horror. While the premise may seem faulty, the movie asks you many questions about morality and challenges you to think of what you would do if the purge was actually in existence.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
watchable but cliché,"its OK, not quite as bad as people say, but watch it as it was intended just a take on an elitist new religion crazinesssome parts will make you rage and the sheer cliché shock tactics like some stroppy girl marching about a house undersiege on her own.the do the right thing undertones and you will only be human for 364 days of the yearthe bits that i actually took away and did haunt me for several hours after the film (which leans me towards I must have enjoyed it on some level) was the scary portrayal of elite people justifying their needs to kill homeless and poor people. People treating this as a new religion quite far apart from the 'thou shall not kill' attitude that religion tends to have and replaces it with thou shall not kill, unless it is the designated 12 hour allotment.essentially it came down to if you could kill once per year legally for a 12 hour period then the poor and homeless get crucified.essentially the idea is OK, i liked some of the idea but it is riddled with holes and what ifs that if this were a reality would actually happen rather than the singular example of the film.my biggest bugbear was they waited until the actual start of the purge to lock themselves in their armoured home, Christ i would have had that door down as soon as all family members were accounted for and left them closed way past the hour.to me it was written by someone who was stoned when they came up with the idea and didn't really think the reality of it through.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Didn't live up to expectations,The premise of the purge is very interesting but it's merely a set up for what become a regular home invasion film. Maybe an improvement would've been the family being forced to leave their home and try to survive in the the chaotic streets.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poorly Executed Popcorn Piece,"The basic idea of 'The Purge' is not too bad and, in a better film, would have been entertaining and interesting to watch. Sadly 'The Purge' is not that film. The home invasion thriller genre may have been done to death but it's still a personal favourite of mine. Home invasions always seem scary no matter how many times you've seen it before but the main feeling 'The Purge' leaves you is not terror or tension but a lack of belief and mild boredom.Although it contains a few good sequences 'The Purge' is generally poorly executed. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey do their best to ham things up but the script itself is poorly written. We are asked to believe in and root for the characters but they make so many stupid decisions each and every scene that it's hard to like them, or even dislike them. Instead I just didn't care. Their emotions too seem almost always out of kilter with the events of the preceding film, a problem that hardly helps to build tension for the situation.Much of any home invasion film's tension derives from the characters making use of their house and its space but in 'The Purge' the house seems inordinately large, even for a rich family in the suburbs. Throughout the film I felt myself asking the question, how big is this house? I know American houses are large but is it really this big?'Purge's' other main problem is its message. Instead of subtly posing questions and answers or calling our attention to the real life social implications of the film's basic premise writer-director James DeMonaco decides to hit you over the head repeatedly with a large brick from the very opening of the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"With some suspension of disbelief, The Purge is an excellent thriller.","Cleansing Hollywood of its sinsThe Purge is better than you probably expect, and you're probably already hyped for it. It's rare that a film has writing, directing, and acting work with perfect synchronization to establish a solid image for the film. It would have passed as a stirring horror/thriller based on concept alone, but it refuses to rely only on its marketable premise to attract viewer-ship. Finally, we can enjoy a horror movie without feeling like we're being baby-talked to.The Purge toys with the concept of an America in which all crime (as long as it is not at the expense of a prominent government figure) is legalized for 12 hours, one night a year. During this time no help is available; police and hospitals are preoccupied hiding in their own homes. Purging night has helped whittle crime rates to a measly 1% of what it used to be, and helps Americans unleash pent-up aggression. It's a foolproof system.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke, giving horror another go since his role in Sinister) makes a large profit for his family by selling security systems designated especially for the yearly occasion. When purging night arrives once more, he and his wife (Lena Headey) and two kids (Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder) prepare for an uneventful night behind the protective barriers.But the beautiful thing about America is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. James' son Charlie doesn't see the humanity in purging night. When a homeless man becomes the target of a group of masked hunters who use the night to unleash their heinous (but highly educated) anger, Charlie lets him through the barrier into their home. The group of anonymous private school students targets the family for protecting the swine born to be hunted this night. ""If you had to kill someone tonight, would you?"" Charlie asks his parents.Unrelentingly gripping the guileful concept, director and screenwriter James DeMonaco slides current political issues into the film. The concept is navigated from the standpoint of a typical small American neighborhood. There's sweet old Mrs. Robinson from across the street, pulling a final batch of chocolate chip cookies out of the oven and sharpening her machete for tonight. Who do you know who would take advantage of purging night, the film asks. Would you?Our four heroes don't have much time to make up their minds. Morals, instincts, and beliefs clash as the family attempts to survive and retain their humanity. The acting is fantastic across the board, especially Rhys Wakefield as our charming gun happy antagonist. He's very Ledger-esque without coming across as a blatant rip off.Every scene is fueled with an agenda to entertain and a different means of entertainment. Part churning and suspenseful and part heart-in-your-throat action, the film rewards with every sequence. The action scenes play well and are perhaps the most satisfying of the film, despite being nearly incoherent from frantic camera movement. The audio is recorded with raw scratchiness from the opening scene and teases its way to a climax of rending but pleasant clamor. (Maybe my position a mere five rows away from the screen made it louder than it actually was.) The over-the-top gunfights combat the film's clever subtleties well.The true greatness of the film is how DeMonaco uses horror as a medium to provide social and political commentary. I don't think most horror movies can add 2 plus 2. This film could ace a calculus exam.Bonus: producer and CEO of Blumhouse Jason Blum held a Q&A after the film was over. Blum is the mastermind behind horror hits such as Insidious and Paranormal Activity (and, if I was writing this in 2014, I'd most likely include The Purge on that list). Blum is a very down-to- earth and tan guy eager for The Purge to hit theaters. Someone in the crowd asked him how long the Paranormal Activity series will go on. His frank reply: ""I probably shouldn't say this Paranormal Activity will continue as long as people continue to see it."" Interesting.The Purge comes out June 7. There's no doubt in my mind this quieter film can stand its ground against the extravagant CGI and chivalrous superheroes this summer.9/10 starsYou can read the full review here: http://logankrum.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/the-purge/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really Good Home Invasion Movie,"In the near future crime has fallen to an all-time low thanks to what is known as ""the purge"" - a yearly one-off 12-hour period where the government has allowed all types of crime to be committed without fear of consequence. James & Mary Sandin, along with their son, Charlie, and daughter, Zoey, are preparing themselves for the purge when Charlie let's a potential murder victim into their house for refuge. However, the group who have been chasing the stranger gives James an ultimatum - give them the stranger or face the consequences. Torn between the choice of protecting his family and morality, James has to decide what to do - and doesn't have much time to do it.The Purge never had a really good write up by a lot of people but in all honesty I actually quite enjoyed it. It's nothing fantastic, but it delivers a good bit of tension & suspense with a couple of wee twists.The idea of crime being down to only 1% is a fantastic thought, but the idea that the film puts forward on how to get that 1% is very contentious. I mean it makes you think - would you be OK with crime being at an all-time low if there was only one specified period of the year where all services are non-responsive within that time and crime is non-punishable? The film kind of raises those morality issues. But even if you don't want to get ""that deep"" into the movie, it's still good just to watch without too much thought.The characterisation in The Purge I think is done pretty well too. Ethan Hawke does a good job as James Sandin, a well-off businessman but isn't arrogant about it. The ""strangers"" are annoying but they're meant to be with the leader being played well by Rhys Wakefield. You do find it quite hard drawing up any kind of sympathy for the Sandins' daughter, however, with her being the typical bratty 16/17-year-old.Anyway, The Purge is a decent film to watch. It's not Oscar winning but it's not meant to be. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm not sure what Ethan Hawke's issue is but he should stick to whatever roles come naturally to him. Ethan in particular, was pretty bad in this film. The wife, Headley, ditto bad. Best acting was done by Bloody Stranger - Edwin Hodge. There could have been a better, clearer and more interesting sub plot: the neighbors.

2022 not so far but people struggling right now!!!,"The year 2022 is shown in this movie where people are allowed to purge at an event that is organized annually by the US. The purge leads to no medical or other services for 12 hours. The cast was good specially Ethan Hawke. I know we live in sorrows but purge is not a good way to release the pressure. So, the movie as an imagination is acceptable but not in any other manner. Few action scenes were nice. The movie just revolved around a single house thats a bit disappointing otherwise it was very watchable. Moreover a bunch of stupid kids wearing weird marks also annoyed me a bit. I am expecting a sequel to this where they could involve the armed forces or even ZOMBIES. Recommended - Ratings 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Superb, short and sweet little cult offering","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a futuristic America, unemployment and crime have been virtually eradicated, thanks to 'the purge', an annual night a year where all crime, including murder, is legalized for twelve hours. One family who choose not to participate are the Sandins, headed by father James (Ethan Hawke), who choose the 'lock down' option in their fancy home. However, things get complicated when a homeless man approaches their door, begging to be let in before he is torn to pieces by a blood thirsty mob.It seems if an idea isn't far fetched and off the wall enough, it can certainly be sick and twisted enough to get your attention. The Purge, the latest offering from the man who was either the director of Insidious and/or the producer of Sinister or something or other, certainly wants to expose the dark heart of humanity at it's centre, but maybe it isn't as far fetched as you might first think. It presents a, somewhat controversial, but certainly thought provoking idea of how to stamp out crime from society that provides real food for thought and forces the viewer to look inside themselves and truly examine their morals and conscience.It's certainly a challenging spectacle that delivers more of itself and gets more out of you than you might have thought. In a day and age of hackneyed, tired scripts and plot lines, The Purge is genuinely suspenseful and unpredictable through out and the edge of your seat is truly where you'll be. Yes, it may follow suit with all the other modern fright flicks with it's over reliance on jump scenes to get scares, but with an intelligent script and taut direction behind it, they serve a function rather than just being meaningless window dressing.There may be a lack of political correctness to it that might put off some, but The Purge is so much more complex and surprising than you expect it to be, it stands on it's own as something to be admired. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original Concept; Execution the Problem!,"The Purge is one of those minority films that has a better ending than beginning. I came to the film enthusiastically, though knowing little about it. However the idea of a family who find themselves endangered by a gang of murderers during the annual Purge, a night during which all crime, including murder, is temporarily legal seemed really intriguing to me; especially considering America's collective love of all things to do with guns, ammunition and the right to bear arms. The Sandin family set-up is good too, with dad James a very successful entrepreneur, whose company specialises in home security systems, specifically designed to offer protection during The Purge.Unfortunately the main storyline's implementation relies frustratingly again on the eternal trope of the ""naughty children"". So we have son Charlie, who's clearly supposed to be at least 12/13 in the movie and a nerd who likes to play with electronic toys. Now despite needing to have Dad explain to him what The Purge is at the start of the movie (to give us valuable exposition), he unilaterally decides to turn off the security. Yes, somehow he already knows the access codes and decides the family will handle things differently. BTW after this occurs and creates all manner of chaos, Dad never has a critical word to say to the brat.Speaking of brats, we haven't spoken about daughter Zoey yet, who is also a unique piece of work. Although Dad doesn't approve of her boyfriend, of course she knows better. Then when said boyfriend tries to kill her father during The Purge but is grieviously wounded himself, what does she do? Yes, she runs away into the mansion-sized house, worrying about the murderous boyfriend's health and not her father's. She spends much of the rest of the movie running away from anyone who's actually likely to offer her protection. She's worse than a damsel in distress; more like a moron in distress.Mom played by Lena Headey, until very late in the third act, plays a stereotypically indecisive, dithering woman, very much the polar opposite of her infamous Game of Thrones persona, Cersei Lannister. She does a lot of nervous creeping around the house with a gun in her hand ... but not much else. Most of the heavy lifting in terms of decisive action is taken by Ethan Hawke's James and let it be said; he does a pretty good job. Also smarmily good is chief villain ""The Polite Stranger"", though it's difficult to see how he inspires much loyalty amongst his gang of thugs, when he's shown to off one for a minor infraction, within the blink of an eye.What lifts The Purge in overall quality is an excellent third act, where we actually are given several reasonably unexpected plot twists which ramp up the suspense and interest quotient accordingly. The quality of the action improves too. Early in the film there are a couple of really badly-lit, choppily edited sequences, whereas in the back half, we start to actually see who's attacking who and what they are doing about it; always a help. Even the post - credit soundtrack adds to the overall calibre of the tale.Many will be aware that due to the success of this first film, a franchise was created with the immediate sequel, The Purge:Anarchy supposedly being even better than this one. I just might be tempted after seeing this, given half a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simplistic, Unsubtle Moralizing","The Purge as a movie is mediocre at best, as social commentary it is ludicrous. My son and I laughed out loud a number of times when the movie attempted profundity.The social commentary is as subtle as a sledgehammer. It takes the most simplistic and mean-spirited caricatures of the NRA, the TEA Party, 1%- ers, and the religious right, rolls them into one dehumanized lot, and tries to sell the audience on an ultra-violent dystopian 2022 where twelve hours of state-sanctioned anything-goes mayhem is legal.One always enters a film with a willing suspension of disbelief, but this film offers up such thin caricatures and obvious moralizing that the spell is almost immediately broken.The only people who could enjoy this film would be those who believe the caricatures fair. Members of the aforementioned groups will find little recognizable in the situations, characters, or their motivations except the oft repeated stereotypes.The film reveals more about the simplistic thinking of the filmmaker than it does the groups he targets.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it certainly is near the bottom.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A ""concept"" film that doesn't bother to explore the concept","When the trailers for this film came out I was somewhat intrigued. A New American Revolution, you say? One night a year where all crime is legal, you say? Well that sounds fascinating. Tell me more.The setup, if you aren't aware of it somehow, is that it is America in the year 2022. Sometime in the film's past (it's not specific) the country went through a ""quadruple-dip"" recession along with a stock market crash that led to huge national debt and a highly devalued dollar. That in turn led some newly elected officials - the New Founding Fathers, as the film calls them - to institute The Purge: a single night where all crime is legal except use of ""above Class 4 weapons"" and crimes against ""Level 10 government employees"". The plan immediately turned things around, lowering unemployment to 1%, reducing the crime rate to non-existent levels, and ""saved the country"" as so many people in the film put it.Again I thought to myself, ""I'm intrigued. What caused that recession? What's a Class 4 weapon or a Level 10 official? Who are these New Founding Fathers, and what position do they hold? Is the country still even a Republic or America now under some other form of government?"" The premise is good at provoking thoughtful questions. Does the film bother answering any of them? No. As a matter of fact, that three-sentence summary above is just as much background as the film gives you on The Purge. You're just supposed to fill in the blanks yourself, probably by assuming that the New Founding Fathers are members of that underhanded political party you really hate. You know the one.Protip: the movie is way better if you imagine that David Icke was right and the New Founding Fathers are actually reptiliod shapeshifters who have decided to turn America into their own barbaric version of the Roman Coliseum.So with that huge potential goldmine of social commentary dangled out there appetizingly and promptly ignored, the film moves straight into giving us a decent setup for actioney whatnot. You've got your standard upper-middle-class family in their upper-middle-class home, white picket fence, 2.6 kids, etc. etc. The father is imperfect but cares about his family, the mother is generic and unremarkable (a waste of Lena Headey's talent), the younger son is borderline hypochondriac (another element left unexplored) and the older daughter is like every movie teenage daughter: more concerned with her boyfriend than anything else. The yearly Purge is a tense time for this tightly knit family, safe in their well-armored home but of varying opinions on the merits of The Purge. Do they sit down and have a frank discussion of their opinions on this literally revolutionary event? F%$# no! Film's only 85 minutes long, people! Can't have all this talking, we need to make time for gunfire, knives, and fake blood all over the place.So with the issues of family relationships also dangled and ignored, the film finally gets to the shooty heart-poundey omgitsrightbehindyou stuff. The family's uneventful locked-in Purge night is, of course, not meant to be any of those things, and in a sequence of events - one expected, one really not - things start getting out of hand. Before you know it there's a polite but clearly unhinged gentleman and his pack of murderous friends trying to break in. Things get VERY claustrophobic at this point, and it's here that the film excels. The big, big McMansion the film is set in suddenly seems very cramped indeed.The problem is, that's really the peak of the movie. From that point on it just turns into a long string of ""well that was OKAY, I guess"". There's some resolution, but not a lot. There's retribution, but not a lot. A fair amount of hope and heroism and redemption, but, again, not a lot. The film sets the stage for some very visceral moments, but more often than not doesn't give you the satisfaction you crave. Not that it's without satisfaction at all, but what you get is not what the movie leads you to believe you will be getting.With all that said, I still enjoyed the film. For a film that had the potential for such heavy-handed social commentary it was in fact quite the opposite... perhaps too much. Regardless, it still had a fair amount of action and thrills, and even a few surprises. I did not regret spending my time watching it, and came out generally pleased.In doing some research on the film I've learned that a sequel is in the works. I'm actually quite pleased to hear that, and will definitely be watching it when it finally comes out. Let's just hope the second spends a little more time exploring the concept than the first did. Like, at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cheap Political Statement rather than a film,"Whenever someone makes a movie that is first and foremost a political statement, it won't be good, unless of course you think the message is right.The Purge is a left-wing view of they see people who believe in individual liberty and the right to self-defense. Obviously, gun ownership is evil and only leads to more violence... Throw in some jabs at greedy Wall Street and this is essentially what this movie is.Even without the annoying political statements, the film is a let-down. Spoilers ahead!First, even common sense will tell you that the entire premise of this movie is deeply flawed. Crime is at an all-time low because people get to kill one day a year? Do the writers even know what the motivators are in crime? Somehow, rape, robbery, murder, and other crimes just decline because people can kill without criminal prosecution? Right! Look, the premise is interesting, but come on, put some more thought into it. People won't stop stealing just because they can murder at will one night...and murder wouldn't cease to exist because most murders are not meticulously planned out...they occur in the heat of the moment, either through rage or surprise (think a spouse murdering his/her spouse during an argument or after finding them cheating; or consider a robbery gone bad). Second, the idea that having one day a year where murder is legal will somehow keep unemployment down makes no sense. Unemployment is not a fixed number, it is related to the size of the population and there will always be unemployment regardless of the population size. When you consider the homicide rate now for a year you'll find it much higher than anything that could occur in a 12-hour span in one night. So if anything, the population would skyrocket and there would be MORE unemployment.As for the plot itself, it was very basic. A family is besieged in their house after the son lets in a homeless guy running from crazed killers. The crazed killers are of course pros at entering a house and have all the right equipment and know-how...oh, and they are apparently trust-fund babies or something. There's a bunch of killing and at the end the homeless guy saves the day, which was about as predictable as it gets. Oh and throw in a brief subplot where the daughter's boyfriend is hiding in the house and tries to kill the Dad, but he is shot and dies...and that's it for that.Plenty of plot holes though. So, they have this security system that they only need for one year...yet the entire family (at least the son and dad) know the security code by heart? The son deftly enters the code to let in the homeless guy. Sorry, but in 8 years, we'll have more security codes and passwords than we can remember and there's no way the family will know it by heart when they only use it once a year.And what is a homeless doing in a neighborhood like that? They make a point several times in the film to say that they live in a very safe area...presumably without any homeless people. Are we to believe that the killers chased the guy miles and miles to a posh neighborhood?Then there's the trust-fund hit squad. They're all wearing creepy masks (for the cheap effect of creeping out the audience) but for anyone who remembers Halloween masks...they're very difficult to see out of...much less stalk your prey and commit murder in. And they're experts at breaking into fortified houses? Their special equipment consists of some Ford F-150s and chains? Really? Just what did they attach the chains to? The steal plates didn't appear to have any convenient hook points, so...? Plus, how did they rip off ALL the steel plates? There were only two trucks and it would have taken a while for them to get to each window...probably several hours, and you can't tell me that the ENTIRE house was accessible to vehicles that had enough room for the trucks to maneuver in order to pull those plates off. I mean as a home-security expert, the Dad should have known that the best way to prevent someone from entering your home is to limit the number of approaches and entry points. For instance, you don't allow someone from the street easy access to your entire house from the outside. You put up fences, you plant trees, you make it very difficult for someone to get in. I'm sure their house would have been a tougher nut to crack than we saw.I hear they're going to make a sequel to this movie...great, another series of bad ""horror"" movies that get pawned off to the public.Don't spend money on this movie...watch it on TV or see it on Netflix or something. There are better films in the genre than this...way better.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Turns from horror to society message to full blown action 'home invasion film' starring Ethan Hawke!,"'THE PURGE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Low budget horror film that killed at the box office it's opening weekend (making $36 million, for a #1 debut, on a $3 million budget). Horror is always the most profitable genre though. They're immensely popular films because everyone loves to be scared and feel disturbed at times. They also can be made on a shoestring budget, which doesn't mean much to the viewer but as a filmmaker being forced to work on a low budget forces creativity. Horror is the best genre to do this with because it lends itself to that kind of filmmaking. Coming up with cool and unique ways to scare and startle people doesn't cost a lot of money and that's what this genre is all about. 'THE PURGE' is a great example of this; it's horror done right.The film was written and directed by James DeMonaco and produced by Michael Bay. It stars Ethan Hawke (who has been doing a lot of horror films these days, like last year's 'SINISTER', when he's not doing 'BEFORE SUNRISE' sequels that is). Hawke and Lena Headey play a married couple (named James and Mary Sandin) with two children. They have a son, named Charlie (Max Burkholder), and a teenage daughter, named Zoey (Adelaide Kane). The family is very well off as James sells security systems, in the year 2022. It's a single-party future where crime and poverty in America are almost non existent because the Government allows a 12-hour period, once a year, where all crime (including murder) is legal and emergency aid is suspended. The only laws are that high ranking government officials are not to be harmed and certain weaponry is forbidden (I'm assuming high powered explosives probably). The film all takes place at the home of the Sandins one night during 'the Purge', which is what the 12-hour period of lawlessness is called. When Charlie lets a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) into their secured home to protect him from a viscous gang of rich kids, led by a masked man (Rhys Wakefield, in a very creepy performance), it attracts the gang to their house. The leader threatens to kill everyone inside the house if the Sandins don't hand over the man. James knows that his security system is not without it's flaws, and the gang can break in, so he decides he must find and catch the stranger roaming around their house and hand him over. His morals, as well as his family's, are put to the test.The story is reminiscent (and perhaps inspired by) an episode of the original 'STAR TREK' TV series 'The Return of the Archons', from 1967. It revolves around a world, that Kirk and crew visit, which allows a similar annual 12-hour period of lawlessness in order to keep the peace the rest of the year. This idea of purging yourself of violence so you can remain peaceful the rest of the time is an interesting psychological concept and a disturbing one to me. This 12-hour period of violence seems like too great a cost, in my opinion, even if it lowers violence overall. The premise of course is a great social allegory and like all great horror the movie is full of good social commentary. It's of course also, mainly, about 'the haves vs. the have-nots' in society; how those with less money always get screwed over. In this way the film is outstanding. Hawke and Headey are great and so is Burkholder and the scene stealing Wakefield. The directing is decent for a movie like this and the writing is probably the film's highlight. It's a great idea for a horror film (despite it's many holes). The film also offers many different genre fans something. It turns from horror to society message (which most great horror does though) to full blown action 'home invasion film', starring Ethan Hawke as it's action hero. I enjoyed it and I think most horror fans will as well. There is a psychological theory that people who watch a lot of violent films 'purge' themselves of violent thoughts as well; that the more violent films one watches the less likely they are to be violent in life. I don't know if I 100% believe that but it's an interesting idea, kind of like the one presented in this film just less much drastic.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfGQiMGk-4",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Turn off your brain and sharpen your machete,"The Purge is an abstract idea given form, a kind of voice for a psychotic fantasy. Gratuitous violence served cold.The good. Great idea for a movie. Well done suspense. A few nice twists in the story. Perfect ending.The bad. Subpar acting for the most part. A few logical flaws, but not too many.The ugly. Characters without any depth.The result. For thrill seekers who like novel ideas. Others should probably abstain.On a personal note, I was not able to suspend my disbelief concerning that future. To me, this is completely impossible. I even find the idea untenable. To me, what makes us human is our ability to go beyond our animal instincts.I think this flick would have been much if they had explored more of this night instead of focusing on a single house. It might have given the opportunity to experiences unintended consequences or other interesting concepts.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful waste of time,"I seen previews for this thought it was going to be good. I am some glad i didn't go to theaters to see it. Waste of time I would have walked out of the theatre no joke. For starters there is next to no storyline, all it is is for twelve hours there is no cops or emergency workers so all hell can break loose pretty much. Ethan Hawke is so boring it is not even fit. I regret staying up late to watch this movie if your looking for a good movie this is not it. I seen some pretty bad films in my life, but this is definitely top five and my first review on IMDb. I can not see how this was so successful at the box office but it is sad that this is what movies are like now today. Paranormal Activity 20, Saw 10 and now it will probably be the purge part 30.

Kind of a mix between horror and thriller,"The great thing about this movie is that it was about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. The bad thing about this movie is that it was only about that. The movie felt really really short. At the end, I had the impression ""that was it""?Well to be fair, the movie was about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. I thought it was going to be different. Throughout the entire movie, I was waiting for a plot twist, a turn, something! Anything for me to believe it wasn't just about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. But there were no surprises, no plot twists. In fact the only surprise was the characters introduced in the first 30 minutes were the actual characters. I was let down because I was waiting for someone to be an undercover spy, or a 10 star general or connected to the mafia, but no.The other let down is the entire movie, less the first 30 seconds, was literally filmed inside the house. Nothing outside the house was filmed, so I kind of got bored.I felt like the director was trying to connect Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" to the Purge as kind of a weird ritual that their modern society accepts. However, I believe the director did not pull it off as well, and just made the movie look a little weird.Well, I thought it was something to watch with a group of friends where you don't really have to pay attention to the movie to get the main idea or entertainment from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing and Not What You Think,"The Purge tells the story of a dystopian futuristic America, where vigilance is almost non existent and unemployment rates remain at a respectable 1%. The reason for this? Because every year, for a 12 hour period the government permits American citizens to ravage the streets, killing, raping and destroying anything and everything they desire. During this time, external aid is unavailable and all emergency services are suspended. This annual holiday is known as ""the purge"" as it encourages the elitist-sort to ""purge"" all their negative emotions and violent urges.The Purge is the latest credit from Jason Blum, the man who brought us ""Paranormal Activity"" and last years ""Sinister"", both of which are highly entertaining and genuinely scary films. Therefore ""The Purge"" should be good. Unfortunately shooting a high concept sci-fi thriller on a shoe string budget and spending 90% of your budget on Ethan Hawke's hair ruins what could potentially have been one of the most interesting speculative horror films of the year.With such a great, albeit it inconceivable and questionable premisis, you'd have thought that director James DeMonaco (probably best known for his writing credits on the awful Assault on Precinct 13 remake) had a little gem on his hands. The setup is fundamentally disturbing and chilling- a world where crime is legal for one night of the year would make for a highly interesting and entertaining narrative if done properly. But the problem with The Purge is it tries too hard to please and is no where near as effective or smart as it likes to think. Add to that a so-so home invasion plot thrown into the mix, which completely sidelines the awesome setup and you have a recipe for disappointment.The film opens up nicely with an eerie title sequence which showcases how ""the purge"" plays out on the streets. From here though we are shoehorned into the claustrophobic life of James Sardin (Ethan Hawke) and his rich elitist family. Sandin designs and flogs ""purge proof"" home security systems to the neighbors and for this reason lives in an impressive lavish home himself. After a cliché ridden dinner party scene complete with flying insults about overage boyfriends, Sandin, his trophy wife Mary (Lena Heady) and their two rebellious teenagers Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder) prepare to settle down for the night, in order the wait out the annual ""purge"" which is about to commence. As Charlie questions the moral practice of such a disturbing concept (killing the needy to cleanse the streets) a stranger (Edwin Hodge) who is being pursued by a gang of masked vigilantes screams for help. Charlie, being the only compassionate character in the whole film decides to disarm the security system, allowing the bloodied stranger to take refuge in the family home. Meanwhile Zoey's creepy boyfriend sneaks into the house to pursue a conflict with her father. It's not long before the murderous mob, wearing masquerade-style garments traces the stranger to the family household. The charming but sinister leader of the mob (Rhys Wakefield) issues a chilling ultimatum to the family- hand over the stranger or they will break into the house and murder everyone inside.From here follows a battle of morals, numerous chase sequences in darkened hallways and more jump scares than you can poke a stick at as cliché ridden plot points play out like a rusty video cassette. The final act consists of an action ridden shoot-em-up, and despite a few neat twists rattles along like an old ghost train, complete with fake manufactured scares. The whole idea of the ""purge"" is lost in the muddled home invasion plot and the numerous plot holes are so large that they could swallow up the house where this dull thriller is set. The cast do a reasonable job, but the script never allows for them to be more than two dimensional clichéd cutouts (the loyal husband, the ""perfect"" housewife, the rebellious kids etc) there's even a token black guy and a pantomime villain. Wakefield steals the show as the main antagonist (a performance reminiscent of Heath Ledgers smirking Joker) but it still doesn't distract from the fact that the concept is smothered by typical horror conventions. The ending is pretty shocking and unexpected (I wasn't expecting such a main character to be dispatched in such a cruel fashion) but the last 10 minutes cannot make up for the previous 75 which are mediocre to say the least.Therefore The Purge is nothing more than a disappointing stretched out Twilight Zone, and even then it would be within the weaker of those episodes. Had the concept been properly explored (showing us the carnage in the streets, tieing up loose ends about the premisis etc) then The Purge may have been a highly entertaining and specualative thriller. As it stands, it is nothing more than your average teen slasher. Best avoided.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great concept, indifferent execution","As some other reviewers have mentioned, the concept behind THE PURGE is great: a futuristic America, where society is peaceful except for one night a year where all crime is made legal. Sadly, instead of exploring the moral concept behind that premise, THE PURGE turns out to be nothing more than a middle-of-the-road home invasion flick.Now, I like home invasion flicks, and director James DeMonaco is obviously a fan of siege-based movies having previously helmed the ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 remake (also with Ethan Hawke). Sadly, this one misses the mark by quite a wide berth, despite obvious nods to the likes of STRAW DOGS. The first hour is particularly dull, consisting of characters wandering about with torches and not doing much. I also chuckled at the way it takes the characters a full hour to come to their moral senses.Hawke and Lena Headey aren't bad actors but they play a pair of very unlikeable characters here, so the viewer can never empathise with their plight. The villains are more effective, but under-utilised, and other than some well-handled action and violence in the last half hour this really isn't much to write home about. The weak writing kills it unfortunately, which is a pity because this could have been so much better in so many respects.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Success? Really?,"What movie/box-office-success!? I'm gonna say right now that I'm a movie watcher and a bit of a winter. I may not be Steven King but I have at least an above average understanding on what it takes to make a story work and I think some may understand when I say that I stopped watching at about 55mins in and simply walked away.Everything is completely unbelievable. I don't wanna write 2 pages on why I think that is - but damn! From the moment that the black guy - no from before the moment that the bum was even on-screen, and that stupid little over-privileged boy decided to give up the safety of his entire family. 5 for 1 is not a good trade in anyway you look at it.And the stuck-up brat of a daughter who's too hot in her pants to even see straight, doing everything she can to get captured and raped by this 'intruder.'I don't even like this movie but lets entertain the idea of it. Do they not understand what kind of animals and freaks come out on that night? Do the kill cams not make it clear enough for them every single year? Does the prissy education they receive not teach them why it is important to simply lock the fkn doors and wait out 12 hours in an entire year? heck, they can sleep most of that time off! Was the daughter so insanely hot for Dick that she was willing to get raped? Could they actually be so stupid?This movie would have made sense telling a story of survivors that are outside the comforts of such a privileged life and security. But for some reason, every person turns on the father who has given them safety and security in more than one way. Every single one of the characters wanted a piece of the Purge action, else they wouldn't have been so stupid as to do everything they did.After the 'boyfriend' of the daughter was shot and the girl went missing with the intruder in the house, how is it that they spent time looking at the cams, talking and acting like its okay that shes alone in the house with an unknown man on the night of the purge. Why where they not all tearing at the doorknobs to go find her. Instead they sat and had to tell the audience the game plan - show through action Mr. Director, everyone knows a fathers instinct is to go out search and kill to get his daughter back.I could rage on and on about the stupidity of this movie. The boy betrays his father and families security twice by helping the bad man to get in and then help him hide. Why?This movie twists too many stupid angles and is only possible if every single character becomes completely stupid and looses all sense of self preservation for no real good reason. I'm not an a-hole and I can't imagine living in a world like that - but I sure understand the darkness of humanity that can be released on a night like that (the cam snippets at the opening credits as some PG examples to how bad it could actually get) horrors so unspeakable it could only be mentioned or hinted at to keep people from puking their guts out at the beast that is humanity without law, order and civility.Please if you are reading this, skip this over-rated trash. If it even made sense and had some kind of intelligence to it, I'd say give it a go because everyone has their own cup of tea. But this thing (not a movie) is so loosely put together and had to take away so much to make itself work that it's beyond an atrocity that it was able to be called a movie. Its like a couple of High School kids wrote the script. Interesting idea - yeah maybe - stupid characters and an even dumber execution.I would instead point your attention to an 'ol movie called Panic Room with Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart (2002) at least this movie made sense and it was about them outsmarting the bad guys, not about being as stupid as they can to get themselves killed like in this movie. Kristen IDR what her characters name was, she understood fear and survival and the situation was somewhat less hostile than an entire country during a purge. See that and then look at Purge, You'll know why I'm raging about stupid money milking movies like the Purge. And you'll know why I cry tears of blood when I hear that this movie is somehow popular and desirable to today's audience. They want more mindless action and less innovative and thought provoking media.When did we stop standing up for ourselves? When did we stop standing up and actually saying 'Booo' and leave the theater. Stand! Demand your money back and go find another movie or something else to do. Don't let the economy or the movie industry or the damned government bully you out of your money. Demand better entertainment! Demand better rights! Demand higher standards!Please rate this movie 1 star, if you agree. I would greatly appreciate it. And like this so that it gets bumped up and helps other people.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Inventive idea,"The Purge involves a pretty inventive idea which could spark various excuses for some horror or thriller plot lines. Despite political arguments, for innovation, the purge receives 5 stars. However where it goes wrong is going down the typical lockdown in a house, in darkness with a family to protect against masked lunatics. Its been done over, to couple it with this superb idea is madness. After a strong start it dwindles out to an average jump out of nowhere fest. There is a bout of pure violence which was enjoyable however it became a little cheap and the ending felt too improper after all that had happened.

The Purge,"I actually liked The Purge. So go ahead, dislike my review and trash all my other reviews and make a YouTube video call me a f*g and say you're going to kill me. Or save it for the Purge.Does this describe something you would do? Then The Purge is making a social comment about you, and I couldn't agree with it any more. They are trying to say that the world we live in now is worse than a future we live in during which it is legal to kill rape and molest people. This was done in many ways including rubbing it in our faces by making things the doll-faced creeps do humorous, such as when the girl jumped up in the air and got shot and went flying. Half the people in my theater were dying laughing at this. I think the makers of the movie threw this in there to show that our culture has become so adjusted to violence that we laugh at it. Go ahead, think I'm crazy, but I think there were a lot of things like this that were added that made the film a unique experience never before seen. (I never like to give away theme in my reviews, as I've said before, so sorry if this seems underdeveloped. Just go see the movie and see for yourself.) The place that bothered me about the movie is the plot that accompanied the great idea behind the film. The simple home-invasion concept seemed like it didn't suit to the idea properly, and made it seem like the idea of the Purge wasn't even necessary for the plot. Something like the characters are driving home from somewhere, get stuck in traffic during the commencement of the Purge would have been a greater idea. And yes, characters do make very stupid decisions, along with many other horror clichés scattered through out, though there was something that made it almost okay.The Purge brought about a new style of horror movie that reaches suspense not through characters or situations present, but in human nature. It brings out a fear of people substituting themselves for characters throughout the films. It brings out not terrifying suspense, but more of a type of cutting fear (it is so hard to describe this, just see it for yourself). It is a style of horror I've never seen before.Overall I really liked The Purge, and don't listen to what other people say. It isn't stupid, they just don't get it. There is so much hidden behind it that many people could not catch it. It is quite the experience that you must witness in a theater to get the whole experience so go out and see it quickly.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
well-written and meaningful horror/thriller,"If there's one thing I've learned about American reviews of movies, books, and plays it's this: you can't trust any commentary about anything that in any way addresses the issue of social class. It's no coincidence that a society as brainwashed as ours produces and watches so many zombie movies. We can identify with the metaphor in these films and, at least on a subconscious level, understand that what has happened in them is what has already happened to us. Nevertheless, like zombies, we cannot help what we do; most of our brains have been eaten by what we've been indoctrinated to believe and we must eat the brains of others in return, especially if they are still filled with any questions or critical views concerning social class and poverty. In the case of movie reviews, the vast majority of Americans will not simply bash a film for making a statement about social class, but be so conniving and ignorant of their own mindlessness as to suggest that this statement was the film's only admirable quality. Many reviews of the ""The Purge"" serve as perfect examples of such connivance and ignorance. While perhaps no masterpiece, the film is easily far better than most American horror movies, including many which have been given rave reviews. The narrative, for example, is both focused and meaningful. The film examines a family, the father of which has become wealthy and provided abundantly for his wife and children, i.e., has achieved the American dream, by the exploiting the fears of Americans during a time when all crime is permitted for one night each year. But this dream turns into a nightmare during a particular purge in which the son allows a homeless man to take shelter in their home, which is excessively guarded by the same type of security system that the father has profited from. This act of morality incurs the wrath of the family's upper class neighbors, who not only hunt down those who cannot afford to protect themselves, i.e., the poor, but have grown jealous of the father's financial success. That which the father created for prosperity and protection suddenly becomes an entrapment and the greatest threat to their well being. These events and characters are not only meaningfully tied together but present a metaphor of society that is just as familiar to Americans as the zombie genre. Unfortunately, however, the familiarity with the society presented in ""The Purge"" is of a kind that severely aggravates those who both choose and try to convince others to choose to ignore anything that might help to explain why it is that they have turned into zombies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The character development is good, and you can easily form a relationship with them, whether it's love or hate.

To say I loved the movie is an exaggeration, but it was a good one. The movie ended not with a feeling of ""I want to know what happens next."" It was more like ""that's it?"" I left less satisfied than expected. But then again, that happens to me when I go into a movie with high expectations. The action scenes were quality, the effects were great, and I loved the plot. There were some twists I didn't expect, as well as some I wish would have happened. So the big question is: ""Is it worth your money to see it in theaters?"" Yes! A television will not give this movie justice. On t.v., I probably would have rated the film a 5 or 6. But you be the judge. Let me know what you think!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst movie ever,"This movie is possibly the coolest idea I have ever seen, yet when the black dude ran in, every single moment thereafter was a f*King waste of my life. No character makes any logical decisions, nothing any normal human would do, f*King happens. They drag this movie on because they couldn't fathom any genuinely good ideas, so they f*King use up screen time with pointless bs. What would take an autistic orphan 5 seconds to act upon or decide, takes the father character a f*King life time. Whoever thought of this idea, good on you, whoever brought it to life, you should never ever ever ever ever involve yourself in another movie. Holy god every moment was so frustrating, actors in Sharknado's made more logical f*King decisions then these brain dead morons. This movie had great potential, but whoever wrote it, whoever story boarded, whoever decided the final script is a f*King moronic piece of s*it who ruined a good idea. Jesus Christ this is the first review I have EVER written, this lame excuse for a movie worked me up that much that I went through goddamn registration just to write this. Retarded ass movie, waste of f*King time, an autistic child trying to do math could plan through better decisions then what these people made the characters do. So many scenes make you just go ""Why the f*ck did he just do that and why didn't he do this"" come to think of it it happens every 2 minutes. Goddamnit lame f*k movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Let's Hope They Get it Right Next Time!,"I personally was a little disappointing with this flick. Based on the trailers and from what I read prior to viewing it I had pretty big exceptions upon walking into the theater. The acting was good but some of the decisions made by the characters were at points ridiculously unnatural and unrealistic. It was far from all bad though. I was on the edge of my seat for most the movie and it had plenty of suspense and at times the writers incorporated some pretty cool ideas.I enjoyed the first half of the film a lot. My biggest complaint was the ending of the movie which was totally deflated, it was one of those situations where you stick around for the credits thinking there has to be more but to my disappointment there wasn't. It just seemed like a really lazy way to end the movie.I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater. As I mention I was quite entertained throughout most of the show but from what I viewed as a very cool idea for a movie, I expected much more and had higher expectations. I got the opinion from the end that they were setting up for a sequel so lets hope they get it right next time!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable,"The Purge is the start of one of Blumhouse Production's horror movie franchises like Insidious and Paranormal Activity. The trailer for The Purge looked really promising but in the end the film didn't managed to get status of a modern classic. That doesn't mean I didn't had fun - yes I did. Let's start with the good things.1)The whole idea of the film is excellent.2)Some nice performances.3)The Polite Stranger was a nice villain.4)The most likable character from all was the Bloody Stranger.5)There was some great action towards the end.6)Polite Stranger's group showed some craziness, which was kinda creepy.7)The costumer for the Polite Stranger's group were well made.8)Little part of the film switched between something like found footage and non-found footage.9)Overall, it delivered entertainment.Let's see now the negatives.1)Charlie, the son, is pretty dump.2)Zoey, the sister, is also kinda dump, at least less.3)The kids's performances weren't that good.4)Henry, Zoey's boyfriend, was got too minor role.5)The Polite Stranger's defeat was disappointing.6)The writing at times.7)Feels like wasted potential.I, like many other people, think, that The Purge isn't among the best horror film in recent history.

"Great Concept, fairly standard movie","So the set-up for ""The Purge"" is simple. In a Dystopian future crime has almost been completely eliminated due to one day of the year being designated as a day where complete lawlessness is accepted. Not a bad set up, and novel concept.The Good: Yes, as I said the set-up is good. It got a lot of people excited of the possibilities of this movie and will draw in some crowds. The acting, hmmm, not to bad, not horrible for sure like most horror genre films, but nothing spectacular either. Ethan Hawke has had a decent renaissance in his career ever since ""Training Day,"" and he does a good enough job in this one that it is a decent stand-up movie.The Bad: OK, this is not going to win any awards. Beyond the dystopian set-up this one just becomes more of a family held hostage by maniacs on the outside type of movie. I think judging by the low rating so far (5.6 at the time of the review), people were expecting a lot more from the deliciously novel concept. It doesn't deliver solidly on that. If you set expectations aside, it is however worth a little more in my opinion.Lastly, another bad aspect. This is a thinly veiled idealism propaganda movie. It has a strong left wing stance trying to hint that this dystopian future is based on conservative ideas, set up in order to make sure ""poor"" people are the victims of the purge and they eradicated each other. Rather strange because historically it has been far left governments who have actually ""Purged"" people more often than right wing ones. Don't let it bother you and just watch an entertaining movie. It's not great enough of a movie to take a message like that seriously.The verdict for me is a 7. Great set-up, average acting (which is above par when it comes to horror movies), decently entertaining movie even if the kids in the movie seem to be the dumbest kids ever. Just don't get the hopes up to high as to the fantastic possibilities running through your head when you see previews.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge Review,"The Purge (2013) Starring:Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey,Max Burkholder,Adelaide Kane,Rhys Wakefield,Tony Oller,Edwin Hodge,Tom Yi,Arija Bareikis, Chris Mulkey,Tisha French,and Dana Bunch Directed by James DeMonaco Review ONE NIGHT A YEAR, ALL CRIME IS LEGAL Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here with a lazy piece shriek that will make you want to cleanse yourself like the murders do in this movie. The Purge is a twenty-thirteen horror slash political thriller brought you by the people who gave us great modern horror classics such as Paranormal Activity 4(SUCKS!),Sinister(Best horror film in years).This film will change everything you know about horror movies,one critic called this movie ""The most important horror movie ever"" and I strongly agree with him or her. Oh my goodness I can't take it anymore, I tried, I really, really tried, The Purge is the worst movie ever! This movie should have it's name changed to wasted potential or maybe the purse,since you know the year it came the audience put all there hard-earned money into it which is sad really. When I say this movie made money I mean it made a house load of money. The Premise is that all crime is legal for one night a year which sounds interesting,so naturally just for that concept anyone would see this horror flick,but then we have it turn into a generic slasher where Ethan is playing well hell I don't remember his characters name because characters, what characters? He crated a house defense system for his and other homes during purge night,but when a random homeless man is outside begging for help his son let's him in. Oh boy doesn't win the child of the year award for stupid. Their is a cult waiting for this homeless man to be delivered to them so they can purge. But the problem with the concept is while realistic,stupid realistic cause it's stupid but it could happen, how could they justify such an idea? One night a year anyone can kill anyone for funzies. How did this get started?, in a politically correct world like ours especially in America how would they get away with something like that? and lastly how did the government come up with this idea? The setting isn't even all that cause while it is a realistic house in a somewhat nice neighborhood, it's just lame and boring this movie has no fun it tries to be way too serious and fails miseberly? None of the elements of a good horror film are in this movie,setting lame,concept cool but at the same time tries to be taken way too seriously and is pretty stupid,acting well like I said what characters? I give The Purge a half out of five.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Believe Negative Reviews,"I watched this movie after hearing how different it was compared to most cinema coming out of Hollywood. I will start with the general concept of the movie, it was phenomenal. A lot of creative thinking went into the one night of lawful murder, theft, and destruction. That was a bit brilliant.Parts of the plot were predictable, but to those who call it ""laughable"" in that regards aren't thinking about the entire scope of the plot as there are some points that could have gone either way. A certain point does give away a ""predictable"" feel, but that wasn't enough to ruin the film.I enjoyed the acting and the constant progressing events throughout the film, it was very well done, there are some changes I would have liked to have seen made. But due to the uniqueness of it and some of the very creepy and intelligent themes, I ranked it highly.True Score: 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Honest Review,"When I read some of the criticisms on IMDB, it's no wonder so few people make good teachers. Incapable of giving credit where credit is due.There are really terrible films worthy of 0/10 or 1/10 and I can list them but this is not one of them.Blair Witch Project for example was the first film I ever witnessed people actually screaming for their money back. There was almost a riot in the hood. There's a title for a new movie. They were all refunded. There are some areas and communities where the cost of a cinema ticket is a lot of money to them. They are much less forgiving.I watched this in 2013.Positives
1. Refreshingly original plot.2. Ethan Hawke is a good actor. He was good in Training Day and fans of that movie will not be disappointed with his performance in this film.Lena Headley and Rhys Wakefield were excellent.So there's 2 marks straight off the bat.3. Professional filming. I don't recall any Dizzycam/Vomit-cam/Queasycam or whatever you want to call the deliberate and cheap misuse of handheld cameras that induces nausea and vomiting in viewers like myself. I'm surprised there hasn't been lawsuits against today's atrocious generation of directors. More said on that in another thread.4. Film was of a reasonable duration. What's up with films being 3 hours these days & boring for the most part.5. Decent score & decent unpredictable ending
6. Entertaining especially Rhys Wakefield if you prefer educated well spoken antagonists. Loved him in this.So overall 6 marks/10 for 6 points. Probably worth 6.5/10.Negatives:1. They shouldn't have used the talking doll. I agree with users who found this particularly annoying/irritating and it ruined the younger actor (Max Burkholder)'s scenes which were otherwise reasonable.2. More could have been done with the premise but that might have required a much bigger budget than the $3million used. Yes. People seem to forget just how low budget a film this was, yet it managed to gross $89 million.So would I recommend it? Yes. Did I recommend it in 2013/14. Yes. Other movies of that time that you could watch back to back is Wolf Of Wall St but you've probably seen it already. Thanks for reading my honest & sincere review.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Purge,"With a high concept evoking a sense of morality reminiscent of 'The Hunger Games', 'The Purge' has an intriguing premise that it fails to fully explore.In this thought-provoking thriller, the citizens of America are left without emergency services during an annual twelve-hour period where all crime is made legal. To avoid the anarchy which they simply must wait out, a typical suburban family lock down their house while 'The Purge' is occurring. When a persecuted stranger manages to take refuge in their home, the moral fabric of the family is tested as they must decide how to manage the situation and escape with their lives.'The Purge' has great scope for exploring the sheer chaos that would occur in a realistic portrayal of these events, however an eye-opening first act becomes a typical horror-thriller, running with the home invasion thread and working it into the ground. Perhaps the micro-budget dictated this was all that could be possible, but the missed opportunities are far too many for the film to make a bold enough point about its subject matter. The marketing for 'The Purge' carried the foreboding tagline 'Reminder, All Emergency Services Will Be Suspended'. Why then, is there not a single reference to this concept besides the fleeting sound of sirens as the film closes?As the generic horror the film reduces itself to, 'The Purge' is a minor success thanks to some solid performances across the board, and Jason Blum's trademark chills and thrills. But as the disturbing social commentary it should have been, 'The Purge' wipes itself out. If a sequel is developed, there is not only the chance to indefinitely up the ante, but also to give the premise some much needed depth.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good Idea to A Film That Should Have Been Better,"This is a film that was marketed with a smart idea - in the near future America has legalised all crime including murder for one night only as a form of cathartic relief . Interesting idea ripe for all types of social commentary . That is until you actually get round to watching the film itself and discover it's merely used as a plot device to set up the story which is one of these stories you've seen before via ASSUALT ON PRECINCT 13 which itself is a reworking of RIO BRAVO . Nothing wrong with this in principle since every film you've ever seen is based upon something else . The problem is THE PURGE is never as good as it could have beenRight away when you give the premise itself you start thinking would you be able to trust anyone if they're allowed to kill , rape or maim you or your loved ones ? The logical thing to do for the average middle class American would be to buy a plane ticket to Canada or Mexico the day before the purge and fly back afterwards . On second thoughts going to Mexico might a case of out of the frying pan in to the fryer but Canada would be a good bet . Just lock up your home with shutters and Canada here we come for a relaxed weekend . This however doesn't occur to the Sandin family or any of the other characters in the film . The Sandins are wholesome middle class middle America and are complete idiots . What essentially happens is what Roger Ebert describes as ""the idiot plot"" ie in order for the plot to progress the characters in the film have to do idiotic things . Of course many films suffer from this but are often able to disguise it .- THE PURGE doesn'tThis is a pity because I remember wanting to see this down to the fact the idea behind seemed very clever .

The Purge is already happening! Read here how.,"The point of The Purge is NOT showing us a good or likely way to end the recession. Nor is trying to tell us that this is a way to reduce violence.No, the POINT of the movie is of course addressing the ridiculous gun laws in the USA and how over-the-top they've become. Sandy Hook has shown us that the subversive NRA-element in our midst doesn't really care how much kids are being killed, they're always gonna pervert any tragedy into a call for móre, not less guns. When Tucson happened, they managed to convince the father of the 9 year old girl to cry on TV and to not blame guns.Of course, if people kill people and guns don't kill people, what the hell do they need guns for?The movie is showing one likely consequence of the current gun-culture. It's asking: ""What could be the ultimate consequence of lax gun laws?"" Oops sorry, 'free' gun laws.The movie is not really trying to be realistic, and that is it's main weakness: The story is so full of holes, that it completely detracts from the message. It allows the gun nuts to say: ""This sort of thing would never have happened to me, because I would have done this and that"", like, bought a generator. Instead of addressing the real issue: what do we do about all these guns in the hands of neo-nazis who happily let themselves be extremely fear-mongered?I think there's also a sizable minority of Americans, like 30-35% that truly believes that killing all the poor people will reduce crime, and will justify it as well by saying that it will revive the economy. However, the MOST damaging criminals are not the poor, but the white collar criminals, like bankers, Goldman Sachs, who openly lied to their customers, in order to sell them faulty products and still weren't indicted for fraud. Imagine that General Motors sold you a faulty car with an exploding motor, and it DID explode, wouldn't GM be sued? Big Corp America take so much money from hard working people, often with 3 jobs, that they can't afford decent health care and education, as well as a lead free house. They do this by bribing republiKKKLan senators to make laws so they won't pay taxes.So, killing all the poor people would NOT reduce crime, would not solve a thing. That aspect DOES highlight an immoral, vicious and un-Christian streak in American society: the conviction that poor people are poor because they're lazy, that the poor have only themselves to blame for their poverty, and, it's CERTAINLY not the fault of the rich paying too little in taxes. That's quite a sick attitude, an extremist right-wing variation on blaming the victim. But it's an attitude that's very popular because it absolves the middle class from doing anything about poverty.Ain't that mighty Christian of them?The Melancholic Alcoholic.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A pop culture icon, despite its shortcomings","From a strictly artistic standpoint, this is not a great movie. Some of the scenes are hokey, and the character development lacks enough depth to inspire your investment in the protagonists. However, its plot is pretty unique, the socioeconomic conversations it inspires could go on for days, and, frankly, it's a pop culture icon (as we discussed in Episode 19 of the podcast, and as further detailed in IMDb's The Purge trivia page, this film has inspired a few major horror maze/experience productions).

"Entertaining, interesting movie","The Purge is a very interesting and definitely a unique/original movie. The cast is really well selected, Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are both great in their roles, they were very intense and could be really bad ass when they needed to be. I love the entire concept of this movie's plot, one night where all crime INCLUDING MURDER is completely legal, very original. This film started out well, just by introducing the family and seeing how they live. Then the movie drags just a bit in the middle, but don't worry because it does rev back up pretty quickly. The last 35 minutes of the purge are by far the best! There is lots of tense scenes, rough fighting, a little twist, and a really good ending in my opinion. This movie isn't like a horror masterpiece, but it sure is a good interesting movie to sit and enjoy one Friday or Saturday night. 7/10 for the purge.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Running riot,"I have seen the Purge films the wrong way round having seen The Purge: Anarchy first and rather liked the film although it was not entirely original.This is the original written and directed by James DeMonaco and stars Ethan Hawke in a future America which has reduced employment and violent crime through the annual purge where almost anything goes between evening and dusk for 12 hours. The sequel and this are unconnected although they seem to share a minor character.Hawke is a home security sales executive, rather handy to protect oneself from Purge night and has made a lot of money from selling the security system to his neighbours as one of them remarks to him jealously.Hawke lives in an affluent neighbourhood with his wife, sulky teenage daughter and young son. They expect to be safe from the Purge however Hawke is not happy that his daughter is seeing an older boy who sneaks into her bedroom and decides that tonight is the night to have a serious talk with the overprotective father.However things get manic when his young son lets in to the house a homeless black stranger who is on the run from a mob of rich kids who are hunting this man as their prey for Purge night. Hawke is given an ultimatum by the rich kids to throw the stranger out or else they will attack the family. Problem is the stranger is hiding in the house and Hawke does not know where he is and the rich kids are ready to attack his fortress.Hawke starred in the remake of Assault on Precinct 13 which DeMonaco wrote. You know this is really the plot of the original Assault on Precinct 13. It's the fortress under siege plot. There are a few twists here and there and lot of its incredulous. The sulky daughter is a dimwit if she thinks the boyfriend just wants to talk to the dad on Purge night. It's never made clear why the boy was let loose on this night of all nights on his own with the security controls.The family should also had taken more notice of his neighbours and realised they are not exactly the most popular people in the area. In fact the house did not seem to be very secure at all given how the boyfriend could casually sneak in to the daughter's bedroom.Still DeMonaco retooled the film for its sequel which made for a better film, it also gave it more social commentary than this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thrillers aren't really my thing, but that's not what was alluring to me about ""The Purge."" It was the concept. Just because most of America participates in some annual mass psychosis, does that make it right? The central characters of this film, a suburban family of four, are thrust into this moral dilemma against their will when a hunted man takes refuge in their home. ""Purge"" was a commercial success with a 30-to-1 ROI, something rarely seen in Hollywood. Perhaps that weighs on critics...

Also, they pick too much on the concept of ""The Purge is necessary"" blah blah. The reasons the characters had to do many of the things they did were plainly stupid. It was really not well thought through. There were parts were after the characters killed a villain and saved themselves they just dropped the guns as if; ""Oh well, there is NO apparent reason I'm using this again tonight"".

"Initial idea of the movie was great, but was barely used","To begin, I am giving this movie a really nice 6.5 out of 10 just because the actors did a reasonably good job.I think other reviewers are being too critical on the movie. A lot of the reviews weighed the entire movie on the fact that the original premise was essentially neglected, but didn't realize and/or recognize that the acting itself wasn't bad at all and was quite average to say the least.The movie, in all honesty, was a solid movie. However, the media and ads shouldn't have heavily publicized the premise of the movie as being the one-day legalized purge system. This misled viewers and built up too much anticipation for an enticing premise that (although was used) was not to the viewer's expectations.The movie should've just showed more than just the family being hunted down. Too much emphasis was placed on the family trying to survive as opposed to trying to actively promote or go against the idea of purging.Neutrality was probably the main issue with the movie, since viewers would expect to see the premise being thoroughly portrayed by the protagonists, or the protagonists trying hard to combat that very evil.All in all, I don't think I wasted my time watching the movie. I'm quite open, and understand when some movies don't quite hit the mark. I don't think I would recommend this movie since it's hard to introduce it, but if somebody asked me what it was about, I would tell them about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cinematography is claustrophobic, while the Editing is excellent. Make-Up & Action-Sequences, are expertly done.Performance-Wise: Ethan Hawke stands out with a stellar performance. He's heroic all through. Lena Headey is marvelously restrained. Adelaide Kane is highly commendable. Max Burkholder is adequate. Rhys Wakefield is loathsome.On the whole, 'The Purge' is an experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
the US notion that a 'true Brit' is a sign of a really bad person,"I found this uninvolving. I was unconvinced by Ethan Hawke's performance and matters are made worse when, after initially being presented as a prat, we are supposedly swing around and cheer him as hero. The whole idea is rather silly and although I really liked the background news bulletins, they did not take away from that notion. Interestingly 'un-American' in tone and reminded me a little of the class war elements in Brian Yuzna's Society (1989). This is a much more modest affair, however, and one of its strong points is that it is not over long. Rhys Wakefield intrigued as the 'polite leader' but is really just one more example of the US notion that a 'true Brit' is a sign of a really bad person. I believe the guy is actually Australian but he certainly plays the part here as if some obnoxious English public schoolboy. Not a terrible film and I will watch the follow up (claimed by some to be an improvement) for although there is much to not like here, it is effectively put together and not afraid to ask difficult questions.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wish it was a pure slasher movie,"This tells the night of a rich suburban family, when all crime is legalised for twelve hours.""The Purge"" may have an interesting idea, but I am afraid the whole film is quite poorly executed. The plot really annoys me, as things happen in a contrived manner. For example, how could the kid have the security code? Why would a group of people target one homeless man, when there are may around? And in times of such desperation, one must fight for survival. Having a battle of conscience is not going to help.In addition, people are clearly abusing The Purge, so how could the economy and the harmony of the remaining citizens not be hurt by it. The plot is so unbelievably contrived at the end, it has lost all its credibility. Though it is thrilling and exciting, I think it is better positioned as a slasher movie without the subplot of battle of conscience.",,Anonymous,Horror
Okay...,"I thought this movie was alright. I was definitely glad I saw it, but it wasn't anything amazing. The plot was good, but the end was a little predictable. The acting was very good, and Tony Oller did PHENOMENAL! Most of the actors portrayed their characters perfectly, with the exception of one or two. The movie was described as a horror movie, but I think that was only because the masks made it ten time creepier. It was really just a really intense thriller.Every thing that happened in the movie was realistic, but some of the choices and decisions made by the characters were a little ridiculous. Some characters made heroic decisions that were completely out of there nature and outside of what they had been going for the whole movie. This movie had a lot of potential, but in the end it was mediocre.I would recommend that if you want to see this movie, wait until it's on at the dollar theater or Redbox.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The wife is a complete waste of human space. The husband is a complete pussy ass loser. The whole movie is completely the worse movie I have ever seen.

A missed opportunity to make a great movie,"It's a couple of hours before the yearly Purge and a 1%er finds out he's salesman of the year at the home security business. The yearly Purge has been setup by the new founding fathers in the future so there will be no violence during the rest of the year. All crime is allowed. Some families just stay at home and worry, others party, and some people go ""hunting."" While the guy talks about preparing, the family just sits and dines and then 3 minutes before the purge, they go to a room with cameras and lock down their mansion with protective barriers. The kid, the daughter, the mom they all go do their own thing. The kid watches the screens and sees a man screaming for help so of course he's going to open the gates and let a complete stranger in who clearly doesn't look like he belongs in a millionaires' neighborhood.Also in the house is the girl's boyfriend who is older than she is and he wants to talk to the dad. Except that he actually wants to kill him. As a result dad ends up killing him and the stranger vanishes in the house. Suddenly a weird gang of rich kids- male and female with masks show up at the door demanding they release the stranger to them so they can purge. Dad is all for it, mom and the kid aren't, but they still don't know where he is. The party outside is getting antsy and give a deadline. When the deadline passes, they break in the house. By then the dad has changed his mind and won't give them the stranger. Now violence ensues, some neighbors also show up, and the family will try and survive the night.The Purge has a fantastic and original premise. But as many point out, the execution is a letdown. The first 20 minutes are pretty good, then things go downhill until the violence starts. It is of course annoying when movie characters act in completely nonsensical ways, and there's plenty of that in this movie. The second problem is that it focuses on this single family that isn't very rational or likable. It doesn't take long before the lights go out and people use small flashlights. You know, it is entirely possible to make a horror movie during the day or with lights on. Hollywood should try it out occasionally. We even get some dark POV perspective because the annoying kid has build some creepy RC doll-on-a-tank with a camera. There are some surprises and twists later on but the weaknesses are too obvious to overlook. The idea is very very provocative no doubt and it confront America with its penchant for violence. This movie should be exciting, tense, edge-of-your-seat stuff--but it just isn't. Hopefully in The Purge 2 the writer/director will address these shortcomings.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible,"This is the worst ""horror"" movie to make it to the big screen in a very long time. There is ZERO character building, no plot, no shocking moments, and extremely slow. For an 85 minute movie, this seemed to drag on forever. I was begging for the action and suspense to start, and for someone to die already, but that doesn't happen. There are so many flaws with this story, it is just pathetic. This movie has an interesting concept that was not developed past concept. It does however, appeal to the mindless violence of today's youth without addressing it or offering any solution. A friend told me that I might be offended by the political statement this movie tries to make, but that is not defined either. Ethan Hawke should be ashamed for letting this movie be so bad. It could have been much better, given the effort of a writer and director with a brain.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Talk about running out of plots. Then to top it all off the entire movie is filmed INSIDE a ""mansion"" and no one in the movie seems to know how to get from one room to the next. Excuse me, if you have that much money to have steel doors drop down to cover entrances and the windows, then you'd have a panic room!

Better than what was made of it afterwards.,"Good idea, good execution. I really don't get the bad ratings. They probably thought the sequels and the series inspired by those, were better. But it wasn't. The thing I liked the most about the original « Purge », was that characters were not acting like the were in a video game. They were human beings, faced with impossible choices. In all this chaos, most characters managed to stay reasonable, and those who weren't, got their own punishment. It was refreshing compared to most 2010s horror movies, indulging in their lowest instincts. Ironically, this movie about letting people do immoral things for 12 hours straight, without any legal repercussions. Had morals and a happy ending. The fact that it was a « home invasion », following the struggle of one family in particular (played by great actors), in this very dangerous night. Rather than a faux documentary, about a group of people, who've decided to kill or be killed. Made the premise of the movie, the most realistic of the franchise. And its characters, easier to relate to.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

12 hours of madness in less than 90 mins,"Just watched ""The Purge"", really good premise...For 12 hours once a year everything is legal, purge your cravings, hatred and desires. This is based in 2020 in the USA where crime and unemployment are so out of control they make every crime legal for one night. It's an extremely tense film where the main excitement comes from, you could actually see the Americans passing this law. It has enough suspense and twists to keep you guessing. This isn't far fetched, coming from a country where you can buy a 50 calibre weapon at a convention.

The bloody stranger has potential for real development but the opportunity is missed (race, class, back story, human contact....)

Must give a try when you are bored with romcoms and wanna switch genres.What not worked?Acting was good but not out of the box as thought of. Also there were some non sensica elements too if you are not considering the whole plot as wrong . Also besides the plot it will look like an average american movie with the protagonist being surprisingly active and fit enough to fit enough to fight 20 to 30 men with guns and without any fear in mind.

Home-invasion thriller that fails to establish scares,"""Our target for this year's purge is hiding in your home. You have one hour to find him and give him to us or we will kill all of you. We will be coming in.""In my opinion The Purge failed both as a home invasion thriller and as a social satire towards American society. It didn't work as a thriller because I never felt tension or chills during the invasion. I didn't really care for the characters in this film and it didn't bother me either way if they survived or didn't. The characters were just too dumb and commit too many mistakes, while the villains felt cartoonish at times and the psychological terror never worked like it did in The Strangers for example. The film did manage to make a respectful amount of money at the box-office so unfortunately a sequel is already in the works. The premise of this story was beyond ridiculous and director/screenwriter James DeMonaco (The Negotiator and Assault on Precinct 13) never managed to sell the futuristic story to me. I don't see a future America acting according to this law. Critics might say this wasn't meant to be real, rather more of a social satire. Well in that case it didn't work either because other films like The Hunger Games managed to make a more believable satire on today's society than The Purge did. This film tries to create cheap thrills that never work and is full of cliché moments and one dimensional characters who we really never care for. Whatever moral statement DeMonaco was trying to make I wasn't really feeling it. He kind of made a similar movie to Assault on Precinct 13 although this time he incorporated the home invasion element instead of the prison. He even had Ethan Hawke star in that film as well. The Purge doesn't have to make sense if it really achieves its goal in scaring the audience but it doesn't and therefor one begins over thinking the plot. The Purge is lazy filmmaking and a very forgettable one.The film takes place in 2020 and in order to combat violence the American government has allowed an annual twelve hour period in which all criminal activity is permitted (including murder). They call this day ""the purge"" because they believe that this way all citizens can release the tension they've kept inside during the year. In reality the people who are more vulnerable are the poor who can't defend themselves or lock themselves in their home. This way America has prospered as a society and the criminal rate is practically non existent. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is one of those citizens who has benefited from the purge because as a security salesman he has made a lot of money selling his product. He and his family are safe thanks to the advanced security system in his home. His wife Mary (Lena Headey) and two children Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane) are locked down in their home as the purge is about to begin. It seems like it is going to be a safe night for them, but when Charlie decides to help out a stranger (Edwin Hodge) and lets him in his home things begin to get complicated for the Sandins. Will they be able to survive the night? Suddenly they don't feel safe after all.The thrills in this film are extremely cheap and every scene seems perfectly staged. Nothing about the film feels real and the characters are far from being real human beings who we can identify with. Ethan Hawke in the lead role gives one of his worst performances to date and the kids in this film are both terrible (the characters they play, not their performance), they make one stupid decision after another. The dialogue doesn't work either and the villains in this film are a joke. Rhys Wakefield tries to play a villain in a similar way as Heath Ledger played the Joker but it really didn't work at all. Even the continuity in this film is a mess. Everything happens in one night and Ethan Hawke starts off with a clean shave and halfway through the movie he has a goatee. The other problem I had with this film is that these rich people instead of spending so much money on a security system could've simply left the country for one day and returned without having to worry about anything. These sort of things I probably wouldn't have questioned if the thrills would've worked, but since the film begins to drag and feel dull you begin to question things. The Purge doesn't live up to other home invasion thrillers and I'm afraid that as a satire it doesn't say anything new about society's culture and obsession over violence. After this movie is over with you will want to purge yourself of the memory of having spent 85 minutes watching this unimaginative film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's movies like this that make me realize the delicate balance it really takes to make any film truly take off. Unfortunately, this one barely gets off the launching pad. Get ready though.

Good From A Psychological Standpoint,"While we've seen the generalities of the plot before, this one has some sharp twists and enough psychodrama to keep you watching. Ethan Hawke is a home security salesman with the typical family--wife, teenage son and daughter. Again we see more clichéd characters, in that the daughter is a rebellious, burgeoning slut and the son a disassociated genius. One night during ""The Purge""--a 12-hour period when all crime is legal (the details aren't important)--the family settles in for what they assume will be a quiet night of impenetrable protection. Things change when the son makes a big-time mistake--and I won't bore you with additional plot points--and the family's fight for survival is on.What this film lacks is that we don't see the mayhem that occurs elsewhere and the way the family battles their attackers, makes the escapes in Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels seem plausible. The villains are a clichéd cross between those in clockwork orange and Precinct 13. I do however, commend the director for what is something of a double anti- hero point of view. The ending is far from a cookie cutter pattern and gets things wrapped up neatly without being forced. A good date movie as far as thrillers go, not a lot of gore and a couple of intense scenes that might leave the ladies shaking their heads.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Please, I never saw someone entering someone else's house with swords and knifes (knowing that the owners have guns) and jumping and smiling so ridiculously, or how does your son know the code that turns off you security system when you know that outside, you can get killed at every moment.In summary, it's the first time that i write a review, and the least that I can say, is that the movie pushed me to write it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge review - murder as a necessary evil,"Would you murder when it hasn't consequences? Would you murder when the government support it?
Ethan Hawke plays a rich family man who tries to protect his wife (played by Lena Headley) on the Purge-Night where all crimes - including murder - are allowed. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headley are two excellent actors choosen by the producer Michael Bay. The Film was released in 2013, but is set 9 years later. The system was reformed and the Purge Night was introduced to satisfy the deepest desires such as murder of people. A night like this evokes the most varied emotions which these two actors bring across excellently.
In 2022, the United States is ruled by the New Founding Fathers of America. To keep crime rates and unemployment low, the government has successfully implemented an Purge Night. James Sandin is employed in the sales of a security engineering company and has become wealthy by selling security systems for the Purge Night. He lives with his wife Mary and their two children Zoey and Charlie in a large estate. They behave like the last few years, but there are some uninvited guests... first Zoey's boyfriend sneaks into the house and later Charlie lets in an unknown homeless person. This has unimaginable consequences.
Personally I liked the idea of such a night very much. It is very well thought out and gives the movie a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I have to write that the producers have not exploited this potential. The storyline is only mediocre. I expected more murder and crime when it is allowed... There are only some groups who go on the streets and murder. And they are mental ill. I expected some profi killers for example. Nevertheless, I liked the movie, especially since you keep asking yourself what you would do that night. The tension was legendary in some places.
That's why I give the film seven out of ten points and would recommend it, especially to teenagers and young adults. It deals with a very explosive subject, where your own imagination may think even further...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not great but entertaining,"This is the last Purge I have seen, I have seen the sequels and this is a lot better than the first purge. It's a silly film but I liked it it was entertaining, just don't take it seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not bad,"Ok there are some cliches in this film but please it's a good original idea that i felt they did well. The acting was good and the whole story is quite creepy if you think I about it. With society these days you imagine this could happen
Anytime soon. But the idea is a clever conceit for sure. The end was quite shocking but in a way that makes you feel it. The house was a good location ti use it worked. Once again it's not a classic boy it's a solid movie in the way it was done. The characters were kind of annoying in some scenes but not a massive problem for me.

Top 10 worst movies,"Although it does sound interesting as a story, the script and the direction of the movie are ridiculous. Not a single scene in the movie makes sense. It was very disturbing to watch the actors doing anything that was stupidly possible in order to get them killed. This must be voted as one of the worst movies ever. The only good thing about the movie is that it only lasts 85 minutes. I really wonder how actors like Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke, accepted to participate in this fiasco... The IMDb rate is 5,5 but i am sure that in a few weeks it will reach something around 2. Seriously, the guy who wrote the script must be a 10 year old who is just making fun and the producers must have lost some hilarious bet with their friends, that forced them to waste money on this disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horrible movie don't waste your time and money!,"I thought this was one of the most craziest and unethical movies of my time. Not only did I hate this movie, but it makes me wonder as to what sick minds could approve this movie for theaters, then people wonder why so many horrible things are happening in this world; have they ever stopped to think they maybe crazy movies like this are provoking the sick minds of America. Not only does it show that murder can be deemed nonpunishable but a deeper view will see that it throws Christianity out of the window, indirectly implying that the government can choose whether murder is lawful or just to please society's economic hardships. Please don't waste your time and money, one thing about this movie is the fact that it controversial and it had me and my friends conversating about why and how its so ethically wrong.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
THE PURGE: We Have Met The Enemy...And It Is Us,"The premise behind writer/director James DeMonaco's film THE PURGE is indeed a fantastic and, perhaps at first, unlikely one: set in the year 2022, when unemployment nationwide is down to just one percent, and crimes across the board are at an all-time low. But what if the manner of getting it that was to allow a one-night ""purge"", in which violent behavior was actually sanctioned by the United States government, and largely to rid America of the poor and the indigent? It is a premise that may seem outrageous; but so too was the idea of a surveillance state as depicted in George Orwell's classic 1948 novel ""1984""; and what has America become since 9/11 but a surveillance state in real life? Under the right circumstances, it isn't totally out of the realm of possibility that something like THE PURGE might come to pass.Ethan Hawke portrays a security systems designer whose entire neighborhood, located in the hills above West Los Angeles, owes its very security and safety to his security designs. It becomes especially important during a twelve-hour time frame from 7 PM to 7 AM on March 21st and 22nd, 2022 known as ""The Purge"", in which violent behavior, including murder, theft, and even rape, will be allowed—and no police or emergency first responders will be on duty. It is a thing that Hawke and his family, and their neighbors, have gotten used to; and they have also become largely callous when it comes to the potential victims of the Purge, namely the poor who don't have the ability to support themselves with any job or pay approaching anywhere close to what Hawke makes. But on this particular Purge Night, one of Hawke's children (Max Burkholder), out of the goodness of his heart and a conscience that the father has apparently lost, lets a wounded black man (Edwin Hodge) enter the premises, which upsets Hawke tremendously. To Hawke, Hodge is exactly the kind of target the Purge people want to kill; and when the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of one such Purge group comes to get Hodge, Hawke, his family, and their home come under siege from that group. Hawke at first advocates handing over Hodge to them (given that the Purge group has already totally crippled what Hawke had once proclaimed a foolproof security system), but his wife (Lena Headey), daughter (Adelaide Kane) and Burkholder, appalled at his descent into cold-blooded survivalist mode, force the issue. In the end, they are forced to endure much physical horror and psychological terror until the morning comesand does it really end there? DeMonaco wrote and directed THE PURGE on a budget of just slightly more than $3 million; and apart from the sometimes shaky and unsteady camera work (a trait that came from the quasi-documentary style of films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), every penny of that $3 million budget shows up here. There are a number of things that don't quite work the way they should; and some of the acting, especially by Wakefield as the chief Purge instigator, is overly hammy. In terms of what DeMonaco is basically trying to do with what is certainly a fantastic and crazy premise, however, THE PURGE is effective enough. Some would claim, in a rather ham fisted fashion, that DeMonaco is attacking the behavior of the Far Right in America and its attitudes towards those who have less than they do. But I have to wonder if any of the reviewers making those claims noticed that the upscale rich people in THE PURGE turn against their own in the end. This kind of has a Rod Serling-like twist to it if you really think about it hard enough--""The Monsters Are On Maple Street"", anyone?. We have met the enemy, and it's really us.Besides that aforementioned ""Twilight Zone"" reference, THE PURGE seems to derive its power and plot from many films: the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (the masks worn by Wakefield and his posse); THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS (the original 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic); and even THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (Peckinpah's last, released in 1983). But these are films that have a kinetic and psychological power that very few other ""horror"" or ""thriller"" films of this kind can have without spiraling into hyper-violent absurdity, and they are films that DeMonaco clearly has learned a lot from.Hawke does a fairly good job of being a somewhat callous capitalist who grossly underrates the impact that the violent behavior of the night of the Purge will have on his family. Headey also does a credible job as his wife, who questions his motivations and his morality when, at first, he decides to hand Hodge over to Wakefield, instead of doing the right thing and fighting for his humanity. In the final analysis, and in terms of its credibility and plausibility, THE PURGE isn't necessarily the best psychological ""horror"" or ""thriller"" film that has ever been. But it is effective enough to deliver what it promises for its eighty-five minute running time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new personal best,"This movie set a new record with me: quickest I've ever lost interest in a movie. Took about a minute for me to lose interest. More than that, it only took about five minutes for me to be annoyed by it.Silly premise, clumsy, one-dimensional plot. If mindless violence is what you're looking for in a movie, this is it.Furthermore, the plot is full of holes.I kept hoping that there was some point to all this, but it never happened. There was so much potential for a profound statement on social divides, but any wanderings into that area were very superficial.There was also a massive opportunity to point out the need for gun control in the US, but that didn't happen. Wouldn't want to alienate all the right-wing gun-toting Second Amendment-quoting nutjobs in the US now, would we? They're the target audience...Nothing to like about this movie (except Adelaide Kane...)",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Survive the night,"The Purge is a 2013 dystopian action horror that centers around a wealthy family who finds themselves endangered by a group of people trying to kill them during a night where all crime is legal.This is a good film with a creative concept that is both interesting and kind of terrifying.Written and directed by James DeMonaco, The Purge takes an extreme approach to population control and behavioral management from a new government known as the new founding fathers that make all crime legal for one night a year. There's not a lot of character depth, but lots of tense moments and no mercy kills that make its story pretty effective with a very good cast behind it all. It's dark, it's original and it's overall entertaining.I personally prefer the sequels that followed this entry into the series, but I still think it's a decent movie. If you've never seen it before, I'd recommend checking it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Honestly suprised with how much I enjoyed this.,"Never watched a single Purge movie, went into this with very low expectations and was actually very pleasantly surprised.The entire premise is a little sloppy with the way it's all laid out, there's problems for sure - but let's look at the good. Cinematography is excellent. I was even pleasantly surprised to see some tasteful hand-held shots during some of the close quarter combat scenes, not too shaky. The camera work does a lot to build tension throughout the entire film.Besides the main villain being ""cartoony evil"" - there's solid development in all the characters. I love the slow realization that the family is no different to who they're hiding from outside based on their actions. I love the class analysis, it doesn't go too deep and it doesn't hit you over the head..but at the same time I suppose these themes could of been introduced more subtly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I found a Blumhouse/Platinum Dunes film that is pretty good!,"A new political party called The New Founding Fathers of America (the clue is in the name) comes into power after the U. S. goes through a depression in their economy. Very soon they find that the country is back on an upward trajectory with the economy improving and unemployment hitting an all time low. Crime has also become almost non-existant. This is partly due to the party passing a new annual event called The Purge in which for one night all crime is legal and will not result in prosecution. Emergency services are suspended for the duration of The Purge. Because of this the crime rate for the rest of the year is also very low.The Sandin family settle into their secured home for The Purge night hoping that it passes without incident. However, the boyfriend of their daughter Zoey who is forbidden from seeing her sneaks in before the house's security system is activated and decides that tonight would be a good night to settle affairs with her father. The Sandin's son Charlie sees a man desperately screaming for help on the houses CCTV system and decides that he can't just leave the poor man out there and so disables the houses security system so that he can allow the man to enter their house rather than being left vulnerable on the street. This provokes a posse to come to the house to demand that the family turn over the man to them or they will be forced to enter the house themselves.When I saw that this was a Platinum Dunes/Blumhouse film my heart sank. But, it's actually a pretty solid and enjoyable film! There are elements that I don't normally associate with films from these stables like, oh, suspense, intelligence, great acting and genuine scares.Issues regarding law and order and the idea of bloodlust as a form of entertainment aren't looked at to their fullest but I think that this works to the film's benefit. In an era of films overanalysing any kind of statement regarding society or dumbing such issues down for their audiences, this is most welcome. It's almost as if the filmmakers are crediting the audience with a modicum of intelligence. Which is nice.The ending is just as abrupt as the end of the night itself but again I didn't mind this. Theres no overlong and cloying 'deep' speeches given by characters about what they are going through/have been through. It gives the film an air of being akin to a short sharp shock which again, I quite liked. It was much preferable to MTV style philosophising.The storyline regarding the vulnerable man being inside the house whilst others try to get in to kill him reminded me of the 1983 Canuxploitation masterpiece, Siege which is a much better film and is due to be released on Blu ray soon by Severin.This is no masterpiece but it's still a fun hour and a half and I've seen worse. Much much worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge,"The Purge is a terrifying theory, which was set up by the American's demented national government to allow all crime for one night. I paused the movie at the beginning thinking what if this was a real life scenario. I don't think I'd make it too long. Anyway, the cast is so-so, not a big Ethan Hawke fan but he was better than the majority. The movie was directed and written well, a tad predictable at parts but still held my interest. I loved how insane the criminals were, skipping , singing and laughing, truly bizarre and creepy. The most kick ass part of the Purge is definitely the last fifteen minutes of the movie. It's not a shocker of an ending but it was the right ending. Check out The Purge, definitely worth the time for a fan of horror movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

You'd think the poor, those living in the ghetto, and anyone, wanting whatever somebody else had, would create a 12 hour period where everyone, might want to kill you.

"Wasted premise, waste of time","Wow, just wow. I ""wow"" at how such a premise can be wasted on such a lame cliché ridden so called ""horror"" film. The Purge lit the internet and box office a storm upon initial release thanks the clever and original marketing campaign for a very interesting concept. What would happen if crime were legal once a year for a few hours? It's a grand idea for a movie one ripe for ideas, so sad then that the filmmakers settled for such a bad one and for such a generic production.The story centring almost entirely inside the house of the Sandin family begs the question of why the purge even is a part of the film? The movie in the end could just be any standard home invasion thriller/horror, just utterly wasting the whole idea of what a night in The Purge would be like. It's made all the worse by small ideas and scenes offer up an insight into the possibilities of a well done Purge movie. The friendly neighbours turning, the angry boyfriend taking matters into his own hands there are countless opportunities here that play second fiddle to a lame and frankly unbelievable story.Another major problem with The Purge is the horrible main set of characters, Hawke tries his best but it must be said doesn't do much while the other bunch of headliners in Heady who is wasted and Wakefield who thinks smiling every 3 seconds is creepy (by the way it's not) barely makes a dint in the film where he should own it with his menacing evil doer. In regards to the child actors Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane the less said the better.The Purge is simply a bad, seen a million times before home invasion movie. What makes it particularly annoying and also like a slap in the face is how it squanders its idea. On the success financially of the movie a sequel has been green lit; can someone please do something with the idea?

Honestly, it's not a 9 star movie either, but I'm trying to balance out the rating a bit, because this 5.7 star rating is just crap. I'm not really into bloody, gory horror movies, but this movie always made me wonder if I would like it, since the concept triggered me.

Assault On Precinct Purge,"First off I want to say I was not as easily sold on the trailer as much as everyone else. Sure I thought the story was a great idea but I also realized that most likely this would just be another home invasion movie. But really at its core this wasn't just another home invasion movie, it was more like ""Strangers"" meets ""Assault On Precinct 13"", and surprisingly that combo worked pretty well.This movie's strength is obviously its story, it is a very clever idea but it also has its flaws. There were a good amount of holes throughout the plot, won't post any spoilers but most of them are pretty obvious. But the movie still works, its fun, suspenseful, and interesting.The acting was solid all around. Ethan Hawke does a solid job and all the family was very convincing, especially the son.This movie is developing a pretty bad rep, but it really doesn't deserve that. Too many people got hyped up thinking this would be the next great horror film of our time, but really it was hardly even a horror film, more of a suspense thriller.Its not excellent, it has its flaws, and it didn't live up to its hype.

Regular people don't want to go out murdering and are completely capable of managing themselves without some police force or government to intervene. So are chimpanzees.

I Like It!,"A strange and special movie in the horror genre. You will remember it no matter how many other horror movies you watch. More than that, it is a satirical irony about American society and the psychology of the American people.The movie also highlights the opposition to violence and extremism ideas hidden in the false values of kindness and tolerance, and where are the boundaries. The concept of this movie is quite unique, it shows us the uncertainty about the future of humanity that we still fear. Assuming that's real somewhere in the world? It's worrisome! It's a pity that the most intense part of the violent scenes look a bit unreal. Every time a character is in danger of dying, he/she is immediately saved.

Plus, the acting of the main bad guy and the lines this guy was forced to read was absolutely awful and was a complete misfire. It's basically the same crap being recycled over and over again. Tricked again at the theater. I'm questioning why I even bother going at all. the only reason I'm giving this movie a 4 out of 10 is because the audience that I saw the movie with appeared to enjoy it.

At last a film we can all agree on!,"Let's face it... films are a divisive topic of conversation. I guarantee at least a hundred people will hate your favourite film (and vice versa). However, with 'The Purge' it seems that practically everyone can agree on one thing: the premise for this film is awesome! Set in the near future, America now has an annual twelve hour period where ALL crime is legal (and no emergency services will help out or arrest you). It's certainly an interesting idea. After all... what would you do? Would you barricade yourself in and hope no one tried to steal your telly (or worse - your life), or would you run to the nearest bank with a pickaxe (or find that bloke who cut you up in his car at the traffic lights and have more than just a few strong words)? Sadly, despite its awesome premise, the execution is lacking. Have you seen a 'home invasion' movie? One where the innocent family are tormented by some sort of invading force in their own home. If you have then you've basically seen this movie. The great premise is soon discarded in favour of a family under siege and therefore adds very little to the overall film.It's not so bad. It's short and to the point. It gets the job done and has reasonably good performances all round. If you like home invasion films then you'll probably like this. It's just a shame that the great premise wasn't expanded on a little more. However, a sequel is in the pipeline, so maybe it'll be addressed then (and with the obviously expanded budget).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Avoid the urge...to purge !,"The only thing relevant about this movie is that after seeing it YOU will want to purge.hurl, puke and perhaps ask for your money back. The first big clue you have that this movie is a huge rip-off and of zero worth is that it was made by the producers of Paranormal Activity. The next is that whatever the screwball message of this film, you can be certain it was anti- Christian, anti-Republican, anti-Capitalism, anti-White, anti-Success and racist beyond belief. The fact that it was made by a bunch of elite, white, rich people from Hollywood is just a nuance they don't want you to notice.The movie is so far fetched that Direct James Mather sets the scene in 2022. We are expected to believe that the U.S. Government has then been taken over by super smart folks who think they know better than anyone else. They allow killing without recourse for 12 hours once a year. This new U.S. Government thinks it can purge the country of those that don't believe the way it does, and that the way to peace and a civil society is to let thugs vent once a year by killing their neighbors. So far-fetched because you quickly realize with the NSA and the IRS and radical Muslims allowed to kill with no recourse, this isn't 2022, this is the Obama Administration! (Small matter I suppose that such a low budget film could not even afford cars that looked like 2022 models to even try to fool you.)The after movie conversation turned quickly from what was the message in the film, to who did the writers want you to hate the most. For me that was easy—the film distributor of course! Film school 101 is you must have at least one likable character in a movie. Ethan Hawke plays the Dad, James Sandin as a detestable security exec who cares more about his sales bonus than raising his kids. Wife Mary simply looks like she is preoccupied by a bad case of hemorrhoids. Daughter Zoey is a clueless, oversexed teen and son Charlie plays the role of a unisex moron who occasionally could be mistaken for an ill-trained Pomeranian. Who wants to save this family or care if they all die? In this film, you are simply hoping they all get killed off quickly so you can get home and lock your own door and be safe. Unfortunately, you realize your phone is tapped, the IRS is out to get you, and the President has buddies in the Muslim brotherhood who patrol streets looking for white people to kill. The only real solace you can find is in the nightly news when the U.S top National Security adviser assures you not to worry ""it is just a film."" Yes indeed, perhaps it is time to purge?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I think there is something being overlooked here.,"I have heard terrible things about this movie, which is probably why my rating is higher than I'd probably give it if I had heard nothing about it. Now bear with me, I am not a movie watcher in that I don't casually watch movies and I only go to see what catches my attention. Furthermore, I will simply walk out of a movie theater if I don't like a movie, and I have done it before. (Transformers: Age of Extinction, Prince of Persia...)I am not really sure why this movie isn't very liked by many, I think it captures the idea of something I like to think about: Human Nature. Now I will not get boring and speak about my ideas of it in a scientific matter, but isn't that just really f'ing scary? I mean, not many people want to accept it, but we are animals. We only are ""Civilized"" because of the way we are brought up, being fed a sense of morality and that there is a way we have to live in order to function in an organized matter.No one wants to openly show their lust for violence because it is wrong in the public eye, but think about certain things that people love that ARE violent. GTA (Video Game), Manhunt(Video Game), MMA, and all the gory movies out there that people just ADORE.Maybe people wouldn't show their wanting of violence openly, but if there was a real purge, what makes you think that you wouldn't want the opportunity to be bad without legal consequences?

Great concept. Poor execution,"It is so heartbreaking for me to even begin to give a negative review of this film, just because I was so in love with the direction at the beginning. And I'm not just talking about anarchy here. Imagine living in a world where you really did need to care about what other people think of you. A world where perception can be a matter of life or death. That is what I found so fascinating about this movie.But of course the execution was sub par, leaving me absolutely devastated. Incredibly predictable and unbelievable at the same time. There is not enough character development which really takes away from the viewers ability to comprehend and translate the obvious sociological commentary.

Not as good as I hoped.,"I thought the idea for this movie was great, seeing that it was pretty much a brand new concept for a horror/suspense film and they could have done so much with it. However, this movie was very disappointing.First of all, as others have said, the dialog is quite bad and so many things throughout the movie either don't make any sense or just go unexplained. In fact, there's an entire character (the girl's boyfriend) who had no purpose at all in the story. Why was he there?? & why did he do what he did. I don't get it and they really could have left him out of it completely. That's also where things didn't make sense. The characters did things without reason and that made it very unbelievable to me.Along with being unrealistic, this movie did not live up to its potential at all. When I went to see it, I was expecting it to be interesting to see how people who react to a day with legal crime. I was really surprised to find that it focused the entire movie on this one family. Don't get me wrong, the story line had to come from somewhere, but I think it would have been so much better if at least some of the scenes (other than the beginning credits) showed what else was going on in the town.Overall, this was a very disappointing, not scary, movie that I wouldn't watch again.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
I rate the Idea,"the idea so brilliant but the movie so tight to discuss it deeply... so why so harsh ?! it's a nice try and may be initiate for something better... i hope creators will exploiting the opportunity to deliver what they really thought and not to drift behind seduction of horror... i will not discuss cast or performance... nothing to say about... they did what they have to did and nothing more... but i wish supporting cast was better... directing was good for a horror movie but the movie not a horror one.... it should given a space and time more than they give it.... probably part two offer a good presentation better than this one ... but i am telling you this is not bad as others say... it have something good inside it, even if not obviously. there is something between the lines economically, politically and humanistic",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice concept very quickly falls flat on its face...,"Look, it was a nice idea, but within a very short time of the family being under siege in the house, and all the cool kids outside want to get them, etc, it just becomes another one of those siege films. Nobody seems to mention anything about the purge idea at all.Great opportunity to talk about community and how it does or doesn't hold a group of people together, .... all lost as The usual conventions crept in, stupid teenagers etc .....Within about half an hour I was starting to get bored.I have a lot of time for Ethan Hawke as an actor, and I can't understand what led him to this Uninventive rubbish.

Mixed Bag,"The premise is really great for a horror movie. Society has one night a year where all crimes are legal. One family has to survive that night. The acting is pretty good. Ethan Hawke and Lena Heady both do a good job. I also think the main villain is very entertaining. My only real issue is that I found the main character's family really annoying. They are in a very dangerous situation and they contribute nothing constructive. I was getting annoyed for him. Now I think about it, the one upside to this purge concept is that on that night you could beat your wife and kids as much as you like. (: ))",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As bad as you've heard,Feeble horror/thriller which completely wastes its single good idea on a derivative and tedious home invasion storyline.Shallow characters making stupid decisions in a thrill-free 90 minute dawdle through horror film clichés make this one purge you'd be well advised to miss.,2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great concept, ruined by terrible script, massive plot holes and the wrong director!","I was excited for this film's release, the concept intrigued me and it did sound promising. Unfortunately a absolutely horrendous script writing ruined this film before it even began!The Purge, a 12 hour period in which anything is legal and all emergency services are suspended, begins towards the start of the film. Middle class family the Sandins settle down for the night, behind their 'state of the art' security. They're safely wasting the 12 hours away, until son Charlie decides to offer refuge to a homeless victim of the Purge (plot hole number one, why on earth would you entrust the code of your security system to your creepy child?). Soon enough a gang appear politely demanding the Sandins release the homeless man as he is their target for the purge, inexplicably cutting the power to the Sandins home (why cut the power? How on earth are they supposed to find someone in the dark?). Of course you can guess the rest, lots of torches, gun shots and just for the sake of it a pointless plot twist.Characters are unbelievably one dimensional, we have the stereotypical middle class family. Hardworking dad, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), his perfect wife, Mary (Lena Headey), rebellious Catholic school girl daughter, Zoe (Adelaide Kane) and some creepy, Blanket Jackson-esque son, Charlie (Max Burkholder). Don't expect to care about any of these characters in anyway shape or form, in fact in the case of Charlie you will probably find yourself actually wanting the antagonists to kill him! There is absolutely NO character development and none of these characters have any redeeming qualities. Hawke isn't usually a bad actor but is terrible in this, he looks bored and fed up throughout. Headey has been given such a flat character I honestly couldn't even rate if she managed a decent job. Rhys Wakefield puts in the best performance as a the creepy leader of the gang though his dialogue is badly written.Unlikable characters (I mean seriously, I don't think I cared from start to finish who died), bad dialogue, full of MASSIVE plot holes that are impossible to overlook, no suspense, no scares and repeatedly using the same cheap tricks (oh look, yet again another off-screen character is saving the day). I wouldn't recommend this film unless you intend to watch it as a satire because really unless you're going to laugh at how much of a failure the characters and plot are it's probably going to be a waste of your time.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still shaking,"This movie was real good. I'm still shaking like 5 minutes afterwards. It's just that there was so much suspense and action I couldn't handle it! I've had butterflies/a nervous stomach since about the middle of the movie. At times I wanted to scream ""No, don't do that! Stop being stupid!"" and other times I wanted to cheer for the people to keep going. In this movie you won't get bored at all (except for the beginning)and there is nonstop suspense.Now for the plot. The idea is pretty unrealistic, for the government to make an already growing gap between the rich and the poor. Sure, the growing population would go down, but the rich people's workers would get killed so that there would be no workers and put the country in poverty. Also, if this was just in the US, why didn't they go take a vacation and put some extra security on their house? It's just that this would never happen.Overall, the movie had great acting, no filler music (it was so action-y they didn't even need it), and it was pretty scary. I would say a 6 for the plot, 8 for the movie itself. Lets meet in the middle and say: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why the low marks? I really enjoyed this creepy film,"I don't know why the low marks and crappy reviews on here, I admit I'm not a big fan of paranormal atrocities (activities), but I really enjoyed this movie, people on here complaining it could've been so much better, then why don't they re-make it? I thought it was well executed, and a bit scary, the characters were a bit dull, but hey it's a horror movie, not classical Shakespeare for god's sake! There are a few nice twists and unexpected moments and it kept me glued to the screen, which is no mean feat, as I get older a lot of movies have the 'seen it before' syndrome! This was a refreshingly creepy movie with a unique story line, so don't be put off by the mostly awful reviews on here, I recommend it and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been way better...Great story though,"Could have been a way better movie if the main characters were reversed, i mean if the main characters were the masked purgers and the story tells about them getting revenge for a friend the movie would easily get an 8/10..the story should be the other way around..So directors should seek making a new film that tells a very similar story but focusing on the bad guys..it is always better, just if we consider ""The Dark Night"" I as well as everyone liked the joker more than batman himself. The story has everything needed to make it to the top, but it was not explained as it should be.Anyway it is not that bad of a movie, but it could let time pass when you're bored.In general I liked it!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Honestly one of the worst and most annoying movies I've ever seen,"When we saw the original preview for this movie, both my husband and I were really excited to see it, because the idea was intriguing. Didn't have the funds for the theater so waited for DVD and rented it right away. I made the mistake of checking the rating and a couple non spoiler reviews on here before watching, but now I definitely agree with them. I have never been so incredibly annoyed watching a movie in my entire life. These characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was hoping they'd all just die in the end due to their extreme stupidity. The son? Ridiculous. The parents? Really? Wimps. There is far too many shots of people staring. All anyone does for 75% of the movie is stare stupidly. The bad guys are semi ridiculous and not in a good way. Would never watch this movie twice. Wish I had never watched it to begin with.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing dystopian idea doesn't quite live up to its fullest,"It is common for filmmakers to conceive such fascinating ideas and watch as they're ideas translate poorly on-screen. On the bright side, some of these instances have to be proved to be surprisingly successful, most particularly films dealing with a dystopian society. This film directed and written by James DeMonoco establishes a profoundly interesting concept that raises questions about our society today, including ""Could this possibly happen in the future?"" and ""Would this be beneficial, damaging to our society, or both?"". This film is set in the near future in which the government has enacted a legislation known as The Purge, an annual night of the year when crime in America including murder, rape, and robbery is legal for twelve hours without any interference or disciplinary response by the law enforcement. The purpose of this act is reduce our country's crime rate and unemployment which reaches an all-time low thanks to this act. The plot centers on the Sandin family including James (played by Ethan Hawke), Mary (played by Lena Headey), and their two teenage children Charlie (played by Max Burkholder) and Zoey (played by Adelaide Kane); a family who lives in a beautiful home set with a high-tech security system which they use to protect themselves on the night of the Purge. When a lonely man batter in blood wanders the streets yelling for help from a gang of masked criminals lead by the sadistic leader (played by Rhys Wakefield) out to kill him, Charlie unlocks the security system letting the poor man. With the gang breaking into their house demanding for the man they are targeting. The family must stand together to survive the violent while struggling to turn into the killers that are after them.With such as thought-provoking idea like this brought together on-screen, it's difficult not to think of the possibilities like ""What would you do during the Purge?"" while watching this. The film succeeds on some levels such as formulating stark, thought-provoking themes and generating some well drawn characters, particularly the main characters James and Mary who are awarded with fine performances by Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The script on the other hand, lies the film's biggest falter. The plot is not bad and does enough to keep at least some glued to their seats, it never quite reaches its full potential. There are so many grounds the plot leaves unexplored and because of this, results in an brilliant film concept that feels somewhat unfinished. Instead of venturing through various concepts, the plot focuses primarily on the family's fight for survival and the grim atmosphere that drives the plot. The suspense works at times, but at other times feels dull. The main conflict here is not the family confrontation against the sadistic criminals that threaten to kill them but also the inner conflict within the characters, the testing of their moral compass when they stuck with decision to either throw the poor man the son let in out to die, or pick up their weapons to fight to protect him and themselves. In the end, viewers eventually come to care for the characters and hope of their survival, even the film fails to be scary or inventive as it outta be.Overall, The Purge is an okay film that expresses some intriguing concepts and thrills, although some viewers will left yearning for more. The film may suffer some flaws in terms of writing and direction but there is still some good to be handed here. Those looking for a straight-out scare fest are likely to be displeased, others may find some satisfaction here.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great idea ruined by it's execution.,"The Purge was the movie I was looking forward to for two specific reasons: Ethan Hawk and the concept behind of it . Crime , including murder is legal for 12 continuous hours. But , instead of exploring the idea and how it's affecting the people , we get a cliche home invasion movie in which a family has to fight back inside of their house after giving shelter to a black man who is hiding from the purge members. The acting , especially by Ethan Hawk , Lena Heady , and Rhys Wakefield are strong and you do believe them in their roles. The family decision making is so bad that there were many cringe-worthy moments that were just unbelievable. Here's number of stupidity and dumb moments in the movie : The son lets a stranger in the house , which is not allowed by the government , the daughter cares more about her boyfriend's death than her dad who tried to protect , the gang shuts the power when they demand the return of the black man , and the mom lets the neighbors live when they just attempted to kill them. I have a friend named Leighton , who got offended watching the movie because it it's a illogical plot which doesn't make any sense and even if it exists as a movie it is still illogical. There are also many plot holes throughout the entire movie: How come we live in a world where it's all legal for 12 hours? , The new Founding Fathers aren't this insane and psychopathic , that they will allow this to happen , it brings more chaos and destruction than happiness and peace which they made it out to be, American people can't live in peace after their loved ones are killed out in the streets like that , and the dad , who is so rich doesn't have back-up generator in his Mansion. The neighbors thing really ruined the movie for me and the idea of the New Founding Fathers really exaggerated it for me . So, I give the Purge 1 star only for Ethan Hawke.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exactly what it was marketed as,"From the start, The Purge grabs your attention with a complete rundown of what the future of America is like. Crime is down, the economy is great aka the complete opposite of Anerica today. Then the film introduces The Stantin family, a picture perfect wealthy family preparing for the annual Purge. The film goes into high gear after the youngest Stantin child let's in a man trying to escape the violence outside which ultimately brings the violence inside once his killers start looking for him. The film goes into high gear from here on out. Overall, the film is acted just as it should be, nothing special but nothing horrible. The scenes of chaotic mayhem are down very well with the violence quick and brutal. However, the film starts to lag at the end finishing with an ending that leaves more questions than answers. This is a clear cut example of an awesome idea that could have been an excellent movie sold out by the standard Hollywood clichés beset upon every film nowadays which makes it just barely memorable. It won't win any awards but it will win your attention for the full 85 minute runtime leaving really nothing to talk about after except for a dumb ending to an otherwise disciplined action thriller. Overall, I recommend this film just as it is, pure escapist entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting twist on the home invasion premise,"The Purge came out in the wake of other home invasion horror movies such as the rather awful ""The Strangers,"" and the rather good ""You're Next,"" and was promoted as another home invasion flick where the baddies wear strange masks. What is fascinating about the film is that it is much more than that. The screenplay must have been, in order to attract an Oscar-nominated actor such as Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays a home security system company CEO who has accumulated enormous wealth thanks to the Annual Purge. For those who are not familiar with the Purge or the series of movies that came after this one (the most recent sequel in theaters as of this writing): In the not-too-distant future, there are no wars, no crime, and people seem to get along well in society. This is largely attributed to the Annual Purge, when for one night every year, all emergency first responders are shut down, and all acts of violence, looting, and murder are legal--for 12 hours.Hawke and his family live in an ostentatious mansion in a more modest neighborhood. He has become very wealthy while others in his neighborhood seem to exist in a less-fortunate economic sphere--not poor, but basically middle class, and suffering from a good dose of ""wealth envy."" During this year's Purge, he will have to do battle with the aforementioned masked home invaders, after his son allows a Black man into their home after the gates have closed before the Purge started. Is this man to be feared, or pitied? The audience doesn't know at first. And neither does Hawke, who is instantly suspicious of the man.And here is where the film develops a sociopolitical tone, which continues in the later films. Those in a certain political camp have made their comments well-known in the user reviewers for this movie, as well as the sequels (and most likely, such reviewers have not even seen the movies). In the end, there is no doubt that more progressive-minded viewers will enjoy this film and the sequels more.It is rare when a horror movie adopts such positions. It is probably likely that the producers, including no other than Michael Bay himself, had not planned on a franchise. But as the later films (particularly ""The Purge: Election Year"" and the current ""Forever Purge"") mirror events that were/are happening in the U. S., it was probably tempting to make the later films. And money is always a factor, as each Purge sequel seems to perform better at the box office than its predecessor.So back to the original 2013 Purge. It is more claustrophobic than the later films, with all of the action (besides the clips we see on the characters' TVs) unfolding inside Hawke's home. It's definitely a good starting point for those curious to check the franchise out. The later films can be watched in any order, however.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not too deep pyshcological thriller,"You know the premise so I'll skip it here.In short, the film is passable. Many on here, are missing the point. I see ppl stating that the plot isn't believable. Weigh the film against its own reality. It works because it exists in a world that we;ve never seen in reality. Don't think too much into why it does or does not work.Worth seeing in a Matinée. It IS rather short however and one should be prepared for this. It feels like there could have been much more here, but that it was cut for time or ratings content.Speaking of content, the ""R"" rating seems harsh for this. No nudity whatsoever, some light uses of profanity. I feel like it got a restricted rating solely on the excessive gun use and blood. the blood is barely visible and the gun play is not overly or overtly in your face.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice idea...,"""The Purge"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a wealthy family trying to survive a twelve hour period when any and all crimes are legal. This period is named the Purge and everyone can do whatever they want and since every crime is legal a lot of things happen.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot with a nice idea which I hadn't watched before. I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Ethan Hawke who played as James Sandin and he was very good at it. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Lena Headey's who played as Mary Sandin and Max Burkholder's who played as Charlie Sandin. Regarding the direction which was made by James DeMonaco, it was outstanding with some scenes that were surprisingly good.Finally, I believe that ""The Purge"" is a very good movie that used a new idea, it has an interesting plot with some plot twists that you won't expect and some very nice interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and if you are a fan of horror movies then I believe that you won't be disappointed watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The low budget explains it all.,"I love the idea from where this movie started and I loved the acting crew that was chosen, but you can feel how the low 3 mill. budget rips through the promising concept. First of all, I love Ethan Hawke and his acting, all his roles and movies where he contributed and you can feel how he saves this one from a total let down. Second of all, since I experienced Game of Thrones, I realised how good Lena Headey really is and I was expecting a decent performance, which she produced. I must admit that the antagonists where a bit shallow, but still managed to create that ""lunatic and psycho"" persona which was the main goal, especially from the main blonde guy. The horror was there, the quality jump scares were there and there was definitely gore. I also liked the plot twist at the end which was a bit expected, but still had a moment of surprise in it. 6-7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Quick and Thrilling Ride,","The Purge is a good movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's a short and sweet film that is very thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout.I do think the movie got in to the main storyline too quickly and put the main characters in danger before giving the audience enough time to really care about them.Most of the cast isn't great but the movie was mostly saved from the performances of Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey,sure Hawke dosen't shy away too differently from characters we've seen him play before and Headey's acting isn't the same outstanding acting she delivers in Game of Thrones,but having more professional actors did honestly make you care more about their characters,however I honestly had no care for their children.The thing that annoyed me the most is that the movie was trying to give out a message about the future of humanity that didn't work out as well as they probably thought.The Purge is an enjoyable movie that certainly has its flaws but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a short and sweet thriller.A wealthy family must protect themselves and their home from people that are free to commit any crime they want for 12 hours once a year.Best Performance: Ethan Hawke Worst Performance: Adelaide Kane",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth a watch,"This movie is terrifying. It isn't Michael Myers or Jason terrifying. It's terrifying to think of a government that would approve allowing its people to commit any crime and not be held responsible. Just imagine that every nutcase, serial killer, rapist is given free rein for twelve hours annually to commit their crimes with impunity. In the movie, the government claims that allowing the annual purge reduced crime. I don't see how that is possible. Perpetrators would just let all that hate and rage build up in them for twelve months as they made plans to terrorize their communities for twelve hours. They probably committed more crimes in twelve hours than they would have committed over a full year. I think people who could and would ignore these urges, let down their inhibitions knowing they would not be held responsible.Any government who thinks it's alright to allow people the freedom to prey on innocent people are evil people.Although people do stupid things, as people do in reality, and the movie is somewhat predictable (I did not predict what the neighbors did), it is still worth a watch.The story focuses on one family, during the purge.

Such a Shame To See a Great Premise Go To Waste,"I remember I first heard about this film in an ad before a YouTube video. It started with a voice-over said ""Don't skip this ad. You are about to see the trailer for the most disturbing movie of the year."" That was a bold statement, considering Evil Dead had already come out and The Conjuring was right around the corner. So naturally, I was curious and didn't skip the ad. One of the first things I noticed was that Ethan Hawke was in the film. I am a fan of Ethan Hawke, and since he was in Sinister a few months prior (one of the scariest films I've ever seen), I was even more curious. Then I noticed the interesting premise about all crime being legal for 24 hours, and as I sat and watched the trailer, I thought ""You know, this movie has a lot of potential if they do it right...""Finally, June arrived and the release date came along, so I saw the film. I was surprised to see a lot of awful acting, bad directing, and a poorly written story. Any and all potential that this premise had was completely wasted. The filmmakers took the premise and did the laziest thing possible: they made it into a cheap slasher flick. The Purge tries to make you feel isolated/alone in a small area with people hunting you, much like how the first Alien movie did. But The Purge relies too much on jump-scares to scare you, which is not a good tactic for horror movies. Good horror has slow-building tension and a release, two things that The Purge has none of.The characters and the acting are similar in the sense that they're terrible and make you angry. The kids make HORRIBLE decisions, and even in some instances, endanger their own lives. For example, there is a scene where the daughter is upset with her parents, so she walks off, while the people are still invading their house. She risks her life just to act rebellious. Then the people invading the house aren't great either. They all seem to wear masks and act insane to seem creepy. This could have worked, but the moment someone fires a gun at them, they immediately stop acting this way, and they take cover and act like regular people, which gets rid of any creepiness of them possibly being mentally insane.My final rating for The Purge is a 3/10. I hoped that this movie would at least be worthy of a Redbox rent, but it isn't even worth that. Part of me feels that I went in expecting too much, and I probably did. However, in a way, with the marketing and the premise, I didn't expect too much out of it. If you say that your movie is the most disturbing movie of the year, then you better give me the most disturbing movie of the year.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge: Doesn't deserve the bad ratings at all!,"I'd give this film a rating of 8, it deserves much more than the rating it has been given. I loved the idea, the masks set the tone perfectly and created that creepy effect. It was original but what let it down was that the ending was predictable and I hated the girl.However, Rhys Wakefield who played the part of the main villain put in an exceptional performance along with Ethan Hawke who is really getting into the horror/thriller genre after his fantastic performance as Ellison in Sinister as well.If it was longer and the ending took a different turn then the film would at least be rated at 8.5-9.5 because the idea has so much potential.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Should have been better,"It had a really good premise. All crime is legal for 12 hours. The rich prey on the poor, which leads to a better economy and less crime.

The security system in which the father actually sells for a living to other rich folks. Things go wrong and the entire family is left under attack. The ending is pretty predictable, and leaves much to be desired. There was so much more that could have been done with the movie. The ending ""message"" if you will is nothing new and can be seen coming a mile away. There is a whole world that could have been shown and explored but left out.

Anyway, solid cast and some suspense make The Purge a solid experience.Last Note: sadly the producers didn't stick to the ""recipe"" of the first movie, that franchise could have been something like a new Final Destination franchise. Instead, they tried to be creative and put more and more politics in the movies and more and more redundant but bigger action scenes and with every new movie another perspective on the original idea, which in my opinion in most cases didn't work too well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Flawed but Fun Blumhouse offering,"I expected this film to be alright - not great, but not rubbish either.And guess what, dear readers? For once I was dead on!It's an interesting concept behind the film - legalising practically all criminal activity for one night, providing a release valve for the population with the result that the crime rate for the rest of the year is practically nil.I was always a fan of Ethan Hawke, and I'm pleased to see that his acting career is having a bit of a resurgence. He and Lena Headey (a superb actress who manages to bring a real humanity to every character she plays) work really well together. Unfortunately, the main villain of the film (played by Rhys Wakefield) tries way too hard to channel the ghost of Heath Ledger in his creepily polite and occasionally eruptive psychopath role, and I feel like I'm watching the guy who came top in his class in GCSE drama but didn't feel the need to get any better.One of the criticisms levelled at this film is that the writers have been rather superficial in dealing with the socio-economic problems brought up by the concept (some people can afford to defend themselves better than others, for example), but then if they had spent more time on that it would have been a totally different film. This is, after all, a silly horror/action/sci-fi flick.Blumhouse have developed a reputation for producing films that are sometimes excellent, sometimes OK, but always worth a look. This is a pretty good one, and it's definitely worth a look. I think if we'd seen this marketed as a thriller rather than a horror, it would have gone down betterVerdict: flawed but fun!yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
strong concept that delivers thrills.,"The Purge is one of those rare movies that did not resemble a big budget studio film in any way, yet it received a wide release in theaters. This movie shows what you can do with an original high concept and a modest budget. It helped that it stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The Purge is about a family of four who are living in the near future during one day. This just happens to be the one day of the year when any form of crime is made legal and no police or emergency response is available. There are some rules; certain weapons are not allowed and of course government personnel of a high rank cannot be killed or attacked without consequence.The reason for this annual day of carnage is for the best interest of the nation because it has brought unemployment down to one percent and crime on any other day of the year to record setting lows. This is all a type of therapy, an outlet to vent deep seeded primal urges for those who choose to participate.So the family shelters themselves in their house with the help of an armored security system that covers all of the doors and windows. Around 20 minutes into the film a B-story kicks in then all hell breaks loose. A clan of young private school students have reason to break into the house. The leader of this group played by Rhys Wakefield is exceptional and is such a believable sociopath you cannot help but be entertained while he was on screen. Everything in this movie is made to feel hyper realistic which makes the situation even more terrifying.The Purge holds up against any other movie playing in the theaters and was produced for 3 Million and it grossed 76 Million to date. I hope the studios take note of this. It should come as no surprise that The Purge 2 is in development. There is countless places you can go with a strong premise like this. For example, what does the white house do during this day of anarchy? It would be interesting to see The Purge from the point of view from someone who hunts. Maybe they have a valid reason for choosing their prey and the audience could be routing for the hunters. This movie causes us to ask tough questions of ourselves and that is why it is so great in my opinion.I have to say that in the theater seated one row behind me were two fat women who talked throughout the whole movie. I wanted to stand up and yell at these self centered ignorant people to vent my anger. Instead I moved away from them. But as I did that I thought if the purge existed I might have followed those two out to their car, to find out where they live.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too bad ! It could have been so much better !,"This is just my opinion.I watched this movie because I loved the concept that it develops. The idea of the purge with those who are for and those who are against. The film could have been so great.So, is it the case ?Unfortunately no. This is a simple horror movie with jump scares. It is quite well directed and quite well played but it doesn't change the fact that the film does not use intelligently his concept. There are many clever things but too small to make the movie better than a lot of horror movies.When I watched the film, I was like : ""OK, I guess that there is someone behind this door."" or ""I guess that the next action of this character will be that."" I was always right. This is an other big problem of the movie, it is too predictable.I don't want to be only negative, it is a good entertainment. This is not bad to watch but if you have something better, watch the better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
semi-OK,"started off very lame - very, very lame. ""oh u got a promotion, sir"" ""yeah thanks!"" they live in the suburbs and they have creepy neighbors. very Disney channel-esque but whatever. fast forward to that ""purge"" thing, and there's some alarm and the TV screens all go blue and they're like ""this is not a test,"" blah, blah.the movie started off taking itself too seriously, fast forward to the middle and it's more. the acting will make you want to turn it off but don't because the ending is different.hidden message throughout. has to do with humanity.for just entertainment, skip it. if you want something a little more (hidden in a crapfest), watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A devastating insight into the psyche of America,"The emergency broadcast roll up said it all - you are free to commit any violent crime you like, even murder other people for 12 hours with impunity. And the clincher? ""God Bless America"". Seriously??Aside from being an utterly revolting premise, the acting was abysmal, probably the lowest point of Ethan Hawkes' career.Thirty minutes was all I could bear before I tuned out and cast this dreadful piece of film making out for good.I have watched some questionable movies in my time but to be promoting social and national values the likes of which this film promotes is just juvenile, infantile and seriously devoid of any moral fibre whatsoever.Well done Universal.

"Great idea, needed better execution","When I first heard about this movie, I was instantly excited for it. ""Anything goes for 12 hours?"" I thought. ""This will be great!"" Once I saw The Purge, however, I was left a little bit disappointed. With a concept like the one in The Purge, I expected more of a chaotic, all-hell- breaking-loose feel. It could be said that this was shown in the Sandin house, but I was expecting more of a citywide, even nationwide look at the effects of The Purge.There are some redeeming qualities to this film, however, that make it worth seeing. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great in their portrayals of James and Mary. In addition, the violent scenes were well-executed and, as they should be in a horror movie, shocking.While somewhat predictable and a bit unpolished, The Purge is definitely worth seeing for its great acting and thought-provoking concept.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as they say it is,"This was better than I thought it would be. With all the negative comments, I'm glad I ignored them and watched and I enjoyed it pretty much. This is more focused on what if we are in the situation and what would we do? I give this a focus on story and not on the graphics and comical story. I give this one a high rate of @@@@.5 for the story. Give this movie a go and please look on the story and not the graphics. Movie is supposed to be judge by its content not the cover anyway. Talking about judging, I found myself figuring out the both side of parties of how they feel and why they proceed in the action and this movie is pretty much what our society today is becoming. This movie need more attention to be watched and reminded how our society can be manipulated just because it's a reasonable action to kill / neutralize other people just so they can be better or should kill more people to raise economical benefits. Again, this movie is to be watched and see for yourself how this movie can tell about what our society is becoming.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad... plenty of predictable moments tho.,"As mentioned, it's pretty predictable as a current thriller movie is concerned. However, it's not a bad movie to watch. Loved the characters, and have to admit I only watched it because of the trailers and Ethan Hawke as a main cast. Ethan Hawke has been in a number of movies I've enjoyed and thought this would be a good twist to his character role (not that I think he's typed-cast).The premise was interesting. The Purge, a good movie for the NRA to watch and see what may happen if they keep turning a blind eye on what they support. Futures like this is for fiction, and we should keep it that way.This movie is thought provoking, something to talk about around the dinner table. For that reason, I will not purchase it and am not trilled I paid money to watch it.Silver-lining: good story line, interesting plot, and a wonderful ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There is bad, very bad, rock bottom bad and then there is this movie","Trailer was good, idea and original angle was interesting and that is what people are drawn to, and that is the only thing interesting about this movie. After 20 min, we were seriously considering walking out of the theater, bad-average acting at most, totally illogical reactions from the characters who chose their bf, or stranger over their family members, what to say about the boy who has the access code on such a critical night, the characters who are not armed half the movie, a multi million dollar house with top notch security system with no back up generator for the lights, iron panels 20 cm thick who are probably sliding on rails sealed in the structure of the house who are being pulled away by a pick up... and the list goes and ob... When people who are watching a thriller/horror movie laugh so often, you know that you have hit rock bottom. They based all their promo and trailer and a very sexy/original idea=12 hours of absolute free crimes to purge yourself, that is all. But again I now realize this move was with Ethan Hawke,,,that was already a good reason not to watch that movie, most of the movies he took part in are crap. After I watch the trailer I thought this movie gonna be either good or total crap, it has that potential, its either the kind of movie that has shown it all in the trailer and gonna tank badly or it as an actual plot and it is gonna be good.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good concept,"Conceptually the film seems to be challenging the absurd institutions we take for granted in our society such as war, police harassment, abject poverty by showing a circumstance that we could imagine in our own society given it's explanations which do not sound unlike the explanations used to justify war etc. However the film becomes boring.

"Funny, but not remotely scary or thought provoking","First, I cannot believe that IMDb uses i.e, when they mean e.g., in their location example. Come on guys!Next, the movie tries to cloak itself like it is Minority Report or for those whom read --Brave New World. However, it is not. It is a break- in movie. SPOILERS, I guess. I am just writing that mainly because I am so scared after reading the threatening notice by IMDb. The movie opens with all this talk of The New Founders that decided to start having a purge. The purge is supposed to relinquish everyones' aggression. And in this new world it works! Crime is down and everybody is happy with getting 12 hours to kill and pillage as they please. However, this small family apparently did not get the memo, with the exception of the father (Ethan Hawke). The son lets some guy into the house like he hasn't been alive for the past 13 years where this event happens every year. The rest is a typical home invasion story, but not without some funny moments. SPOILERS like the imitation of Clockwork Orange like portrayal of the elite young upper class who can only derive pleasure from killing the less fortunate.Do not expect to be scared or connect with any of these two-dimensional characters; however, do expect to be entertained in this fun romp through a typical story presented in a updated way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent but still a disappointment.......,"Well going into this film I had very high expectations and I came out of the theater disappointed-The cast was overall decent although Ethan Hawks performance was just okay it's defiantly not his best or his worst I feel that the overall direction of the film went completely wrong! One thing I can say it that this horror flick had a very interested plot the bad news is they failed to deliver and fell short of what the film should've been doing focusing more on (The actual Purge) this film had real potential but unfortunately that slowly faded away with a boring story,over unrealistic acting, and bad directing its........in closing I want to say give it a watch its not the worst film but if defiantly not the best it's worth one watch but trust me this film isn't at all memorable I would recommend renting it on (Redbox) or at a local video store but if you've got spare money and want to waste 20 bucks then the Blu-ray will be there waiting for you",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice Idea For a Film,"The writers were on a decent track when they thought this movie up.Making a movie where there is no laws for a certain amount of time, and everyone can make their selves feel better by ensuing whatever crime they desire for that amount of time.The down-fall of this movie, is not the actors, but rather the plot.If they had the family leave their house, for some reason or another, it would've made the movie much more suspenseful and gritty -- But I guess seeing as ""The Purge: Anarchy"" did this, they waited to make Anarchy to be able to show the outdoors... Well I got news for you; The Purge: Anarchy was WORSE than its prequel (As, in my opinion, most sequels are) But back on track... The Purge was/is nothing more than an action movie with cliché action sequences and a lot less language was used in it than your average action film.I really wish they would have made it much more gritty, violent and possibly gorier as the name implies.And I know this is a review for ""The Purge"" but I'll just throw my 2 cents in real quick (again)... ""The Purge: Anarchy""... Hmmm... Writers, next time you feel the need to place Anarchy along-side a word such as ""Purge"" or any variant or similar word, please show Anarchy -- Because all I saw, was generic cliché action sequences with sh*t I've seen before.The basic definition of ""anarchy"" is ""chaos"" and there wasn't NEARLY enough chaos in ""The Purge: Anarchy"" for the title to match itself.So yet again, great key point (""Purging""), completely done wrong.---I rated this movie at 7, only because Ethan Hawke (and whoever plays his wife -- I can't remember her name) is a good actor and actress and they kept this movie alive long enough for me to scoot passed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dystopian society that has the possibility lead to a purge,"(2013) The Purge
SCIENCE-FICTION SUSPENSE THRILLER/ SOCIAL COMMENTARYThe sole 'idea' of this movie is something that can be seen from a Japanese movie which the entire environment has been altered into controversy. Like ""Battle Royale"" or ""The Hunger Games"", ""the Purge"" is supposed to be like America's latest cult-like phenomenon where citizens are allowed to express their contempt toward other people in general by using physical force for a time of 12 hours. And that people working under gov't including police officers and fire men are exempt from ""The Purge"". To put it in simple words, it's a day where the open public are allowed to shoot, kill and maim as many people as s/he chooses for 12 hours since no one isn't going to be prosecuted for doing it. The first half of the movie explains 'the Purge' to the audience that acts like the Hunger Games and Battle Royale, the second half of the movie is a reminiscent of ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Assault On Precinct 13"". We're also introduced to James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his family. James makes a good living selling latest security equipment for people who want to keep their homes safe. He has a wife, Mary (Lara Flynn Boyle), daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and youngest son, Charlie (Max Burkholder) and things become complicated to the family, which questions the family's humanity as soon as the youngest kid, Charlie allowed an African American man seek refuge into the family household, motivating 7 to 10 wannabe killers who are part of this killing phenomenon to go after the family if this African American man isn't let out on a specific time. And they of course, became motivated to fight back since they also have firearms. One of the subtle things I liked about this movie, is the fact that because I do read newspapers and watch a lot of news on TV, the movie is suggesting how this ""Purge"" phenomenon can be deemed as racial and stereotypical since majority of it's victims are people who're living below the poverty line, which in turn means that much of them are minorities including African Americans, Latinos and Asians. I can see gun nuts hating this movie because they deem themselves as righteous owners who can never be manipulated, and I can see politicians, particularly right-wing not liking this movie either since they would never okay on such an act, except that it has already happened since in some of the largest cities in the United States such as Detroit and Chicago, policemen only help and aid residents who live in the city but not in dangerous urban communities which is where most minorities live. I would see hospitals closed down where they are needed the most so they could provide to areas where people can afford it. The best way to describe this movie is 'nihilistic' with a possible presumption about what things may yet to come because not all crimes are not properly attended, and that the only ones that are addressed are the ones branded as entitlement.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Purge is in Purgatory.,"You know, I can't bring myself to write a full and expansive review for this film. With mainstream horror it actually doesn't matter what you put down in type on internet forums, your rating is all that matters and will be equally reviled or lauded as being right or wrong!Of course there's a hint of sarcasm in what I write, not that I'm trying to provoke a response either way, it's just that with something like The Purge, it's guaranteed to be divisive.As it happens I enjoyed the film but found it utterly frustrating, a waste of a smoking hot premise that resorts to home invasion clichés as dumb characters do dumb things.The lead villain shows great promise but is sadly under used, and the snarky asides at work in the narrative (you know, preoccupation with violence, America is a bad gun loving place etc) get lost in the formulaic broth.Still, action is fun, the violence imposing, and cast perform adequately in lieu of the material. But horror lovers should approach with caution... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A little of the ultraviolence,"In the future (the year 2022), crime is essentially nonexistent and the unemployment rate is 1%. But one night a year, the country's fine citizens are permitted to commit any crime they wish, without penalty, including murder. It's the ultimate way to blow off steam. Twelve hours of mayhem, and then the population surplus is reduced. That's life with The Purge.The Purge - the event, not the movie - is sold as a good thing, something that keeps everyone in harmony for the other 364 days in the year. No crime? Almost everyone's employed? All due to The Purge, apparently. Some see it with a more cynical eye, though; those who can afford to defend themselves, their family, and their property against the onslaught of violence will probably be just fine. But those who live in the poorer sections of their city...well, they're there to be Purged.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) lives with his family in a gated community. James sells security systems, which as you might guess becomes a lucrative business around the time of The Purge each year, on March 21. The Sandin family has a very nice, expansive house, nestled among a plethora of other ""haves."" Thus James, wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder), and daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) feel safe, removed from the anarchy of the annual ritual.Until, of course, a still-unsure-if-he-supports-The-Purge Charlie decides, after the sirens have signaled the beginning of the madness, to let a bloody homeless man (Edwin Hodge of As Above, So Below) into their home. Ooh, bad call. See, some devout, well-armed Purgers are looking for the guy, and sure enough the Sandins' neighbors have ratted them out as harboring the guy. Does James hand over the man, or do the mercenaries take the house by force? Like You're Next, The Purge centers on a group of people being attacked unexpectedly. James does have weapons, but it's quickly apparent that his security system is more of a nominal deterrent than anything. The villains find it surprisingly easy to get inside. And with the lights out - yep, no power except for the generator that's somehow powering only the multiple cameras - and the family separated from each other, it's utter chaos at Chez Sandin.Also like You're Next, there's a nifty twist at the end. Sort of makes up for plot holes or just missing information. Here's a question: Since all weapons at Level 4 and below are legal during The Purge (and presumably illegal the rest of the year), how do law-enforcement officials discern whether a higher-grade weapon has been used outside of the annual Purge? It's not explicit in the movie, but I guess crimefighting is just that good in the future. But then I was thinking, what if it's good by virtue of instilling fear in the populace? That might control everyone for much of a year, but when it came time for The Purge, wouldn't cops be the first ones on the firing line? (Note: in a prologue voice-over, we're informed that elected officials have immunity.) The Purge offers some interesting food for thought. Would you be willing to live in a complete police state in order to have a crime-free society with jobs for everyone? On the plus side, you get to steal/vandalize/rape/pillage/murder to your heart's content. On the negative side, you could be the victim of all of that and not live to see another Purge. Kind of a dilemma, eh? But make no mistake, this isn't a movie that dwells on heavy issues. It's a thriller designed to shock and entertain, and to that end The Purge does a bloody good job.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The most provocative yet deep and question movie in this modern age,"I was surprised by how deep this concept really struck me, from the simple yet totally bizarre idea that once a year, America, will have one single night of total criminal legalization to outweight the violence and murder that used to be a common fact before the idea was put to action. As it so happens, the statistics has changed over the years, and shows that all kinds of criminal activity has decreased rapidly due to the very fact that people are allowed the pleasure to purge themselves from impulsive and aggressive behavior on this very special night.But, that is not the only thing that seem to change with this anual festivity. According to other sources, viewed upon as a ""everyone has their own opinions"" thing, the purge does not only work itself through anger management, but simultaneously erradicating any kind of humanity as poverty decreases due to the lack of affordance to the same kind of barricades the upper class has the means to procure.What it all boils down to is formed perfectly throughout the movie saying that the purge does not rid the world of aggression, but actually supports evil to manifest itself in the psyche of every single individual participating in this vile and abhorrent ritual.The ones that partake show no remorse of killing, and rather, religiously, delve in the very thankful gift of the founding fathers that came up with this barbaric idea, giving them the strength to go on, and support an ideal society. It shows that homicidal psychopathy is not a trend, but rather a natural behavior sinking discreetly into every human being, infectious and ruthless, til the point when none can tell the difference, ultimately resulting in a world were caring and understanding does not exist.The purge (in the movie) has gotten responses from a fraction of mankind, people that still carry a conscience, saying that it is wrong, and has only supported a callous and harsch future, not dissimilar from how the real world looks today. It is a great metaphor for cruelty and egoism that revolves around the supposedly none existing upper class in todays society, saying that equality is a fact of our times, yet in real life unknowingly supports total materialism over the well-being of humanity as a whole.The Purge takes the face of ""the American dream"" and rips it open turning the under-belly inside out showing the true face of greed and primal instinct.This is not a review as much as it is an analysis of a subtle, yet extraordinary message, imagined as a cruel and distorted jest of real life, very parodic, yet with a perfect serious tone that really grips your sences.As for the rest, I can only say, it was a good movie, no matter the acting or the scripture, but still, I guess it flowed so naturally that there's nothing to analyze from an objective stand-point, but rather a moral one. I think it is important that these kind of movies exist, not to scare us or makes us feel satisfied afterwards, but to stop us, make us sit down, and think about what it really means to be human.Feel free to have another read after you've seen it. As I've said, it is an experience, more than just a flick, so, prepare I guess, or don't, just indulge in it, and hopefully learn something useful from it.Have a good one!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great concept, limited execution","Not the most intelligent of thrillers / horror movies but a good couple of jump scares. The concept is great and has a lot of potential, let's see where the other movies take it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It had potential...,"After watching the trailer, I was really excited to watch this. I tend to gravitate towards these kinds of sadistic, slasher-type plots where the protagonist(s) are made to feel somewhat trapped in a corner (sometimes literally) and forced to fight to survive. However, unfortunately as is the case, high expectations leaves one vulnerable to be easily dissatisfied.The premise was extremely unique, and had the potential to be quite memorable. During the entire film, I was constantly required to think, asking myself 'what would I do in this situation?' and 'what would I do if it happened right now?', etc...and for that, I think the film was successful. The premise was also not too far-fetched either - an annual loophole/cleanse that exempted all US Americans from legal sanctions for 12 hours. Although unlikely to occur in a predominantly democratic society, the premise definitely could reflect (in an extremist manner!) the subconscious paranoid inclinations of some members of the community.The film also successfully made me feel a sense of defeat for some of the characters. The vulnerability of people invading one's space and liberties with intentions to kill reminded me of similar intrusions as in The Strangers and Vacancy.However, where The Purge was lacking was in its character development. Each character did exude some depth, but as a whole I felt disconnected to most of them. During some of the more 'climactic' points of the film, I actually didn't feel too concerned for the safety of some of them - except for the main protagonist played by Ethan Hawke. In fact, there were a couple of characters that I secretly hoped would be captured because they just absolutely irked me (...perhaps representative of my own subconscious feelings to purge).Overall, the film was satisfying - but I wouldn't watch it again (except to show future generations of what not to do if a purge were to ever become reality).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"All Setup, No Payoff","""The Purge"" had everything it needed to be a horror thriller that not only built tension but also delivered some sharp social commentary. The idea of a government allowing twelve hours of consequence-free crime to ""purge"" society is, at the very least, intriguing. The problem is that James DeMonaco's film seems more interested in using this premise as a backdrop for a predictable home-invasion thriller rather than actually exploring the implications of a world where crime is temporarily legalized. In the end, instead of a thought-provoking dystopian horror, we get a generic break-in movie where shallow characters make dumb decisions while the shaky camera frantically tries to inject artificial tension.The opening setup actually hints at something promising. The year is 2022, and the United States is experiencing an era of apparent prosperity thanks to the annual ""Purge Night,"" where citizens can unleash their most violent urges without consequences. Our protagonist, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), is a successful security system salesman, making a fortune by turning wealthy homes into impenetrable fortresses for the occasion. He and his family-wife Mary (Lena Headey) and kids Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder)-live in an affluent neighborhood surrounded by people who, even if they don't actively participate in the killing, at least accept it without question. But when Charlie, acting on a humanitarian impulse, decides to let a stranger (Edwin Hodge) into their home, he puts the family at the center of a moral dilemma-while also making them the target of a group of masked, psychotic rich kids, led by the ""Polite Leader"" (Rhys Wakefield), a villain so over-the-top he feels like he stepped out of a bargain-bin comic book.The biggest issue with the film is that it completely squanders its premise. Instead of genuinely exploring how a society could reach the point of institutionalizing an annual massacre, or how such an event would impact the collective psyche, ""The Purge"" quickly boils everything down to a simple conflict: a group of home invaders wants a man hiding in the Sandins' house, and the family has to decide whether to hand him over or fight to protect him. That kind of setup could work if it were at least well-executed, but the shallow characters and lack of real tension make the suspense fizzle out before it even builds up. Even Ethan Hawke, an undeniably talented actor, is wasted in a role that doesn't give him much to do beyond holding a gun and throwing out generic tough-guy lines like, ""This is our home!""On top of that, the film doesn't have the guts to fully commit to its ideas. Instead of embracing the brutality of its concept and delivering a truly unsettling psychological horror, it tries to balance weak social commentary with frantic action scenes, never really developing either. The shaky cinematography and choppy editing make the violent moments feel confusing and unimpressive, and the supposed tension-building mostly consists of characters slowly creeping down dark hallways while the soundtrack blasts over-the-top musical stings to announce every jump scare. And when we finally reach the much-anticipated showdown between the Sandins and the invaders, the direction stumbles, turning what should be an intense climax into a visual mess where it's hard to tell what's even happening.Another major letdown is the main antagonist. The ""Polite Leader"" is a cartoonishly theatrical villain-grinning creepily, delivering pompous monologues, and delighting in his own cruelty-but he never feels like a genuine threat. He and his gang, with their grotesque masks and exaggerated mannerisms, seem more like they belong in a satirical sketch than a serious horror film. Their motivations are barely explored beyond the surface level: they kill because they can, and because they're rich enough to get away with it. The problem isn't that the film portrays the attackers as sadistic sociopaths-that could have worked if there was some depth to it-but rather that they're reduced to such artificial caricatures that they lose all impact.The end result is a movie that seems afraid of its own ideas. Instead of embracing psychological horror and meaningful social critique, it settles for being a predictable thriller that ultimately has nothing new to say about violence, class, or morality. ""The Purge"" could have been a suffocating, disturbing experience, but it ends up being nothing more than a disappointment-an amazing concept wasted on a forgettable film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

James, Mary (Lena Headey) and their two children struggle to survive the night while trying not to turn into monsters like the ones they are striving to avoid.Is this movie good? No. It's not. I'm sorry to say that it is a very lacklustre movie with a wide array of issues. But do I like it? Yes. Yes I do. Despite its flaws, I do still enjoy this movie, and the franchise that follows. Whether that be for the interesting premise, funny villain or stellar per- wait never mind, they're all this has going for it.The premise for this movie is, in my opinion, a genius one. Is this movie supposed to be a social commentary? Maybe, but I don't care. I absolutely adore the premise of all crime being legal for 12 continuous hours. It's a fascinating concept? What WOULD you do? It's truly interesting and is literally the only reason I return to this god forsaken film. Well that and....Creepy Weirdo! I love this guy. Rhys Wakefield is so, so bad as the polite stranger but he is so entertaining. He thinks he is terrifying but he's just not. It's so funny to behold. I love the villain in this movie. Whenever he speaks I just want to pinch his nose. He is genuinely the only reason to see this movie. But is he enough?No he is not. The story surrounding the premise is dumb. The remaining performances from Hawke and co. are lacklustre and disappointing at absolute best. The cinematography and editing feel like a go pro was attached to Robert Downey Jr in his 'prime'. The 'scares' feel more like a Goosebumps episode rather than a feature length horror movie. Nothing in this movie is especially good. In fact, it is quite awful. And that is why I cannot recommend this awful movie. But you know what? I love its awfulness. Should you see it? No. But I like this movie. It's so dumb and bad that it IS my guilty pleasure movie. Don't watch it. Just leave me and Freak Boy in peace... I'll rate this movie 5 'Creepy Strangers' out of 10. Don't watch this film!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One good deed,Solid movie and the start of a new horror franchise. The acting is decent and the storyline fairly straight forwards. Low budget but it plays to its strengths and keeps the scope small. A few good jump scares and some unexpected plot turns.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

PURGED out of sync,"The story and it's context is interesting to a point of WHAT if ANYTHING the government would allow. This would be like a programmed consensus of population control by means of everyday citizens committing the purge or cleanse of murdering others. I did ""say"" the context was interesting but fails miserably as plausible. There are a lot of mistakes and fails with this film. The acting as a whole is absolutely trying on the audience. I like Ethan Hawke, but hell, he couldn't even save this film. The main catalyst of the film (Hawke) is a security systems sales analyst, and in the film his fails as the power is down. Wouldn't ya think with his position there is a back up plan as he sells these. I feel this film is just a ploy on what ifs. Hell it did spurn 3 sequels. I give it a modest 4",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
What would John Wayne say about this Movie?,"In his Playboy interview from May 1971, Wayne stated he considered High Noon ""the most Un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life"". Like many others I was surprised by all the bad reviews after the release. So I was wondering why so many dislike ""the Purge"" or the concept behind it. I can see that it's not so easy to be an American and feel not affected or thing no way this will be in the so near future (2022). But then again you living in a country with laws like ""stand your ground"". Imagine the homeless man (Target/Hostage) in the movie would have an an actual name an the name would be Trayvon Martin. So I would say don't go by all the negative reviews. This movie is really good.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great set-up becomes a routine (although very well done) home invasion/siege film,"I'm fascinated with The Purge franchise and although I'm consistently disappointed with each film and feel the stories never live up to the story or thematic possibilities of this fascinating dystopian world. ""America. 2022. Unemployment is at 1%. Crime is at an all-time low. Violence barely exists. With one exception..."" That exception is The Purge! A government-sanctioned annual 12-hour period in which all criminal activity, including murder, becomes legal. While it's a dynamite premise ripe with storytelling possibilities, it's also the fatal flaw of the series. I mean really, how would the world become a perfect utopia just because people are allowed to run wild once a year? It makes zero sense. Still, the premise has enough power to draw the audience in, forcing them to consider, what would you do during such an event. What would your neighbors, co-workers, friends, and family do?Working in schools myself, I've always wondered why they haven't shown what happens at schools during The Purge, because I'm pretty sure there would be at least one kid with a grudge who'd try to burn their school to the ground each year. The same probably goes for any government building, which would be interesting to see how those often reviled institutions are protected during The Purge.Anyhow, I decided I wanted to rewatch the first film of the franchise and it made me appreciate the world-building writer/director James DeMonaco did with each subsequent film and also the two-season TV series. This first film is a pretty small-scale home invasion/siege film that takes place within a larger dystopian universe that's largely left unexplored. The setup is ripe for unhinged Devil's Night mayhem along with all sorts of possibilities for commentary on society, politics, economics, ethics, and human nature. We do most certainly get some intense mayhem, but what's disappointing is this first film barely scratches its thematic and story potential. Ethan Hawke plays a home security salesman and the story follows his family on Purge Night, hunkering down when they find themselves the target of a well-armed group trying to get in to kill a homeless person their son has let in and given shelter to. I can excuse the film for keeping the story small-scale and not fully exposing the world of The Purge due to budget constraints, but while there are some thematic nods regarding the economics of the haves and have-nots, the film never really goes all that deep. Despite my disappointment in terms of unexplored potential, THE PURGE is a well-crafted, exciting, and suspenseful siege film. It's not up to John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 standards, but it's leaps and bounds better than most home invasion films. THE PURGE also benefits from a stronger-than-average cast for a genre film, which besides Hawke also features Lena Headey as his wife. Rhys Wakefield, who was previously unknown to me, is also very memorable as the ""Polite Leader"" of the group trying to get inside. And one bit of film geek casting that had me giddy was the casting of character actor Chris Mulkey as one of Hawke's neighbors. After completing this film, writer/director DeMonaco said that if he ever got a chance to do a second film, it would be more like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. He's since delivered on that promise, further exploring and expanding the world of THE PURGE that this first film only hinted at. That's what surprised me the most rewatching the film again, was how little they go into explaining the world of THE PURGE. It's like going back to watch the first ELM STREET and CHILD'S PLAY movies, where there's surpassingly very little Freddy or Chucky in those first films. Although most of The Purge sequels end up being predictable run-and-gun action flicks, the premise is enough to hold your interest and it's usually the small details (shop owners on their rooftops protecting their stores, racist vigilante groups running amok, good samaritans running pop-up medical services, etc.) that are the most interesting of world-building elements versus the larger elements (The Founding Fathers political party and the way corporations support the annual Purge) which come off as ham-handed attempts at making a ""statement."" Overall, this first film is the tightest of the series, and although it's wildly exciting and suspenseful and features a strong cast, with a very cool story setup, it's also a missed opportunity leaving a rich subtext left largely unexplored.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Culling out the people you hate the most, without any retribution","Culling out the people you hate the most, without any retribution, wouldn't that be anyone's dream? I know what my answer to that would beBut I'm not sure if the notion of a purge; one 12 hour night a year -7 pm until 7 am- is either sick or ingenious.This film shows one family during the purge. Trying to stay together during the 12 hours, trying to keep it together. Trying to stay alive, while all hell breaks loose around them. But when there's a daughter that lets her suspicious boyfriend in just before midnight,and a son who lets a stranger, crying for help after being hurt, into the house, who knows what might happen. Dubious shadows keep moving in doorways, are they the boyfriend or the stranger? Is the family safe? And who are the dozen people moving ever closer to their house with axes and other weapons.When the family encounters the intruders on their lawn, their power gets cut, and it seems like they are f*cked. Will they be able to protect themselves?This movie shows the downside of 12 hours of a lawlessness and portraits the worst that can happen.7 out of 10 stars; It's a okay film, but with an original story line I haven't seen before, turning this from an average 5 stars to 7 stars. This is a thriller/slight horror, with some unexpected twists.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Itz an OK Movie ..Loved It,The Purge..As you all know is happening in America..The day in which all crimes including murder is legal for 12 hours.. Yeah its a dumb movie plot..but in a way interesting too... Well i found the starting of the movie quiet appealing and i kinda believed that the dumb plot was real and was happening.. .In ma opinion James Sandin(Ethan Hawke) and Mary Sandin (Lena Headey) were lovable characters and the acting were quiet impressing..However Charlie Sandin (Max Burkholder)and Zoey Sandin (Adelaide Kane)acted well but both were stupid and senseless..Which after a while I thought they were competing to be the most dumbest..And last point I thought why the father didn't beat him up and kill him(No one cares..Itz purge right??) And O.M.G Polite leader(Rhys Wakefield) did a plausible work and he should be casted as Joker(you will get it after watching the movie) {NO Offence}Well about the movie..It was good but sometimes they took decisions even babies think is dumb.. But the direction was superb which covers all the stupidity of script and make you believe in the whole thing..I anticipated for more violence and gore..But the movie delivered action too..The movie have unexpected twists...For people who doesn't like reading everything THE MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING...,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Between awful and horrible,"What can I say? Stupid characters, lots and lots of plot holes, predictable ending. Interesting initial idea (one night, every year, murder is legal) but stupid justification (so, if you allow them to kill one night, every psychopath, every passion crime, every murder motivated by money...just will not happen the other 364 nights....yeah, it is clear that the director and the writers knows a lot about human psychology). And, hey, we the rich ones, instead of leaving the country for vacations that day, we buy absurdly expensive and in fact completely ineffective security systems. In addition, we do not think about hire some mercenaries to protect our residential area, no, it is much better to give a gun to our absolutely idiot ten year old son. Do not lose your time with this piece of crap.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid concept but blandly executed,"'The Purge' is a somewhat decent sci-fi horror action thriller that features an excellent premise, a taut and intense atmosphere, interesting themes and plenty of bloody violent sequences to keep you mildly entertained throughout its run time. Despite it's potential to be something great the movie opts for a safe and rather bland approach to this grand idea, but it's not all bad as it does provide some solid entertainment even if it is mostly on the slow side and thankfully the cool concept would be explored far better in further sequels.The Plot = Set in a dystopian future where the government has sanctioned a 12-hour period in which all criminal activity including murder becomes legal known as the Purge. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his wife Mary (Lena Headey) and their kids retires for the night in their secured home until an intruder breaks their gated community and begins a sequence of events that threatens to tear the family apart.The movie does have some great things going for it, the idea alone was worth horror gold and it sets up its rules within the universe rather effectively, but the biggest problem here is that compared to some of the other entries this feels rather quaint and comes across more like a good if a little generic home invasion thriller than it does a 'Purge' flick which is strange considering that this is the first entry in the series. However, there are a few neat twists and turns throughout its narrative to keep you interested and the great cast does elevate it somewhat above the usual low-budget genre fare. The themes of morality and class are well explored here and there are plenty of suspenseful moments and once we get to the halfway point when the freaks arrive the horror elements ramps up by adding an impending sense of creepiness and dread to the movie and this is when it starts to become a lot more engaging. The filmmaking aspects are well done and the direction by James DeMonaco is pretty solid, and he does what he can with the restraints of the budget and delivers a slick and polished looking production.The cast here are great with stellar performances from Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey as the middle-class couple and Rhys Wakefield delivers a standout performance as the leader of the murderous freaks.Overall 'The Purge' is fine for what it is a mildly entertainingly standard home invasion thriller that could have been a whole lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great concept, poor execution","Things most of Hollywood - and this film - doesn't like:America
Religion
US Constitution
Founding Fathers
The SuburbsYou know, the standard Hollywood dislikes - nothing new.Things THIS film (like many low budget movies) doesn't like:Complex characters
The outdoors
Due process
White peopleThings this film likes:Edged weapons
Homeless people
Random acts of violence
PC character motivationsThe Purge is such a part of our lexicon I figured I should give it a watch when I saw it was on HBO. The concept is a very good one, the execution was a little disappointing. Like most movies that follow Hollywood's rules of political correct wokeness, it becomes easy to predict who will be good or bad... which kills a lot of the suspense.It gets a 5 and not a 1 because it held my attention in spite of being stuck in one location (due to budget reasons). The acting and directing were also solid - especially for a low budget movie.If they'd changed up even some of the standard PC tropes for some surprises, it would have been much better.(If you want a violent movie with a similar feel to this movie, but will keep you guessing, check out The Hunt.)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hit or Miss Flick, but mostly a miss.","I will start off by stating that I quite like Ethan Hawke, give or take a couple flicks. The only reason for watching this movie was the premise, it seemed like it could go in a few different directions. Not knowing too much about what happens before watching it, I didn't have the chance to avoid it. The premise seemed like it could accommodate a variety of twists and engaging elements. I thought the idea of legalizing fun, while it wasn't the most logical plot, seemed like it could be a really fun movie. Given this wouldn't happen, I wouldn't let this logic get in the way of my judgement. I just wanted to be entertained, not shown a masterpiece by any means. However it fell short, terrible how they could ruin something with potential.The acting wasn't terrible, but was not great either, I won't delve into that.However, the thriller aspect of the movie was not enticing. The film featured long periods of 'attempted suspense', but came off quite cheesy at times. The last two thirds of the movie were intentionally, and brazenly dark, in the literal sense. I could understand the opportunity for some thrills in this, but it did not work out. This drew the movie out for a while, and nearly put me to sleep hoping for some a genuine adrenaline rush, but it was too cheap. The movie is highly polished, incredibly long in its feel, and stands out as just another grim Hollywood attempt for a stab at your money.No substance, I wasn't expecting any regardless, but not entertaining in the slightest. Given the exception at the beginning building the story line. The ending had a twist, but a pretty weak and unimaginative one, so have fun with that thought.Overall, I really wanted to like this movie, but am sadly let down. It could be a hit or miss, but I would avoid this movie at all costs, don't waste your time around trashy and cheaply written movies.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Needed to be more satirical,"The Purge starts with a concept. What if for one night in a year all crime was legal, including pillaging, vandalism, rape and murder. All of it. It's an interesting idea. Naturally it could never happen in real life, but that's not the point. It's the work of fiction to explore the possibilities, even the impossible ones, because they're all reflections of our society, our psyche as humans.Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired, being really nothing more than an intruder horror drama. A family is locked inside their own house to escape the purging, and when everything doesn't go according to the plan, you can pretty much guess what will happen. I would have liked to see this idea explored on a larger scale, or with more attitude. Now it tries to play it safe, or perhaps too realistically. Like this is supposed to be a warning against this sort of solution.Then again, all the actors do their jobs very well. Rhys Wakefield is especially amazing as a polite leader of hooligans out to purge for the night. He almost summons back the spirit of Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orage to possess him and bring us back that good old ultra-violence.The Purge is a decent film. It had the potential to be much more, but what we end up getting has some seriously creepy imagery, the action and the horror both work and it's an interesting idea to mull over for an hour or two. Recommended for horror fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Case of the Could've Beens,"As a premise The Purge threatens to be something special - in the near future there is a 12 hour window once a year when all crime is legal, i.e. anything goes. With that set up there are any number of tantalising stories that could've been pursued so it's disappointing to report that we are treated to little more than a bog standard 'family protecting their home' plot that has been explored so often in film.Ethan Hawke plays James Sandlin, a home security salesman and therefore held in high regard, particularly around the time when the next 'Purge' is to occur. With a stereotypical movie family at home he locks the place down for the annual 12 hour crime fest that will take place far away from their gated community haven. Except someone else is in the house and their quiet neighbourhood isn't quite as tranquil as they would hope.It is sadly all rather mundane with perfunctory performances from all involved, including Hawke whose eclectic career is littered with occasional forgettable roles such as this. Things do get slightly more interesting as the tension is cranked up towards the finale but to its detriment it insists on hammering home the moralistic conundrum that is the purge itself rather than just accepting the premise for what it is.The ending is telegraphed right from the opening scenes and you are simply left with a feeling of nice idea but where's the rest of it?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Nothing is ever going to be okay again!""","Seeing the THE PURGE's rating here and on Amazon, I didn't get my hopes too high. I found it compelling and watchable enough, decently acted, and professionally filmed. Otherwise, it was something of a let-down.As many others have noted, THE PURGE has a very original premise, and there's a lot more that the makers of this film could have done with it. Some of the various themes regarding contemporary America--classism, nationalism, gun-obsession, neighborhood relations and competition, etc--also begged for a little more development. But in the end, THE PURGE just becomes another run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up fest.It would have done miracles for this film if it had begun a few days BEFORE ""Purge Night,"" giving a little more background on the Sandin family's relationship with their neighbors, dad's business relationship with the community, and daughter Zoey's forbidden relationship with boyfriend Henry. That way, what happens during ""Purge Night,"" especially at the very end, would be better-earned and make a lot more sense.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The purge,"Even though the reviews about the purge were negative mostly, i just had to see the movie and it was great and got me on the edge of my seat it shows how humans can be monsters sometimes to survive and it was exciting to watch, i will totally recommend this movie i love Ethan Hawke acting he is my favorite in the movie, but other characters are irritating to me but i guess everyone acts different in the purge and some may people who you didn't expect it all, but don't think a lot about facts just sit back and relax,im sure its one of those movies you talk about after years and years and don't care about other people opinion about the movie plus the acting was great and the masks and the customs were very creepy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tolerable, Absolutely Tolerable.","""Tolerable"" is the best compliment i can give this movie. It did a good job of showing a ""Lord of the Flies"" style breakdown of morals of a nice and smiley suburban white family. But every move this movie wanted to make was so forshadowed so heavily that nothing was a surprise. Which could be useful in a movie where the entire cast is bland as toast.The ""villains"" are about as intimidating as a troupe of toddlers with squirt guns and even the parts that were meant to convey menace or unease (the masks the villains wore, for instance) honestly came across as funny and not scary. There were one or 2 points where the tension was right, but this was few and far between.My main complaint is that this movie goes NO WHERE. From the time The Purge starts, 30 minutes in, until the closing credits, the stakes are not raised at all. Nothing happens to increase tension or make you wonder ""how will they make it"". Again this is as much a fault of the heavy handed forshadowing as anything, but I still feel a movie needs to increase the stakes in the last 20 minutes or so to keep it interesting and this movies remains lifeless for the last hour.As I saw before, this movie was funny, very funny at some points. But this is not a comedy and I laughed at it as much as I did with it. 4/10 because while it had problems, these problems weren't terrible, just gave the movie an over all uniteresting quality.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge (2013) Review,"The film is set in March of 2022. The basic premise of this movie is that on one night a year for 12 hours (7pm- 7am) all emergency services are suspended and all crime, including murder, is legal, a law introduced by the new president (name undisclosed) within his first month in office. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is the top salesman for a company that produces high end home security systems which are specifically used for the night of The Purge. Him and wife Mary Sandin (Lena Headey) are full supporters of The Purge because of the low crime rate and unemployment that the it has created, however they are not participants of it. They have two children Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane). James and his family are so exaggerated in their behaviours that I almost felt compelled to like them; it's as if the directors had stuck a massive label over the top of the family saying ""People We Like."" Each character also did not feel cohesive as a family; each child had different mannerisms and traits which were not portrayed in either parent. As well as the parents having a sickly sweet and unbelievably perfect marriage.Unfortunately for this film, the viewer is left dissatisfied within mere minutes of the film starting due to the very poor and unconvincing acting styles of Mr Hawke. His enthusiasm and friendly persona are overwhelming for the introduction of the character. Although being enthusiastic works to his advantage during some surprisingly brutal action scenes, one of the only places where DeMonaco's directing came to any good; the action scenes seemed to be the only part of the film that was believable. I will maintain that the acting from the fairly unknown cast was not all that bad, Lena Headey delivered a somewhat average performance, although this is more due to bad writing more than her particular style; a very dull and very typical mother character. Rhys Wakefield, who plays the ""Polite Stranger"", delivers the best performance of the film. His creepy and annoyingly cheerful personality is about the only thing which creates terror throughout the film.The film is set in a wealthy suburban area with little knowledge as to whether this in a town, village or city, however, I think the important part of the setting lies within us knowing it is a wealthy area. It is also set at night, a concept also not easy to grasp, because if all crime is legal there is no need to sneak around at night, so why not the day? I do accept that this is done for the purpose of it being a horror, although I do find it unnecessary in terms of supporting the film's basic premise. I find that the setting does not add anything to the fear aspect of the film; in fact I think a rural setting would quite possibly be more beneficial for this element and would create a lot less plot holes.One major problem I had with this film is the amount of horror styled elements the movie tries to incorporate. It's creepy, it's supernatural, it's sci fi, it's gory, it's terror, etc. This makes the film very confusing in terms of what you should actually be afraid of. It also creates complicated and unnecessary questioning as to what genre the film actually falls into; the possibilities being horror, thriller or action. This ""too much going on"" theme runs throughout the films plot too; so I guess we can slightly applaud the film for having a sense of cohesion. Another problem I found myself is that the film runs on ""no bad guy"" system; how can we be angry at characters that are just doing what they are legally allowed to do? It is their right to purge just as much as the Sandin family have the right not to purge. For me personally, it does not make me feel empathy towards any ""good guys"".The films initial premise excites me to an extent as many of us, myself included, sit there and wonder whether such a concept could work in society. However, throughout the film, many decisions made by the neighbours in the suburb do make me question the premise. For example, there are no safe zones, only citizens of class 10 or higher are exempt, this includes the government. So even those who do not wish to take part, still have to pay the high cost to install security systems. Although this concept is addressed within the film where they state that a minority of people think the Purge is a way for the government to eradicate the poor.I was highly disappointed with this film as I thought we may have finally had a horror movie with a decent writing crew to deliver a cohesive movie with little plot holes, but we have been given the opposite. Overall acting: poor, directing: poor, writing: poor, all of these elements deliver an unsatisfying cinema experience. I hope that no sequel is attempted with the left over rubble of this car crash.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fascinating idea, with a subpar execution","A fascinating concept, which could have been so much better if fully developed, we meet the Sanding family just as the new America of 2022 is locking down for Purge Night a 12 hour period when all crime is legal including murder. They are a well to do family in an upscale neighborhood. The lockdown goes off without a hitch; well, almost. The Sandina daughters boyfriend gets locked inside, and their young son charlie sympathizes with a stranger he views on the security camera outside, letting him in, and greatly upsetting a group of young travelers, exercising their right to purge. A pretty wild setup, but the screenplay as it is, presents ideas, in skeletal form, with lots of undercooked execution.

Amazing and please get your facts right...,"Yes, well. This movie was pretty amazing I would think. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. I was one of those ""kids"" who was cheering in the crowd when people died. But, anyways. Some of the acting wasn't too believable, but in all, this movie was quite good. I thought all of the actors and actresses played their parts quite amazingly. I believed most of the acting, not so much James (the dad), But Mary, Charlie, Zoey, Polite stranger, etc. All of their acting was very much believable, that is why I enjoyed this movie so much.

Brilliant Concept Bogged Down Under It's Own Weight,"In 2022, the United States has been overtaken by a new legion of Founding Fathers who implement a twelve hour period of near-complete lawlessness aimed at allowing citizens to properly vent frustration built up over the year. The Sandin family, led by patriarch James (Ethan Hawke) has a fancy security system designed to keep the violence out and the family safe inside, but that all changes when son Charlie allows sanctuary to a homeless man fleeing a band of murderous freaks.""The Purge"" is an absolutely brilliant movie concept that gets so bogged down in the weight of its own message that it reverts to an average-at- best action-horror flick. The script sees fit to introduce a fascinating idea, that of a night of pure terror sanctioned by the government, and the ramifications that bad decisions can bring. It tries to prove violence as an answer to pent up emotion, but gives little payoff for the few humane enough to say 'no' to the destruction.The biggest problem here is simple explanation. Just throw in a sentence here and there to explain the following; Is it really beneficial to the economy to allow people to use extreme measures to do whatever they want? If buildings collapse or manual workers are killed, what happens to profits? Are taxes at sky-high rates to pay for all the wounded receiving treatment afterwards? Little things so unexplained. Why is the rebellious boyfriend even in the script, what did he do to advance the plot? He is forgotten by the end.Acting wise, Ethan Hawke does a good job as the father trying to protect his wife and family. Yet you'd think, for a security salesman, he would implement a fail safe or two preventing young kids from opening intricate home defense systems with the touch of a button. Lena Headey is breathtaking and makes a great heroine, but she seems to have the bare minimum interest in her children's well being, not even knowing where either of them are for most of the film. Rhys Wakefield makes for a creepy but unmemorable villain.This is a decent movie and worth a rental. It will make you think, but not of the morality or immorality behind the Purge. Instead you'll be scratching your head as to the incompetency of the Sandins. Perhaps diverting your attention from the inhumanity of the Purge is the point.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

I saw everyone rating this movie very low so i had to write a review and tell you it was brilliant. It was different and the story line is unique and great. There are some scary scenes because it can happen to anyone not only because they were on a purge. No matter what anyone says this movie is excellent!The meaning this movie brings is magnificent.

Interesting premise? Definitely poor execution.,"I really thought this might be a good movie. It has an interesting premise, unless you take 30 seconds to think it through. The government gives every citizen nearly full license to do whatever they want for 12 hours every year. I say nearly because there are ""clear"" restrictions set up in the movie by means of an emergency broadcast. They can't use certain weapons (Class 5 and higher, one would assume things like nukes or other similar WMDs) and can't harm ""government officials of ranking 10"", so one would assume the way higher-ups. The broadcast also mentioned all crime, including murder, being legal.Pondering that can only bring you to one conclusion: how the hell does the entire country not fall apart? What sort of moron would think this is a good idea? Well, the creators of the film clearly thought people were stupid enough to buy into this, perhaps for some morbid curiosity crap... The problem is most people aren't going to go kill someone simply because it's suddenly legal. The film doesn't really err on the side of realistic. Sadly the premise tends to be heard as ""MURDER LEGAL GO!""Aside from the premise not holding up in reality, the rest of the movie was essentially a pieced-together horror/thriller that was never really horrifying or thrilling. I did not care about the main characters. They were a bunch of rich folks with their own silly problems and absolutely no depth. And of course, lets not forget the daughter who prances around in a catholic school girl outfit for the duration of the film.This movie really wanted to capitalize on extreme close-ups and the brilliant scare tactic of hiding the villains behind people's enlarged heads. I eventually found myself counting down to the next ""OMG HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU"" moment and actually nailed most of them. It just wasn't scary. It is still possible to make someone jump out of their seat, and I don't mind having that happen. But when you can predict those moments, it ruins the experience. As for the psychological part, it didn't really work out, especially when you want the main characters to die anyway.By the end, I was hoping someone would have just dropped a nuke right on this house, but sadly that would have been against the rules. I'll give them credit though, it's hard to find a film with a $3 million budget that does this well in the box office. But clearly this is only a sign of having a rather captivating premise marketed with a decent trailer.I really hope Honest Trailers picks this movie up. They'd probably enjoy making another lens flare montage.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
All crime certainly was legal when this film was made!!,"I won't lie to you, the film itself was watchable- It has a good premise, very good acting and some amazing scenes- however the ending made me want to throw the DVD player out of the window. It was infuriating and a classic example of a lazy writer. I have been dying to see this film since it came out, probably before, but I was extremely disappointed with this over-hyped, murderer of the genre.As said before the majority of the film was OK, there was immaculate acting from Ethan Hawke and young actor Max Burholder, but a lot more could have been done with a promising Idea such as this. For Ethan Hawke fans do not refrain from watching this movie as he does not disappoint but for fans of the average housewife don't even go there. I can conclude by saying that this film featured one of the worst endings in today's cinema!!!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
confused and not fully explored,"Such a terrific idea gone to waste. It's happened before and it will probably happen again. Sadly, with all its ""Funny Games,"" ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Them"" influences, it manages to be nothing more than a boring, cliché-ridden, confused mess.The premise is simple; one night a year, for 12 hours, the population of the USA have the legal right to commit any crime they desire, including murder. One man and his family have gotten rich off this programme by selling security systems to his rich neighbourhood. This year he's going to get his comeuppance.what could follow is a film that explores the money made on fear and the conspicuous consumption ideology of middle class America and Europe. It's also fun to watch the bourgeoisie get what's coming to them. Instead, shortly after the 'Purge' commences, most sense and ideas go out the window: the writers can't even come up with a decent villain.As soon as the 'Polite Leader' of the freaks arrives, gurning at the Ethan Hawke's terrified James through CCTV, all tension is lost. We know exactly how it will pan out and, unsurprisingly, that's exactly how it pans out. Except, well, the whole Ethan Hawke having awesome combat skills for some lily-livered business man. There's barely a whiff of danger and no game of chess played between hunter and hunted. Unlike other home invasion films (the aforementioned ones as well as ""Panic Room,"" in particular), the main characters here seem to have every idea of what is happening and every idea of how to prevent it. There's also very little to fight for in this film; Jodi Foster and Naomi Watts were both fighting for their families in their films and the poor couple in ""Them"" were fighting just to stay alive. Ethan Hawke, however charismatic, isn't fighting for the justice or injustice of ""The Purge,"" his belief in the system is never clarified and he certainly doesn't seem to be fighting for his family seeing as they all seem too cosy and miserable in their massive home.Sadly, the writers don't know what to do with their cast and characters disappear and reappear on a whim, doing very little but pushing the film towards an inevitable climax. There's a homeless man who puts the gears in motion and some neighbours who are/aren't the family's saviours but they're all so inconsistent. This could have played like a more violent Hitchcock film or at the very least a smarter version of ""Mother's Day"" but fails in both aspects - too loose and underdeveloped for Hitchcock and too lacking in conviction and horror to be ""Mother's Day."" The fact that the main antagonist is cornier than Blowfeld makes the whole thing even harder to stomach - was he aiming for Michael Pitt in ""Funny Games?""All in all, the film ends criticising the violence it is based on making the protagonists nothing more than a bunch of cowards who are too afraid to stand up for their convictions. I sincerely doubt that this is the film they wanted to make.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horrifying Exploration of Humanity's Darkest Desires,"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with The Purge? This movie is an absolute rollercoaster of suspense, terror, and sheer intensity that left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I have to say, I am absolutely blown away with this film and I am so excited to share my thoughts on it!First of all, let's talk about the premise. The idea of a Purge, where all criminal activity is legalised for a certain period of time, is downright bone-chilling. It's a concept that is both terrifying and fascinating at the same time. The thought of society descending into chaos for 12 hours is enough to send shivers down anyone's spine. And the way the film explores the consequences and moral dilemmas that arise during this period is absolutely brilliant.Now, let's dive into the storyline. The Purge centers around a wealthy family who find themselves held hostage by a ruthless murderer during one of these Purge nights. The tension builds up organically, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread and unease as I watched the events unfold. The film does an incredible job of keeping you guessing and constantly on the edge of your seat. Every twist and turn had me gasping for breath and eagerly anticipating what would happen next.The characters in The Purge are also worth mentioning. They are so well-developed and fleshed out that you can't help but feel invested in their fate. The family's struggle to survive and protect each other in the face of pure terror is heart-wrenching and will have you rooting for them every step of the way. And let's not forget the antagonist, who is truly spine-chilling and will haunt your nightmares long after the credits roll.But what truly sets The Purge apart from other horror films is its social commentary. The movie raises important questions about morality, justice, and the dark side of human nature. It forces you to confront uncomfortable truths and challenges you to think about the lengths people are willing to go to survive in a world gone mad. It's a thought-provoking and deeply unsettling exploration of the human psyche, and it adds a layer of depth and substance to an already thrilling and terrifying film.I cannot conclude this review without mentioning the incredible direction and cinematography. The Purge is visually stunning, with its dark and gritty atmosphere perfectly capturing the bleakness and chaos of the Purge night. The tension is amplified through masterful camerawork and perfectly timed jump scares that will leave you jumping out of your skin. The combination of stunning visuals and a gripping narrative make for an absolutely unforgettable cinematic experience.In summary, The Purge is a true masterpiece in the horror genre. With its bone-chilling premise, gripping storyline, compelling characters, thought-provoking social commentary, and stunning direction, this film deserves a resounding 10 out of 10. It will leave you breathless, terrified, and completely enthralled from beginning to end. If you're a fan of intense and thought-provoking horror films, I cannot recommend The Purge enough. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tries To Be A Cathartic Movie About Cathartics,"The Premise is the thing. It asks You to believe that by allowing one 12 Hour Lawless binge a Year ""Purge Night"" where anything goes, including Murder is the answer to Unemployment and the elimination of those dirty ""Takers"".

Typical but really good home invasion thriller,"If you like home invasion films (Panic Room, The Collector, Hostage) then I don't see any reason why people wouldn't like this.From what I can understand, the over-the-top negative reviews (1 star?!) are from people who felt misled by the hype so I suppose this is a reason to avoid watching trailers and reading too many reviews as your expectations will greatly affect your enjoyment of a film. For example, I loved Pain and Gain (2013) and it really is funny but I talked about it so much at work that my friend didn't enjoy it as much.So I'll try to be concise about why this film is good without going overboard with my review:It's a home invasion film. Nothing more, nothing lessAs with all heavily 'genre-d' films such as rom-coms, there has to be a unique premise for the film and with home invasions, the reason the home is being invaded is the unique factorThere is genuine tension in the filmI liked the family but there could have been more character development in the beginning... but do we really care? Well, yes because the more you know and care about the family, the more tense it will be but it doesn't let the film downThere was maybe one moment where I groaned out loud at a dumb thing a character did, but for the rest of the film the characters were allowed to make realistic decisions and not be idiots like in other films (you know, where someone does something no-one would ever do in real life just to set up the next scene)Not all elements of the ending were predictableThis was a fun and entertaining way to spend less than an hour and half, just go in with the knowledge that it's home invasion with a new, interesting premise. That's all.My vote, 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally wastes itself from potential greatness,"Thought to be safely locked away in their homes, a man and his family find themselves under attack by a gang of criminals seeking them during a legally sanctioned night of depravity, murder and mayhem and forces them to fight back.This was a really lame suspense/thriller since hardly anything actually happens here until the final ten minutes. Most of this is spent with the family trying to prepare for the actual event and actually watching around the other actions of the night. That it then becomes a frustratingly interminable sequence of events about the family searching throughout the house for the wanted individual makes for a long, boring series of scenes that do nothing but showcase how large and dark the house is without any sense of pacing or tension as it just winds through it's paces until the inevitable conclusion with the house attack. This does make for some fun times with the different brawling and gunfights that take place throughout the living room and kitchen where they come under attack by the criminal gang. All of this is rendered moot, though, under two of the most laughably inept motives behind the film which is the sheer stupidity of the central premise that it rests on and the ineptness of it's execution. The fact that society would devolve so greatly as to await a yearly-appointed time of day when criminal activity would be legally rendered and expunged from their conscious makes no sense at all for it wouldn't be needed in the matter it shows off here for citizens would be wary of further repercussions on that night and would eventually render the need for the particular night moot on the second or third year of it's inception. That this features such a group of whacked-out individuals as these guys shown here who are clearly in it for the legalized murder rewards and have very little that shows them to be normal citizens on every other night of the year completely takes away the scare factor of them who just turn into mindless yackos without much thought. Seemingly this is a commentary on the violence in everyday society but whatever the cause it fails mightily under the inept execution because they never are seen to do anything other than chase the one individual. Rather than partaking in this night of glorious excess, they stand around lamely prancing away on the front-yard because of an ultimatum issued that ruins their credibility when they should've just barged in and taken over the way the plot really should've dictated they do. That might've generated a scary tale here but instead it turns into a lame thriller for an hour with about ten minutes of actual horror and that's not a worthwhile balance.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Purge,"Purge , lets see the tittle of the movie tells the story that its about releasing hatred, bad intentions on people, by killing people.The story was nice, the idea was also nice.Screenplay wasn't good at all. It could have been really good by far. Some points in the movie were just non- sense. Really i couldn't understand them at all. Like why does the kid lets the man inside. Though, man was calling for help but the by knew he could get his and his family life in danger. The boy at first should have told his dad, but he didn't. Then the group of people after the man, when asking James to return the man or they will kill him, his family with the black guy, he agreed to give him the guy, but his son Charlie still didn't wanted to return the black guy, its just ridiculous considering the situation. On the other hand the boyfriend of James daughter Zoey, sneaked into home just before lock-down when the family was at dinner met Zoey in her bedroom and told her that he was going to talk to his dad about their relationship. Zoey being so foolish not noticing that, why on annual purge did his boyfriend wanting to see her dad? And tried to kill Zoey's father but got himself killed by his father. In the end their neighbor's saved them from the group of young boys and girls and wanted to kill the family themselves. So, that they can purge by killing them. I mean that didn't their neighbor's purge by killing the young boys and girls? According to me it was a waste of time by me watching the movie. Not a good movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Without a doubt, the stupidest plot concept of 2014","This isn't a horrible film. It's competently shot, somewhat competently (if distractedly) acted, and the sound is good, in that the dialog actually syncs most of the time with the actors' lips.But the problem I had seeing it, which started during the first explanatory minutes and again every seven or eight minutes thereafter, is the nagging voice in my head asking, now WHY did they decide to have this Purge night again? Did responsible political leaders actually decide this was a good idea and did the media and majority of citizens actually go along?""Hey honey, see this? They're going to make rape and murder legal for one night of the year and on that night the police won't come if you call them"".""That's nice, dear. Be sure to pick up a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs on the way home tonight"".Honestly, I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when this was pitched to studio execs. Ethan Hawke tries to enjoy himself a bit, but by the end, you get the overall impression that he's got a similar voice in his head asking what went wrong with his career that he has to do this nonsense. He made a couple of decent movies, right? Usually, you get a halfway decent concept and poor execution. This is the worst plot concept of at least this year (which is only 2/3 done!), but it's not horrible if you're able to sufficiently numb the part of your brain that handles logic and reason you may find yourself suitably stimulated by the movement and color and sound, like a baby with one of those hanging musical mobile toys. I mean, this plot is so bad, they couldn't even convince a rapper to play some small part like in most current movies. You know when 50-Cent thinks the plot is too implausible to make some easy money, you've got a stinker on your hands.Go see it when it comes for less than $5 at the revival houses or stream it from your favorite service.

The mother and the son are just stupid and almost got the entire family killed.The entire premise from the get go is interesting, but the execution is not great. Why did all the villains dress up?

Creepiest idea on the planet,"As the trailer shows: This movie takes what is in your mind as far as the worst possible horror scenario and puts it to the screen.

But let's take it a bit further... what if acting on these horrible behaviors was not only legal but it was ACTUALLY YOUR CIVIC DUTY?"" What would happen then? Would innocents die? Would the population greatly decrease? Would people be permanently disfigured? Psychologically harmed forever? Do people actually STOP cold when those Purge Sirens sound again to alert it's all over? Maybe...and maybe not. I think you will just have to watch the movie to find out. That is what the trailer tells you to do so I did it. I was surprised at the twists and turns. Without giving away any of this story's actual plot, it circles around a family as the trailer shows. It's extremely well acted and the characters are well rounded and you're quickly gripped and dragged in. It isn't a movie you can watch without stopping, getting up and regrouping, mentally.

A Very Good Movie,"If you're looking for a bloody gore-fest like Saw or Hostel, then maybe this isn't the right movie; but The Purge is definitely worth watching.Although it's not the most unpredictable movie I've ever seen, it did surprise me once or twice. Mostly, though, The Purge was less terrifying and more unsettling - scary because I didn't find any of it far fetched. It shows the sadistic nature that we all fear the people around us have inside. Other than being set a short bit in the future, I had no problem imagining myself and my family in the situations presented in the plot. I also enjoyed Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke, both of whom did a fine job of portraying parents who are thinking only of their family's safety.Moreover, at certain points The Purge genuinely left me unsure what the moral course of action would be. How far would I go to protect my family? It may not be a political documentary, but this movie definitely made me think. There are a few moments if you listen, where the economic climate of the time plays a part.As an aside, I don't recommend taking your dog for a late night walk after watching The Purge.

A great concept that fell short because of failure to be creative,"Let me start off by saying, I have never seen a good plot develop in a film that's only an hour and 25 minutes long. It's just not possible. This was ultimately The Purge's major downfall.With such a creative idea came a bit of story development for the beginning of the film, which took a decent chunk of time. By the time that we had a plot going, the movie was nearly over. They got a few jumps and scares in, and before we knew it, the movie had ended.To put it simply, the writers came up with a brilliant idea for the movie. However, once they introduced the storyline of ""The Purge"", the creativity was thrown out, and we just started watching another typical home invasion movie, similar to ""The Strangers"". After the commencement of The Purge began, all fun ideas were shot out the window, and we were left with a typical scary movie.Thankfully, it was the film's only fault (although that is a HUGE fault). The acting was decent. The scares and the action were quite enjoyable. There were quite a few moments where the audience screamed and shouted and even cheered for the characters. However, when the credits started rolling, I could tell people felt cheated that the film didn't bring as much originality as expected.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Murder legal for 12 hours. Done. The previews painted the picture of a family in a battle of wits to survive a night of legal freedom. Instead, your given a boring yawn that annoys instead of intrigues. The clichés alone will make you roll your eyes to the point of nausea. It's predictable. So predictable that I felt I was watching a Friday the 13th movie. The ending actually made me yell at the screen, along with most of the theater. I understand your trying to raise some moral questions in me, but you need to let me figure out for myself what i would do, instead of forcing morals down my throat. If the goal of the purge is to rid the streets of the poor, why not just gather them all up and let people kill them off once a week? The ""prayor"" they said every time they were about to make a kill was annoying, it served really no purpose. Like I said, this movie annoyed more than it intrigued.

Eye Opener At Least For Me!,"The Purge was a very good film IMO. Not exactly what you'd expect but engrossing to say the least. One thing about the whole idea of letting society at large have one night to just ""do what thou wilt"" that bugs me is this : Do you think you can just shut it off after that? Human nature IMO does not operate that way. A ""Purge Night"" would be somewhat like Pandora's Box and we would never be able to shut the lid again. Ethan Hawke has grown so much since he was that shy boy in ""Dead Poet's Society"" (remember that?). Lena Headey manages to make you forget her role in ""Game Of Thrones"" as well. Talented cast.

The Purge just falls short,"I really wanted this movie to be good. I thought conceptually it was different than anything studios have put out in a long time.

Sadly this movie falls short on just about every level. There's a really bland undertone of social commentary regarding the wealthy and homeless, have's and have nots etc. That really just doesn't go anywhere, it felt like the writers slipped a little bit in so people wouldn't bitch about the concept. The main villain reminds me of an intellectual, rich kid version of Jason Mewes, which isn't terrifying on any level. Finally (just like Hollywood does) they try to throw in a twist followed by another shittier twist that doesn't do anything for this film.

Doesn't build to much,"Seems there's a lot of films coming our way from the makers of ""Insidious"" and ""Sinister."" Both of which I loved.

Where all violence in society has been completely stopped, because its legal for one night of the year to do whatever the heck you like, including murder!

Its beginnings give the feeling that they're setting up something great. Only when the good stuff comes, its disappointingly cut short, and what could have been an action packed finale, is replaced with one that tries way to hard to be clever, with its obvious twists.There are a couple of genuinely edge of your seat moments in this thriller, but its short running time, and creepy mask wearing bad-guys (Hasn't that creepy mask thing been done to death already?) don't do it any favours.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visceral, Intense Film!","I think ""The Purge"" is great! It's amazingly, incredibly dark. And, you have to be okay with that. So, it's a polarizing film. But, if you are on board, you can really get into it and find it visceral and intense. I did.This film is a button pusher, and it's intended to be. It wants to challenge you with the possibility of what would happen if humanity went to its darkest place. And, with the premise of ""The Annual Purge,"" it does that. What fascinated me is that the film took that premise even further that I thought it would. When seeing it, I thought it was basically going to be a relatively standard home invasion movie.But, it's really about challenging both the characters and the audience with the notion of what would you do in the situations presented? And, the answers become increasingly more fascinating, at least to me. And, that is what made the movie for me, a writer/director who was highly skilled and could make you really feel what it was like in that house. I completely believed what was going on, and that is absolutely key to the film's success.And, it isn't easy to do that. Especially in film, where too much can be spelled out for you, creating a sense of terror and dread is highly difficult. But, it happens here, and it works! Hats off to that filmmaker, James DeMonaco for creating the world this film inhabits.This isn't for everyone, obviously, but if you are ready for a film that is thrilling, but challenging, you could like it as much as I did!******** (8 Out of 10 Stars)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Purge...0.5 out of 4 Skittles,"Sometimes you hear the description of a movie before you see it and wonder how such a dumb concept could actually be made into a real movie.

Every now and then a movie will surprise you and find a way to get past its ridiculous concept and deliver a great-underrated movie. The Purge is NOT one of those movies.This movie is dumb. Really dumb. In a future world where everything is wonderful unemployment and crime are at an all-time low, and it's all credited to the Purgea once a year holiday when all crime is legal. Dumb!Somehow the audience is supposed to buy into the rational that the government will allow you to go out and kill anyone you want once a year, and that this will give everyone a release from their built up stress and allow them to be on their best behavior the other 364 days. Dumb!Even if the audience were to somehow go along with the idiotic premise and forget that most murders are committed in the heat of passion and not from careful premeditated planning, they still have to get past the scriptwhich is heavily flawed with convenient plot points at every turn, filled with gaping holes and overall weak. Writer/Director James DeMonaco forces the audience to be as dumb as his movieat least those who want to try and enjoy it.It's also sad to see Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Sinister) in his douchiest role to date. It's hard to watch Hawke go from a brilliant performance in this summer's Before Midnight, to pathetic swill in this one. He obviously thought there was something profound in the turd of a screenplayand nobody else can be blamed for his choice.The Purge is a dumb concept with a flawed script and plays as a really weak movie trying to disguise itself as something deep. The Purge is a waste of time, money and brain cells.For more quick spoiler free reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful,"This movie had so much potential to be great... However the ball was dropped. I can't really go in to specifics without spoiling the movie for whoever wants to see it (don't waste your time). Hopefully a few years from now it will be remade and done right. The antagonists were spot on, I wouldn't want to see anything different from how they were portrayed but the family that was targeted was just so awful that it seemed like a second thought even though without them there really wouldn't be any focus for the movie. I've never really taken the time to write a review for a movie but this one was so bad in my book I felt I needed to say something.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"We should purge ""The Purge.""","I have never been so upset in my life after watching a movie. I was mad for the rest of the night. Not worth the watch, the time, or the money. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this movie. The beginning was great and then towards the middle to end was just almost unbearable for me to watch. I cannot believe there is such a movie as this that exists. I don't even know if the actors wanted to act in this movie because it was such a horrible movie. I personally would get upset as a character, especially if I was one of those dumb characters. I never bothered to write a review for movies before until I saw this movie -- that says a lot. If you do watch this movie, you will cringe in your seat as you see how ridiculous this movie is. I am so upset that I don't even know what to say anymore but just do not watch this movie at all. Save all that you have and are to not watch this movie. You will be thanking me and your future self because this movie is horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Un-Realism dominates yet another movie,"In hindsight the concept of the movie was different. The trailers point to another creepy slasher movie involving a defenseless family who put up a fight for their survival. Let me tell you this, this movie sucked. Why didn't i just stop watching it? because i paid $22 dollars in movie tickets for myself and my girlfriend and i hate to intentionally throw away money.The realism of this movie comes into serious question when the characters do the dumbest things. I get it, its a movie but c'mon, you don't have to be in certain situations to know ""holy F i don't just confront several armed people or it will just get me killed!"", Jesus!The ending is just the F'ing worst. This is one those particular times when you say F your morals and double F forgiveness. Harsh? maybe but i'm sure many would have done things differently when placed in that same situation.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
