Not as bad as the reviews say,"Knowing is one of Nicholas Cage's lesser films, that's true, but it's nearly as bad as the majority of the critics reviews. Knowing is a science fiction film starring Nicolas Cage and Rose Byrne. The plot surrounds children who are able to tell when the worlds most horrific disasters and atrocities happened. Figuring out how these kids know these things and what the numbers mean is really what the entire movie is about. The performances are pretty good from the two leads. Byrne and Cage both turn in believable performances. I think that the script was average, the writers did their job, it's nothing spectacular but it suffices. The idea of the movie was very interesting and it's executed well for the most part. There are some parts of the movie that do feel kind of lackluster but they pale in comparison to the ending and how interesting it turns out to be. Some people said they thought the ending was too weird and random but I think it was unexpected and cool. And I think the way in which it ended gave the film a meaning. Overall yes I would recommend Knowing, it's not one I'd go to automatically when recommending films to people but I would say it's a fairly interesting watch. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I feel like this movie had cutting edge cgi for 2009. The last ten minutes dropped this from what could have possibly been a 7 if I was feeling generous. No one will ever read this.

What if everything's not just meaningless chance?,"A disillusioned professor in the Boston area (Nicolas Cage) acquires a document that has successfully predicted tragedies for the last fifty years, but new ones as well (!).

Alex Proyas's doomsday piece boasts a chock full of interesting concepts and sleek special effects to make up its fundamentally flawed climax,"This science-fiction thrill piece starring Nicolas Cage in the protagonist role is a film blooming with brainy concepts on science and religion, while hanging over apocalyptic themes that pay reminiscence of other end-of-the-world flicks like 'Left Behind'. After all, the key figure in the story is revolves around what appears be a biblical prophecy, although the spiritial theme only serves as a small undertone here rather than driving the storyline. Director Alex Proyas, the father of projects such as 'Dark City' and 'I, Robot', exhibits his grandeur of visual stimulating style that manages to triumph over its compelling, if somewhat flawed plot. Proyas is successful at making the thought-provoking ideas work, even if they are occasionally little rocky. The only major flaw is lies in the final act that borders on the line of preposterous. It is not a groundbreaking piece of work for the genre, but it is just enough to warrant for a sweet recommendation. This film opens up in 1959, at an elementary school where children are given the assignment to draw pictures of what society will like fifty years from that time. One girl, Lucinda Embrey (played by Lara Robinson), draws a long series of seemingly random numbers and places the paper in the school's time capsule. Flash forward to fifty years later, a nine-year old Caleb Koestler (played by Chandler Canterbury) and his class open up the time capsule, and Lucinda's paper is found in his hands. When he shows the paper to his widowed father John (played by Nicolas Cage), an astrophysics professor at Massachutes Institute of Technology, John believes the numbers are enigmatic codes to disasters occurring around the globe. Enlisting the help of Lucinda's daughter Diana (played by Rose Byrne) and granddaughter Abby (also played by Lara Robinson), John must encrypt the message of what seems to be a sign of a global catastrophic event.Some may question whether Alex Proyas is trying to deliver a cautionary tale about an apocalyptic prophecy or is pinning viewers with complex ideas of science and religious theology. Both are more than likely doubtful, especially when the plot shows little respect for the laws of science to begin with. Nonetheless, it keeps things deeply eerie and grim in terms of storytelling and tone, almost bordering the line of a psychological horror thriller. Caleb and Abby are children who are haunted by mysterious entities, resembling the alien creatures from 'Dark City', who introduce them to terrifying visions of the world facing mass destruction, an eerie, yet shocking concept that is placed with sweet visual spark in one scene where the former looks out his window and sees the forest engulfed in flames. The main protagonist in the story however, is John Koestler who is infused with a performance by Nicolas Cage that can only be described as acceptable, but not bad. When Koestler learns of the terrifying secrets behind Lucinda's prophetic message, that is when the story kicks into gear, allowing Proyas to experiment with his engaging concepts. His attempts at breathing life into his ideas are mostly successful and set room for some visually electrifying sequences such as devastating plane crash that leaves several victims flailing in flames and a subway crash that racks up an enormous death toll. However, the third act, which is predictable and sets up with heavy emotional sigma, is a little absurd; especially if how unrealistic the characters behave to such an unnerving situation that is on the horizon. Shouldn't they be more terrified? On the bright side, the audience is blessed with a riveting score by Marco Beltrami to settle the tone.Knowing is a compelling doomsday-themed piece with a chock of interesting ideas of science and religion put into play, and a surprisingly enthralling execution by Alex Proyas who brings his powerful visual grandeur to the game. It is a flawed picture with an execution may have a few scars, but not enough to make it a sore to sit through. Don't expect it to be anything revolutionary.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Clever and well done.,"This movie was a nice surprise. I usually don't like Nicholas Cage movies. Any of them. But he was perfectly cast for this science fiction piece and delivered a solid, believable performance.The story itself was brand new, not a rehash of any tale that I can recall.The directing allowed you to see the film without knowing until the very end what was happening - which was great. I usually enjoy figuring out the end before it gets there, because it usually seems that if I CAN'T figure it out... the movie is poor. That has been my experience. But Knowing delivered a solid mystery up to the end, with the type of finale where one thinks, ""Oh, I should have seen it coming, those 100 things that happened all make sense!"" Really, all the little details came together in a flash of a solid closing.I also appreciated that there were no loose ends. Everything was tied together in a neat bow with nothing hanging out.The only negative that I have will sound humorous to you if you don't see the movie, but I won't spoil it for you except to say that the metaphor of a pair of bunnies wasn't necessary.Catch this movie when you can, it's definitely worth it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","The good: Strong start to the movie, the plot hooks you in, excellent sound, confronting disaster scenes, haunting images, Rose Byrne, at times quite freaky, The Bad: Special effects looked like they were from a video game, ripped off basically every science fiction movie ever made, poor acting from Nic Cage, very predictable.The Ugly: Last third of movie was shamefully ridiculous.Summary: If you are a science fiction fan, you will probably not be able to resist seeing this movie. Be warned, you will think you are seeing the sci-fi great that you have been waiting for but mid way the film gets lost. You may very well groan out loud at the ending.

Why all the hate?,"I know it's a bit late for a review but I feel compelled to reply to some of the criticism leveled at this movie. The reviews tend to be based on a few mistaken assumptions.1) The movie is pro scientology propagandaIf there is any truth to this then the propaganda is very obscure, as a quick reference to scientology symbols does not include the 7 pointed star as per one detractor. To state that the movie uses a numerical based prophesy and that this is indicative of scientology is conspiratorial and nonsensical. Both the bible and koran are full of them. Maybe I am too ingenuous but at no time did I feel I was being led along a path of conscription to scientology.2) plot holes due to slim chances of a text fortuitously falling into the hands of a person intelligent enough to decipher the meaning and be the father of one of the chosen survivors and have the descendants of the original prophecy play a part in the fruition of the plan.fair enough, but nobody seems to question as to why the prophesy itself is possible. Surely if the universe was deterministic, as suggested by the very presence of a prophecy, then a sufficiently advanced civilization able to foresee the prophecy would also be able to foresee the path they have subscribed to the resolution they have decided on.3) The movie doesn't make sense or jumps around too much.Fortunately there are many straight forward shows and cartoons to watch instead .",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Anti-Armageddon, as far as Michael Bay goes","I feel a strange shift of priorities within moviegoers today, when a movie like District 9 can use very familiar content and simply shake it around a little, and then be hailed as a masterwork of originality and become immensely popular - while a movie like Knowing will be heavily questioned and criticized beyond it's proportions despite, or perhaps due to, the fact that it actually takes an actual leap of originality. I wonder when the latest time it was I saw a Hollywood-movie end up where this one ends up. While not being perfect, Knowing still is a proper science-fiction film in the vein of 2001 - A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Certainly not as good, for various reasons, but at least clearly part of the genre.The storyline of Knowing is kind of a reversed bottle neck, by the end the multitude of the story is as big as it gets but to begin with, we are in a kind of X Files territory where we get a spooky prologue with a mystery note being dug under the ground (I won't go into the details, because it's really not important for me to go over them) and post credits we pick it up 50 years later when the note ends up in the hands of MIT professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) who is one of those I-lost-my-wife-so-I-lost-my-faith kind of guys, believing that the universe as we know it is all random and coincidental. Easily cracked, the numbers on the note, written by a little girl and buried for five decades, declare the dates and places of all future disasters to come, including death tolls. Cage sees 9/11 predicted from this little girls hands in 1959, as well as the Katrina and several disasters that haven't taken place yet. Without saying too much, he doesn't like what he sees at the end of the list of numbers.I have heard the movie be called predictable. Looking back, I must admit there's a lot of places where I could have seen a lot of things coming. Many quite blatant clues are placed right in the very first couple of scenes and if you know your plot and character mechanics, you would spot some obligatory scenes to come. However, I didn't. It seems I was in on the ride. The plot of the movie, I think, expands in such a methodical way that as long as you get sucked in to begin with, you don't ask any more questions. The mystery is intriguing enough to have you focus on the next shot, not the overall story. I was fairly annoyed by the story device that was seemingly on the side of the plot, dealing with Cage's kid being stalked by a couple of evil, albino trench-coat-guys looking like a bunch German electro-goths. I found that they distracted the viewer from the more interesting, down-to-earth kind of story going on with Cage. But come the ending of the movie, nothing is really earthbound and they seem kind of forgivable in retrospect. Just like in Close Encounters, Knowing is a movie that starts out cryptic but ends out in big scale cathartic satisfaction and harmony, as if it all (*all*) makes sense in the end.As for the flaws, I didn't mind the story or any of the plot holes (which mostly are arguable anyway). What did bother me probably more than anything else about the movie, though, was it's unfortunate big-time flirt with the melodrama. Take the score for instance, by Marco Beltrami, not really king of the subtle, and it's unfortunate for a movie which deals with this unusual hypothesis to have such operatic and stereotypical acting. And why, WHY, do Hollywood-movies nowadays feel the need to use those HORRIBLE matte paintings? They look like a 50's parody! As for plot, Knowing certainly bites off a lot more than it can chew. I quickly noted in the credits, with fear, that while the story credit went to one person there were like three or four guys behind the actual script. That usually means what we also get in Knowing. Messy conflicts within the narrative and sudden ""moronic behavior as plot device"" from characters. Also, not every mystery thread thrown up on the floor ends up with a sensible conclusion. But despite a lot ends up as fairly arbitrary anyway, I think a lot of the questions are meant to be left unanswered. Knowing picks up a lot of ancient SF-ideas, that probably would seem tired if this genre had been over-represented in any way, and at the end of the day, you didn't ask the monkey in 2001 how he figured out how to use that piece of bone, right? In all fairness, the movie is partly a thriller so it needs certain plot devices in order for the it to have a good spook value which, I might add, it surely delivers. This is the kind of movie that creeps you out just by having a character flip a bed on to it's side. I'm not sure if these abandoned mysteries is a giant flaw or just one of those things you can roll with, but I know that it makes sure it doesn't reach the top. Knowing is a movie made I'd say for 80% entertainment, and I could say I was 80% entertained. The remaining 20% is sci-fi fodder and that made me happy too. No masterpiece then, but a good ride that I certainly will recommend.Also. I get the feeling that a lot of people who dismissed Knowing this summer were the same guys who were angry at the Bay bashers of Transformers 2. I wonder, why on Earth are the flaws of Transformers 2 forgivable, whereas the strengths of Knowing dismissible?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pythagorus As Nostradamus.,"Knowing is directed by Alex Proyas and collectively written by Ryne Douglas Pearson, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White. It stars Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne, Chandler Canterbury, Lara Robinson, Ben Mendelsohn and Nadia Townsend. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Simon Duggan.1959, and young schoolgirl Lucinda Embry (Robinson) keeps hearing voices. When asked to submit a drawing for the school time capsule– that's to be opened in 50 years time,– she writes a series of random numbers that don't appear to make sense. Forward to 50 years and the grand opening of the capsule, where Professor Jonathan Koestler (Cage) and his young son come by way of Lucinda's numbers. Just what do they mean? If anything?...Ah yes, the good old disaster movie, a genre of film that continues unabated through the decades, this in spite of critical indifference. But the paying public still keep turning up in droves, even in this new technological age. Where once was models being destroyed, and paintings forming elegant backdrops, now is whizz bangery that costs a fortune. Still great fun, though, which is why something like Knowing exists and has many fans.It's a splendid piece of sci-fi hokum pulsing with supernatural overtones, a gentle creeper unravelling the mystery in layers until the final countdown begins. The science is obviously dubious (it's a movie folks) and the air of pessimism that hovers consistently over proceedings (not only is the world in trouble, but all the protags have miserable issues as well), may be too much for some. However, Cage is as committed as ever, Proyas yet again proves himself a beautiful visualist, while the scenes of carnage are truly harrowing and unforgettable.A popcorner with moments of wonder and awe, and yes of course, some cheese as well. Ignore the Cage haters, if you like sci-fi infused disaster movies and haven't had fun with this one yet, then do so, it's a blast. And did I say it's gorgeous to look at as well?

An enjoyable film. (NO SPOILERS),I like these types of films and enjoyed this one as well. Its not the best film of this type I have seen but its still worth watching.Basically The main character who is played by Nicolas Cage has a son and one day he brings home a sheet of paper with a load of numbers on it. He got the sheet of paper from a time capsule that was buried 50 odd years previously by students who went to the same school. Cage is fascinated by this and discovers the numbers point to previous disasters that have happened throughout the world. He then realises some of the numbers point towards possible future disasters. I wont say any more as its best to watch the film.The plot itself is relativity strong but does have a few minor flaws. There is a fair amount of mystery and action in the film as well.I would recommend this film especially for people who like films such as 2012 or the day after tomorrow.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth Seeing  Before the End!,"From the trailers of Knowing you'd be convinced that you're going to watch a cheesy, try to save the world picture with a wound tight Nicolas Cage at the center gritting his teeth and ducking his way to the perfect ending. Well, you'd be partially correct. Cage is definitely giving his wound tight hero routine that he's worked so hard to develop over the last half dozen films. As for the cheese factor, that's where you'll be surprised. Director Alex Proyas manages to deliver a rather decent sci-fi flick that has plenty of suspense and intelligence.The plot turns around John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), an MIT astrophysics nerd turned Indiana Jones when a time capsule is discovered at his young son Caleb's (Chandler Canterbury) school. Inside are drawings from students in 1959 predicting what things would be like in 2009 some 50 years later. The drawing that Caleb comes home with isn't a drawing at all but a series of seemingly random numbers. Koestler becomes obsessed with the numbers and their meaning or what they seem to mean. The whole thing shakes him to his scientific core and a quest has begun.The film is very lucky to have director Alex Proyas from films such as Dark City which is his true geek film and critical acclaim as well as I, Robot and Garage Days. The visual and special effects are outstanding. It was surprising how much suspense was in the script (Ryan Douglas Pearson and Juliet Snowden) which gave the film a real thriller atmosphere which continues to build in tone as the mystery is unraveled.I admit I went into this film expecting a rehash of National Treasure on a more global scale. The sci-fi aspect of the premise is very well thought out and told. The acting by co-stars (Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne and Lara Robinson) are solid performances and stand in complementary contrast to that of the tightly wound Nicolas Cage. The geek factor of Knowing is rather high with lots of number configurations and what-if scenarios which is great for the sci-fi fans. At times your brain may have to turn on in order to follow the film, but that is what made Knowing such a pleasant surprise to me.*",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kind of similar to 'The Box' (if that's any help),"I know that nowadays the name 'Nicolas Cage' is met with either a smirk or a sigh, depending on how you view him. His recent movies have hardly set the Box Office on fire (most being released straight to DVD or streaming service) and it's hard to remember a time when he was A-list material and capable of selling a movie on his name alone. However, there was a brief period in between his blockbusters and his, er, 'lesser' films where he made some which were actually pretty good - and yet still seems to have been forgotten. 'Knowing' is definitely one of them.Cage is also well known for his own brand of 'over-acting' which can be anything from comical to cringe-worthy. Here, director Alex Proyas seems to be able to reel him in enough to capitalise on his talent, while at the same time keep him grounded. Cage plays a school teacher who, along with his young son, stumbles on a code back from the fifties which accurately depicts all the major disasters of the last few decades. If this wasn't creepy enough, some are set to occur in the next few days and there are some odd-looking men lurking around his family.I won't go into the plot too much for fear of spoilers because, I really do think that if you're into science-fiction then you'll really enjoy this one. It's got some nice ideas and isn't afraid to go in directions that you might not see coming.Cage is still great as a leading man and I've been a fan of director Alex Proyas' work ever since he did 'The Crow.' This may not have the visual flare of some of his early work, but he deserves props for getting a really good performance out of his leading man.If the film has a weakness I'd say its special effects are a little uneven. I was actually really impressed with some of them and they left me pretty creeped out. However, it looks like the 'effects budget' was spent on the big set pieces and when it came to some of the 'lesser' effects (mainly involving fire) they look very 'computery' - if you know what I mean.There's another 'forgotten' sci-fi film called 'The Box,' starring Cameron Diaz and directed by 'Donnie Darko's' Richard Kelly which feels like it could be set in 'the same universe' as 'Knowing.' So, if you have seen 'The Box' (and again - don't believe the negative reviews - it's actually pretty good for some dark sci-fi drama) and you liked it, definitely give 'Knowing' a try. It may not be a 'feel-good' movie, but if you're in the mood for some dark sci-fi, or just a Cage fan, give it a go.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
And in the end...,"What has happened to Alex Proyas? Back in the '90s, he directed dark, edgy pieces of sci-fi/horror, like The Crow and Dark City, that didn't necessarily pander to studio or audience expectations. Nowadays, he's gone in exactly the opposite direction, first with the fun but uneven Will Smith vehicle I, Robot (which doesn't have much in common with Asimov, despite the title) and now with the Nicolas Cage-starring Knowing. Entirely bad it ain't, but boy, does it struggle from time to time.Cage plays a physics professor at MIT, named John Koestler, who teaches students about the notion of determinism, i.e. the theory that everything is part of a precise, already established plan. The irony is that he doesn't believe any of that stuff since his wife died in a tragic accident, leaving him alone with his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). One day, something special occurs at Caleb's school: a time capsule, which was buried fifty years earlier, is unearthed so that the new generation can see what kids thought the future would look like back then. Instead of a drawing, Caleb ends up with a page containing a bizarre sequence of numbers. John takes a look at the sequence, and quickly (?) realizes that the numbers represent the dates and body count of every major disaster of the last five decades, including 9/11, Katrina and - big surprise - the death of the missus. Three of the predictions, however, have yet to come true, so John must find a way to prevent them from happening. Additionally, he has to deal with a group of weird-looking people who are interested in Caleb.If it all sounds a bit familiar, that's because it is: while the story develops on its own terms, the premise alone, coupled with the creepy atmosphere, could come from an episode of The X-Files. In case the similarities weren't clear enough, the writers have even replicated the Mulder-Scully dynamic in the shape of John and his reluctant partner Diana (Rose Byrne) and added the inevitable religious subtext, which is hinted at from the very beginning (John's dad is a preacher). Also, the Strangers look kind of... In short, it's the sense of déjà vu that brings down most of Knowing: the third act is very easy to guess, the father/son relationship is sketchy, yada yada yada.And yet Proyas manages to get some things admirably right: the tension is actually pretty consistent, with a few professionally delivered jump-scares along the way, and the visual effects are state-of-the-art, most notably in the impressive central set-piece which - a true stroke of genius, this one - is depicted in a single, continuous shot. Additionally, Cage's performance is one of his most convincing in quite some time. Okay, so it's not that difficult given his recent body of work includes the likes of The Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Next, but his portrayal of a man who questions his beliefs (there we go again) adds some emotional weight to the picture. And that's without mentioning the refreshingly merciless conclusion...Knowing is nothing new, meaning that the few unexpected elements it contains are rapidly sidelined by textbook scripting. Still, even on an off-day Proyas manages to pull off a collection of oddly compelling images (Cage's hair not included). Not quite enough, but we already sort of knew that, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Meaty, 7/10","I can't decide between a 7 or an 8 for this. As soon as it ended I was kinda angry at it, but the more I think about it, the more I've made peace with the movie.As usual, Nicolas Cage is great, and everyone else is good. The story is interesting, with a great premise that made me really interested to see what would happen.The film gets all its 'non stop deadly action' scenes over with pretty quickly, so I was unsure how they were going to spend the rest of the running time. I needn't have worried though, because there are a couple of bonkers twists that kept my attention.Speaking of twists, I really was not impressed with part of the ending at first. I was confused about it, but after a bit of thinking I am more OK with it. However I will say, that the use of Beethoven's 7th symphony at the end is absolutely brilliant.Ultimately, I can't take too many points off for the ending, because this film has convinced me of something that I've suspected for a while.Some films are impossible to end in a satisfactory way.I think disaster movies in particular are susceptible to this, but there are some stories that are built up in such a way that no ending would properly conclude it. The ending to this film left me a bit unsatisfied, but if it had ended any other way, it would've been just as disappointing. There's no twist that could live up to the direction the story was going in.Overall, this was a pretty enjoyable movie with an interesting story, and a shocking ending that I think people will be conflicted on, although I'm pretty sure that was inevitable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good dark film - fan of pyros,"I thought this was arguably one of the best movies of our time. With that said, I've gotta admit I'm a scifi movie lover and these movies are my kinda thing.This movie literally had everything I typically LOVE in a movie, a great beginning, a thriller climax, and a killer ending. There were no plot holes to this film, which initially made me love this movie in the first place. One thing I love about this movie has to be after I watch it a couple of times- I actually notice little hidden things in the climax that ultimately lead up to the ending, things you don't typically notice when you first watch this movie.Those who love the indie film-type endings, or those who love horror or slasher films, or actually anyone who likes cliff-hanger endings- this might not be for you. But if you love apocalypse type movies, or are a thriller fanatic then you'll hopefully like this movie. This movie also supports the Christian/Catholic faith- so if you are against it in any way- this movie may not suit you. With that said, it's NOT a Jesus loving movie. The ending has a lot to do with the Christian faith and if that's not for you- don't watch it.All in all, this is a pretty spectacular movie. The music was on cue with everything in the movie and the scenes were incredible. Each scene had you gripping onto your seat in anticipation.

Sc-fi Classic: A blockbuster for thinking people,"Nicholas Cage's son receives a series of numbers from a 1950s time capsule that a psychic girl wrote 50 years earlier, which predict major disasters in the future.Big budget sci-fi, which must be commended for its consistent downbeat tone and lack of histrionics. Normally, a Hollywood blockbuster would have the hero knowing all the answers and riding in to save the day. Can Nic Cage do it, and how? The lack of predictability is its major strength. His understated performances were made for this film.If you're in the right mood, you must see this. I've seen this film 8 or 9 times, and it's only been out 9 years, so it must be doing something right. Even when I know every line of the film it still drags you in each time it pops up on tv.Yes, there are some cheesy moments, with some obvious CGI, and the middle third loses track somewhat, but the relentlessly downbeat tone shows what can be done with the right budget. In earlier viewings I thought it was a bit of a mish mash of genres, although still great, but subsequent viewings reveal the relevance of each plot development.Overall, highly recommended.

"Not as Good as Ebert Says, But Good Nonetheless","A professor of astrophysics (Nicolas Cage) stumbles upon a complex series of numbers that predicts natural disasters and even more amazingly how many people will die in them. Now he sees it as his job to save those who would perish, but is his role already factored into the equation? Can he change the future or only be a part of it?Let us start off by addressing Nic Cage's bad acting. There are exceptions, such as ""Adaptation"", but generally if you want a quality acting performance you don't call upon Nicolas Cage. He somehow sells movies, often even action flicks (""National Treasure"", ""Con Air"", ""Face/Off""), but can be unreliable. He's like a slightly less goony Jeff Goldblum in many respects. That being said, Cage does a fine job in ""Knowing""... so maybe he's finally got a handle on his skills.Roger Ebert loved this film and gave it four stars, if the cover of the box is to be believed. I generally have a high respect for Ebert, and can usually see his points. On this occasion, I'm not completely sure I do. I haven't read the full review, which would probably explain more, but this was not a four star film. Two and a half, maybe. Despite many great things -- the acting, the general plot, the decent effects -- it is a flawed film and sort of needs patching. To put it in the ""four star"" category is insulting to other films there.I loved the cinematography and think they took lessons from ""Children of Men"". One scene featuring a plane crash was very well done with the ""camera-in-tow"" method and lack of cuts. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this in films, though I'm still torn on the shakiness that tends to accompany it.As I say, the film is not flawless. I don't know much about science or astrophysics, so I can't comment on the accuracy of those parts. However, I do object to the idea that determinism says everything happens for a reason. Determinism may say everything has a cause, but to say it has a ""reason"" implies a meaning behind it, which is simply not true. Things may or may not have a meaning, but determinists are not all in agreement on that point. So, if that was what the film was suggesting, I disagree.I also object to the use of putting the opening credits over a still background rather than during the opening scene. To keep the pace moving and the film a shorter length, this could have been changed. Lastly, the movie crumbles in the third act -- at least for me. I can't really say why without spoiling the film, but there's a twist and turn in there that was completely unnecessary and which doesn't explain some of the plot holes as much as I would like. A second viewing may help me (it was pointed out to me after the fact how much foreshadowing there is in the first ten or fifteen minutes), but some aspects just don't add up for me.""Knowing"" is an enjoyable watch, but may leave you stale. I would recommend watching it alongside ""The Screwfly Solution"", as they would create an interesting contrast. Beyond that, I don't know... a good film but not the science fiction masterpiece you've been waiting for.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great film, destroyed by religious preaching!","As a huge Sci-Fi fan, i was really excited about this film. After watching it was pretty satisfied, but i just couldn't overlook the overwhelming religious message of the film.Half way into the film i thought to myself :""This will be a sure 9/10"". But when it was all over, i was really disappointed that the writers, decided to turn, what could have been a perfectly good sci-fi film, into a religious preaching film.On the other hand, it's definitely worth watching. It has almost everything a great Sci-fi/Thriller needs. Great Visual FX, great plot and great directing. And the music couldn't have been better for this film.So to sum it up, this movie could have been a solid 9/10, But sadly it was destroyed by religious preaching.7/10.....",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Intelligent Design"" propaganda","I was pretty intrigued by the flow of the movie and the twists and mysteries it presented. I did cringe a bit at the classroom scene where the protagonist questions if the creation of life was a result of random chaotic events. I cringed but dismissed it as an appeasement to the majority of religious people in this country. Granted, after the above-mentioned scene the movie turns back on a mystery/thriller track... As some other reviewers mentioned, and I agree, a movie is worth 6-7 stars out of 10... until you see the ""grand finale"" that is.It is then that the movie truly reveals its face - nothing more than creationists' piece of propaganda: ""Life is too complicated to be created by accident/evolution and too fragile to exist/survive without some sort of divine/alien interference.""

Surprisingly good,"Finally! A Nic Cage movie watched for this challenge I set myself that I liked a lot. And it's a divisive one, and for sure it's got some problems, but there was a lot here I liked. Yes, the director of this, Alex Proyas, also did the really shoddy Gods of Egypt which most people have forgotten about, but he also did Dark City and The Crow, which are both good movies from the 1990s that hold up well.First of all: there's a few things you need to accept going in. Nic Cage plays a scientist, which probably sounds silly on paper, but I think he makes it work. He gives a solid performance, and sure, he doesn't scream scientist as much as some other actors, and may arguably be miscast as a result, but I bought him as a dad, which is arguably a more important role he plays in the story.There's also an out there premise involving a series of numbers that predict worldwide catastrophes that is a bit silly on paper. There are questions about it that the characters don't ask, and that can be frustrating. But in another way, it is an interesting (and of course outlandish) idea, and the movie gets some good entertainment value out of it.There's also some clunky dialogue. Less than you'd expect, given how low this movie's rated on many film websites, but some lines of dialogue are pretty weak and unnatural.A good deal of the effects have aged well, and I thought some of the sequences were quite tense and horrifying. It moves pretty well, and I'd say 3/4s of it is pretty strong. The final chunk of the movie is less consistent though, which lets it down a bit. On paper the ending is sound, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired.Oh well. For the most part I liked this and was overall pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
impending doom,"I thought Nicolas Cage did a great job on the movie. the premise is pretty good to.. a man figures out by some sequence of random numbers,, that certain things are gonna happen on a certain date and time,, and wouldn't you know it.. he's right.. people of course don't believe him at first and he is chastised and ridiculed. he goes thru the movie trying to prevent what appears to be the end of the world,, will he save the day , or is it already to late to save mankind,, this movie isn't you're typical disaster flick, It centers more on the predictions, and how the man has to go about figuring out what disaster is gonna happen next and how to stop it,, this movie has lot's of action, thrills, mystery and suspense, I thought it was very well watching and will see it again soon.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film but not the happiest film of the year.,"I saw this film at the cinema the other day. I would recommend seeing this film at the cinema rather then DVD, blue ray etc. as the action/ disaster sequences are even more dramatic with cinema sound.

There were many bits in the film that gave me goose bumps as they were slightly creepy and a couple of jumps and surprises to keep you on your toes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
starts with interest but ends with wtf,"It's 1959 Lexington, Massachusetts. The local school is burying a time capsule. Student Lucinda Embry is a troubled loner hearing voices and her teacher Miss Taylor finds her trapped in a closet. It's 50 years later. Caleb Koestler needs a hearing aid. His class is opening the time capsule. Caleb is given Lucinda's letter which is a long string of numbers. His father John (Nicolas Cage) is an MIT Astrophysics professor. He starts making sense of the numbers. First, it's 9/11 and 2996 deaths. He matches every numbers with disasters except three still pending mass deaths. His wife Allison was part of one of the past disasters. He's there for the next disaster and figures out the location coordinates in the numbers. He becomes obsessed and tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana (Rose Byrne). Throughout, there are mysterious strangers haunting Caleb.The start has an intriguing premise. It's on track to be an interesting moody horror. It adds on some big CGI action sets. Once the mystery of the numbers is solved, the story loses its intensity. The ultimate ending requires much more foreshadowing. This needs to chop off the ending and tweak it to something less convoluted. If it wants that ending, it should be more than strange white-haired guys leaving wish pebbles.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Finally, they made a good one!","My Take: While the plot isn't great literature, There are some intriguing twists and some occasionally spooky moments.Finally, the movie that M. Night Shymalan might have made if he hadn't done the disappointing LADY IN THE WATER, and the movie Nicolas Cage should have made instead of abominations such as GHOST RIDER and THE WICKER MAN; A supernatural thriller dipped in science fiction and sprinkled with a little religiosity, KNOWING has in it to make it more than just a thriller in namesake. This time they did it right, even if there are some moments that ""jump the shark"" as far as plot twists are concerned.The film opens in 1959, where students of William Dawes Elementary School were asked to sketch their own view of the future, which will then be stored inside a time capsule. While other students busily draw their own versions of futuristic automobiles and rocket ships, mentally disturbed Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) disturbingly writes a series of numbers which might be a numerical sequence of sorts. Forward 5 decades later, the time capsule is unearth during an annual school ceremony, where the drawings stored inside are distributed each to a new generation of students. Astrophysicist John Koestler (Cage) and his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) end up with Lucinda's work. what seems to be simply a set of randomly written numerals turns out to be a cryptic numerical list of every major disaster in the last decades, along with the number of casualties, in perfect sequence. See where we're getting here? Soon, Cage runs around in desperate attempt to warn everyone of the upcoming doom predicted in the code. But just when twists are starting to wear out, the script dishes out the usual ""big twist"" that abandons the restrains of reality.Not that it matters. Under the hands of DARK CITY director Alex Proyas, any plot implausibilities and reality lapses are handled with some seriousness and poignancy that makes it sound less ridiculous than it really is. KNOWING may be a silly thriller if given in the hands of another somewhat lesser director, but Proyas does an adequate job that proves his up for the challenge. Cage is still less the actor he was in his better years, an aftertaste some of his previous efforts have left, but gives a rather adequate performance that goes way over the top in several laughable sequences, but does carry most of the film. Co-star Rose Byrne, who plays the disturbed Lucinda's daughter, is a good actress put to a lesser use in the movie (not even a love interest),. It may just be a case that the material is better than the people who act it out. The intriguing, sometimes screwy, plot is filled with interesting twists that, silly as they might get, come at you with some surprise that it still often startles somehow. There are a share of laughable moments that I'm perfectly aware of are supposed to be dead serious, but getting passed them, there are moments successfully pulled-off by Proyas. The special effects are terrific, sometimes frightening, but thankfully doesn't upstage the plot.Nic Cage fans (as in former Nic Cage fans) will be surprised and delighted. Basically, KNOWING is better in every aspect some of his earlier movies have miserably failed. Let's face it, KNOWING could have been (and may still be) another paycheck role for the once great Cage, but this time, in KNOWING, even we to get our money's worth.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"This movie has brought BS to a new level. It starts in a very stunning way so that you think you're watching the best thriller ever. The visual effects is just astonishing. As the story goes on you become more and more disappointed. At the end you have this feeling that the hole plot is written by a child who's parents has told her some stories from the bible, something like stories of Adam and Eve and the Armageddon, and she mixed these stories with the stories of aliens and UFOs she heard at school... The first 2/3 of the movie is worth watching, but the rest is a huge disappointment. Honestly though, it is like giving this simple mindedly written plot to the best film making crew.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kudos To Proyas For This Surprisingly Good Flick!,"It may seem improbable, but Knowing actually adds something fresh and inspiring to the disaster genre.Certainly the action scenes are well staged  they are as grand and tense as the previews would have you expect. But Knowing really stands out from the likes of Next and various Roland Emmerich movies because of its heart (there is a profoundly human element amongst the chaos and destruction), and because of the surprising, riveting turns the story takes. In no way was it a generic ""save the world"" flick, like I feared going in. It is an original with a memorable ending that should not be spoiled, but it will almost definitely have people talking.In my mind, director Alex Proyas deserves a lot of the credit for the fact that the film is brave, and does not try to replicate a typical Hollywood blueprint. In fact, he even has Nic Cage back on solid footing, an actor I used to love but have been quite weary of lately. But I think Proyas deserves the main kudos for turning this into something creative and special, and I'd go as far as to say this it is his best movie since Dark City.There really isn't much to complain about regarding the film, but the one exception might be the middle, where the action sags a bit. Still, I think the captivating final third more than makes up for it.I definitely recommend the film - you will be pleasantly surprised!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wishing I Didn't Know,"This film is one of the best examples of the necessity for a strong story. It has a lot going for it, including some impressive special effects, but the story is so flawed it crumbles under the load of its many defects.Nicolas Cage plays the part of John Koestler, a widower who teaches astrophysics at MIT. He has distanced himself from most of his family, but he secures emotional sustenance from his students and his young son. Still, he lingers over the memories of his deceased wife, as does his son.When a page of seemingly random numbers comes into his life, he almost immediately finds a hidden meaning. He cracks the code and it sets off a hunt for deeper meanings. It also brings elements of danger into their lives. The over-riding mystery has to do with the cause behind it all. The viewer is given plenty of chances to take an exit to the most reasonable explanations as the options grow more and more improbable. Eventually, it seems that only the most impossible of all explanations can solve the conundrum that has overtaken John's life.Unfortunately, the story is filled with plot holes and convenient coincidences---so that many viewers will feel betrayed, especially when the final riddle is solved and the viewer is left with a ""reality"" that is deus ex machina in the extreme, to the point of being amateurish.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So-so creepy thriller that has a good atmosphere that covers up its many other weaknesses,"When a time capsule is ceremonially dug up after 50 years in the ground, all schoolboy Caleb Koestler gets is a page with a list of number on it. He takes it home and by coincidence his grieving astrophysicist father Jon spots a pattern. He spends all night going through the numbers finding, among the meaningless numbers, dates and numbers that relate perfectly to events and how many people died in them. Almost unable to believe it himself, he is scorned by his friends until the next ""event"" happens just as the list of numbers predicted. John tries to prevent the next event from happening while his son appears to be somehow connected to the predictions.Knowing got a fairly average critical response when it came out and it was sufficient to make me wait for the DVD to come out rather than shell out for a couple of people to see it on separate tickets. Perhaps this is why I was pleasantly surprised by the majority of the film. I'm not suggesting that the film is inherently a good one but it did do a good job of holding my attention for the most part. It managed this by producing a creepy air and tension throughout the telling that made me ignore the massive jumps the plot makes along the way. The effects help it because they are too ""harsh"" to be ""fun"" – blockbusters often show destruction but do it in a popcorn type way – here I winched while watching people burn to death screaming – not fun but it helps with the air of tension and drama. It cannot do enough though because the writing still is hard to swallow, with lots of convenience about the writing, from the obvious bigger picture stuff right down to niggles about why John appears to not read the remaining events until they become the next one to happen! The film tries to have this dumbness lead into a sort of religious conclusion that is religious but also not religious at the same time. It is a real love it or hate it ending and for me it was more towards the ""hate it"" end of the spectrum. Not because it was religious but more because it just seemed so easy and a bit daft. Also it put me off that it couldn't decide to be religious or not, preferring to try and cover all bases by suggesting god, aliens, other planets, heaven etc without making a decision – this is why I didn't really like the ending. Normally I would not have bothered with this because of Nic Cage but he is OK. He is overly earnest for the most part but the film needs him to do that, helping the viewer get into the tension of it all. Canterbury is not much cop but fills the role without being a sickly sweet kid, which I guess is a victory or sorts. Donnellan does reasonably well while Maloney's still ""stranger"" is effective in adding to the chill of it all.Overall though it is still a daft supernatural film that relies heavily on the creepy air and urgency to cover up how weak the plot is. The ending will please as many as it annoys I guess and ultimately the film is only an OK one – not a good one.",,Anonymous,Mystery
You Gotta Finish Strong,"I'm afraid I have to side with those who found this really disappointing. As I watched the first two-thirds of this film I was really engaged. The premise is really fun. Cage is at his quirky best as he tries to juggle his obsession with his life, one that requires an equal share of attention. A brilliant man, he breaks through the puzzle left behind in the time capsule by the little girl. Unfortunately, the script fails us. Once again there are children who can hear voices and mysterious figures lurking in the woods. Once again, we have a religious kind of resolution. When this happens, what was a scientific movie with Cage breaking through becomes another one of those ""We are so small, we can't understand movies. There are also red herrings all over the place. What's the deal with those rocks other than to make us ask, ""What's the deal with those rocks?"" After I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and read ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke, I've gotten the message. These are outstanding works of art. This new movie begins wonderfully and then becomes another rip-off of the same old same old.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Better, and different than expected","First off, Nicolas Cage was pretty good as a science teacher who's initial skepticism over a batch of numbers (scribbled on a piece of paper found in a school's time capsule from the 1950s) is tested and eventually worn away by a quest to find out what they mean. Cage runs hot and cold when it comes to the characters he plays; he's awesome in films like ""Raising Arizona"", ""Con Air"", or ""National Treasure"", while not so believable in stuff like ""The Family Man"". He's maturing as an actor and getting better, it seems, with every role. Another standout is Rose Byrne, as the daughter of the odd little girl who wrote out the bizarre number sequences that Cage's character is analyzing. Byrne's always good at playing pensive women with something mysterious in their back stories. Yet as good as the actors were, the special effects and the twists in the storyline are what make this movie really entertaining. The writers didn't take the easy, obvious route with the story which was refreshing. The plot continues to surprise throughout taking some very different turns with the outcome of the story which made it even more unpredictable and better for it. I like movies that keep me guessing and this is one of those. See it if you like the unexpected.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I mean..come on... i saw the trailer...the movie was going to deal with disasters and future telling and Nick Cage running to save people... while being cool in the process...once again...The only thing I could expect from this movie is a bit action, some cool visual and audio effect and a lot of bs.

"Great movie, Alright Plot, Bad End","Summary:I enjoyed this movie, the special effects were phenomenal, I really liked the entire movie until 30 minutes from the end or so... but at least it was original, not a standard text book ending.Cons:There are some parts of the movie that really, don't make sense at all... and some things that don't even play into the plot, just take up time in an already 2 hour long movie. In my opinion, It could have been much better then it was. There was also a section in the movie, towards the middle area.

I can't wait to buy the DVD version so I can watch ""The Making of"" to really see how much money and resources were poured into this movie. I also have to comment the sound and music were very well made.

"""The Caves Won't Save Us!!""","Wow...words failed me after my body wrenched in pain after Nicolas Cage screamed those lines.

However, out of ""everything"" it had to be *reported* disasters within the U.S. Since the U.S. is the only country in the world, all disasters must happen in the U.S. for this plot of a movie to be cohesive.The premise is mildly enticing compared to what else is at the box office, but the execution is poorly done. Proyas can deliver eeriness, but he can't evoke emotion in his movies. Armageddon had 50 times more emotion tugging than this shallow attempt. It would seem logical for a disaster movie to be emotional when centered on a family. All it is a few of Dark City ""strangers"" making cameos and Nicolas Cage running around as a dimwit father trying to save the world.The movie is outlandish, poorly paced, poorly written, adequately directed.

Fifty years ago the students drew pictures of their predictions for future life and buried them in a time capsule on the school's grounds. Today is the day to dig up the object and view the contents. As each student is given a sealed envelope containing the picture of a former student, Caleb is shocked to discover that his package has no picture, only a bizarre string of numbers. After showing the sheet to his father, John is baffled, too, until he begins deciphering the codes. It seems that within the lines of digits, there are the dates of many natural disasters on earth, with an exact number of victims, including one for 911. As there are three strings of numbers which have not ""occured"" yet but which may be happening very soon, will John be able to prevent the next disaster? And, what about the girl who wrote this strange information on paper? Was she herself clairvoyant or was someone or something giving her the information? First, let me state that Proyas' Dark City is a monumentally great film, one for the ages, and that his The Crow and I, Robot are great films, too. However, this movie is not on their level, despite having a thought-provoking and complex plot and an art direction that is first-rate. Why is this so? Its hard to put it into words. First, the cast is fine, but is definitely not the reason to see the film. Cage starts off well, for he is a great actor, but there are times when his performance seems ""forced"". This fact alone hurts, as Cage is one of the finest actors of our time and my personal favorite. Rose Byrne and the lesser cast members do not enhance the film's value but don't detract from it either. The one bright cast member is the young boy playing Caleb, for he has an eerie, ""otherworld"" look that is spooky but he also is quite touching as the confused soul in a changing world. In his favor, Proyas has fashioned a beautiful looking film, with amazing sets, costumes, art direction and special effects. Scenes of a plane crash and of a subway derailment are spectacularly effective and the atmosphere of the film is downright scary, at times, due to Proyas carefully constructed camera angles and heart-thumping music choices. So, ultimately, the true problem of the film is not necessarily Proyas, but the story and script. It just doesn't ""hang together"", being one part mystery, one part science fiction, and one part family drama. Sad. Yet, for all of the criticism that the film will receive, it is still worth the viewing, for the ideas expressed are tantalizing and will make tongues wag for hours after a show. Therefore, if you love Proyas and Cage, like me, or science fiction in general, DON'T skip it. It may be flawed but its still an eye-popping film with plenty of stimulation for the mind and the heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Originality,In a world filled with sequels and prequels and the same rehashed stories we see every year this movie does stand out as being a original apocalyptic movie. The ending will throw some people off and that's what's great about it.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie... to a point,"I really wish I could give this movie more stars. I wish it had surpassed my expectations. And for a while there, I thought it might... until I, and everyone else in the theater, became... let's call it 'uncomfortable'.The intro to this movie was close to perfect. It setup the suspense and curiosity you would enjoy throughout the film. The body of the movie was more than exciting and fulfilling as well. The special effects were superb. The acting was... average to above average. The plot was thick. This was appearing to be one of the better films of the year, and possibly one of my favorite SciFi thrillers. But, then it happened.It's like a switch was flipped. The visual effects remained spectacular, but just about everything else fell apart. They attempted to produce an ending so incredible and unbelievable, that they ended up making it downright silly. The actors started over-acting, and every line became as cheesy as you could imagine. So much so, that you could see everybody in their seats squirming, trying to overlook the predictable and lame lines from the actors, only to re-discover the goofy ending to the film. In my opinion, quite a waste of a perfect introduction, great body of work (acting and story telling), and the possibility of a completely enjoyable and interesting film - from start to finish.Special effects (entire movie): 9/10Acting (first 3/4 of the film): 7/10Acting (last 1/4 of the film): 4/10Plot (first 3/4 of the film): 8/10Plot (last 3/4 of the film): 5/10Frustration that the ending ruined the rest of the movie for me: 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nic Cage's best film,"I love KNOWING. I loved everything about it from the moment it began to the time it finished. I loved it enough to watch it again a week later, to see whether I'd been overenthusiastic in my praise, and I discovered it was just as good – if not better – a second time around. Director Alex Proyas delivers a tour-de-force disaster movie that takes Hollywood convention and tears it up until little pieces until nothing is left.It starts out deceptively simple, slow and understated, the kind of slightly-odd mystery yarn that THE X-FILES used to do so well in its heyday. Then it hits you with a pivotal scene involving a plane which is one of the most breathtaking I've ever seen up on screen. Truly a phenomenal moment, the kind of scene that I had go to and watch on Youtube a couple of times because it was so great. The tracking shot in ATONEMENT was superb, and this equals it. From that point in, I was hooked, and the film kept me hooked until the ending.Said ending has proved a little hard to swallow for some viewers, but I was more than happy with the outcome: it plays a difficult hand and avoids ever becoming twee, so kudos to Proyas for not inserting some sub Spielbergian nonsense. Nicolas Cage can do this kind of haunted, jittery character in his sleep by now, but even so he gives a strong performance, the kind that leads me to forgive him for some of the tosh he's appeared in during his career (not least THE WICKER MAN). The SFX work is, it has to be said, outstanding, perfectly complementing the storyline for once, leading me declare this one of the top films of 2009 and in such hallowed company as DISTRICT 9 and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I owe Nicolas Cage an apology...sort of.,"I saw the trailers for this movie and I thought it looked intriguing...until I saw Nicolas Cage was in it. Then it automatically looked like it was going to suck.Now I'm not a pure hater, I used to really like him back in the late 90's...The Rock, Con Air, etc. But around the time Windtalkers came out...I found him to just really project this ego of ""I'm the greatest actor I don't even need to act."" which continued for every film he was in that I could bear to watch after that. It got to the point where just seeing his face in a movie got to be enough to kill my interest in seeing that movie. I saw this movie for cheap at the video store so I decided to pick it up. I figured what the hell, should at least have some good special effects.Boy am I disappointed I didn't see this at the theatre. It was excellent, there were quite a few layers to the movie, all around solid performances by the cast (Yes that includes Mr. Cage) great visuals, compelling characters, suspense, drama, emotion, dread, the list goes on. I was most impressed with the film being based on the Ancient Astronaut Theory of which I am fascinated by. And the film does it in a subtle but not ""this is fact"" kind of way.So I definitely recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't like Nick Cage, it's worth a look.",,Anonymous,Mystery

There's nothing like Knowing!,"First of all, yes I did see this movie, and no I'm not much of a talker when it comes to discussing and reviewing movies. Therefore, I will keep it short and simple.Nicholas Cage's movies have lately been a lot of action flicks that may or may not seem like movies we've all seen before. This one, however, brings a new fresh feeling to this genre.I think we've all seen the whole ""I see it coming"" type of movie where the main character has to prevent something from happening. This is one of those, and yet it isn't. It doesn't bore you, it doesn't make you feel like you've seen it before, and yet you have a comfortability with it that intrigues you throughout.I found myself quite entertained and the movie didn't lose my attention or have me checking my watch. Good direction and acting. Nicholas Cage does a good job.I believe anyone who sees this movie will enjoy it for what it is. Go see it, it's a fun flick!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Senseless,"Some really horrific action sequences are on display here but the rest of the movie is just laughably bad. The plot hinges on ridiculous contrivances and bypasses so many plot holes. The characters increasingly are called upon to do the dumbest, craziest thing you can think of, while the actors go at every line with a heavy-handed seriousness, which would work if the movie made an ounce of sense. Instead, Cage and Byrne just look like they're trying too hard. The worst is the ending, which jumps the shark into flat-out parody of itself. How anyone thought this ending was the best they could have done is a mystery to me. During the screening I had the idea that this movie could have had the intense paranoia of ""Arlington Road"". Instead it does the laziest and most senseless thing every time.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The children get it while the grownups are hysterical,"I found Knowing to be exciting, thanks to the mystery of the numbers the girl scribbled down, eventually leading up to an ending of Biblical proportions. The men in dark coats, the black pebbles they leave behind, the unintelligible whispers they emit - what are they and why do they all through the movie seem to follow the children? There is a sense of nostalgia and resignation to Cage's character. The sense we get is that the children are the future, and the grown ups are not able to listen or to change. The woman in the movie is hysterical and quite frankly annoying. She knew what was coming, but she still refused to accept it. What do I think about the very end? I'm not sure. It's not very clever, merely completes the Biblical narrative already laid down.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"3/4s great, 1/4 horrible.","A typical showing by Cage. The casting was on point, though the child actors were at times visibly inexperienced. Very interesting and compelling, a bit more graphic and macabre than I was expecting. It doesn't quite settle into its genre, is it a disaster movie, is it a thriller, is it supernatural, or is it sci-fi? It's quite good until the last half hour. Then it just drags and gets more ridiculous. It feels like someone from a high school AV Club finished what was a good movie. It feels like it's over and then there is another layer.

"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid","Warning: Stupid Character Alert! I went into this movie with no other expectation than to get my money's worth. If I had gotten a penny back for every time I rolled my eyes at this, I would have gotten my money back ten fold.While the concept isn't completely ludicrous, the characters and what happens next are. I'm so sick of writers using the death of a parent or spouse as a reason to excuse the odd behavior of the main characters. I couldn't relate to or sympathize with Nic Cage's character or his son. Not to mention that his son was one of the stupidest child characters I have seen yet in a movie.What's one word I would use to describe this movie: Forgettable. The concept of world tragedies being predicted is great. The story could have gone in many directions but don't let such information fall into the hands of an alcoholic Nic Cage. You risk a balding actor trying to play superman in a bunch stupid detective, rescue sequences.I can't name one character in this movie who I could actually stand to watch for more than a minute.

How To Ruin An Almost Great Movie,"I had very low hopes for this movie . It stars Nicolas Cage and while some actors give the impression they swallowed a bottle of Scotch and turned up hoping for the best Cage gives the impression he's smoked a splif the size of a telegraph pole and wandered in from the set of his previous movie . He has struck the same single one note performance for over 25 years . It's time like this I regret criticising Paterson Joseph because using the cruel cliché of "" He has the range of a water pistol "" is ready made for Cage . On top of that I was also under the impression KNOWING would achieve all its spectacle via some very lazy and unconvincing CGIGuess what ? To a very large degree this is how KNOWING plays out . Throw in some new age mystical nonsense about numerical codes and you wonder if conspiracy theorist David Icke might be making an appearance at some point . Saying all that KNOWING works far , far better than it has any right to . Indeed I found myself constantly surprised as to how compelling and involving the storyline was . It's a preposterous premise, one of being able to predict disasters via numerical codes but like so many fictional premises that are seemingly stupid if you're able to make things convincing then you're well on the way of spinning a great yarnDirector Alex Proyas helps the premise by directing in an understated and gloomy manner and letting the human elements of the story come through . He does have a slight problem with the spectacular disaster elements as in the aforementioned CGI looks far too much like CGI and one wonders if the film might have worked much better in curtailing the on screen carnage to a large extent . That said they still have an impact even if they're not as well realised as they might been . Perhaps it's because of the drama involved . After all how often do we see a movie hero save the day by averting a disaster . Here the future is written and no matter what he does Cage's protagonist can not change the course of destiny . Films with am impotent hero are few and far between so it's good to see an ineffectual protagonist for a changeThe fate of humanity is at stake here and I was left biting my badly bitten finger nails as to how Nicky boy was going to save the world from an extinction event since he'd not been able to change fate at all . The build up to the last ten minutes of the movie is tense and suspenseful then proceeds to blow everything with a leftfield deux ex machina that has to be seen to be believed and must feature as one of the biggest cop outs I've ever seen in a movie . It wouldn't have been so bad if it was a very mediocre TVM production made for the Syfy Channel and after seeing too many cheat plot turns in 21st Century DOCTOR WHO I thought I'd experienced every unlikely plot turn ever made but here the rug is pulled out from under the audience and they fall so heavily it hurts . It's a great pity because the production team have gone out of their way to make a grim and great supernatural sci-fi thriller that would have bordered on great if they'd thought up a better ending",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Profoundly Disappointing,"I'm a director fan more than an actor fan. Nicholas Cage I enjoy occasionally, though he seems to be in as many bad movies as he is good. Alex Proyas cemented my attention with The Crow and Dark City, and then earned my disdain with I, Robot. I hoped Knowing would be another winner --- after all, Roger Ebert liked it -- but it was not to be.The kiddie cast was largely pleasing, Lara Robinson (Abby / Lucinda) more so than Chandler Canterbury (Caleb Koestler). Our heroine, Rose Byrne (Diana) reminded me of a younger Jennifer Connelly. I meant that as a compliment.If you liked M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, then you have already seen Knowing, except Knowing wasn't as good, and I consider Signs to be one of the worst pictures I have seen in the last ten years. Only Transformers 2 scores lower on my suck-o-meter.It started out well, with an intriguing premise tautly directed. Then the whole thing devolved into the sort of twaddle that made What Dreams May Come such a bad picture. If you liked What Dreams May Come, then you might consider this review an endorsement.They dumbed down the concept of determinism to the point that it was egregiously wrong, but that's perhaps a minor quibble only interesting to philosophy majors.Profoundly disappointing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
until the end of the...,"There has been many a movie about people discovering important clues in seemingly random topics: ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The Number 23"" are examples. Now, director Alex Proyas (""The Crow"", ""Dark City"", ""I, Robot"") brings us ""Knowing"". Nicolas Cage plays a college professor who lost his wife a year earlier. In his MIT class, he teaches students about randomness (things just happen) vs determinism (everything happens for a reason).When a time capsule gets opened, his son finds a strange paper written by a girl fifty years earlier. While at first looking like a bunch of arbitrary numerals, he realizes that it shows the dates of famous disasters and the fatalities therein. Sure enough, it starts to look as if this relates to him.I found most of the movie intriguing - I've never come across any series of numbers (anything else) that looks like what the flick portrays - although it seemed as if the end got kind of religious. If you ignore that part, the rest of the movie is pretty enjoyable (although I still consider ""The Crow"" Proyas's best movie). Just pay attention the next time that you see a list of things.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hilariously cheesy camp,"Whether or not you like this depends on whether or not you like Nicholas Cage. Knowing is basically the purest essence of a Nick Cage film - Cage plays a hard-as-nails atheist astrophysicist single dad, distant from his religious father and improbably brainy son, who finds a long sheet of numbers in a time capsule. Cage picks a random string of 8 from the sheet, and by sheer luck picks the exact numbers that somehow predict the Sept 11 attacks.Much of the rest of the film consists either of Cage staring at a sheet of paper as a look of wispy stoned horror builds on his face, running blankly as various pieces of transport infrastructure explode around him, or having ""tender"" moments with his 9-year-old son, who speaks entirely in stilted Professor speak (""I'm afraid that I think that's rather unlikely, Dad""). The film alternates between ridiculously slow (Cage must spend at least two minutes of screen time just sipping liquor) and insanely fast (Try to work out what is going on during the action scenes. Here's a hint - you can't), and builds to severely creepy (but admittedly quite brave) ending of sheer WTF-ery, religious metaphor and implied prepubescent sex.

What is With This Movie?,"If you're looking to see a kick-ass movie, then I do suggest not seeing Knowing. It was probably one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen, sitting for two and some hours to see lots of death. It was more or less background music to the nap I took through most of it. Also, the biggest buzz-kill of my life, ever.The movie is filled with pointless, and pathetic, foreshadowing and symbolism, which any idiot can pick up on. It was filled with some jumpy parts, some strange parts, some awkward parts, and parts where you just sit there and ask yourself ""what the F just happened?"" The ending was just horrible... I feel that the writer could have at least made it a little more exciting. But nope, still pretty ridiculous.Nicholas Cage should just still to his Disney National Treasure BS because that role fits him a little better, more than an alcoholic crazed professor.Then again, I am not giving much credit to the special effects that were used in the movie. Some of the scenes were pretty awesome with the graphics of the disasters. And the boy actor was adorable. So there.I'll leave it up to you. Have a good time at the movies!",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How you accept the final third will determine which camp you are placed in. I was confused by Ebert giving it four stars and then hearing others whose opinions I also often agree with eviscerate it, but after seeing it this makes total sense.I fall into the unabashed love category, and absolutely did not expect to going in. My brother Doug felt the same way.

I've always liked Nick Cage, although I didn't like some of his later choices to act in, but he was doing just fine here, right from the start. Soon, I realized this was some sort of science fiction tale, and I was very glad, as it's been my favorite type of movie since the 1950s. My favorite movie is still Close Encounters, so you can imagine my delight near the end when we learn who the dark strangers are. I was watching this movie all alone, but I couldn't help clapping when I saw their vehicle.

Redundant,"Roger Ebert called it ""the best science fiction movie ever made"". It just happens to be made by the director and writer of Dark City, Alex Proyas, who is a friend of Ebert's. Roger Ebert did an audio commentary track for Proyas for the movie Dark City.Ebert is off his cancer meds if he thinks this movie is good. It's another unhealthy dose of religious propaganda from Hollywood. I was sickened by I Am Legend which turned the great original Matheson story into a religious propaganda piece.This movie is an original screenplay so it's less annoying but still a religious propaganda piece. It's hard to give reasons why without completely giving away the plot.I don't mind that the religious folks make movies like this but they should be honest about it. Everyone knew that the sci-fi film Battlefield Earth was written by the father of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. The writers of this film should have promoted it as a Christian science fiction movie. Then I could stay away and all the Christians could go to it in droves with their church. Even so, there's no science in this movie. Maybe science fiction wouldn't be the best term to use, maybe it's simply Christian propaganda.The acting was also very poor in this movie. I chuckled several times when Nicolas Cage got all serious. He's a widow with a child, a scenario all too familiar for these movies. Mel Gibson was a widowed single parent in the very similarly themed ""Signs"". The movie also reminded me of the struggling single mother in ""The Sixth Sense"". Both movies have elements of psychic children. We know Cage is a troubled man who has lost his faith (Hey, just like Mel Gibson in Signs!) because there are several scenes of him chugging liquor from a bottle.This movie is redundant religious crap.

Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuff,"Knowing (2009)Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuffKnowing is terrific and terrifying, and it has some of the best disaster effects you'll ever see. But it's not brilliant or even original, though the plot has its own turns and specifics to make it distinctive. It uses so many familiar sci-fi/thriller/horror tricks to shock us and make us pay attention, you might feel as manipulated, and helpless, as I did, but you might also get swept along and have a great time.The plot, which I have a rule against describing, is more crucial to the development of the action than many movies. Nicolas Cage is really fine as the lead scientist/dad, and in a very usual Cage kind of way. If you like him (which I do), I'd say you'll like the movie. The kids hearing voices and the building sense of doom are necessary and entertaining--if that's not too breezy a word for a heavy heavy story. Because it is all dependent on this 50 year old prophesy, and about how to decode it, and then, alas, what the heck to do about it. In some ways it devolves into a standard catastrophe scenario, with Cage holding his end of the stick very well. The scientist he plays faces his atheism and watches it evaporate with dry resistance, very nicely.The really disappointing gripe is how poorly the concept is handled in terms of science and math and general likelihood. The numerology just isn't convincing. In some ways it's so simple and historically based, it's dull (and excessive) once you get the point. But having the information and then running around in a frenzy isn't exactly what you might expect. Furthermore, the solar flare idea is conceivable, but not presenting with a kind of scientific reasonableness that would give the movie credibility. Even the way the trailer has been abandoned for years and never vandalized doesn't match my experience of the back woods.But then, maybe it just operates as a what-if kind of fantasy, with a holy-cow ending that will gag the most dreamy-eyed of you. They could have left the last minute off entirely...but you might disagree completely. If you see it on a plane (not likely) or in a motel, it's perfect distraction material, gripping and exciting. The first big disaster (you'll see) is so realistic it gives me goosebumps remembering it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"another underrated movie, supernatural and sci-fi people, watch it","At first, i wasnt ready to watch it. Now that i have watched this, was better than i was expecting. This is not a sci-fi thriller, or a supernatural movie, is both, so to dont spoil, the mix between the photography(i love how the cars are the only lights in alot of scenes), the plot, and the way they know about the future but theres always something that happen...you need to discover why everything happens. Watch it. Is a thriller special for the lovers of the supernatural stuff, and the sci-fi stuff, but everything packed in a intense drama. Is dark, eerie and with some unexpected twists.

The very last Nicolas Cage film I really enjoyed,"The opening scene was enough to wet my appetite for the rest of the film. I found the film interesting and mysterious. It was a sort of a 'Left Behind' type film, only in a slightly different direction and more realistic, I think. This was the time when Nicolas Cage still made good films and when I was still interested in seeing his films. (Can't remember when the list Cage film was I enjoyed. In fact, this was the last one!).Having directed one of my all-time favorite films 'The Crow', Alex Proyas does not disappoint with this film. I really liked his approach to the disaster scenes, making them brutally realistic. The plane and train scenes are incredible! They are fast-paced, no holds-barred scenes just the way it probably would happen in real life. There was so much going on during these scenes that you'd miss something if you blinked. The film also has some very good visuals, and even a few scary moments.I did find the music a bit loud and overbearing at times. Also, the film shows John (Nicolas Cage) deciphering the code in just one night - while intoxicated, I might add. Although he is a professor, it is still physically and mentally impossible. Despite that, though, this was an enjoyable action packed thriller drama with a satisfying ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sci-fi for Creationists,"Atheists be aware: yet another bible-preaching supernatural thriller in the disguise of Science Fiction. The Bush era has certainly left its mark on Hollywood productions like The Sign, I am Legend, and now this.First half of the movie is enjoyable, with thrilling suspense and spectacular special effects. The disaster scenes are quite amazing. I would have loved the film if it stayed within the boundary of god and ghosts and witches and fate... Unfortunately, it decides to venture into science, namely, aliens and spaceships.Take the art from Matrix, The Abyss, throw in a bit of Bible description, now we have the look of aliens. ""But we don't know what to do with them, boss?"" says the writer. So let them stand and stare. Let the spaceship rotate endlessly with its hypnotizing CGI charm. So, with Apocalypse looming, Nicholas Cage seems to have a world of time saying goodbye to his kid. Call me cruel, but I completely missed out on the touchiness of it because I was laughing hysterically at the fact that: according to the aliens, our genius MIT professor - supposedly a valuable human specimen, is inferior than 2 bunnies.I would highly recommend this movie to creationists, especially families with young kids who tend to skip Sunday school. The implication of Noah, angels, and prophets, etc, are hard to miss. At the last sequence I fully expected to see a snake and an apple... Then the joke would be complete.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent concept, poor execution","I'm 14 years late to the party, but I can tell there's polarizing reactions to the flick. The late film critic Roger Ebert ended up giving this a 4-star review. But I also saw that the Rotten Tomatoes website has about a 34% favorable rating.I can applaud the special effects of the plane and subway crash scenes, and I liked seeing how the protagonist made sense of the cryptic 50-year old letter, but the bulk of this movie was enigmatic. Especially when it came to those aliens and the black rocks.The one thing that crossed my mind was whether Lucinda had any intention on stopping any of the mass atrocities. She had the dates, death count, and coordinates of these events at her disposal, after all. But realistically, the 2009 death date for ""everyone else"" was set in stone, so I guess it wouldn't matter.It is a watchable movie.

This movie as a WTF ending which you will either enjoy or not,"It's hard to discuss this movie in an interesting way without spoilers. A friend and I had totally opposite reactions. I loved it. He hated it. For me, this was like a high budget high action Twilight Zone episode.A physics professor discovers something he doesn't believe, something that challenges his beliefs, and as he investigates his world is turned upside down with many things that provide an explanation for legends/stories of old that he'd dismissed as nonsense. As an x-religious, now staunch atheist I really liked it. It's hard Sci-Fi. It goes with an idea and runs it to the end. Further, it brings up lots of interesting questions. But, if at the end you find where it goes doesn't work for you, you'll see it has hokey.I'm a huge Nicholas Cage fan. He's a world class actor. See Leaving Las Vegas, Moonstruck, Pig, Adaptation, Wild at Heart, and plenty of others. Of course he's made lots of fun silly movies too. This is not his best nor his worst but if you're one of those people who thinks he only does stupid and you go in with ""this must be stupid because it stars Nicholas Cage"" well then you'll likely choose the ""the ending is silly"" path than the ""wow, this was a great Twilight Zone ending"" path.Roger Ebert gave the movie 4 stars.

Heavy religious overtones,"Unless you're a ""Left Behind"" fan, in which Nicholas Cage IS left behind, don't bother with this movie. Under the guise of SCI FI fantasy, the movie-goer will discover that ""Knowing"" is unknowingly a film steeped in Christian dogma. Unfortunately, we don't discover the true intention of this flick until the 3rd Act.For the first three acts, I was fully engaged in the action-packed and character-driven plot line. Nicholas Cage was fat his zany best as astrophysicist John Koestler. The direction by Alex Proyas and pulse-pounding music score by Marco Beltrami provided just the right amount of dramatic build, and the special effects kept me riveted to my seat. However, at this point it seemed as though the entire production switched hands. Cage the scientist discarded his logic and reasoning, gave up his fight to save the world, and suddenly accepted the fate of mankind because he'd remembered a scripture quote from his evangelist father. Gone was the driving music, replaced by bombastic classical selections. We were suddenly inundated with biblical prophecy and symbolism, medieval religious renderings, and an in-your-face message; only those who listen to whisperings of the alien/angels will be saved and that only males can be role models.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A rewrite of Arthur C. Clarke's novel,"SPOILERS HERE - In very many ways this is a rewrite of ""Childhood's End."" If you're familiar with the novel, the aliens in the movie are the Overlords, who, as caretakers of a dying Earth, await the final moments of the planet's existence to take the world's children to another place. It is not Eden (definitely not Clarke's intent). And, similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" also based on Clarke's writings, the children are prepared to master a new home, one they will be able to understand and prosper in. The film can be interpreted in many ways--one of its great strengths--and though wings can be imagined by the wispiness of the aura surrounding the aliens, these individuals are but representatives of a culture intent on, if you will, protecting life and intelligences. That the children are willing to go--and Dad senses the deeper meanings of all of it--points to a pervasive, yet silent communication to humans (or many of them) by the Overlords. Remember, too, that people in many parts of the world were, in one way or another, preparing for the space ships; many of them left Earth at the same time. The non-Eden place featured alien plants, and a tree with nary an apple. The bunnies gave comfort to the children, and, symbolically, pointed to a rapid and gentle population soon to appear. A superb film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great story ... buried in a grossly bad movie ...,"OK, let's be honest here. As one sci-fi fan to another, I'd say ""sure, see this movie"" but would add ... ""it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared."" I think you can see this ""like""/""dislike"" perception being played out in the ratings. The IMDb ratings are (currently) above 7, yet the reaction from critics is very negative (Rotten Tomatoes rating < 25%).My take: There is a fun story underlying this film, but the implementation (the movie itself) is pretty bad. I rate it a ""6"" only because I enjoyed the story idea and the special effects.The movie is basically about an MIT professor (Nicolas Cage) who comes into possession of a 50-year old note from a time-capsule. It identifies (through numbers) all the major disasters of the last 50 years ... plus a three upcoming ones. He resolves to look deeper into the final three ... and wonders - why him, why now and what is about to happen?On the surface, the setup is very cool-sounding; something like that will always pull me into the theater. But when you watch the movie - it's kind of a train-wreck.The acting is bad, the way the reality-checks in the movie are nuts and even the film's color (or processing) is sub-standard (and I generally never notice that kind of stuff).Even with one of the most watchable on-screen presences like Nicolas Cage, the performances are almost painful to watch. The events drive this movie forward, not interest in the characters.I think the worst part of the movie is that no one did any serious ""reality-checks"" in the script. For instance, the time capsule hardly looked protected - it looked like the burial hatch could could be pried open with just a couple of crowbars. A couple of kids could/should have raided that thing 2 days after it was put into the ground.Even the 'skeptical' scientific sidekick of Cage was unreal. His fellow MIT professor friend recommended that he dismiss his decoding of the numbers - even with what seemed like a 99+% positive correlation to disaster dates and death tolls. There needs to be more ""gray"" area to inject believable skepticism - not go up against a 99% hit rate.Perhaps the last problem worth mentioning is timing. Everything is happening tomorrow or the day after ... literally. I'm all for tension, but the timing is just too infeasible without further and better explanation.On the positive side, the effects are fantastic. There are crashes and explosions that are among the best I've seen. The effects crew deserves an award for the intensity and thoroughness of their work: bravo!All in all, this is pretty interesting idea couched in a bad movie. I managed to maintain my fascination with the story in the midst of a lot of terrible movie-making. I would not recommend this to the average moviegoer, but to the sci-fi fan ... ""sure, see this movie, but it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared.""",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie but way too many questions left unanswered,"Spoiler AlertI personally quite enjoyed the movie as it does change direction half way through the movie and keeps the audience guessing , whether this was intentional is open to debate. Certainly the reviewers here who believed they knew the ending after 10 mins, I think are conning themselves , they probably saw the trailer or heard it on the grapevine as clearly up to half way through the movie the audience is led to believe that Cage's character is clearly there to stop the disasters from happening or at least try to save some lives , the end of the world does not come into it at all.The biggest problem that I had with the movie is that it simply leaves too many questions unanswered as to the point of various story lines within the movie and this is shown by the various different interpretations by other reviews.I shall ignore the various ""believability"" of certain actions in the overall storyline as this is a sci fi movie so you will get loads of them e.g. cage just happens to spill his drink and highlight 9/11 but concentrate on the ones that need an explanation:- 1. What was'Lucinda role in this? Apart from the production of the numbers. She could hear the Angels so why was she not picked by the Angels to leave the planet? Why commit suicide, why did she live in the exact place the aliens were picking up the children, why did she never try to warn people of the disasters like Cage character did? 2. What was the role of the stones? They were clearly given to all the children that were to be rescued but what were there purpose? My guess is they were tracking devices , used by the aliens to track the children they wanted but we never find out or were they directional finders for the other children to know where to go? or where all the children kidnapped to get them to the correct location , if so what is the point of the numbers at all? 3. The numbers on the paper that Cage's character used to eventually work out where to go to save his son, was this their primary purpose or was it a fluke that he had the paper and his son just happened to be ""chosen"" at the same time.4. When Rose died , Cage's character tried to explain to his son at the end that she had died , his son simply stated that she would be OK , how would she be OK , she was dead and why have the stone in her hand when she died , what was its significance?Anyway any answers to these questions would be most welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Outstanding Film - see it by all means,"I've come not to expect much from Nicholas Cage's movies. Outrageous plots seem to be his mainstay. However this film is simply gripping. How can I tell if a film is good? 2 ways. 1.If I'm not conscious of sitting in a theater, fidgeting in my seat and 2. If I am brought to tears and/or other gripping emotions.This film accomplished both. It surprised me, shocked me, AND brought me to tears. Simply outstanding. I've read the letters of complaints by others but they seem to come from juvenile viewers. I've also read the list of errors found in the film but they border on the outrageous (the wrong conductor's cap? c'mon!) Everything was not sweetness and light however, e.g. I was not happy with the quasi-religious ending.But I found this film to be so outstanding and memorable that even now - 7 days later - Beethoven's 2nd movement of the 7th symphony still plays in my head and I find myself wondering about the importance of life.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth a watch for some disturbing scenes,"There was a time when Nicholas Cage wasn't a laughing stock and he time was before Knowing was released. Knowing is a strange film to review. On the one hand it contains some genuinely creepy scenes including a plane crash that is convincing and a scene in the woods that is eerie but the story about a professor who goes out to prevent catastrophes based on a list contained in an unearthed time capsule falls flat. This is probably the film when Nicholas Cage started going nuts and acting in every film that was probably thrown his way, though this cannot be faulted at the film. Alex Proyas could have done a better job but it is a decent effort containing some great isolated sequences.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Concept, Bad Execution","I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie. The beginning was very promising. I very much enjoyed the ""time capsule"" concept.The first half of the movie was intriguing, but then... was the second half written/directed by entirely different people??I didn't think the acting was very good, either. Absolutely everyone in the movie was sub-par, especially the teacher in the beginning. Well, they were not *horrible*; just not very good.Nicolas Cage's character was quite one-dimensional and unlikeable. The way he neglects his son throughout the movie and treats him like s***. How do you expect people to root for such an uncharismatic, wooden, unremarkable character?The ending was just 'lazy' and thoroughly disappointing. They could've thought of something more original. Honestly. If you're going to have aliens in the movie, at least take some time to introduce them - and their purpose - properly.The second half of the film is just some cheesy religious propaganda. Total drivel. And that scene with the two kids on a supposedly new planet as Adam and Eve... oh, the horror! Words can't convey how cringe-worthy it was.The special effects were a bit lame and unrealistic.(1) Lots of WTF moments, too. For instance, he wasted several hours writing those numbers (from Lucinda's paper) *by hand* on a chalk board?? He could've just made a bloody photocopy! (2) And what about Lucinda? She's clearly disturbed and a major weirdo, yet nobody in school seems to do notice - or care about - her issues. That kind of behavior is impossible to ignore. There wasn't much background on Lucinda at all -- basically, we know nothing about her, even though the whole movie is based around her.(3) What the f*** was that plane crash all about? A plane has crashed (and exploded -- several times!), yet all the people seem to have got away with catching a little fire. Not even them, but their clothes. They seem to be in impeccable condition i.e. not injured in any way. That scene was incomprehensible.And plenty more where that came from.I'm giving it 7 stars just for the premise, which I thought *was* excellent. The execution seriously sucked, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I liked the story, good mix of weirdness and believability, some plot inconsistencies here and there, some development missing on some issues but mostly OK and also not ""stupid"". It does not require the usual ""suspension of disbelief"" that most sci-fi movies seem to need today. FX are on par with bigger budgeted movies and sound was really good.

A decent disaster prediction concept that tries too hard to be original,"The problem with ""Knowing"" is that it goes too far. It's a tough act to juggle so many overused story conventions such as decoding numbers, the apocalypse and the supernatural these days. Movies like ""Knowing"" have become almost a genre of their own thanks to Roland Emmerich and other disaster/end-of-the-world-predicting filmmakers. And with that comes expectations as well as a need for originality. What is supposed to set ""Knowing"" apart? Disaster shots? No; A protagonist trying to convince people he's not crazy though he can see the future? No; Nicholas Cage? Ahaha.""Knowing"" tries a bit too hard to compensate for this lack of an original premise and the result is a plot riddled with holes. As talented as director Alex Proyas (""Dark City,"" ""I, Robot"") is with science fiction and blending sci-fi themes with commercially appealing techniques that please producers, he can only capture our attention for so long until we realize how disconnected and far-fetched all the story elements are.I'll give the film a bit of credit for trying to piece together a message about family and knowing that the end is inevitable and how we struggle to decide whether we believe the events of our lives our connected or completely random, but it gets lost in film's lasting impression because of the absurdity of events. Cage plays an MIT astrophysics professor who discovers a list of numbers from the time capsule uncovered at his son's school. He discovers the numbers are the dates, locations and body counts for every major disaster from 1959 - 2009 and that includes some that have yet to happen.The glitch here is that there's no actual justification for Cage to go running toward life- threatening disasters that he knows will happen. He is a single father with a young son who he promises (in sign language no less) that he will be with forever and ever. It's convenient for him to chase these events because otherwise there's barely any action or special effects, but it sets the film off on the wrong foot.Conceived by an inexperienced Ryne Douglas Pearson who wrote the script in conjunction with ""Boogeyman"" writers Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, I supposed I shouldn't be shocked that the story plays out like M. Night Shyamalan meets ""The Day After Tomorrow"" meets ""Indiana Jones 4."" It certainly keeps your interest but when it's all done you realize they tried to make something work that didn't quite make any sense. Most blatantly, ""Knowing"" leaves its audience imagining too many hypotheticals.Proyas ultimately gives ""Knowing"" half its competency. He has envisioned some pretty cool action sequences and found some way of pulling something resembling a theme out of this story that tries to make something original out of a premise inherently unoriginal. Without him, this film would be in the Nic Cage scrapheap along with ""Next"" and ""Bangkok Dangerous.""~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I love this film! It is daring, challenging the viewer to think way outside the box","I love this film! It is daring, well acted, but most importantly, challenges the viewer to think . . . way outside the box.On a scale of 1 - 10, I'll give this film a 12+, and I am not usually inclined to be so generous in my comments along these lines.I have always had considerable respect for Nicholas Cage as an actor, but in this film, he shines - could not have been castled more perfectly.I freely admit, this film is not for everyone. If you're someone who stays glued to the TV screen watching the usual sort of mindless dribble that is dished out to the mainstream TV audience, this film is probably not for you.The one clue I will offer is that this is sort of what ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" could have been, although I did like that film as well, and Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for the part in that film, in its modern remake version.But ""Knowing"" truly is unique.People who are scared of thinking outside the box, and like to stay safely ensconced in the world they were trained to believe in, in many cases will not ""get this"" - that's to be expected.But for a very large and growing percentage of the population who are beginning to take a serious look at what our history on this planet might have been, and what many are now trying to understand in this context, this film does walk the viewer down a path that leads to areas of thought that are quite timely.This was a well crafted example of the art-form - two thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Apparently, from the scene the movie changes to horror (the kid scratching the door with her fingernail) and change then change to science fiction (UFO).I do not know what should i called this movie, horror, drama or science fiction?

A nice thriller and sci-fi entertainment,"The story is just another an apocalypse narrative like any others. The variation in the story that aliens are protecting humans by selecting some kids and 'whispering' them signs and clues about the impending doom, and ultimately taking them someplace else to start over doesn't really make the story a unique one. The thriller side is quite nice. Combined with the strong sci-fi practice, this movie managed to keep me curious and stayed on to watch. Although I must say that I'm rather disappointed with the ending because the mysterious whisper people are revealed not as expected. The depiction of the alien race is quite nice. In some ways, it tries to connect our science, reports of alien sightings and experiences, myths, and religious faith into one depiction. The acting by Cage is just a so-so and is not a special thing. Byrne's performance though, is a nice one because she can grasp the emotions involved in the scenes, whether on the calm situations like most of her scenes, or the elevated situations like the one in the gas station.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent, excellent movie ( Don't trust the critics and reviews)","First off let me say that although I'm a little biased when it comes to Nicholas Cage movies (absolutely loved ""Con Air""), he hasn't been coming out with the same types of movies that once blew your mind. That said I must say that after watching this movie in theaters, I walked out and literally said to my friend ""That was probably the greatest movie I've ever watched in my life"". I understand not everybody is gonna feel the way I feel but I almost didn't watch this movie because I read the review on Yahoo directory. Let me be the first to say those guys don't know the first thing about a good science fiction flick.The movie itself: The pacing was just right, like a thundering locomotion it started slowly and built itself into an unstoppable juggernaut towards the denouement.I thought the casting of the movie was great. One of the many faults of the movie according to online reviews were that Nicholas Cage only displayed about 2 facial expressions and emotion during the movie. While this is not true, would you really care about how big of an array of emotions you are displaying to your audience if the world was coming to an end? The cinematography and special effects were good albeit not spectacular, it gets the job done, and done with style. The plot twists and turns along with a stellar music score and sound effects makes the movie frighteningly heart-gripping.I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Interesting but doubtful twist on The Apocalypse,"John Koestler (Cage) is an MIT astrophysics prof with a very precocious preteen son Caleb. At Caleb's elementary school, a 50 year-old time capsule from 1959 is opened. Other kids get drawings of what kids from then thought 2009 would be like, but Caleb gets a sheet full of row after row of numbers, apparently meaningless, written by a girl called Lucinda.It takes a little while for John to figure it out, but the numbers refer to dates and number of fatalities for every major disaster for the past 50 years - in perfect chronological order. Later, immediately before witnessing the crash of an airliner - predicted on the sheet - he discovers that the GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) of the disaster are also included in the hitherto mysterious ""joining"" numbers between disasters.So far so good and quite engrossing. But what begins as an interesting mystery rapidly evolves into an end-of-the-world scenario with hardly any lead-in at all (compare the months the world had to prepare in Deep Impact). This in itself might be OK especially as superhuman/alien influences are involved, but read on..Global disaster looms in the form of an impending solar super flare. Solar flares regularly engulf the Earth, but the effects have to do with communications disruptions, possible destruction of electronic devices and spectacular displays of northern or southern lights. This one is different and Koestler describes it as a super flare, ""a 100 µTesla wave of radiation that would destroy our ozone layer"". But that's something which would have resulted in a slow, lingering death for much but not necessarily all of planet Earth rather than an apocalyptic one where the Earth's surface is swallowed in fire and humanity perishes, as in the film. There's doubt too about that ""100 µTesla"" - when Googled, that intensity doesn't seem particularly lethal. The impression is given that the Sun's fatal outburst is a natural phenomenon and not something that the aliens have induced..Curiously, while the authorities know about and start to give warnings of the event in the day or so beforehand, they clearly have little prior knowledge despite the fact that the sun is under constant study by various learned bodies involving Earth-based observations and dedicated satellites. Please SF makers, work within what is and don't insult viewer intelligence.The idea of Whisperers/Watchers is OK - outside of normal human experience so it's possible. They have been monitoring events for at least the past 50 years and drove Lucinda to create the sheet, then made sure Caleb received it. He and Abby (Lucinda's grand daughter), among other children throughout the world, are Chosen. But why only kids (and bunnies) get saved is a bit of a puzzle tho, surely some mature humans should be included.Mainstream end-of-the-world movies where the End actually eventuates and is depicted in graphic detail are understandably not too generally popular - the only other one I can think of is When Worlds Collide though there are probably others. I am inclined to think that the ""sudden"" ending caters to the ""24""/attention-of-a-goldfish mindset where the audience majority are assumed to be idiots who will quickly lose interest if something dramatic (however improbable) does not happen, and happen SOON. After all these blockbusters do cost heaps to make and as always, money rules (sadly)...SF geeks like me will find this movie irresistible but it's too bad the proposed means for the destruction of the Earth does not make sense. Otherwise it could have been a great, rather than a merely good, Sci-Fi flick. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A strong premise... which epically fails.,"I never really planned on seeing this movie. I'm not a huge fan of nicholas cage and his limited range of squinty facial expressions. However, after hearing some friends report on how 'awesome' it was, I decided to give it a shot.The film begins beautifully, with Melbourne providing quite a good an admirable job at passing for Boston- my only clue was seeing Doug Peterson from Summer Heights High- and both visual effects and a plot which set up a dark mood, full of intrigue and possibility.The film takes this on for a while, and for this time my only complaint was the badly photo-shopped image of rose byrne that appeared a couple of times, and a few awkward script moments that left many audience members laughing. Apart from a few unnecessary moments of foreshadowing, all looked well in the world of ""Knowing."" How, how wrong I was. Like in so many other films, it reached a point where I realised ""This movie is going to have a really, really stupid ending."" And I was right. It's almost as if the writer of the original story gave up on trying to create a quality ending, instead focusing on ridiculous and unsatisfying ways of bringing so many odd moments in the film together, combined with huge, but not always the greatest quality, special effects. This ending's stupidity is only compounded by rabbits, a ridiculous goodbye and an awkward and ultimately incomplete moment of family reconnection. Once it ended, the cinema was full of giggles and a few comments along the lines of ""its about time it ended!"" wait for the DVD, if you must watch it at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I could give numerous examples from incidents in the movie that could demonstrate this facet, but nothing could be more telling than the shocked face of the woman sitting a few seats down from us, who at the end credits of the movie could not remove her hand from her mouth neither her eyes from the screen. 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not KNOWING What It Wanted To Be,"As most of my criticisms of this movie have to do with its details and plot points, writing a review devoid of spoilers was tricky, but I did my best.Nic Cage's film choices, and acting style, and general appearance over the last five years are all good for our amusement, but it's been what, 15 years since he won an Oscar and about 10 since he was nominated. I saw ""Knowing"" because a friend paid for it.Having said that, I was very into the movie right from the beginning. The scenes set in the 1950's were alright, the cinematography and score reminded me of a more traditional sci-fi movie, taking some chances with the narrative style and trying to unsettle the viewer. I was ready to dismiss the movie as a serious one and mock it, but it didn't let me. It was a good movie.Nic Cage works as a Professor at M.I.T. in Astrophysics (or something), and this is where the film starts getting lazy. He explains Determinism vs. Random Chance as though this class full of MIT students are 4th graders. This is linked not-so-subtly with his state of mind at this point in his life, having lost someone very close to him. Without getting into too much detail, his son receives the sheet of paper with numbers, numbers of great significance, written by a little girl in 1959. What follows is a standard investigative story, complete with cover-ups, suspicious deaths, abandoned homes, children bearing the burden of their parents' abnormalities, and mute albinos in trench-coats.What doesn't work for me, chiefly, is that I don't understand what I'm meant to get out of this movie. The special effects are quite good, and the scenes in which they're used are shocking and effective (pardon the pun), but I think the movie missed a few chances to deviate from a predictable, ultimately lazy, somewhat nonsensical path. Nic Cage knows about upcoming disasters, and he kind of limps through the motions of trying to influence their occurring, but not really. He makes a couple anonymous phone calls, hits a tree with a baseball bat, gets a revolver, and falls to his knees. Rose Byrne, in yet another thankless end-of-the-world supporting role, spends most of the movie looking distraught, haunted and helpless, and at one point literally yells, ""We Have To Save The Children!"" I was not the only one in the theater who laughed.For most of the film, the main investigation is concerned with details so finite and exact, that the ""startling revelation"" and its aftermath, the intentions of the mysterious beings and their identities, the ""solution"" to it all, feels very carelessly or vaguely put together. It's a surprisingly sentimental conclusion, but instead of finding the meaning in all of the events, I left with the opposite feeling. I felt as though the characters didn't influence anything with their knowledge, which is ironic considering the title.This reminded me a lot of I Am Legend: both start out good, drawing me in with quality effects, cinematography, score, and mood. Ultimately, however, both cash in on the intriguing premise and setup with a conclusion so (overly) simple, that rather than appreciate the symbolism and beauty of it, I'm left to wonder what the point was, and if there weren't too many ""chefs in the kitchen"" as far as the message of the film is concerned.The only thing I know we're meant to understand is that Nic Cage is the ""Cynic Who Rediscovers His Faith Amidst Disaster,"" and I've just seen that before in Independence Day, Signs, I Am Legend, etc. Hard to say I was disappointed because I didn't have much hope for this movie, but it was surprisingly entertaining until its frustrating end.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I am left speechless - and not in a good way!,"This is perhaps the worst film I have ever seen!!! The trailer gave me fairly high expectations as the idea was intriguing, and boy was it a let down.

I am fairly easy-going when it comes to films, most of the time I quite like the ones that get bad reviews on IMDb, but this was just appalling! I cant see how on earth it has managed to get a rating of 6.3, it doesn't deserve 2.3.

Knowing A Decent Sci-Fi Apocalyptic Thriller With Flaws,"Knowing is a decent sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with flaws from director Alex Proyas whose admirable in making this movie giving audiences some suspense, cool special effects, and well paced intense realistic disaster sequences. A slow pace however, unanswered questions, the lack of character development, and the ending is what weighed it down the most. Nicolas Cage is okay as the main character John Koelster but this isn't his best performance. No offense. If you want to see a good Nic Cage movie I suggest you watch Con Air, Face Off, or Leaving Las Vegas. Rose Byrne does what she can with her small role but her character isn't really developed because most of the focus is on Cage. The rest of the relatively unknown are decent but none one stands out. The movie starts off good because it's weird, different, and there is some suspense but there could've been more. The mysterious men in black were effective in their very limited screen time but they could have been more developed. The disaster sequences are well executed and intense because they look at least for the most part very realistic. The same can go for the special effects which may not be spectacular but they're effective none the less. The film does leave many questions unanswered that I'm not even going to get into because it would take me forever and the ending does sort of reveal some secrets but the conclusion wasn't the greatest. I can see that there might be some message with the way it ends but if they had changed the ending and improved some of the other things that weighed the movie down I probably would have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall despite some flaws though Knowing is a so-so sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with intense disaster sequences, some suspense, a few surprises, and decent performances by the cast but it could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining enough mystery/thriller,"At the start of the movie, a mystery is established: what is going on with a strange primary school girl and the voices she seems to hear? And what is the meaning of a string of numbers she writes down on a sheet of paper to be buried in a time capsule for fifty years?When the time capsule is unearthed fifty years later, and the strange girl's number string comes into the possession of John Koestler's son, Caleb, the mystery is about to resolved. John (played by Nicolas Cage) is a physics teacher who is very good at working out what numbers can mean.There is a thriller aspect to this movie as Caleb (played by Chandler Canterbury) seems to be stalked by some strange, unidentified men. Who are these men? Is Caleb in danger?""Knowing"" combines certain pop/cultural strands of philosophy/beliefs in a surprising way...such that you wonder what adherents of either strand would make of this melding of belief systems.Generally, I think that this movie is interesting and entertaining. Doubt that it would have much, if any, repeat viewing value, but as a 'popcorn' movie for a cinema complex, it works fine. There are plenty of exciting special effects (concerning disasters of various kinds), and an engaging premise that piques your curiosity.The ending is sort of interesting too...there is an element of 'wish fulfilment' to it, perhaps appropriate to the times we live in.If some of this movie's elements appeal to you, you may want to seek out ""The incredible shrinking man"", which does have some overlap with this movie (though it is slight).Recentish 'blockbuster' movies which have repeat viewing value in my estimation include films like ""Watchmen"" and ""Hancock"", which I've reviewed here.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie!,This movie has a lot going for it that you probably will miss if you try to watch it on the screen of a cell phone. It's some of the best special effects I've ever seen...

Wasted number of minutes,"122No special meaning attached to that number, just the number of minutes I wasted watching Knowing, knowing that Nicholas Cage will usually take any job that comes along in rarely a quality film (Adaptation (2002) was the last good one, I believe). John Koestler (Cage), an astrophysicist from MIT, discovers meaning in a random list of numbers pulled from a fifty year old time capsule.It doesn't take him long to figure out the numbers predict disasters since 1959; what he never figures out is what a disaster the film is, a compendium of sci-fi clichés from creepy mute Aryans to a clueless MIT professor, who continues to put him and his motherless son in harms way through stupidity hardly becoming an intellectual.That Koestler lost his wife last year seems a staple now of the genre; that he meets an attractive single mom crucial to the solving of the mystery is another common element. That no meaningful thematic or character development issues color the bland here is painfully obvious after that grueling 122 minutes The last line of the film is, ""This is not the end."" I certainly hope it is; a sequel would leave the free ticket-holder preview audience as burned as the blazing sun in summer at the equator.Let this be the end, please.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Knows a lot! Until the end,"Knowing is one of those sci-fi films that rely on a jaw-dropping ending. Something really well thought out and intelligent. Unfortunately Knowing fails to deliver that impact. The film starts off brilliantly with an interesting flashback to a distant little girl who scribbles a load of numbers into a time capsule. Flash-forward to 50 years later and who ends up getting that picture but Nicolas Cage's son (not his actual son, but you know). I thought the film did quite a good job of building up th characters and creating an involving storyline, so you cared what happened Nicolas and his family. Although some of it was schmaltzy and over-sentimental such as the sign language when his son went to bed, but it made a great effort of caring for the characters.Some of it did defy belief as well, such as randomly noticing that the bunch of numbers had a link to 9/11 but I suppose the story does need something to push it along, whatever that may be. But what's great about Knowing is that it's never boring, thanks to the great build-up to the disasters. The disasters themselves aren't that incredible, but the build-up of not knowing what's going to happen is highly suspenseful. As the mystery unfolds it also becomes incredibly gripping, and you look forward to what the end is going to offer! Unfortunately it doesn't offer much.I found the ending to be incredibly clunky and awkward. It didn't feel as if it fitted within the film and also seemed lazy and plonked. The ending was a total cop-out to me and it's a shame because the build-up getting there is marvellously entertaining, but all you get is a piece of hokum that deserved to be something intelligent. However, Knowing is not an amazingly clever film, it's just a piece of entertainment and it certainly achieves that. Nicolas Cage is as wooden as ever, but if you can over look that, then it's certainly a film worthy of your time (if you can learn to forgive the ending). The special effects are quite impressive too.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Religious theme?,"I haven't seen this film since the release date but i'm sure i have a few comments to put forward still :) I have seen many films with Nicholas Cage and there is none like this. I believe not only is this film based on supernatural beings but also that this film brings a religious point to not conflict it, but instead pair with it.Although not religious myself i am of the understanding that in the bible, God promised a promised land. Could this be a message, i also see the supernatural figures as a representation of angels.However, this could all not be the the point of the film, but that is how i interpreted it.The film brings deep meaning as well as a horror, thriller and action stance to it.7 out of 10 Thanks guys",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You don't have to Know - just check your brain in and give it a chance.,"Knowing is a film that requires the suspension of disbelief, but then so too does The Sixth Sense, Aliens and Terminator 2, and we easily manage with them and they are considered classics. For some reason this has been panned a little for being unbelievable yet a child who can see and interact with dead people does not.In any case the first 90 minutes of Knowing is consistently engaging and for a few minutes outstanding. Unfortunately though it is let down a little through overreaching just a little in the last quarter.Nic Cage plays John, a university lecturer whose wife has passed away and who lives with his son Caleb, who at age 11 ish is finding his way in life and as such is both idealistic (annoying) and wants to be more independent.Caleb attends a school where 50 years previous a time capsule was buried (shown in a brief earlier sequence), on the day of the unearthing each child at the school gets to open an envelope left by a student 50 years prior, Caleb of course gets the one that sets events in motion.Two things before proceeding: 1/ The Time Capsule was ""unearthed"" by two hooks, there was no code, padlock or preventative measures in place to stop theft, and it was in the middle of an open courtyard. You're expecting me to think that for 50 years no mischievous kids thought to pull it up and fill it with dog poop? Or used socks? 2/ The film revolves around an intricate code left by one of the students. 99.99% recurring of the population would have turfed it after a momentary glance, and even if they had decided to look into it there was no way in hell they could decipher it. The movie would be better served if it were titled Not Knowing, but that movie wouldn't have been made would it? Caleb instantly forgets the page filled with numbers, though he does take it home where John somehow deciphers a code from it.In essence some of the numbers relate to historic (and future) dates, followed by numbers which relate to mortality figures in disasters that occurred on those dates, the nerve wracking thing is that there are more dates to come, and that they are all in the near future.John goes to visit the teacher who was present at the original time capsule burial, we find that the girl who wrote the code was a little odd, and that after writing the code she was found in a dark room in a sort of trance. (Things the audience knew from the first scene by the way.) So far, so what really.But the best scene in the film has John stuck in a traffic jam on the way to pick up Caleb from school, as he waits in traffic he realizes what the other numbers in the code refer to, and hi theory is instantly and spectacularly proved correct when a plane falls from the sky in a terrible crash that is both horrible and wayyy cool.The fun bit, there are two disasters left before the code finishes, so now John knows where these events will occur, and the likely death toll, except that the final death toll simply says ""EE"", instead of numbers.(Needless to say when they find out what the code means it's a bit of a bummer.) John has a decision, does he go to the site of the future disaster or stay the hell away? I'll leave that for you to find out, but after a slowish start I found the middle hour of the film quite immersive, even when the circumstances became more convoluted through the introduction of more characters I still wanted to see where it was going. It was only towards the end that I felt the plot went a little too far in trying to ramp up the cool factor that I got a little annoyed.This is a Nic Cage movie, he carries the entire thing and it largely revolves around his performance, which is fine as he is believable here, Rose Byrne comes in after a while as the daughter of the code writing little girl (she had Rose once she was an adult obviously) and does the whole ""This can't be real"" thing for just long enough without it being tiring, and the two kids (by the end) are only mildly annoying mostly.The centerpiece is really the plane crash, for the few minutes leading up to it and the thirty or so minutes after I was hooked and willing to take whatever leap of disbelief they asked of me, only they kept ratcheting up the action and overstepped the mark just enough that they managed to reduce the impact.I still think that Knowing is a fine film and worthy of a look, it doesn't really go off the rails, but the ending did end up costing it some realism and impact, and I thought that by simply toning down a couple of things this could have been a great film.As it stands I put it near Déjà vu as movies with noticeable flaws, but that are good enough that you are willing to ignore or move past them because the filmmakers tried to make something different, unique and exceptional, even though in both cases they didn't quite get there.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. If ever a Director's Cut was needed, this would be it. This could have actually been improved by removing (only) a couple of things. Right now though it is still good, just not great.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Calvinism Redux,"Harrison Ford is clearly the most famous actor with a long history of SF&F films, but Tom Cruise had a nice little run of his own (Vanilla Sky, 2001, 7; Minority Report, 2002, 8; War of the Worlds, 2005, 5). We'll pass quietly over Keanu Reeves. Brendan Fraser has made a career, if not exactly a name, in the genre. And now we need to acknowledge that Nicolas Cage is lending his considerable screen cred to our favorite kind of flix. The question going into this TEOTWAWKI epic is whether it would be a splendid effort like Next (2007, 8) or a disappointment like Ghost Rider (2007, 5). Alas, it's a fuddled testimonial to Calvinism's doctrine of predestination.50 years ago, kids in suburban Massachusetts did a bunch of drawings intended for their new elementary school's time capsule  except for 1 odd little girl, who just filled her paper with endless digits. Cut to 2009, where that paper winds up in the hands of little Caleb Koestler, son of widowed and cynical MIT professor John Koestler (Cage). Among the plethora of digits is the string ""911012996"". Now, you might think that it was the ""911"" that captured Koestler's attention, but no; he writes the string on a whiteboard and then spends some time mulling where to put the slash marks. The ""2996"" is, of course, the death toll on that fateful day, and Koestler soon discovers the dates and fatality counts of many other disasters in the previous half century  plus 3 that are slotted for the next couple of days. Every such entry is also trailed by a string of other digits, and the genii at MIT are unable to figure out at 1st what they mean. (Of my 1st 2 instantaneous hypotheses  location and junk DNA  the more obvious proved correct.) But it's asinine for a fellow prof to liken the predictions to numerology (as in The Number 23) or suggest that maybe Koestler is following in the delusional footsteps of John Nash (brilliantly depicted in A Beautiful Mind) when the numbers are so clearly related to real, and supposedly unpredictable, events.Koestler tries to prevent the predicted disasters, but to no avail. Evidently it's all been written down in the Big Book in the Sky eons ago, and mere mortals are powerless before destiny. It goes on like this, getting progressively gloomier, until we arrive at an improbable ending that makes The Day the Earth Stood Still look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.The acting and effects are quite convincing while you're in the theater, the kids are cute, and the dialog (under the circumstances) is realistic, so the flik isn't an absolute dog.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The story jumped around so much, almost like they made it up as they went.It was an overall bad movie with a horrible ending that made no sense, it had no greater value, spoon-fed you the entire movie (definitely not a thinking movie), and had random parts that jumped around so much but weren't complicated enough to ever make you think, despite its intention to be an adventure and mystery movie.In the end, this movie definitely is not up to par with Nicholas Cage's other adventure movies such as National Treasure or even Next.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Plot - meet holes. Holes - meet plot,"How would one go through life is one would know what would be happening next? It's a question that is silently posed in this film but it's never really answered. It all starts when a young kid, upon being asked to make a drawing to store in a time-capsule does not draw a picture but writes down what seems to be random numbers instead. When years after the time-capsule is opened again the paper with the numbers comes into the hands of a father and his child and the father starts to stare at the numbers, attempting to find a pattern or meaning in them. What he finds scares him more than anything has ever scared him before.This film starts by making one big claim. If one can accept that claim to be truth it turns the film in a pretty standard but OK film with a fun but plot-holed filled story. If one can not accept that claim the film quickly turns into a long series of irritations. It plays out fairly decently, building on the initial claim and adding more twists to it, eventually digging its own grave a bit because it contradicts itself a few times.

Knowing Will Generate Questions,"John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), a professor at MIT, knows which side of the debate he falls on when he teaches his students about choices. Are they random or determined? Stuff just happens, he tells his class. He tries to live his life accordingly. When he's not teaching in class or taking care of his partially deaf son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), he drinks away his sorrows. He's unhappy that his wife passed away in an accident and has taken a passive seat on the life bus. Although like everyone, he wants desperately to know that life isn't a waste, his highest goal has become keeping his son ""safe."" If stuff just happens, he won't let anything happen to Caleb by keeping him home.One day, something happens which challenges his beliefs to the core. His son's school is opening the time capsule a class buried in 1959, 50 year ago. Each student gets to open a letter from a student describing the future. Out of all the letters possible, Caleb gets the most disturbing one, a letter covered with seemingly random numbers. During one of his typical drunken stupors, John studies the numbers carefully and decides the same thing that Richard Dreyfuss did in Close Encounters: ""This means something."" Of course his confidantes all think he has lost his marbles, so John must seek out the truth in an alternate way. He finds a fitting colleague in the somewhat creepy, somewhat attractive Diana (Rose Byrne), who has a connection with the original creator of the letter Caleb opened from the time capsule.This is a suspenseful story, part science fiction, part thriller, which will challenge viewers to decide what they believe in the aforementioned debate. And unlike the sensation we find in some suspense stories, viewers won't have to suspend much belief to go along for the ride. John's journey happens step be step, each event happening in perfectly logical order. Is John creating his own story or is he just following the steps laid out for him long ago? Much of the story is laid out in cold, muted tones. We see how cold John's life is through the lens of the director's camera. When the tone finally changes to warm and bright on the screen, and it is oh so glorious to behold, we understand that John finally knows what he needs to do and is able to do it with 100% of his heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What happens when the numbers run out?,"After a not so hot streak of low end, trashy movies, Nicolas Cage has come back from the dead starring in this high powered apocalyptic horror/sci-fi breed from director Alex Proyas. I've always been a big fan of Cage, but not so much lately when he starred in what seemed to be a slew of uninspired movies that can be compared to garbage eaten by rats. But alas, guided by the right hands of a man with a vision and free reign, Cage returns to form and carries the whole movie all the way through. What's more is that he didn't need to don an ugly looking hairstyle, just a normal one and no killer bees, motorcycles on fire and Thai prostitutes either so my faith in him has been restored. I've heard news that he plans to retire soon, I say no.The man clearly has more to offer and to some, the stench of the havoc caused by Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Bangkok Dangerous is still there. Maybe take another jab at the Oscar gold too. Nicolas Cage aside, I can't figure out what the movie really tries to be. There's part where it passes off as a horror movie and there are parts where the vibe is just pure science fiction. But I call a mix between the two because there's just enough to make it horrific and just the right amount to call it sci-fi. Alex Proyas, the man behind such great films like Dark City and The Crow may have made his best one yet with this movie. Peppered with great CG effects, just the right amount of dialogue for a movie like this and a couple of mind melting scenes that will cause your brain to leak out your ears. I saw it in a theater and I was on my toes the whole time probably because of the effective mood the director has toned it with and the astounding and ear shattering music score by Marco Beltrami.I wouldn't wanna spoil the ending but I can vouch for its uniqueness. Definitely not your typical Hollywood ending one expects it to be, I like how the director probably just slammed it all over the Roman Catholic church with the way the ending turned out and still, leaving a mark and a message that will make an impact to the audience and they won't even see it coming.One of the best films I've seen since 2009 kicked things off.

"Worth watching, although it could have been better","Nowadays, it seems that the attention threshold for the average movie viewer is so high, that directors think they need to rip planets apart in order to be noticed by a wider audience. The movie is without doubt dynamic, with lots of good special effects and tense moments which will grab your attention until the end. But it has some usual Hollywood clichés: over-dramatization and shallow and unrealistic characters (Who writes those silly characters anyway?). The scientific background is mainly credible, there are no screaming misconceptions, like in other modern ""doomsday"" movies. Of course, there are many strong fantasy elements, which can be hardly called scientific, but make the story interesting. I was left with the impression, that with so much effort, money and good actors in this movie, it could have been much better.(like the 90% of other Hollywood production today). With just a bit more intelligent storytelling, it would be probably harder to understand for ""the masses"", but it could be a great movie. Instead of that, it has a somewhat mediocre feel about it, although a few memorable scenes and interesting ideas make it definitively worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should knowingly hate it but I don't,"First off...Knowing is one of the most ambitious ""big movies"" I have seen in a long time. And the first hour of this film is a marvel. Probably one of the best set-ups of any thriller in recent memory. The third act has problems. At times making the third act of the last Indiana Jones movie seem tame. But the ending is very thought provoking. Maybe the most thought provoking ending in a recent sci-fi film since ""A.I."" and ""The Fountain"". Both flawed but daring movies.Visually the film is mostly a marvel. Director Poyas has a firm grasp on powerful visual imagery used repeatedly as motif.Bottom line: this daring film has an amazing amount of craftsmanship, decent enough acting, and very ambitious ideason the downside: ""Knowing"" suffers from enough plot holes to fill.. (insert clichéd line here), Cage has some ""worst acting ever"" moments. And the third act feels like it needed a rewrite or three hundred..I should have hated it...but I can't. It's too ambitious a movie to easily dismiss. And since big budget spectacle movies are never ambitious and very rarely ""thought provoking"", I have to give ""Knowing"" it's props.end kdc",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just Might Have Explained The Greatest Mystery Of All--- Where Did Life/We Come From And Where Are We Going?,"Based on my reading and observation/deep thinking, it seems like DNA/RNA were deliberately designed and then programmed into the first proto-cells billions of years ago, and then these cells were let loose on Earth, pitted against the elements and changing environs, thus leading to natural selection and adaptation. Darwin's theory of natural selection offers a very limited view of how species evolved, and any amount of thinking will clearly display that the varied forms of life on the planet could not have just arisen by natural selection from a common ancestor. THERE HAS TO BE A FORCE AT WORK TO ENGINEER THE FIRST NUCLEIC ACIDS AND THEN CAUSING DRAMATIC SPECIATION AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME! Please note I used the word "" Force"", since I do not believe any of the world's organized religions or their God/gods/goddesses or scriptures stand up to common, rational sense or very rudimentary science They were all made up by men/people to fill in the gaps and make sense of the world as they saw it thousands of years ago, to offer an explanation, an incredulous one, at that. For me, it is way more likely that an advanced race of beings/ entities created the "" Life Experiment"" on Earth billions of years ago, and then let the cells loose to see how this game of survival proceeds, and populations evolve. The panspermia theory alludes to this possible fact as well. I could never have fathomed that I would actually seriously consider this idea, but after much study and deliberation, it stands out as a very strong possibility to me. Kudos to the movie's concept makers for a genuinely original, possible, and maybe the true answer to the greatest mystery of life!.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Knowing--one of the best sci-fi films ever.,"I'm a die-hard fan of GOOD science-fiction, which means I'm extremely critical of sci-fi movies. Too often, you could say nearly always, the studios sacrifice character development and meaning for explosions and effects; if it's good enough for teen-age boys to say ""cool,"" it's good enough for a studio exec to greenlight.Knowing isn't like that. Rather, it gives you characters you can care deeply about, and questions that you will either chew on or which will chew their way in the back of your own mind if it's the slightest bit open.Nick Cage portrays a lonely and cynical astronomer who discovers a 50-year-old sheet of paper, filled with numbers, the apparent meaning of which begins to tear his world apart.You already know that they relate to disasters and possibly the ultimate disaster. But you won't know that this is apocalyptic science-fiction with a mind and a soul. The performances are wonderful, the effects breathtaking, the story compelling. As events unfold, we'll certainly encounter disasters, horror, and suspense, but also love and hope.Knowing is the movie that last year's ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" should've been, but wasn't. It's also the movie that ""Signs"" should've been, but wasn't, or that ""The Last Mimsy"" should've been, but wasn't. It ranks up there with la creme de la creme of the genre: E.T, The Matrix, Donnie Darko.The mingling of science with the supernatural seems to have set the critics in tizzy. Ignore them. They were wrong about Peaceful Warrior, and they are wrong about Knowing. This is not a movie for cynics or critics. Knowing is for people who can suspend disbelief for a couple of hours, and it is well worth that small effort.

"Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.","Teetering between genuinely thought-provoking science-fiction and largely innocuous disaster movie pomp and circumstance, Knowing, which comes from director Alex Proyas (The Crow and I, Robot) is an irksome and mostly disjointed affair. Dealing with characters, situations and plot lines that go a little beyond the usual scope of cinema while offering viewers an experience with the potential to thrill and surprise, this outing for Proyas inevitably crumbles under the weight of its own ambition which is disappointing. Indeed, while the script for the most part portrays its lead character in shades of sheer lunacy and insanity, the movie as a whole can be seen as being just as schizophrenic, if not more-so. It's indulgent, overlong and padded to the brim with needless contrivances, puzzling u-turns and banal digressions that have little or nothing to do with the central theme at hand. The result is a feature that sporadically entertains and even raises interesting questions and ideas from time to time, yet too often falls victim to its own verbose, directionless prophecy babble to the extent where all focus and engagement is lost. Knowing certainly has potential, and this is evident in several startling scenes visceral and sensual, but such potential is never truly tapped or expanded upon. So the viewer is left to squander amongst the ruins of half-finished ideas, disjointed themes and a lacklustre, unconvincing narrative that binds it all together with a sense of bemusement at everything that transpires—sure, it's pretty unnerving and it's definitely got a sense of audacity about it that Nicholas Cage seems to seep out of everything he touches these days, but as a whole is it any good? Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.For all intents and purposes, despite the movie's attempts to fool the viewer during the first two acts, Knowing is first and foremost a disaster movie. Taking place in our current day, some six months down the line after a astrophysicist named John (Nicholas Cage) comes into possession of a series of numbers written down and placed in a time capsule by a crazy kid fifty years prior which predict disasters from that date onwards, Knowing is a disaster movie in every sense. What perhaps could have made the feature a little more convincing and interesting on a visceral or cerebral level however was if it spent as much time expanding upon the ideas of determinism, causality and the eventual allegorical outcome that permeates the whole of the film in retrospect. Instead however, much of the movie resorts to mundane fabrications set up for the sake of giving the audience those big disaster movie CG shots—train wrecks, plane crashes, you know what the deal is. To be fair, Knowing pulls off these moments as good as anything else out there today, but in the end they all feel like inconsequential distractions or derailments from what the script is really trying to say.Taking the theme of predestination and running with it to the extent where Stan Lee's infamous ""with great power comes great responsibility"" came running through my head, the character of John reveals why Nicholas Cage was picked for the job. For the better part of the middle section, John takes it upon himself to try and solve this mystery of numbers predicting dates, numbers of people dead and locations in order to prevent the inevitable. At one point he even estimates that had he been granted this ""window into the future"" sooner, he could have prevented his wife's death (and in turn also killed one of the movie's biggest clichés next to the distant family, lone, gifted son and the mysterious Strangers in the Woods) without giving one second of thought to the complete stupidity of such a concept and irrevocable implications involved with determinism that he flaunts so glibly during the movie's opening act. Sure, you can't blame a guy for getting a little crazy when faced with a possible End-of-the-World scenario, but at the same time you also have to seriously question the plausibility to all that goes on in the twisted world of Knowing when it so obviously and excessively wants you to believe in its tale.The problem however, is that the script is a meandering mess devoid of any sense of compelling pace, or interesting elaboration on anything that it raises in the wreckage that it so ceaselessly creates. The resulting world isn't one that feels like ours, and so the whole disaster element of the movie feels contrived and irrelevant. Furthermore, there isn't much else to say for the ensemble of performances here outside of the fact that they downright stink. Cage, who to be fair isn't known for his humanist shades, is wooden and largely uninteresting as the movie's protagonist-trying-to-save-the-day-whilst-being-a-single-dad cutout. His co-stars are just as blasé and awkward, echoing last year's similar—but much more effective and stylistically distant—disaster romp The Happening in a way that only goes to further the movie's schizophrenic, somewhat alien nature. So in the end we come down to the most tired and truest of cinematic criticisms—if I can't relate to these people, if I can't believe in their plight then what else do I have but some nice looking photographs and a loose form of narrative tying it all together? For some, this will be enough. The fact that the movie takes the whole disaster thing and runs with it to the very end in a coherent fashion is one of the only saving graces here, yet science fiction fans and people just a little tired of these overlong, over-produced distractions will find no real joy here.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Mystery

Better off not Knowing,"Since the plot/storyline has been told and retold I'll not repeat that aspect of the movie but I will say that I don't think this movie knows what it wants to be about. Is it science fiction or drama? Is it a horror film or a comedy (unintended)? Is it spiritual or agnostic, or hopeful or hopeless? Who knows? As many as correctly said, this movie goes off in many directions and ends up nowhere. It attempts to tackle deep issues and by not focusing on any, ends up shallow and pointless. To the movie's credit, there are some good effects but many others are incredibly unrealistic. I disagree with those who see the movie as some kind of Christian message vehicle. Rather, I think the movie uses Christian themes in an attempt at depth but what results is a confused storyline and an unsatisfying movie-going experience.Among the many unanswered questions: Why expose the prophecy to a child 50 years before the climactic event, yet the child chosen to receive the prophecy is not chosen ultimately? What's the point of knowing what's coming if there is no chance to use that knowledge and therefore no hope? What's the point of the stones and the whispering if the extraterrestrials will just end up driving the chosen to the landing zone? These and many other unanswered questions leave me wondering if the filmmakers knew what point they were trying to make. Maybe we're better off not knowing.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Whether it is deterministic, derived from a defined set and sequence of circumstances or just probabilistic (randomness). It is not a unique theme but not explored in this fashion. We have seen it in Matrix, Dark City and few others. But the drama is unique to the film.Knowing is not without some problems, especially with some of the writing as the mystery unfolds, but it is fair to say there is absolutely nothing you can preempt.

Solid drama and acting. Nice effects. Standard cinematography and sets.,"Overall rating 7/10. Acting is good though not exceptional. Lesser actors would have been a disaster since the material really forced the actors to wring the most out of what they were asked to say. Script is pretty standard material for a human drama, safe and uncreative. The plot elements were above average. No eye-rolling took place while viewing. This isn't a must-have or must-see but if you watch it you won't feel let down and it really is good for mixed company. The family drama is a bit tired but whatever, that's Hollywood for you. The action goes beyond the call in terms of CGI effort, and that was a real eye-opener. The cinematography is the same boring stuff you've seen everywhere. People driving, people talking, people hurrying about. Standard shots with standard timing by people who know how to do standard perfectly.

A Decent But Not Spectacular Movie,"22 March 2009. This movie is above average because it appears to deliberately avoid the most obvious movie clichés but just can't completely ignore the screaming, emotionally wrought female scenes nor the male drinking phenomenon of stereotypical movies. The movie also panders to the audience's sensibilities of movie disaster special effects which are designed to make the audience go ooh and awe and almost succeed, though ""The Aviator"" (2004) has a much more potent, in your seat and pants accident scene. For some people, this movie is likely to be somewhat predictable like later Director Shyamalan movies such as ""The Village"" (2004). This movie is also supposedly a ""bittersweet"" family drama with a twist (that supposedly must not be revealed) that is supposed to make this movie more European, breaking the American style, for which it can be given a few bonus points.

Take it for what it isn't,"When a film could have succeeded on tension alone, you know you have a solid film. And when a director can infuse a possibly exasperating or awkward premise with such atmosphere and a sense of impending dread, you know he is the right person for the job. What you will never expect however is the though-provoking and uncompromising direction this Sci-Fi mystery will take you.Director Alex Proyas, like an Edward Zwick, is a master of the intelligent action film; a movie that ripples with philosophical undertones, morals and begs to have deeper questions answered. Like his previous works, I, Robot, The Crow and Dark City, Proyas is able to harness and combine his directorial skills with his own intelligence and knack for chilling atmosphere to make his films much more rewarding then straight up actioniers like Wanted.When I say uncompromising, I do not mean such in every vein of Knowing, perhaps I mean unrelenting or unflinching, as Proyas' vision truly stretches the boundaries of the PG-13 rating, and I had actually take a double take on the marquis on my way out. This leads me to the following statement which is quite bold, but is not an iota less true. There is a scene in Knowing, you have seen it on the TV ads, that is the single tensest, most disturbing and unyielding segment I have ever witnessed it cinema. The special effects, certainly for the modest budget, are stunning and to those who say otherwise are either needlessly comparing it to Transformers or are just looking for a way to slander the film. Three effect heavy sequences perforate the film and they are all awesome, not it the surfer lingo way, but awe-inspiring, mouth agape, drool drippingly spectacular.For the first time in a review I am going to forgo the plot description as you have seen what needs to be seen on the ads, and anything further I say would tarnish the unexpected revelations that conclude this film. As such I will remark upon the acting. Nicolas Cage is finally back doing something I can be proud of following some bland stints in the National Treasure sequel, Next and Bangkok Dangerous and is believable as the everyman and his wound-up trademark acting style is perfect for the scenario. The child actors, Chandler Canterbury and Laura Robertson are very good as well, and it continues to come as a surprise as to the number of skilled child stars working today. Rose Byrne as Cage's ally in his quest is remarkably effective and franticly alarming at times, concluded perfectly with her characters arc.Knowing embodies the stark opposite of the advice you normally hear about movies these days; to ""take it for what it is"". Take Knowing for everything it isn't, for everything it doesn't spell out, for everything question it asks, for every seemingly bizarre revelation that breaks forth. I urge you to mull over Knowing after returning from the theatre, as this film asks important questions and you will be sure come away with far more than you could imagine; knowing isn't everything but trying to figure it out, is.Read all my reviews at: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pseudoscience is Fun in Film,"Numerology is complete nonsense in real life, but I don't understand why people are holding Hollywood accountable for using it in a film about prophetic film? Even still this film was pretty disappointing for a disaster film, it was unique but there isn't nearly enough destruction as you would expect until the last 3 minutes of the film (not a spoiler there is a lot of destruction before it). I tried to be lenient on the CGI of the film but it looked cartoonish and unpolished in comparison to The Day After Tomorrow or 2012. The only reason I'm giving it a higher score is because Nicholas Cage gives a surprisingly good performance along with the child actors Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson who were surprisingly convincing it's a shame it had to be in a mediocre disaster movie. Rose Bryne wasn't half bad either.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sixth Sense, Independence Day , Lost, 10 Commandments, etc...","I actually enjoyed the first part of the movie and the fact it was not the typical sci-fi with a happy ending but there were too many scenes that seemed extracted from other movies like:1- Whispers and Plane crash (with the same close-up of the turbine): LOST 2- NYC destruction: Day the Earth stood still, Independence Day 3- Final scene: one of those biblical movies 4- Aliens and spaceship: War of the worlds, E.T... 5- Little kid glazing at the ""angels"": Sixth senseI have no problems with those references as long as the plot have worked. The movie does a good job in hooking us in and make us think a bit about how life is temporary, but it was quite hard to understand:What is the reason for the premonitions (50 years before the apocalypse)? Just to tell Lucinda where she should go to be saved? Wouldn't the ETs take her anyway? - What was the point of involving Nicolas Cage's character if he could not be saved anyway? He found out about the latitude/longitude where the save was going to happen only to go there and say goodbye?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A different kind of supernatural/sci-fi thriller,"""Knowing"" seems to divide opinions a lot, and I think I understand why. It doesn't really fall into one specific genre, and if you expect it to do so, you might be disappointed. But if you can take it for what it is and try to wrap your head around all its concepts, you might like it.First of all, there is this mystery-solving aspect which I think is the most interesting element of the movie. It really grabbed my attention and gave some chills. But then there's also some supernatural/sci-fi stuff, religious allegory, and the genre of catastrophe film. I think there's enough material for two or more movies, which might have worked even better. But even as it is I liked the movie. I watched it first time about a year ago, and recently wanted to watch again. I think it got even better on the second viewing.One thing that must be said is that this is not a feel-good movie. It's quite bleak - though that also depends on your own worldview. But if you like sci-fi movies that aren't always fluffy but more like asking ""what if"" then you're in the right mindset. The mood also reminded me of some supernatural semi-horror thrillers like ""Mothman Chronicles"", ""The Others"" and other movies that make you feel mystery and wonder. I really like that kind of films so that's why I also liked this one.It's a little bit hodgepodge for a thriller, and perhaps not an easy one, but if you have an open mind for something different, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This film won awards! Why!?,"Not only that, it was considered by some to be the best science fiction film of the year.We are talking about the same film I saw last night. The same film with Aliens, plot holes and the ham-iest acting to be seen outside a butcher's window.I began the movie with ambition. Maybe a sci-fi Mercury rising (I don't mean to say I thought Mercury Rising was a good film, only that I can imagine a sci-fi film based on the same idea working). I knew Cage had a huge tax bill, but, being open-hearted I thought hey, it's late, I've had a drink, why not?But it's SLOW. That's OK, it's a slow-burner. It'll get good. And so I waited and waited.And then aliens landed. Aliens. And, despite myself, and incidentally waking up my girlfriend, I laughed out loud. Awful. Mind you, it wasn't the first time I'd woken up my sonambulent partner during the film: there is a time shortly before Aliens that Cage catches his son automatic-writing, and Cage shouts:""What are you doing?!""Seriously. The whole premise for the film is that Cage works out the hidden meaning in the numbers written in a mad dash by a youngster. Not, incidentally, that that seems to have anything significant to do with the plot. But hang on, towards the end of the film, his son is writing unstoppably, surely this must have some meaning?!No, he screws the paper up and throws it away. That's it. Nada.I envy those who think this film has something to offer the modern audience. Maybe the film is a cynical as I think it is, pandering to the 'ooohhh, he and his son connect through sign-language, that isn't a cliché I've seen thousands of times before' audience, maybe it isn't. But, in the final analysis, for the laughs the conclusion of this dirge provokes, it isn't worth the wait.Awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

By my best judgement only positive part of this movie is the Mazda3, which eventually is a great car (however this is my personal taste only).When the car is not on the canvas, the movie is simply a piece of crap. Most of the time Nicolas Cage's face shows only three types of emotions: 1, dumb 2, desperate 3, dumb againThe rest of the actors are crap as well. The story is really inconsistent. It has some creepy scenes, but if you watch it during the daylight then you would only laugh because these plots only operate with the good old ""it is dark and there are creepy voices"" method.Long story short, after you watch this even oprah will be a relief for you.",,Anonymous,Mystery
It think I enjoyed it... but I'm not sure yet...,"Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me. Overall, I thought the movie was well done. It managed to mix the thriller genre while successfully (to a greater or lesser degree) incorporating both the sci-fi and spiritual elements. Most of it worked. Most.While trying not to give too much away, the plot can be summarized as the story of a widowed father that has resigned himself to the scientific as a result of her death. After a 50 year old time capsule is opened revealing a list of numbers, he begins to notice a patten defining every major catastrophe over the past 50 years. As he follows the pattern, trying to prevent the events to come, he begins to wonder what all of this has to do with him and his son. It is a good thriller and it kept me second guessing myself throughout.I think the hardest part for me with this movie was the special effects. Now, whoever did the graphics certainly did a better job than I could ever do, but as this seemed like a big budget movie and as we've see many movies with similar visual sequences done so smoothly, I was very disappointed and I actually had to try to convince myself to ignore the music video par cgi so I could appreciate the movie. As an example, the fire at the plane scene was very flat and the subway lighting and textures were not believable. Even movies like what pixar has put out have been able to create realistic flowing so the long grass appearing so outdated, again, took away from the believability. Though I will definitely compliment whoever made the object that caused Cage's character to fall to his knees towards the end. THAT was impressive.I think had it not had so many similarities to things such as Signs, or Armageddon, or Die Hard (high tension action), I think it would have gotten a better score.But that said, I would still highly recommend this movie!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not the movie I was expecting.,"A movie that turned out much different than what I thought going in. It's one that I can't really get into without ruining it for those that haven't seen it. We have Nic Cage and his son finding a page full of numbers from a 50 year old time capsule at the son's school. Nic Cage, being the brilliant mind that his character is, deciphers the meaning of these numbers and comes up with specific dates and victim numbers of catastrophes that happened on those dates. Every major catastrophe in the last 50 years is covered plus a few more dates yet to happen.Nic Cage and his crazy hair decide that perhaps these catastrophes can be avoided with the prior knowledge of their occurrence. After a couple of really nifty disasters (the plane crash is really chilling), this movie in which Nic Cage and the daughter of the person who wrote the numbers fight to avert disaster takes a turn that takes the movie to a deeper, horrifying, more unpredictable and (in my opinion) much cooler place that leaves what went on up to the viewer and up for debate.

I enjoyed it but...,"...there are a number of holes in the story.

I'm a big Penn & Teller fan so my first thought would be that someone had already been to the time capsule & put that page in. Elaborate, sure, but more likely than the list being real.Thirdly, his scientific colleague at the observatory was way too off- hand in looking at the data. One might be a coincidence, even a few, but so many matches? Not really plausible it was just random chance. Why didn't he realise it was either an elaborate hoax or really, really weird? Either way it deserved a closer look.Lastly, assuming that human history has an end point, what were the numbers the boy was so feverishly writing down?Nicholas Cage has gone the way of Jason Statham, or Wesley Snipes as an extreme, in that he does so many very ordinary movies now that he can command the big bucks. This is better than many he's done recently but you can see Cage never changes gear out of 1st.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cage saves the day, barely","Nicolas Cage's strong on screen charisma and genuineness makes the actor an archetypal lead for any film that requires saving the world from an impending apocalypse, and it's further evidenced in the otherwise disappointing ""Knowing."" Like an inelegant amalgam of an M. Night Shyamalan movie and a Fundamentalist direct-to-video, Alex Proyas' end-of-the-world sci-fi intriguingly pitches the idea of determinism-versus-randomness at the outset only to devolve into a cacophonous pile of genre clichés.MIT astrophysics professor and preacher's kid John Koestler (Cage) has long abandoned his faith since his wife died a year earlier, finding solace in his firmly held belief that everything is an arbitrary result of complex chemical and physical reactions. However, on the 50th anniversary of his son's (Chandler Canterbury) school, each student is given a piece of paper that was buried in the ground by a group of schoolchildren in 1959, wherein drawn are the future as they envision it. John's son receives Lucinda Embry's (Lara Robinson) paper scribbled with seemingly random numbers, but as John closely inspects it, he realizes that these numbers are the dates of the major tragedies to have happened in the last five decades, and three more are about to take place.As he has demonstrated most recently in ""I, Robot"" Proyas is a proficient director of mood and visual exhibition, yet just as with the the Will Smith-starrer, ""Knowing""'s promising ideas never translates into a lucid unit, tripping into a second act filled with heavy-handed religious undertones and a grab-bag of copiously borrowed scenes from its predecessors, culminating in an oh-so hackneyed Creationist tableau. ""Knowing""'s overt portentousness dilutes whatever arresting display it has, though it's all made at least mildly tolerable by the charismatic Cage who finds himself the quintessential guardian of the world that how apt, then, he almost becomes the savior of a possibly absolute schlock.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You have to wait for it,"but it kinda pays off. For most of this movie, I sat there with a smirk on my face. The dialogue was pretty hard to take and some of the plot was pretty silly in how convenient everything was.

Unfortunately the ending was taken from a very popular song from the 80s which immediately starting blaring in my head. I really don't see how that could be a coincidence.It's interesting the thoughts that go through your head while watching a film. At one point I was thinking ""How much money does Nic Cage have now?"" And I got to that point because I realized he's been making action movies for 10+ years and he started off as a really good and quirky actor. But now he just runs around solving puzzles and averting disaster. I'd really like to see him act again. He must have enough money by now.The movie is more of a horror movie than I was expecting. It's not gory or anything but it's full of horror elements and if you're comparing it to most horror films it's better than most of them. But there are many points where it's unintentionally funny. Still I have to give it credit, because it's trying to say things. It uses familiar elements but isn't like most movies you've seen. And I'll tell you the truth, I did not see this cribbed ending coming at all. Even though I've always hoped that is what will happen in that circumstance.There is some hammy kid acting and we really need to figure out what to do about Cage's hair. But this movie was watchable.

A Nutshell Review: Knowing,"It's been quite a while since Alex Proyas was at the helm of a film, the last being I, Robot back in 2004 where he adapted Isaac Asimov's science fiction classic of the same name. He continues to dwell in the sci-fi realm again with Knowing, with leading man Nicolas Cage plucked from his National Treasure roots because his character here, MIT professor John Koestler, follows in the tradition of running around everywhere in search for answers and the truth.A widower, John's world consists of his estranged parents, sister Grace (Nadia Townsend) who pops by his home every now and then to check up on him, and his son Caoeb (Chandler Canterbury), and if this was a film other than sci-fi, you would've suspected that there's some incestuous relationship between John and Grace being suggested at, which I thought Proyas had failed in toning the downright awkward looks they are passing at each other.But what Proyas succeeded, was the crafting of great atmosphere in keeping you guessing along with the characters, building up tension when necessary, but being succinctly to the point without dragging it out when it served no more purpose. It starts in the 50s where a time capsule is being assembled and the students are tasked to draw a picture each of what they perceive as the future. A girl who has been acting strangely had listed down a whole page of seemingly random numbers, which her teacher abruptly took from her to be sealed into the capsule.Fast forward to today, and it's preordained that Caleb would be the recipient of that strange sheet of numbers, which he brings home and John begins to decipher it while high on alcohol, only to discover that there's a pattern to those randomness, and so begins the quest in search for the truth, hunting down that little girl's offspring Diana (Rose Byrne) in between running from a handful of beings who seem to only want to communicate with children.There's this very strong theme running through the movie about randomness versus decisiveness, with one camp believing that everything's an independent development from one another, rather than a sequence already determined and laid out. It's like destiny, whether one has the option and choice to change it, or just perceived to have the ability to do so without any to begin with. When the numbers finally revealed themselves to mean something, could anything be done to prevent some of them from happening, leading to the ultimate event that seemed like a page out of the Book of Revelations. It too served as a cautionary environmental warning, though only fleetingly, in telling us how important the ozone layer is to our world, without which we would find ourselves in some really deep trouble.I suppose Proyas continues to be bitten by the special effects bug, given some groundbreaking CGI some many years back, which continue to be dabbled in and employed for this film, accentuating three key action sequences that would make any disaster movie feel envious. I've always been in awe at Final Destination's airplane disaster and that from Kairo/Pulse, but the catastrophe here upped the ante for the next film to follow suit, given a perfect continuous single take that deserves a second viewing. And the disasters shown here, no doubt only possible through CGI, puts one in the driver's seat and gives you a first person's perspective in how one would bear witness to such events, should one be there and then at the site. Nothing less than jawbreaking, I tell you, as it doesn't flinch from its intended violence, nor gratuitously glorifying such moment.It's been a while since we've seen a thinking man version of an action flick such as Deep Impact, and Knowing firmly rests with that film in being one amongst those that socks it right into your emotional core. Science fiction fans may be apprehensive after Hollywood's last big budgeted flick with The Day The Earth Stood Still, but Knowing comes definitely recommended and surpasses the former in almost every aspect.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Knowing nothing,"Monday evening we were expecting a great film after viewing the trailer (and buying our tickets at 16 euro! what a terrible waste).Sadly this movie wasn't even an attempt to be a good one. It was so bad in every way possible: the actors were so unbelievable, you feel nothing when you watch the movie (no emotions), the 'disasters' were very disappointing ('put in loads of blood spatters, fire and horrible noise. the crowd will love it'... No Hollywood, we don't!). And finally, the worst of all > the most stupid ending ever!!! All you can think is, why can't they make a good story out of this? This film just tried to be a bit of everything: horror, thriller, disaster (like cloverfield, the mist and war of the worlds), 'scary children will frighten people' (the grudge, the ring, omen), and some sci-fi ...If you really really want to see this film, just wait and rent it. Do not spend your money on this one. There are much better films out there! But the producers and director of Scary Movie will not have to look far for a new story of there next parody.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Plot holes, intuitive leaps and religious innuendo?","If, like me, you expect to see a movie about Cage running around trying to prevent incredible heart-stopping disasters from occurring before they happen (as any logical plot would of taken), you're going to be sorely disappointed.I've seen a number of films where I expected one thing and got something else entirely. While that's not always a bad thing, sometimes the alternate path turns out to be ruinous. Such is the case with ""Know1ng"".First off, the way in which Cage's character first comes to realize the list is more than just a list of random numbers requires an ENORMOUS amount of forgiveness on the part of the viewer (Cage *just happens* to pick THAT particular sequence of numbers and JUST HAPPENS to break them up in a way that looks like dates without ACTUALLY breaking the numbers up into dates (clue: there is no ""91st"" minute, hour, day or month, so why did he separate it that way??? No logic behind it.) He's an MIT professor, so I guess we're not supposed to be smart enough to understand his thought pattern? Then Cage's character makes some intuitive leaps based upon mere coincidence. One or the other would already require a suspension of disbelief, but PLEASE don't compound them. Believing one coincidence is bad enough.The final disastrous straw is when the movie moves headlong... and entirely unnecessarily... into Religious innuendo. I won't spoil it for you if that's the kind of thing that might attract you to this movie, but ""Know1ng"" turns out to be a vehicle simply for pushing ""Chri-Fi"" (religious science fiction).All-in-all, an enormous disappointment. The movie could of been a great action flick but instead tries SO hard to be something it's not, that it eventually becomes something else entirely. If you're still curious, wait for the video.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Creepy and Disappointing,"I didn't enjoy Knowing. The story didn't make any sense and the film was fairly depressing. It's a big budget Hollywood movie so it's well made and has excellent special effects. However If you have had a stressful week and are looking for some light entertainment, this film is probably not for you. I considered walking out, it was one of the worst films I have seen in awhileThe film starts in 1959 with a strange little girl is able to predict catastrophic events where lots of people die. She deposits a page of numbers into a time capsule which is re-opened in 2009. She forecasts the end of the world and becomes a very odd woman who dies living alone. Nick Cage analyzes patterns in the numbers and bizarre things start to happen.Nick Cage's character is not very appealing. He plays an alcoholic, MIT professor who grieves for his dead wife. Cage's character is unhappy, estranged from his family and won't let his young son do normal things like play soccer or stay with friends. The movie features creepy aliens who turn up periodically and just watch, we don't find out their role until the end.Biblical prophesy is mentioned and there is some discussion about predestination but you feel it's just been included to appease any Christians who might be watching. You never discover how the aliens, the Bible and the little girl's predictions all fit together. The aliens could be working with God but it's all rather confusing and hard to understand. At the end of the day I didn't care, because it all seemed very silly.There are several catastrophic events which look spectacular on screen, but the acting is overwrought and the film gloomy. Overall,it's a movie to avoid.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A disaster,"This movie was a disaster. Ugh. It was part Close Encounters/sci-fi, part disaster (and how much more disastrous can you do than the destruction of the ENTIRE WORLD...sheesh), part horror/suspense, etc. etc. The attempts at sentimentality were pathetic at best. Nicolas Cage looked awful in the role of an alcoholic single dad. The plot was clearly influenced by humanist/vonDaniken scifi theology and even cultic beliefs (i.e. Heaven's Gate cult), and it's ""explanations"" for famous Bible stories (i.e. Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, angels, rapture) were offensive. What a depressing and hopeless movie. Seeing this movie in the theater has reminded me afresh to check movie reviews before plunking out $10 for a ticket. What a waste of money.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie sounds like the Dresden code doomsday prediction.,"The theme of the movie appears haunting analogous to the Dresden codex from the Mayan civilization. This code made between 1200 to 1250 BC appears to have various astrological predictions of various eclipses and other events that will be occurring. One notable even was a solar eclipse in July 1991 that was predicted accurately.However, there was one weird aspect of this prediction. It was stated that a ""meeting of the brethren"" would be occurring on that date. On Mexico, where this eclipse occurred there was a number of UFO sitings recorded on video and observed by many eye witnesses.This same codex has an end date of December 12, 2012. Mausumi Dikpaki, of the National Centre of Atmospheric Research (can be googled) suggests that a solar storm will occur on that year that's stronger than any other solar storms in history. Sun activity is now actually lower than usual, which she calls the eye of the storm. She predicts a 30-50% stronger solar storm than ever before. This means there is a possibility that a strong solar storm could really occur around that time as predicted by that codex.If you were to take analogy with the movie's motif, such as the numbers on the paper in a time-capsule predicting events of the future and compare it to this codex, you add the UFO alien element, as with the 1991 solar eclipse seen over Mexico as validating the authority of predictions of this codex. Then the movie takes on a more haunting and scary tone.The aliens in the movie are actually ""Nordics"". They are tall, blondish human looking people that are commonly seen in Europe. If you take all these sort of elements and make a creative work of fiction -- then you have something like this movie ""Knowing"".I actually appreciated the theme of the movie and it's inspiration for me to do this private research from a tip I got watching ""Mexico Roswell"" from UFO files last year and looking more deeply into the Dresden codex leading into a deeply rich intellectual experience.After doing the research, this is a brilliant fictional story, taking mythological beliefs and stories and making some sort of compilation. If you are well versed in this sort of stuff, this movie will freak you out, guaranteed. Not because of the cheesy acting through, but more what it represents.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very underrated,"Knowing is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. The story is a real attention getter. Nicholas Cage & Rose Byrne both are fantastic in lead roles, in fact I would say this is Cages best effort. The Easter eggs(white rabbit) no pun intended are throughout the film. I won't spoil the storyline other than to say it is an end of days film that won't offend Christians, even though it doesn't follow the Revelation 100%.

We may rub shoulders with people that have the same gifting as the young girl and not even know it and we just think they are strange.

Start As You Mean To Go On,"I recall a time when Nicolas Cage was a really decent actor. These days he seems to be cashing in on this frankly, bygone reputation. Knowing is one of those movies that starts really rather well, but ends up sitting on the fence. A religious nut's wet dream, it goes so far off it's original course that it forgets it's own identity altogether and literally makes it up as it goes along.There are some nice pixelated effects during the film, but it isn't enough to carry it through on the strength of this. Again, while it does well at first, it is let down by someone at the studios giving carte blanche to the CGI guys, who really do push things so clearly beyond the capacity of their tools that a good deal of the effects look unreal and plastic. Less definitely would have been more here.Nicolas Cage puts in yet another lacklustre performance here, content to do 'just enough' to warrant his over-inflated pay cheque, while the other actors and actresses are frankly average or at worst, forgettable. The soundtrack does enough as do the sound effects, but the real problem here is the script and screenplay - when it works, it works well and keeps the viewer intrigued, but when it doesn't it's almost unwatchable.So, all in all, an average film that reminded me of so many mainstream movies of late. It works for a while, but when the initial intrigue has faded and deeper questions are being asked, it simply refuses to give a straight answer and reverts to type. I'm rating Knowing at 6.0 out of 10, because it genuinely does start well - just turn it off after about an hour and you wont be disappointed. Shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It too have some good scenes and one or two thrilling moments but for that we cannot tolerate a whole movie. Its plot too similar to various movies we have seen before including his own movie Next. Screenplay also not so good including some awful scenes unnecessary to the plot. Not only Cage non of the actors given their best performances. Background score is OK but it should have been done better considering it is a thriller(not me). Don waste your precious dollars on this movie wait for DVD.

Lots of reviews...,"Given that the storyline has many elements that give an appearance of a depth that doesn't really exist in the movie (for example, the idea that everything is totally planned out - but it doesn't quite turn out that way)... However, reading a review that points out similarities with a Scientology theory I can quite easily see a parallel and possible hidden agenda.It's quite a shallow film with some imagined depths - mostly supplied by the viewer. It gets you thinking a little, and it's an enjoyable movie. It tends to fall down and frustrated me a little toward the end; but then the end is a cool ride that leaves you feeling good (even if it is trashy).It's not too hard to zone out and suspend brainpower. After trying to work things out for the first half, you're ready to watch the second which delivers a shot of endorphines and leaves you not feeling too bad about being cheated.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A mindless, heartless waste of time","""Knowing"" begins quite promisingly (despite very overt and simplistic introductions to the main characters and their emotional history that already didn't bode well for the rest of the story), and the one good thing that can be said about it is it has very well crafted special effects. But it goes downhill really, really fast, with wooden acting, a flawed story, and shallow characters with unbelievable turns in their basic beliefs and premises. This movie has a lasting place in my mind as one of the most lovelessly made movies I've ever seen, and any good that it may cause by provoking deeper questions in some of its viewers, it poisons by a naive, shallow, and heartless depiction of religious mythology fit to destroy any notion of joy or happiness.

"Knowing is everything, and this film knows!!","What do we really know about the end of the world? Is there a pattern to predicting the future? These are the question's that this Alex Proyas directed Sci-Fi disaster film asks, it asks whether or not we believe in destiny or fate( which ever you believe in.) is real or not, weather it is just fiction or something more. Personally I believe in both, and this film explores both of those strange and bizarre occurrences . Nicholas Cage stars as professor Johnathan "" John"" Koestler a man who's son amazingly stumbles upon a strange list of number's listing all the global disaster's for the last fifty years.Now he set's out to try and stop these last few event's from happening, but can one man really out run his fate? or the end of the world for that matter. Knowing presses a question that we all know, how will the world end? Well knowing takes it one step further and try to map out how will happen in it's own terms. This film puts a not so arch typical hero against the force of nature and puts our most frequently asked and most pondered question on the silver screen. Knowing how the world end is something we could never understand, this film brings it full center and opens us up to a world we've never know or seen before. Knowing is a definitely going to the Oscar's for visual effects and it's music and is surely going to please and shock audience's for all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Make up your own mind,"With Knowing it is not so much a question of 'is it any good' or 'is it bad', it's a question of 'do you like Nicolas Cage'.Personally, I have no idea why this guy has starred in as many films as he has and Knowing is no different. Nicolas Cage has got to be one of the most talentless, uncharismatic and unnatural actors ever. If you don't like Nicolas Cage (and he doesn't really do this film any favours) then you've had it, basically. OK, that's Nic out of the way.Knowing is what it is, it's a film. Not only that, it's science fiction. There is your first clue. Don't try to take it seriously. Secondly, and more importantly, it's not a bad film. It's flawed, yes, but then again what film isn't? In fact, Knowing is quite well made, and it would be even better if it didn't have Cage in it (although this is one of Cage's better efforts). Despite some average performances, the film is well paced, it's atmospheric, well scripted and pretty well shot with good CGI effects, and if you like obscure science fiction then chances are you will enjoy this. That's all there is to it.Ignore the talk about Scientology propaganda and how idiotic the storyline is – it's science fiction! If you're planning a night in, and you're stuck for something to watch (and you don't mind Nicolas Cage), then you could do a lot worse than Knowing.Just watch it and make up your own mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A rather weak mixture of everything,"This movie was disappointing, I was expecting something meaningful and smart.

And, if they want to save humanity, why destroy it in the first place? It would make some sense if at least the film pointed out how humanity is deteriorating itself and living selfishly, destroying the environment we live in, but no, it is not even referred to...I don't even want to go into details other than this movie was clearly a religious propaganda and did not make any sense at all.

Somewhat Interesting,"Most of the comments here on IMDb already make clear that which I wish to comment about the movie itself, I got more to add, i will spear you, because that would be mostly about basic mistakes in film making. What i really wish to comment upon is the subject of this movie as such, especially after having watched the special feature that came with the DVD trying to tackle the subject of the coming Apocalypse. I thought the feature would have been a hell of a lot better, or at least it promised to be so at the beginning, maybe when it spoke of what we have learned from the past, but not the future. it was way too magical, and mystical. What i wish to point out is that when the dinosaurs seized to exist, it did not mean that life on earth seized to exist. Eventually we came along, there was us, humans. however it does not mean that we are anymore important then the dinosaurs were. At some point there was an amoeba which evolved into the frog and eventually that frog, maybe to attract a mate gave out its first croak, but just like that frog had no concept that its croak would eventually evolve into all the languages of the world, with Shakespeare and Dostoevsky and what not, then neither can we possibly conceive whats to come. We might know a lot, achieved a lot, but in contrast with the universe we might be no greater then that cow that thinks it very smart to chew on some grass, we are just a crap idea.

An entertaining watch,"""Knowing"" (2009) is one of those movies that grabs your attention with an intriguing concept and keeps you hooked with its mystery and suspense. The plot, while ambitious and unique, sometimes feels like it bites off more than it can chew, especially with character depth and emotional weight. The film builds tension effectively but doesn't always make you feel invested in the people involved. Nicolas Cage delivers a solid performance, carrying the film with his usual mix of intensity and brooding energy. The directing by Alex Proyas is well-executed, creating an eerie, unsettling atmosphere that keeps things engaging. Visually, the cinematography does a great job of amplifying the film's apocalyptic themes, with some standout sequences that are both haunting and well-shot. The CGI, though not perfect, holds up for the most part.The script has its strong moments, especially in its pacing and mystery elements, but it leans heavily on exposition at times, which can make certain parts feel more like a lecture than organic dialogue. The score adds to the eerie and suspenseful tone, effectively building tension in key moments. While the film might not be a masterpiece, it is still an entertaining watch with an interesting premise, good directing, and some genuinely tense moments. If you go in without expecting deep character exploration and just want a gripping mystery with a bit of a sci-fi twist, it's definitely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Knowing was great....until the ending.,"So Nicholas Cage is back with the latest offering with a combination of a sci-fi, disaster and puzzle movie, mixing the likes of The Day After Tomorrow, The Da Vinci Code and Independence Day.This movie starts off very promising with a time capsule that is found buried, Cages son gets a piece of paper with just lots of random numbers on, but Cage works out that they show the times, dates and location of every major disaster in the last fifty years.Throughout we see Cage in a panic trying to work out when the next disaster will hit and at the same time trying to protect his son from a bunch of strange people who don't speak English, it turns out there aliens.All the way through I was on the edge of my seat with the story like what was happening? Who were these strangers hanging about Cage's son? What happens when the numbers on the paper ran out? There was plenty of excitement and tension and the acting was reasonable but then in the last twenty five minutes, the film just spiralled down here into lame superficial silliness. I was literally just sitting there and thinking ""oh right"" The ending (not to ruin for anyone who still wants to see this) just didn't make any sense. How it ended just isn't explained and it felt like a massive let down. I was originally going to give this a nine or ten out of ten but I felt so let down I had to give it less.Other people I have spoken to about this film said the same thing.

what I was thinking before the shock entered my mind,"I went to see this movie because the trailer made me curious what was all the fuss about with those mysterious numbers. now I've seen the film, I can split it in two: the first half was boring as hell. Nicolas Cage acted as if he was looking in a mirror. he was the worst actor of the picture. they could easily replace him with Kevin Costner. Costner may be a diva (as I have heard), but I really really like him. but Cage? what was the last movie where he was in that was good? anyway, so here I was trying to look at my watch, because the time seemed long. this movie was even worse than Disaster Movie, which is a movie that must be appreciated by the total sum and not the parts. lucky for me, this Knowing flick had a fantastic second half, which made me forget all about the first. by that, it made the total sum correct. this movie is BEEPing great. not superb, but still good. the second part was all about these terrible things that happen (maybe the numbers have an actual reason???) and the first accident really blew me away. it shocked me. not with electricity, but just with the content (which I will not reveal for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet). the only thing I can complain about, is the trailer. it shows us too much already. so take my advice, avoid the trailer as possible but don't miss this film!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An extremely enjoyable movie with a horrible Title,"I almost skipped out on this highly well made film because of Nick Cage's previously two films and the fact that from the previews that this looked like a Davinci Code rip off. This movie is much better than the Davinci Code (and nothing like it). Cage plays a scientist who discovers that a recently unearthed time capsule has a numbered piece of paper that predicted major future catastrophes where there is a high body count. Being a scientist, this challengers his way of thinking (obviously) and he is on a quest to find out what's next. Also thrown into the mix is the fact that not only is he brilliant, but he is a single father of a very intelligent young boy.So let me just say this, this movie is rather PG13 and its is extremely intense for children. In fact, because of some of the images, I am surprise this film didn't get an R rating. I would not take anyone under the age of 15 to this film. I heard audience members saying that they are going to have nightmares and about 5 people left because it was so intense. I am a grown man and the accident scenes were some of the most intense I've seen in movies. But it was 100 percent believable. I got to warn you though, the first half of the movie (30-45 minutes) is a bit slow and dry, but once the film gets going, it moves at a pretty good clip. This is a summer blockbuster type of movie that has such a bad title, that the title itself (and the so-so preview) may prevent people from going to this movie. But the special effects are FIRST class. And the film didn't over do it (like the Day After). It's a drama/action/horror movie and its awesome. I highly recommend going to this film and seeing it on a big screen. You will surprise yourself on how much you will like it. I sure did. Still, I cannot stress this one point enough again. There are some extremely intense, graphic images that isn't appropriate for children and because of the theme of the movie, you may find that your kids will need some reassuring from you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Familiar Cage fare with must see CGI sequences...,"An interesting tale that I went into blind. Again, this newfangled notion of Knowing all about the various aspects of a film spoils things. More than likely, it is because I am growing older and used to a movie naturally unveiling its secrets and charms. Perhaps, the youth of today, who were born into the information age are naturally conditioned to expect a synopsis that will make sense with the subliminal every-scene-flashed-before-your-eyes trailers. At any rate, it was nice to let this one unfold on its own.Knowing is a decent, well made film. It stars Nicholas Cage. Cage is a reliable actor because he plays himself, as he believes the character would be as Nicholas Cage. Audiences accept Cage in this way. We like him as a measured lunatic (Honeymoon In Vegas), a funny lunatic (Vampire's Kiss), and a full on lunatic (Wild At Heart). When allowed to, Cage steps out of his skin and into roles fashioned for the big boys (Leaving Las Vegas). He excels in such surroundings, but you get the sense he does not love them.Chandler Canterbury is fine as Cage's young son burdened with having to grow up too soon. Rose Byrne turns in a nice performance as a link to the to the mystery Cage so desperately needs to resolve. Both provide welcome company to Cage's tossed-into-the rabbit hole existence.Special effects abound, and the CGI just keeps getting better with each new release. 'Knowing' has some profoundly realistic CGI sequences that are a must see for fans of FX. The computer gaming industry pushed visual and audio technology to greater heights until Hollywood got a hold of it. The town did what it does best: make magic. These days, teams of amazing technologists can be as important to a film as the cinematographer. They will one day replace them, when exterior locations are too unhealthy for filming.My only grousing with 'Knowing' is in some of the run of the mill goofy movie dialog. However, it is minimal, and I tried to chalk it up to the characters 'state of shock' disposition. I would have liked to see a bit more science, especially from the academia angle that was introduced early on. However, it is addressed in the 'special features' section.The story line is pretty much equal parts fantasy and science. As a sci-fi fan, I rate the film a respectable six out of ten tribbles. I would like to compare this film to some favorable films I have seen, but it would give too much insight into the plot. In addition, I would rather be sparse in a review so you might enjoy the surprises as well.'Knowing' is a nice rental when you're in the sci-fi mood.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The 3rd Act Took Away Their 8/10 Stars,"The First Act was intriguing and set us on a mystery path. Very solid work and grounded performances. Oh course Nicholas Cage is Cage..The Second Act really kept you on the edge of your seat and the way the story was unravelling made your jaw drop at parts and heart race. Emotions of sorrow for sure during this time.Then the Third Act... Boy... I must say.. from holding that Hold to the Very End, Minus the Truck Scene ( You'll Know) , was just jumping the shark... Lost its balance and just took away from the entire experience that the movie was leaving us with.This movie would've been great if the ending was more of a grounded our reality idea/conclusion instead of one that didn't make sense for ""real life"".All in All I still do suggest it to people, however tread lightly at the end or embrace yourself for impact.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Talks a lot about logical causality, but has little of its own","An interesting enough premise, but enough plot holes to sink the surface of the planet into the ocean before any of the catastrophic prophecies scribbled in numerology have a chance to occur.It makes no sense for Lucinda's 1959 time capsule note to predict anything to anybody, even if they could decipher it in the absurd manner we see in the film, so why was this information ""whispered"" to her in the first place? When MIT Prof. Nicholas Cage (in an uncanny duplication of his American Treasure character) randomly picks out (from hundreds of mysterious) numbers that he reasons to be the date and death toll of an infamous event, it's weird enough, but ultimately, there seems to be no apparent rhyme or reason for him to do this in light of the larger order of things that happen later on. There are many ""Well, why didn't they just do such and such?"" questions in your mind by the end; many elements of the story end up brazenly glossed over and disconnected.There's some decent symbolism for several points of view that are presented in the story, but the film is too chicken to establish any stand towards anything. Instead, it thrusts a salvo of conflicting philosophies, and tries to stew them into a center intersecting place that ends up patronizing everyone, no matter what their view. Religion, Randomness, Determinism, Science, Science Fiction, even Ancient Alien Astronaut Theory, and others clash and collide with enough force to cause catastrophes without any help from accidents or nature.Still, the film is an absorbing watch; it's even one of the more entertaining movies about this subject matter, which has been the foundation for many predecessors to this one. I've never been much of a Nicholas Cage fan, but his one-note approach seems to fit here, considering the grand futility of his situation. The supporting cast (especially the always dependable Rose Byrne) do pretty well with what they're given. The movie's best moments are saved for last: the two climactic closing scenes pull no punches and are contrasted one to the other brilliantly.Far from perfect with illogical plot development, but overall a fair movie for an evening rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"'Knowing' provides good effects, a intriguing premise, but little else","The premise of Knowing is simple, yet intriguing: A man links numbers with disasters and finds several have not happened yet. I wasn't sure what to expect. But what I got was some decent effects; that's it. Knowing provides many ridiculous, laugh-worthy scenes using these effects. Like many movies now a days that have loose ends in the script, the writers tie them together with the simplest way- a twist. Knowing's is so ridiculous and stupid, but is still completely boring. Another problem is the acting. Recently, Nicolas Cage has become infamous for overacting in titles like Ghost Rider and the terrible Wicker Man remake. Knowing is no exception. Cage is frequent to random acts of violence, like ripping things off of walls, throwing things, and attacking trees (yes, really). No one else is a particular good actor or actress either. The bottom line is Knowing is entertaining, but for its effects (in certain scenes, not all) and unintentionally hilarious moments.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A slow sci-fi flick.,"For a movie that deals with the apocalypse, it was really quite a bore. Numbers ... disasters ... fate ... destiny, these are themes of this seemingly long and dragged out movie. This has to be one of the longest two-hour movies made by Hollywood. The action drags, the acting is humdrum and the story is devoid of any suspense. Even the scene with the airplane crash quickly loses its initial dramatic impact. Nicholas Cage gives a solid but uninspiring performance as a college professor with a secret that cannot possibly grab anyone's interest. The best part of the movie is right before the final scene when the earth ... well, if you really want to know what happens go watch the movie, but if you leave the movie feeling a little let down or just plain tired, don't blame me because I told you so.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Original, entertaining, and fun!","What else do you need from a movie? This film gets a lot of hate, and yes we all know Nick Cage is not one of the all time great actors, but if the top billing actor is all you look for in order to conclude if a movie is ""good"" or ""bad"" then you have missed out on a lot of good movies.This is a fun film that has the rare quality of an original plot and storyline within the ""world ending disaster genre"". It kept me entertained and was able to get me interested in the resolution to the story and how things were going to unfold and conclude. Isn't that exactly what a movie is supposed to do? Films aren't supposed to always be the best and most original story ever told. They are supposed to tell ""A"" story and make you interested in how it plays out. Nowadays we don't even get original stories anymore let alone original stories that are an entertaining watch.It's not in my top 5 films of all time by any means, but it was worth the watch and was entertaining the whole time. The acting was fine and certainly included some textbook Cage, but who cares?If you've been wanting to watch this movie but weren't sure if it was worth it because all the meaningless dislike for it, as far as I'm concerned you should ignore those who trash this film and watch it. I'm willing to bet you will enjoy the story, find yourself interested in the resolution of the questions presented, and in the end you'll be satisfied with your decision.

Good movie... One to see.,"MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS -- nothing specific This may not be the greatest science fiction movie since ""2001,"" but it is good nonetheless. It is better science fiction than all of Spielberg's films put together.Seems to me that a lot of Europeans commenting on this movie resent that it has a (relatively) upbeat ending. My suggestion is, go plow $100M into a movie that is a complete downer, and see if you have profits from it to do another one. Audiences (and especially American ones) are not willing to pay $10 to see a movie and come out of the theater feeling they need to go see a shrink in the morning. That's just a simple, hard economic realty.Nick Cage is far from being my favorite actor but he has been in a number of good movies with interesting stories. This is one. I thought he did a workmanlike job of playing the grieving widower, and the nightly drinking to ease his pain was especially believable, without it (thankfully) being a major plot-point. The young, troubled, and ultimately hysterical young female lead was also very believable.The disaster scenes were grisly and disturbing. Cage did a great job of post-traumatic shock that was played just right.I was surprised by the ending and thought it was an interesting mix of both hope and loss.I had a few moments of disbelief at certain plot points, but they are quibbles.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The only disaster not predicted here... was the movie itself.,"Considering Nicolas Cage's recent filmography, expectations for Knowing are already pretty low, but there was hope in that Alex Proyas, a director who seems to have mastered a fascinating Gothic/sci-fi hybrid in previous cult classics such as Dark City and The Crow, could produce the goods. However, despite being well shot and often being unsettlingly atmospheric, the film could never hope to overcome such a messy and cliché screenplay.When Caleb, well acted by young Chandler Canterbury, receives a list of numbers from a school time capsule, his father John (Nicolas Cage) who is conveniently an astrophysicist doesn't take long to figure out that the numbers correctly predicted every major disaster for the last fifty years. The plot thickens when John becomes obsessed with stopping three predictions yet to occur.What was a moderately intriguing premise is heavily handled, using every possible cliché with soap opera dialogue to accompany it. Cage doesn't do much with the material either, basically just looking miserable to be there, but can you blame him? Australia's Rose Byrne is a cast highlight, but once again in undone by an overwrought script principally requiring her to shriek and sob for the children.The disaster scenes themselves are conversely spectacular with dazzling special effects. These scenes are well orchestrated and become the highlight of a dull film, communicating the horror of the disasters effectively. There are also other little moments of genuine suspense that intrigue, but are ultimately bogged down by surrounding tripe capped with a conclusion that had audience's chuckling and eye rolling.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's what bad movies are made of,"I watch at least a movie a day and I generally consider myself an easy spectator. And I even come to enjoy bad films with extremely thin plot and even thinner acting.However when it comes to Knowing even indulgence cannot come to the rescue of that P.O.S.Knowing should not have been one of the six hundred movies produced by Hollywood this year. This movie doesn't bring anything to anyone. There's no funny dialog, there's no witty comments, there's no scientific background, there's no beautiful landscape, there's no thrilling plot, there's no sexy male, there's no naked female, there's nothing to redeem this movie.I really can't think of anything appealing in this movie. Maybe 10 minutes back to back worth of C.G.I but in a 120+ minutes movie could be noted as entertaining.Watching this movie whole demands some strength of will or strong resilience against boredom.The acting is way below average, the kids are annoying, Nicolas Cage plays Nicolas Cage playing Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne's character is ghostly and almost see-through as she gave nothing in this performance. The scenarist must have paid some intern in dough-nut to write the screenplay. The only thing the music is moving is your finger to hit ""Fast Forward"" The directing is text book ""Director for Dummies""I must say I am more than disappointed by this movie, I love disaster movies and anything a little Sci-Fi. But this one I couldn't handle without the remote.The pace is way to slow, watching this movie feels literally like aging. This movie is proof of Hollywood long term illness getting more and more serious as the years go by.This movie should never had been produced.

Pre-consived notions that this is a disaster flick,When I began to watch this film I figured it would be like any other disaster flick out there but I fell that this is more of a drama about life and religion than anything else I only wish that the rest of the film was as beautifully shot and written as the ending. I know I will get some trash talking' from this but the ending would of brought a tear to kurbick's eye if you look at it the right way and not for the explosions of SPFX which by the way where amazing and the story is fresh and original it just left a lot to be desired by the meat of the story.

Unexpectedly Great,"This is one of those films that comes around every so often that truly is an original piece of work (to me, at least). The story of this movie was superb, even with the disappointing ending it had me on the edge of my seat wanting to see more but not wanting it to end. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for the holes in the story at the end.Nicolas Cage did excellent as one of the lead roles, he continues his excellent acting and I think this was a great film for him to do. Rose Byrne does a decent job portraying her character, though it's hard to tell because she isn't really a dynamic character but I didn't have any complaints about her. The kids do pretty well too, I think Lara does a great job portraying Lucinda as a kid and then as Abby. Chandler as Caleb does decent as well, but again, he's more of a static character.This isn't like any of Cage's recent films, but I think this is a likable film for anyone who appreciates a good story. It's got some action mixed with clues and a lot of stuff in between.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Catchy premise,....terrible execution","There are people who believe that things happen for a reason and then there are people who believe things happen out of randomness. As if there is no order to how the universe works - it just happens by chance. But what if there was an actual systematic method to knowing (ergo the title) when such major tragic events would occur? This is what happens when John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) gets his hands on a note that was put into a time capsule fifty years in the past. The note contains a map of numbers that specifically says when the next tragic disaster will be. That's some premise.In some ways, it mixes the ideas of The Number 23 (2007), 2012 (2009) and Final Destination (2000) all into one big question. What is the purpose of this list of numbers? Why was it written and who knew of such dates? It really is an interesting premise. The idea digs into the psyche of the human mind and makes viewers wonder if things do happen just randomly or calculated already or brought on by belief. But that is one of the far few things that make this movie any good. In fact the only other commendable components about this movie are its special effects and realistic images. The acting isn't bad but that's a must anyway because that's what a movie should have, decent acting.Back to writing. First is the idea of making this a supernatural genre film. It wasn't needed nor was it a smart move. By doing this, it takes away the whole mystery of where the paper with all the numbers came from. Why ruin that? The script also contains little to no explanation about anything besides what is currently happening . It's not even funny. For example, there is a character that doesn't speak in this film and it is never explained to why this is. Another moment is when the same character gives out these black smooth rocks to one of the main characters. Even by the end, it is never explained to what the significance of these rocks were for. It's just baffling to why these kinds of things aren't explained.Glad to know the guy behind this story, Ryne Douglas Pearson isn't doing any future projects yet. His writing needs more work. Amazing as this is though, the film was directed by Alex Proyas. The man behind The Crow (1994), Dark City (1998) and I, Robot (2004). Why couldn't Mr. Proyas see the flaws in the script? Lastly, of all things to look forward to, not even composer Marco Beltrami's score to the film truly helped. It did contain the creepy feel and even some emotional tunes but there were some scenes even then that didn't match the mood. There was no theme either making it stuck just to the background.Some scenes were helped by CGI in the film though. That at least was a positive although audiences may be surprised by the realistic nature of the film. In fact, it may be too graphic for the MPAA to call it PG-13. Some of the disaster scenes were very intense. There's no guts but there is blood. I was shocked to see how one scene was treated though. It was a scene where some person was hit and the audience will here a WILHELM SCREAM. It's even stated in the trivia! Was that supposed to be taken seriously or comically? But who would want to take that kind of situation comical? I don't understand. It's not worth the time to try and figure out.The special effects are decent as well as the mysterious plot but they can't overcome the bad story telling along with unexplained subplots. A very frustrating sit.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A seriously under-rated, shocking and scary movie","The less said about the plot the better, but I will say that Nicolas Cage puts in his best performance in years and in what starts off looking like it's going to be another typical Nic Cage adventure movie quickly turns into a dark and scary sci-fi disaster movie with essences of The X-Files, Armageddon and the best M. Night Shyamalan thrillers.The score is also worthy of mention, as it borrows much from John Williams' Jaws, but also reminds you of E.T. and Close Encounters, i.e. a powerful score that becomes part of the movie, rather than just playing softly in the background.This film will surprise you and it will scare you, if not in its intense and graphic disaster sequences, then in its many spine-chilling scenes of terror when our lead characters are in the woods, in a car or in their own bedroom! This is not a family-friendly disaster movie that has any comic moments like Armageddon or Independence Day, but a more modern disaster movie for our time that you will either love or hate. Some of the audience will laugh at its ridiculousness, but others will find its impact stay with them long after they've left the cinema. To entertain, this film relies on your suspension of disbelief. For a deeper impact, it depends on what you really believe in. At its core, this film is a debate on coincidence versus fate.The movie plays well on a big screen with big sound, but will not have such an impact on the small screen. This movie may go on to become a highly under-rated, under-watched cult classic or it may spawn a new wave of far more family-friendly disaster movies but with the same theme... it will probably do both! Go and see it... twice.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A good sci-fi with a debatable ending that decreased the force and the suspense created during the plot, showing an obvious end","So many productions that address the destruction of planet Earth released by Hollywood in recent decades that have even lost accounts. Since the early 90s, which was the decade in which it was possible to realize the fact that the special effects would reach a level never seen before, with films such as Jurassic Park (1993) and Independence Day (1996), more work are thrown trying to outdo others in the matter of effects.To Omen, director Alex Proyas and knew not emphasize the effects and preferred to create a good mix of genres. Proyas was the acclaimed director of The Crow (1994) and City of Ember (1998) who present fiction and suspense in shades darker, and his biggest commercial success so far, I, Robot (2004) that inserts more action in an obscure fiction a frightening future of humanity. In this new fiction, fiction Proyas keeps walking all the time alongside the suspense so engaging.In 1959, a group of students doing some drawings on how to imagine what will be the future. They will be stored in a time capsule, which will only be opened in 50 years. One of them, made by a girl, brings a series of random numbers, which she claims to have been told by someone who does not see. Half a century after the capsule is opened and this design comes into the hands of Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury). His father, the astrophysics professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), he realizes that it is a coded message predicting the dates and numbers of deaths of each of the great tragedies in the last 50 years. John begins to investigate the design and discovers that he foresees three disasters have not occurred, the last one of global proportions.The screenplay by Ryne Douglas Pearson, Juliet Snowden and Stiles Whit grows well and gives room for the viewer to draw his own opinion and gradually discard it. Attempts to create a suspense that is effective until the moment of revelation of what are all the numbers. So far we know the relationship of John and Caleb, lack the death of the mother of the boy makes up for it. So far we have a drama that airs acquires fiction with the revelation of the capsule. Only then does the story gets really interesting.After finding out the dates and locations of two disasters, John tries to prevent them from happening. That's when Alex Proyas presents us with two electrifying action scenes and very well directed. First we have the awesome plane crash in the middle of the road, held every sequence plan and with handheld camera. We follow the terrified look of the characters to the skies, and soon following we see a tilted plane about to crash into the track. After the fall, the ship explodes and gets into flames, crumbling into pieces. The few survivors then rise from the rubble with body on fire, screaming and asking for help. A scene in fact very strong and performed flawlessly. A perfect combination of effects with filming techniques. Soon after there is the underground scene, with a major derailment, equally shocking. After these two particular scenes, and some scenes of supernatural thriller is that the story begins to take other contours. With the entry of other characters, the family drama increases.John is the son of Reverend and seems a little lost in his belief after his wife's death. The main theme of the film is the faith and everything will converge in the climax. This concept appears in the subtext of the film, interwoven with the main theme, which is expressed by Professor of Astrophysics in the classroom to see at the beginning of the plot: the dichotomy between chaos and order, between determinism and free will. Clearly, as in his previous work, as Proyas can embed a serious issue in the midst of action, effects and fiction.It should also be noted that the father and son, for example, bear Christian names, and quotes the visual angels, prophets, the signs of the Apocalypse described in the Scriptures, apart from the fact that the Bible expressly cite the end of the world through fire, and says that it will be advertised for four riders. We can also mention a clear reference to Noah's Ark. In fact, we can not define well if we face angels or aliens. We only know that they are beings of light when they arrive in your ship to rescue the elect. The impression one gets is that they are aliens, but the last movie scene amid lush woods giving the impression Estrem in paradise, as Adam and Eve to start the creation of the human species, leaves us with the definite impression that these were angels.The visuals are eye popping as well as the art direction of Sam Lennox and especially photography Simon Duggan. Already the trail of Marco Beltrami only does the expected and not surprising, except the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven in the end, that work in total harmony with the chaotic scene brilliantly directed and editing Richard Learoyd, that not only this scene, but throughout the movie, knew dictating ever-increasing pace. At the end, we realize that not been two hours of film.Still speaking of visual effects shots, the climax is full of relevant scenes. Since the arrival of beings of light in his ship, until the destruction of humanity in a beautiful sequence leave anyone impressed. The last sequence of the film to the sound of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is a gigantic delicacy. As for the story, leaving the side effects, many disliked. In fact, the resolution of the plot leaves a bit to be desired, but does not play the whole plot at a lower level.Perhaps the best film of last year Nicolas Cage, who has been doing not good choices for your career. Rose Byrne and Lara Robinson children who faced the dual role of Abby-Lucinda, and Chandler Canterbury as Caleb did not commit at any time. It is interesting how the story is well-crafted and takes us along with the character John seeking to decipher the numeric codes and how events affect the micro to the macro in the course of the film. The film also passes a message to enjoy life to the fullest as if it were the last moment and live without rancor, especially those who truly love us. The end of the film is perhaps one of the many debatable points and took the force and the suspense created during the plot, showing an obvious end. Still is a great fiction that leaves you stuck on the screen the whole time and it deserves to be given.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An action-packed and thought-provoking film.,"Before watching Knowing I thought it would be just another forgettable action-adventure. It turned out to be very intriguing though; a film with a mystery that I eagerly wanted to see solved. I'm not going to explain the mystery, but I will mention that it has both fantasy and science-fiction elements. Nicolas Cage plays the protagonist Professor Jonathan ""John"" Koestler. He's a depressed single parent who it seems lives from day to day, and mostly for his son. When he confronts the mystery he realizes that it goes against what he has come to believe. So he is determined to find out what is going on. Some of what follows may seem absurd but it's certainly entertaining. Simon Duggan's cinematography captures some beautiful scenery, especially Koestler's house and the woods surrounding it. The special effects aren't many but they look fine. Knowing is a science-fiction disaster film by director Alex Proyas. Proyas directed the impressive comic book adaptation The Crow in 1994. He also directed one of the best films of the 1990s: the 1998 science-fiction Dark City. Knowing, however, isn't a great film. What happens at the end may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still one of the most entertaining and absorbing films I've seen lately. I recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not at good as I'd hoped, but better than I expected","It started very strongly in the set-up scenes, giving a delightfully freaky introduction (though not terribly much). It followed up with some refreshingly gory disaster incidents, too.. The score was nearly perfect, but tried too hard towards the middle-end to pile on the tension. This could spoil the mood for some, as it did for me. In fact that, and the lunatic brandishings by Mr Cage with his shiny revolver, were almost all that spoilt this for me... And perhaps the very last visual before the credits rolled, too.I can't claim to have an in-depth knowledge of the source material from which the last quarter or so of this movie was based. That said, the smattering of my knowledge that relates directly to the visuals in that section left me quite liking what I saw. (This is me trying to tell you nothing, if you haven't seen it yet). In fact, I think that those images probably bumped it up a point on my 1-10 scale. It will undoubtedly have an opposite effect for many others though, I suspect.Oh, and it's also a really predictable movie... But a fairly nicely done one at that..",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Predictive programming for idiots,"Most of what needs to be said about this movie has already been said but I will add that it's obvious the writers at Hollywood have their marching orders. The first part gets you hooked and it's downhill all the way after. So what do we get? We get United Nations Agenda 21 and a whole lot of New Age 'sustainable development'. In a nutshell: Old people are crap and won't be saved in the coming New World Order and get left behind and will get wiped out. The 'old world' must die and will be similarly wiped out. Only the 'kids' can 'get it' and are fit to be taken through into the new world breaking up the family in the process. Christianity sucks too, apparently. The kids are the only wise ones but frankly if I got spoken to by a little brat like that I'd whip his little ass. To the lack of continuity I'd just add that how can that dumb bitch get a stone prised out of her hand after she's just been driving with both hands on the wheel?

Dark but Disappointing,"Nicholas Cage starrer ""Knowing"" reminded me of Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and also has similarities with Keanu Reeves' ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". It has the touch of that Spielberg's 70s movie but certainly not the class of it.But the unique thing about the movie was it was 'dark' throughout, never a light moment, neither Cage nor the child actors or the lady played by Rosy Byrne could conjure up a smile at any moment. The brooding MIT professor kept brooding throughout and the knowledge of the impending disasters didn't seem to help his cause.As a viewer, can only pass a judgment but can't say what exact mix makes a movie from poor to average to good to great !!! 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably one of the worst ending of all time,"If the movie had stopped at the 1h45 mark, I would have given it a 6 on the basis that it took a rather dull SF plot and made a half-decent thriller about it. Full of holes, perhaps, but watchable nonetheless.Unfortunately it didn't, and instead dragged itself into a corny, cheesy plot which had me laughing out loud for all the wrong reasons. It was bad enough to ruin the movie, that's for sure.But even without the ending, the stiff acting, illogical plot twists and overall generic feel of the whole movie would be reason enough not to pay good money to rent or buy it.Avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This will stick with you for some time,"I just watched this today and all I can say is wow! I can't think of anything quite like it. It was not on my radar when It came out. I think it has to do with my feeling about Nicolas Cage. I'm paying too much attention to the Cage bashing bandwagon. So I guess he's not a selling point in my movie choices. However, I can't think of anyone playing this part better. Nick expresses a particular anxiety and depth of emotion that is stunning. Bravo Nic! The kids were quite good also. Alex Proyas got a believable nuanced performance from the children. This is an important element in getting the movie across. ""The Rapture"" (1991) is another ""stick with you"" movie unfortunately marred by the actress playing Mimi Rodgers daughter. I would suggest not seeing Knowing if you're just looking for a special effects laden sci-fi thriller. It's so much more than that. As good and surprising as the CGI was it wasn't what was important about the film. See Knowing for the after effect; how it stays with you.

One of the Worst!,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. Makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like genius. It starts out fine setting a nice mystery. But Nicolas Cage's first appearance brings the film to almost a complete stop. I kept hoping the film would pick up the pace -- alas, when it did towards the climax the plot totally fell apart. There is no character development, no plot development and no reason to go see this film unless you're really dying for some movie popcorn. Perhaps, if you think that the movie industry needs a bailout, you might be willing to pay for this stinker. Oh, and the supporting actors stink, too. The kids are forgettable, the supporting actors, especially Rose Byrne, are atrocious. IMDb does not allow a zero stars rating -- shame, this film deserves one.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A movie whose trailer lies to you,"I remember 2009, things were a lot simpler back then. Things weren't as insane as they are now and the world was a happier place.Of course that is unless you live in Hollywood, because during this decade and before 2012 we had a slew of absolutely horrible - yet enjoyably silly - disaster movies to watch, from titles as funny as 2012 itself to The Day After Tomorrow, we saw a lot of The End Of The World films.This movie came out in the height of it and it was...an experience to behold.I said it back in the day, I don't mind movies where the world ends, I don't mind movies that have religious themes, I don't mind Nick Cage as an actor that much.But the problem I had back then and still do today, is the asspull storyline of using a numerology idea where you can predict any and all disasters by having random number generators throw out numbers.
And inserting an allegory of The biblical Armageddon and then the Garden of Eden.If you're going to do one, DO one.If you're going to do the other, DO that.Don't try and insert one into the other, because then you are just cheating the viewing audience into hating the film for lying to it.You don't see people complain about the movies like Sharknado or even movies like Little Women for lying about their premise to get you into the cinema. They have their own barrel of crazy to deal with.

Entertaining and unpredictable Nic Cage flick,"I love this movie. My friends who have seen it and don't like it say that the plot is ridiculous, or that it's just way too cheesy. Well of course it is. But that's the kind of movie it is. It's not going to be seen at Sundance or win any Oscars anytime soon. It's just an entertaining Nic Cage flick.That being said, one of the reasons I like this movie is because it's very unpredictable. Say what you will about the ending, but I guarantee you know one could predict it. There are also elements of time travel and predicting the future which are really intriguing.There are also some great disaster sequences, which are actually surprisingly graphic. But they are entertaining nonetheless.In my opinion, if you want a movie that will keep you guessing and that you can just sit back and enjoy with a beer, this is it. You get to see Nic Cage running around, well, being Nic Cage. It's good fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An extraordinary film,"""Knowing"" is quite underrated and deserves more than a 6.2. But, alas, it is highly intelligent science fiction, and that limits its range of appreciation. It is profound on many levels and has one of the most extraordinary endings in film history - a perfect recipe of plot, graphics, music and implications. In addition to the ending there is one other scene both spectacular in its presentation as it is surprising. While such a scene has been done in other films, none have done it better.It takes exceptional writing skill to create scripts of great intellectual power while still appealing to a mass audience. Those who possess such skill include the Wachowski siblings, creators of the hugely successful ""Matrix"" series, which made them enough money they could create a vanity project, ""Cloud Atlas,"" even more complicated than the ""Matrix"" series. The money was needed as ""Cloud Atlas"" lost a bundle.For various reasons the American audience in the collective is not getting smarter. How to make films, particularly scifi films, with great scope and depth and at least break even?Fortunately, ""Knowing"" was frugally budgeted and made some money, helping to ensure there may be more films at this level of sophistication.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brief Summary of Character performance,"Well, I can say ""Kudos"" about this film because it definitely captured my attention. John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) was exceptional in his character performance and was able to fully describe his feelings through words and expressions. I also congratulate Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) in his exceptional performance in convincing the audience into believing that his situation was real. He was able to convince me and make me believe that he was literally crying because he was literally contributed to his character.Nicolas Cage was an excellent actor, he has starred in National Treasure and some other movies.Chandler Canterbury had only appeared in this movie and he was outstanding as he inspired and convinced other people to believe that the situation was real.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An interesting beginning. The rest of the film does not matter.,"When I started watching this movie I was excited. Finally, a good sci-fi movie, with touches of suspense and horror, and a nice tension. In fact, the two major strengths of this film are the visual components (airplane disaster or scenes of looting crowds, closer to the end, are visually impressive, for example) and the central idea of ​​the plot: a numeric prophecy investigated by a skeptical mathematician. The problem is that the good things in the movie end here.From the middle, the film loses quality. With prophecies solved the plot thread ends. From there, the film extends because it has to close the story anyway, giving rise to plot holes the size of houses and inserting immense religious symbology for no reason. I read a comment that said the movie is full of subliminal propaganda to Church of Scientology... well, I actually detected symbols with religious connotations, but I'm not an expert in subliminal messages or in that sect to properly identify a connection to a specific cult. Another problem is the hammy and unnatural performance of Nicolas Cage, who ceases to be skeptical too suddenly and unbelievably. At the beginning of the film, he lectures at MIT in which he approaches determinism and coincidentality... even this could have been best used in the script! The film is loaded with CGI of fairly medium quality, but the end is more worthy of a computer game than a movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Knowing unknowingly succumbs to plot implausibilities and conveniences.,"This is another case of an interesting premise being weighted down by terrible writing. Proyas has an acute eye for visually arresting set pieces, but unfortunately these can't disguise the ironically predictable plot conveniences that will roll your eyes the other way. A cosmologist/astronomer/professor/father attends his son's school ceremony where he receives a mysterious note from a time capsule. Cage, in all of his craziness, starts to uncover what this string of numbers represents. Predictions for global disasters. Attempting to prevent these, he soon starts travelling to the recorded coordinates...only for him to simply witness the havoc. Look, I like the concept of determinism and theories of fate, but this does nothing with them. Taking intelligent philosophies and turning it into a heavy-handed blockbuster that lacks both emotional conviction and engaging storytelling. There are enough conveniences here to produce a solar flare and incinerate a planet. Such a coincidence that the one note predicting disasters is given to Cage's son, whose father teaches determinism as a career, where he places a dirty mug on the paper which circles a select sequence of numbers that highlights the 9/11 attack, leading to Cage to actually Google ""9/11/2001"". Such a coincidence that the first disaster he encounters is by accident as he impatiently sits in traffic staring at the coordinates, meaning he was in the right place at the right...by mistake. Such a coincidence that ""EE"" means ""Everyone Else"" instead of writing the actual figure of the world's population. Seriously, take some time to dissect the film and you'll realise how absurd the plot is. Credit to Cage and Byrne who do give some credible performances, but the script disabled all emotional responses. The inevitable demise of Earth makes for a broody serious tone, and it works. However the thematic allegory of family can't quite breach the dark narrative. I'm still not convinced by the ending, doesn't sit right with me. Good premise, bad film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should have made everyone happy but probably didn't.,"That's exactly what I knew I'd find when I started reading reviews of this movie. I loved it. Awesome story with great effects with a profound ending. But it probably wasn't morbid enough for most. I believe people these days go to the movies just to be upset rather than truly enjoy the movies anymore. I love Nicolas Cage. I think he picks movies that he wants to do. Not movies he feels will get him his best shot at an Oscar. Hell, the Oscar he got was for probably the only movie of his I hated. Leaving Las Vegas. If you want a suspenseful movie with a great ending this is the movie for you. If not well watch American Beauty.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Half a movie...and half of another,"The story starts off interesting, heads down a path...which turns into a dead end...so the director takes off in another direction and ends up with...what? Another movie...and not a very good one at that.Did the director get religion halfway through the film? I heard that's what happened with the last Omen sequel.One good point: There -was- an ending (which is more than one can say about No Country for Old Men); it just wasn't the ending of the same film that I started watching an hour before - same actors but a different story.This film reminded me of the board game Clue. As the film progressed, the director pulled the cards out of his behind. ""Colonel Mustard"" ""in the library"" ""with a knife"". No internal logic. Speaking of clues, I should have known how bad the film could be by seeing the producer and director were the same person. He probably couldn't get anyone else interesting in producing it (or directing it). The more I think about the movie, the angrier I get. I'm going to wash my hands thoroughly.Anyway, if you can possibly avoid this film, do so. It will be on TNT soon enough.Summary: An awful waste of time.

As I watched it, several times I thought, ""I got this figured out"" but was really surprised at how wrong I was at the close of the story. Knowing is a really great addition to the scifi gender and may well become a classic as time goes by. Kudos to the whole cast! Cage is at his best, as are all, even the brief appearance of Cage's father at the end just adds to and makes the story complete!

A work of excitement and imagination,"According to the Mayas and the Aztecs, there have been four previous worlds and we are now in the Fifth World. Each of the prior worlds was destroyed in a cataclysm, but as one world is destroyed, another is reborn. Alex Proyas' metaphysical thriller Knowing speculates about such weighty subjects and about whether the universe unfolds randomly according to chance or deterministically according to a preconceived plan. It is an entertaining and ambitious film providing much food for thought, though perhaps it is more audacious than successful.The film opens fifty years ago at Lexington, Massachusetts' William Dawes Elementary School. Miss Taylor (Danielle Carter) asks her students to draw a picture about what the world will look like in their imagination in fifty years, the pictures to be stored in a time capsule to be opened in 2009. One student, Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson), a pale girl with a haunted look on her face fills her paper with seemingly random rows of numbers, much to the dismay of Miss Taylor. When the time capsule is opened fifty years later, Lucinda's paper is given to nine-year-old Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) whose father is Professor Koestler (Nicholas Cage), a hard-drinking widower whose wife died in a hotel fire only a few years ago.Shockingly, Professor Koestler discovers that the numbers on Lucinda's paper are predictive of the dates, number of people killed, and the latitude and longitude of every major disaster occurring in the last fifty years with a harbinger of similar events to come, the final one suggesting the possibility of massive global destruction. As Physics professor, Koestler believes in the randomness of the universe, that ""stuff"" happens, but the unfolding events that seem to involve his son cause him to question the role fate plays in our lives, especially when Caleb is approached by other worldly creatures he calls ""the whisperers"" who communicate telepathically. Whether the creatures are aliens or angels is left to the viewer to decide but their main function in the film seems to be mainly to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.Koestler enlists the help of Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), daughter of the girl who wrote the prophecies fifty years before and her young daughter Abby (Lara Robinson) who also talks to the ""whisperers"" to attempt to prevent the predicted events from happening but the most he can do is stand around, pick up bodies, or shout furiously. While more thoughtful than most disaster movies, Knowing has its share of explosions, chase sequences, and assorted vehicle accidents, including a state-of-the art plane crash in an open field near Logan Airport, and an off track subway train hurtling through a tunnel at breakneck speed, but, by the end, the film moves from over-the-top frenzy to a more subtler level that brings in apocalyptic and religious themes.Proyas must be commended for tackling important questions and he has produced a work of excitement, imagination, and some chills even though it is marred by a one-dimensional performance from Cage whose emotions range from worried concern to frantic hysteria. Credit should also be given to the studio for giving the green light to a project which will inevitably divide people because of its subject matter and because it dares to introduce an element of faith and hope into typical doomsday scenarios. Some critics have attempted to scare off viewers by waving the dreaded ""New Age"" flag but hopefully today's viewers are more sophisticated. After all, this is a new age, whether or not some people have gotten the message and any film that challenges us to explore ideas about life and its future on Planet Earth while providing music from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony has a lot to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ending Failure,"I'm not the greatest of Nicholas Cage's fans... personally I think after 'NEXT' there was no need for another 'I SEE THE FUTURE, I CAN SAVE THE WORLD' movie and then the inevitable happens and no one changed anything and many innocent people just die. 'Knowing' was an interesting film, the story wasn't the most original but it managed to keep me awake at 3am, however the ending was probably one of the worst endings I have ever seen and trust me i've seen 'Funny Games'. If the movie ended 20 minutes before and then they made a 'Knowing 2' where they show how they save the Earth, without having any relation whatsoever with Aliens or any biblical suggestion to the Adam & Eve theory with two kids that were chosen to see the future, that would have been MUCH better than the terrible ending of this movie.I mean seriously, you don't need to see the future to know that the ending of that film just ruined everything, luckily you can't blame Cage for that.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better off not Knowing,OMG awful. Had the movie ended at the second last scene it would have only been a bad movie. The last scene left me wondering why I hadn't stayed home to clean my toe nails. From the opening scenes there was no doubt that the acting was going to be very mediocre and there was little throughout the course of the movie to sway that early opinion. Nicolas Cage delivered an outstanding portrayal of himself (paraphrased from another review) and in fact provided some comedic relief in doing so. The concept was interesting but the plot lacked plausibility and left me wondering if there were any decent script writers employed for this project. Copying from one is plagiarism. Copying from many is research. All I can say is that the script writers and director did a lot of research. Save yourselves!,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kowing was a great disappointment !!!,"I will keep this brief...I will not comment in length about this film as it doesn't deserve it.At least Mr. Cage's ""Treasure"" films, like the Indiana Jones adventure series was somewhat tongue & cheek, this movie is dead serious, and so full of flaws I do not know where to begin. I will just say this......Though the first half of the movie was at least suspenseful, the predictable and overdone ending ruined any merits this film may have had. The basic premise of the film was plagiarized from a few eps. of the TV series, ""The X Files"" and those who followed the series know exactly which eps. I mean. However, THAT was the GOOD part.The ending was such was virtually the same, and had the same message as ""Close Encounters"", ""Contact"", and among many others, the recent remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" We have seen the same ending per se in scores of SiFi films and we don't need it beaten into out heads again and again....******SPOILERS******> > > The scene where the two children are shown on a distant planet, supposedly to start the human race over again was problematic in itself... We see the two children running in fields of wheat(?) and we see other ""pods"" containing it seems other children landing in the distance...Call me a fool, but here are some questions that I do not understand, and it wrecked the movie for me...With the alien spaceships the size of the state of Texas, why did they have to gather up the children by twos, each in their own pods? YES, along with the rabbits,I did understand the allusion to Noah's ark, TWO BY TWO..but come on...that is such a waste of spaceships..Or...another thought...were the children somehow paired up by the aliens?This is TOO freaky.. !!!So..the little boy and girl barely 10 years old are selected to be mated in order to populate their new planet?Is that the Utopian future for our kids...to be selected into a predetermined ""marriage"" like the children of the LDS church, or Hindu and Muslim sects that believe in pre-arranged marriage?Sorry...I rather they were burnt to a crisp...And to be taken away from their parents???What..there were no adults on the entire planet Earth worth saving?Which brings me to another point.Are the children to be left to their own devices, and possibly revert to ""Lord of the Flies' mentality? Or are we to believe that the kindly aliens will see to their every need?The children are still human, no alien agenda or influence can change that. No alien can guide into adulthood, a human child anymore than we should attempt to modify the lives of the mountain gorillas.Another passing thought.IF the spaceships are Noah's ark(s) and the planet the new Garden of Eden, the boy and the girl the new Adan and Eve, then it is still an implausible senerio that makes me want to gag...The scene in CONTACT where Jody Foster meets the alien who is the visage of her dead father was schmaltzy, but at least it made sense...Give me a break!!! I could write a few more pages about specifics, but I think that I have given enough examples to warn off any lover of good science fiction from this drivel...Post Script: I originally typed this without reading any other reviews. Now, having read a bunch, I can see that I am not alone in the comments I made, nor in my condemnation of one of the worst SiFi flicks of all time.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Something only very few movies really do.

Never mind suspending disbelief, to watch this your disbelief has to have taken an indefinite leave of absence.

"Well paced and engaging movie, but not for everyone...","I really enjoyed this movie, even though the ending will be perceived as something akin to religious overtones.

The effects are incredible and realistic, although containing much of fantasy elements at the end.I'm not going to discuss the film in respect of giving away the plot, but as depressing as the elements of the film are in how they are conveyed, it does end on a upbeat note by piquing one's sense of religiosity (ie, one's sense of feeling spiritual).Whatever your mindset or ideology, creed or philosophy, the film is thought-provoking and engaging, and can be enjoyed if you allow for what Coleridge coined in his notes on poetry...""the suspension of one's disbelief""...and undertake the analysis sometime later.
