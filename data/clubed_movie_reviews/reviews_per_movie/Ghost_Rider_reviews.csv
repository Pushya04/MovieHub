Ghostrider is the best thing in it.,"Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character . The chain ,the bike , the flaming skull for a head -he's just plain cool. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.It works the same way with the movie: seeing ghost rider in action provides almost all of the films entertainment value. Watching him ride down buildings , fight villains and flip the bird to the police is a cool sight to behold. When hes not on screen though ,things aren't that interesting. Nicholas cage is funny and quirky as johnny blaze and eva mendes is impossibly sexy (as per usual)but for the most part its all very cheesy and feels rushed and episodic.Also, the villains are frustratingly lame , including black heart who's severely downgraded from his comic book incarnation.When sitting through ghostrider , your best bet is to wait for the flaming skullhead to show up- watching him do his thing is tons of fun. Sadly the same cant be said about the rest of the movie.While its not bad it doesn't quite do ghostrider justice . Why ? Because hes TOO cool..........",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ghost Rider,"This demonic Marvel adaptation is visually groundbreaking, no doubt, but is not an easy ride. Ghost Rider's exaggerated tone and dialogue and hell-driven sequences provides many speed bumps on this less-than-anticipated ride.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
So bad...,"Oh where to begin. How could they screw up a movie with a premise like this.The acting and the dialogue was awful even with actors like Cage and Peter Fonda delivering them, and the set up was rushed, like most of the rest of the movie. The FX ranged from OK to GOOD with the first transformation scene of Blaze to Ghost Rider being pretty well done but every change from there on in is in cheap and nasty morphovision and the morphing motorcycle looked stupid even if the flaming bike itself looked cool. The bad guys were non-entities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease, even the main dude at the end.Honestly this movie has so many clichés you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke.Go get the comics instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic movie to just sit back and enjoy,"If you like movies that just entertain you and blow you away but doesn't has that much of a plot, Ghost rider is the best choice. Although IMO the plot was decent, a man sells his soul to the devil to save his father and is forced to work for the devil to take down demons. The special effects are fantastic, you'll be blown away when he turns into Ghost rider the first time. Although there could have been some more action, but the action was intense and wonderful. This move is great on a Friday or Saturday night. But don't see this movie on a Sunday, wanting a dramatic emotional movie like spider man. This is a movie to entertain, not make you fall in love with. So just sit back and enjoy one of the greatest Marvel movies ever",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tired Hollywood formula causes Rider to wipeout,"It's official! Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher. It took Schumacher two movies to bring the Batman franchise to its knees, and with only two movies, Johnson has already buried two comic book franchises with 2003's Daredevil and this month's Ghost Rider, which arrives in theaters dead-on-arrival; flat-lined, from it's hokey beginning to it's clichéd video game ending.Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, a famous Evil Knievel-esquire stunt performer that sold his soul to Mephistopheles (or Mephisto for short), played by Peter Fonda, in order to save his dying father, stricken with cancer. In a moment of young, naïve, foolishness he signed, with his own blood no less, a life contract to become the devil's bounty hunter; damned to hunt down fallen angels cast out of heaven.During the day Johnny is normal, but at night, in the presence of evil Johnny's skin burns off and his skull lights aflame with hellfire. His motorcycle transforms into a speed demon able to travel fast enough to melt parking meters and vertically climb up sky scrapers, and in its wake, leaves behind a fiery trail of destruction.The idea sounds kind of, well cool, actually. Unfortunately the studio  in an attempt to cash in on the Marvel product  limited the film to a PG-13 rating in order to reel in a wider audience:10 and 12-year-old boys, which was a terrible, terrible move.Instead of a fun and wildly entertaining ride, what we got is one of the worst comic book adaptations to crash land in theaters since Batman & Robin and Catwoman. Yes, it really is THAT bad.Instead of cranking out another soft and wimpy flick about demons, hell and tortured souls straight from the formulaic, cardboard factory of clichés, what we should have gotten was a fun, dark, R-rated blast more along the lines of Blade or The Crow, heck, even Spawn had more bite and attitude! It seems like Johnson isn't even passionate or interested in telling his own story, and it shows.The heavily forced and completely uninteresting romance between Johnny Blaze and his long-time love, Roxanne Simpson (played by Eva Mendes) has but not a spark of chemistry. Mendes is given little to do, and does little more than stand around and look pretty as the ""damsel in distress"", whose only real talent is an impressive bust-line.Nicolas Cage  who is an expressed fan of the Ghost Rider comics  is one of the film's biggest flaws; completely miscast as the macho avenger. Cage is a talented actor when working with the right material (see his performances in the underrated Bringing out the Dead and Matchstick Men), but at the age of 43 (pretending to be 28), and his James Stewart persona of acting just isn't what this particular film calls for.What it needed was an actor with a hard edge and some grit, someone with the kind of tough-guy presence, like a young Clint Eastwood. Thomas Jane might have made a nice Ghost Rider, and I'm sure if someone like Robert Rodriguez had been working behind the camera we would have gotten that fun, R-rated ride that we should have had to begin with.The film tries to do many things, and succeeds at nothing. It tries to be humorous, but nothing is funny. The scene in which Johnny tries to explain his night-time dark side to his girlfriend aims to be funny, but all I could think about was the scene in Batman, where Michael Keaton compares his superhero gig as being just another job to Kim Basinger.Ghost Rider also tries to be scary, but nothing comes close to being frightening, and in the end, after all its constant failures, amounts to little more than boredom. Normally I don't do it, but I was tempted to walk out.Throughout the film Johnny Blaze talks about deserving a second chance, in order to turn things around, for the better. Cage is an actor who deserves a second chance, especially coming off last year's ""it's so bad, it's good"" remake of The Wicker Man. As for writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, he's had his second chance. This whole comic book movie thing just isn't your game, kid.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hell of a Ride,"If you go into this movie hoping to see Academy Award caliber acting or a dramatic plot that's going to move you emotionally, then you're going to the wrong movie. However, if you're looking for a movie that's a lot of fun and is going to keep you entertained, then this is exactly what you're looking for.The visual effects in this movie are, simply put, amazing. Ghost Rider is just one of those movies that's cool to look at. As I said before, the acting sometimes falls a bit flat, but Nicolas Cage does exactly what's expected of him for the role. It's a bit cliché and humorous at times, but this is a movie based on a comic book, so you have to expect that sort of thing.Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda provide the best acting in the movie, while Wes Bentley does a solid job as Blackheart and Eva Mendez is just a very beautiful actress who fits in well as Roxanne.There are a lot of little gripes about this movie if you look too hard and overthink it, but as a die-hard Ghost Rider fan, I didn't mind these things so much. It stayed relatively true to the original series, while borrowing elements from the 90's series to help make the movie more visually impressive, which I felt worked really well.I've been waiting for this movie since they started trying to make it over eight years ago and overall, I'd have to say I really enjoyed seeing my favorite comic book character finally make it onto the big screen.If you want to go see a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride; then go see Ghost Rider without any worry of disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Third time's NOT the charm for another awful Mark Johnson directed comic film,"A young Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) makes a deal with the demon,Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father. Years later, Blaze (now Nicolas Cage), a world renowned bike daredevil starts to turn into the Ghost Rider (sort of the devil's henchman who's job is to capture the souls of evil men. He also has to contend with Blackheart, a goth looking demonic villain whom is the least intimidating heavy in a film in recent memory. What's the saying about the third time being the charm? Well sometimes that's simply not true. Director Mark Johnson's third comic-book based film (after the dire Darevil and simply putrid Elektra) proves just that with this supremely boring joke of a film. Bad acting, a plot that fails to do the comic that it's based on justice, and an aforementioned supremely awful villain all collide to make this disaster such a chore to sit through. By the time that the Ghost Rider dons his trademark leather studded jacket, I was too bored to care, so later in the movie when Johnny Blaze utters ""is this thing ever gonna end?"" it was like he read my mind. It's all fun and games till Johnson gets his hands on/ royally screws up a sincerely great comic-book, say something like ""Preacher""My Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Thrill Ride,"Ghost RiderStarring: Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Peter Fonda, Wes Bentley, Donal Logue and Sam ElliotGenre: Action/Fantasy/Drama/ThrillerRated: PG-13Ghost Rider is just one of those movies where you don't have to take it so seriously in order to like it. This movie is almost like the Blade movies in terms of how Ghost Rider fights evil that's from hell but this is way better than Blade. So anyway, Nicolas Cage plays the wild stunt biker, Johnny Blaze who makes a deal to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to save his father and in return has to forget about his life and his love, Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). A few years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Mephistopheles to give up his soul to have Johnny become the fiery bounty hunter of hell, Ghost Rider in order to take down Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a son and enemy of Mephistopheles. Nicolas Cage did a great job playing Ghost Rider and of course it's always nice to see Eva Mendes on screen of course. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how they decided to put in a villain who turned out to be an easy defeat instead of picking one that would be more of a challenge but then again it's an origin movie so everything has to start off easy i guess. But hopefully there will a more challenging villain if they do a Ghost Rider 2. Overall i'd recommend this movie and I hope they do a Ghost Rider 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I am so sorry that Wes Bentley's career is over :(,"Oh yes this was about the lamest film I have ever seen. I have to say, that I was very excited about the filmI am a comic fan, but not a fanatic or anything. My expectations may have been a little high, but still the movie was pretty awful. It is the only movie I have ever considered walking out on. It certainly had great potential, but truly the execution was off. Throughout the film bad blocking, very corny lines, and bad editing plagued a great comic movie idea. I think that the editing crew was aware of the failures. It was clear that they sliced out every possible plot transition, but were somehow able to keep the extensive camera time devoted to squished cleavage. Maybe this was to distract most people from the train wreck of a movie they had paid good money to see. Lines were always delivered like a bad high school play. They had the opportunity to save it with a little self mocking--you know Evil Dead style, but apparently, no one recognized how awful the script was even as they said it. What a shame. The director, producer, and even some of the cast deserve a penance stare for the mediocrity they have unleashed upon the world.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It angered me it was so bad,"I am a Nicolas Cage fan. I love all his comedies and think his serious ones are okay. After seeing the Wicker Man, I lost my respect for Cage in serious films, and went to see Ghost Rider thinking it would be an average movie, but probably easy to make fun of. It was bad. . . very bad. It was funny at times, I will admit that, but Cage just is bad in the role, the story is not very complex and has many plot holes in it. You know it is bad when you go into a movie only wanting to make fun of it and coming out just depressed because it was SO bad. In short, don't see this movie, if you want a superhero movie done right, see Batman Begins or Unbreakable, or basically, any other superhero movie was better than Ghost Rider. Thumbs extremely far down",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ghost Rider A Halfway Decent Comic Book Movie,"Ghost Rider is a halfway decent comic book movie brought to the big screen but it's not memorable like Spider-man 2, X-Men United, Batman Begins, or The Dark Knight. The movie isn't all that bad. Ghost Rider is no Elektra, Punisher War Zone, Daredevil, or Spider man 3 but it's not that much better either. Director Mark Steven Johnson does an okay job of bringing Ghost Rider to big screen but the bad outweighs the good in this one. I'll get back to that later. Nicolas Cage whose recent films (The Wicker Man and Bankok Dangerous to name a few) haven't been that great but fortunately in this one he's all right as Johnny Blaze who becomes a hell blazing vigilante with a skull thats covered in flames for a face. Eva Mendes is decent as Johnny's love Roxanne Simpson but she doesn't really get much to do. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Wes Bentley as the devil's son Blackheart, Sam Elliot as a mysterious cemetery caretaker, and Peter Fonda as Satan himself. Donal Logue makes a brief appearance as Johnny's friend Mack and he does a good job with the small part but he like many other characters in the film doesn't have much to do and lacks screen time. Some other flaws with this movie was that the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times, the CGI to create Ghost Rider and his bike looks cool but nothing we haven't seen before, the action/fight sequences are good but none of them stand out and the lack of a central villain. There are about three other villains for Ghost Rider to face besides Bentley and Fonda. The special effects used to create their powers were impressive but none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. If you're a Nicolas Cage fan you might like this one better than I did because Ghost Rider isn't one of his best movies. No offense to Cage who is a good actor but Ghost Rider overall is a movie that could've been much better than it was.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Good First Try But Not Enough,"Ghost Rider was always a cool comic book character. So why not make it into a movie? Although this movie had a great financial success, its screenplay is actually quite sloppy. I'm surprised it did so well. I liked Ghost Rider. I liked the visuals, the action, and the villains (a little). But I felt things could have been polished. Mark Steven Johnson who directed and wrote the story for this movie could have done better.To start off, Nicolas Cage plays as the anti-hero Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I really like the way they made Ghost Rider look in this film. Just like a bat out of hell, his skull is cloaked in flames, his jacket has spikes on it, he has a flame chain, and his bike has a mind of its own! Much of it is fun to watch. Just seeing Ghost Rider for the first time on screen was pretty awesome to see. The action was good too. Any of the sarcastic comments Ghost Rider makes in this film is funny to hear. I even thought the actors who played the villains were good. What destroyed all these good moments, was how the character's dialogs were brought out.Most of the dialog in this movie is weird, if not awkward. Mostly due to Cage's character, Johnny Blaze. I guess Mark Steven Johnson figured because Blaze lost his soul to the devil, he might as well lose his personality too. If that's the case, it was not a smart choice. It almost seems like Cage AND ONLY Cage is uncomfortable with his character. I know he's a fan of Ghost Rider but it seems like the script was written out of wack for him. There are parts where it seems like Cage is lost in himself and doesn't know what to say next. I don't quite understand that. One other thing I didn't comprehend was that there was way too much ""pointing while zooming up on the face"" business. Was the director trying to make a trademark for himself in this film? Not only is it redundant, it can be very obnoxious.The other element that does not work here are the villains. I liked the bad guys in this movie. They looked frightening to me when I first saw them. But then I noticed a trend as Ghost Rider had finished one off at a time. None of the bad guys really did anything. Blackheart, the son of the devil, has henchmen who have powers like the characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender, except they don't involve all the martial arts moves. Before Ghost Rider is about to finish one of Blackheart's henchman, we don't even see him use any of his powers. Well that was kind of anti-climactic. Even Blackheart himself barely uses his ""almighty"" powers against Ghost Rider. It's really disappointing to watch.Besides these parts of the film, I enjoyed Christopher Young's soundtrack. It has a lot of guitar in it and creates a punk tone to the action. Sam Elliot appears in this movie as a minor character, he's always fun to listen too but even he can't make up for the bad screenplay. It's unfortunate because I really like Ghost Rider as a character and was expecting something a little more darker for a dark character.Ghost Rider will please fans to a point, with its good action and awesome special effects. But nothing can help the film recover from its lazy screenplay, awkward dialog and dull villains.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Just Awful, lets keep it at that","I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet. Unlike this movie. It's complete garbage, thats all I can say. It just has not plot to push the story anywhere. Alright, now for the beginning. The actors that portray Nick Cage and Eva Mendes in the opening of this film should probably look elsewhere for a career choice because there acting ability truly shows how bad they are as actors. Now once the film gets going, it picks up with the false feel of nostalgia. Nick Cage, needs to stop. I mean really stop, he shouldn't take himself so seriously, cuz it ain't workin'. Eva Mendes, who is smoking' hot, can't act. And I really can't recall any time when she could. Thats the biggest grief of this film, the acting. Peter Fonda, appears to be smoking' the same stuff that he's been doing since Easy Rider, so he's the same. But in this role he's just stupid. With a line like, ""Far Out"" as his first it truly take you bag to the late sixties and the time when everything and everyone was truly free. Thats why the film gets two stars, and thats it. The other supporting roles are dumb to the point of unbelief. Why would anyone seriously want to finance this movie. I don't know, but I wouldn't. It ain't revolutionary, it ain't fun, and overall it ain't good.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Somewhere Between X-Men and Spiderman,"There won't be any Academy Awards for ""Ghost Rider,"" and deservedly so. Great cinema it ain't. It is fun stuff, though, and very much in the spirit of the Marvel comic book of the same name. Nicolas Cage works well in the role; his dead-pan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze, and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his long-lost girlfriend is classic stuff, full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.Granted, things get a little melodramatic from time to time, but that's as it should be. This is, after all, a movie based on a comic book hero, and what superhero worth his heat-vision doesn't indulge in a dose of the melodramatic every so often? It comes with the territory. Still, there's a sense of humor at work here, something that didn't play out well in the ""X-Men"" franchise and led to that abysmal third installation. There are a good number of laughs in ""Ghost Rider."" This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously, which is a nice benefit considering how heavy the subject matter could become. It's rough around the edges, no doubt, and isn't quite up to the same level as the Spiderman movies to date.I saw an early (11:45 AM) show and the theater was still nearly full. The audience laughed at points that were intended as humorous and even jumped at a couple of scenes. All in all, everyone looked like they were having a good time, from the six year olds with their parents to the older folks like me who were fans of this comic as kids. If you're looking for something fun, ""Ghost Rider"" isn't a bad bet at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
While not the best adaptation of a comic book (graphic novel if you prefer) to the screen...,"I remember watching this film the first time and thinking it was just a lot of special effects without a lot of plot. Then I watched it a second time, and started to realize you have to really pay attention to the details to get the story. While not the best adaptation of a comic book (graphic novel if you prefer) to the screen, the special effects are awesome and the photography is Oscar worthy. Cage is Cage, that stoic actor who seems somehow devoid of emotion in most of his films. Mendez is hot, goes without saying, and equals Cage's level of emotion. Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are the saving graces of the film, both adding a dimension of emotion lacking in the main characters. The prelude scenes of young Johnny and Roxanne are somewhat necessary, but could have been trimmed down to include more footage of the Ghost Rider and his missions. I haven't seen the newest film, just released at this writing, but hopefully the characters have been ""fleshed out"" and the plot concentrates more on the present than the past. With Cage being the only holdover for the new movie, perhaps the new directors can up the game a bit. The original film is rated PG-13 for violence and language, but nothing the teens haven't seen in their video games. Collectible? If you are a Marvel fan like I am, probably. As as classic film? No way. But entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not good,"I'm usually very tolerant when it comes to comic-book movies. For some reason i like them even though i don't particularly like comic books. I guess it's the way that they can bend reality with an alibi to do so, as opposed to when they do it in a regular action movie. In the end though rocking action scenes, or a good solid story, is needed to make it work. There are loads of examples of movies that did work with different approaches. Like comedy (Spider-man), action (X-Men) and emotion/story (Hulk by Ang Lee). This movie however doesn't really have an approach...I can freely admit to never having heard of the character Ghostrider before this movie. And i'm not surprised, it's not a very interesting character. And it works less well in a live-action movie. Considering the Ghostrider is basically just a special-effect with a flaming skull, there's not much acting to be done. Nicholas Cage is his usual self as the troubled man who turns into Ghostrider at night. Whether Nicholas Cage being himself is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. The rest of the performances range from dignified (Peter Fonda) to downright silly (Wes Bentley).The real problem here is not the acting though, it's the fact that the movie has precious little to offer. It lacks direction and purpose almost completely. It's too slow and lame to be a good action-movie (although there are a few decent special-effects scenes), it lacks comedy almost completely and the story is too lame and shallow to carry the movie. I guess going for the action-angle would have been the best way, but the Ghostrider doesn't really have any interesting ways to fight. He punches people, strangles them with chains and looks deep into their eyes. The fact that the money seems to have run before they got the flaming-skull effect right doesn't help either.The thing i was thinking when the movie was over was ""Spawn"" from 1997. This movie reminded me so much about Spawn that it could easily have been a sequel. Both movies are very heavy on special effects (although this one is obviously light-years better in that department, or well, ten regular years...), both have an anti-hero with connections to the devil, both seriously lack weight in the action-scenes. And in the end both of them are thoroughly dull, and while they make a lot of noise, they have precious little to offer in the way of entertainment.I rate this 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome flick if you like some cheesy fun,"First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have read a lot of the bad hype that the flick has receieved, and I believe that this is partly due to the fact that people go into these types of movies expecting amazing advances in cinematography as well as a gripping and dramatic plot. Well, I hate to burst everybody's bubble, but that is really not the purpose of this type of movie. These bad reviews make me wonder just how serious you have to be (or just how snobby a critic) going into the theater to hate this type of movie making.Far be it from me to say that this movie was perfect. It had its flaws and there were times when I found myself snickering at the silliness of it all, but that to me is good entertainment. The scenes where Cage turned into ghost rider for the first time were fairly intense, and I found myself marveling at the coolness of his transformation and powers. I also enjoyed the battle scenes including one involving ghost rider and a helicopter (I won't tell you what happens there, but it is pretty amusing). I also felt that the movie was pretty well-acted overall, and the entire flick maintained an aura of fun throughout (which I believe was the main purpose of the whole thing) while flowing smoothly through a simple plot.If you are the type of person to over-analyze plots, scrutinize special effects, whine about some cheesy acting or if you get offended when a movie doesn't have a deep and philosophical meaning behind it, this is definitely not a movie you should waste your time or money on.If, however, you are the type of person who enjoys some good laughs, some over the top (and at times cheesy) comic book acting, cool battle scenes, action and adventure, or if you simply just like to see some guy with a flaming skull, this is worth the 8 bucks to get into a theater seat.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Ride Trough Great Action and Fun!,"I really had a great time watching this film; although i have never been a Ghost Rider Fan, i loved comic books. I had been a Superman fan all my live, but in the comic stores the character of Ghost Rider had some attraction to me, as the non-typical superhero.

A superhero that fight evil of the worst kind!, just great, a combination of a superhero and some horror - type characters; great complement!.

This movie needs Cro and Tom Servo,"When I got a free pass to a prescreening of Ghost Rider at my comic shop, I was thrilled. I'd already been planning on seeing it, as I am a fan of the character, and I typically enjoy Nicolas Cage movies. The trailers I'd seen had not filled me with hope, so I was expecting a bad, but still enjoyable movie, along the same lines of Daredevil and X-Men 3. I was thoroughly disappointed.The movie began, and I was entertained to see that they were including the original western Ghost Rider in the story, even if they had to completely change the character in order to do so. The movie continued, and I was further impressed that they got Johnny Blaze's origin story right. My nervousness about the quality of the movie began to subside. But then the movie continued further.It seems that part of the Ghost Rider curse is constant pointing and the spouting of one liners. To say nothing of the re-use of CGI. I don't know how many times I saw the same clip of Ghost Rider flipping his chain around his torso to put it away. Some other reviews have said that the fights were excellent. What fights? I don't know what movie they saw, but I did not see any fights that lasted longer than several seconds.As I said, my ticket to see the movie was free. I want my gas money refunded. And leaving the theater, I was not the only person muttering that. Nor were we in the minority.All in all, all I can say is ""Mark Steven Johnson, your soul is tainted with the blood of the innocent. Look into my eyes.""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Ghost Rider,"Mark Steven Johnson, I hate to break it to you. 3 strikes and you're out. I understand your earnestness in trying to write-direct Marvel superhero movies by trying to stay close to the source material, but somehow they all turn out to be mediocre efforts. Although you didn't direct Elecktra, you produced and wrote it, and wrote-directed Daredevil and now Ghost Rider. I enjoyed Daredevil even though most others did not, and that unfortunately was your best effort.Marvel superheroes have their fair share of material being translated to the big screen, the largest cash cow being Spiderman, which opened the doors for efforts like The Hulk and Fantastic Four, creations of Stan Lee, and others, which I deem on the lower echelons, like Daredevil, Punisher, and Ghost Rider. The floodgates have not closed, as Spiderman and Fantastic Four will spawn their sequels this year, with Iron Man coming our way as well. Naturally not all the movies are hits, and too bad, I had hopes for Ghost Rider to join the hit list, even though I've not faithfully followed the comic books nor am a fan.I'm not quick to dismiss that comic book material can't be turned into powerful motion pictures. Batman Begins and the Spiderman movies have earned their mark of respect for having that emotional oomph to engage the audience, coupled with effects and stunts to wow. I guess we're spoilt from the excellent efforts of Christopher Nolan and Sam Raimi, as they've raised the bar and their movies are now the de facto benchmarks for comic book adaptations to reach.The first sign that things aren't going all that well, was that this movie was postponed, if I recall correctly, for almost one year, on the pretext of jazzing up the special effects. True, the flames on the skull were as realistic as can be, but that's about it. Every other effect seemed quite ordinary, and nothing to make the jaw drop. In fact, some CGI shots became so repetitive, that you start to wonder if the same clip was being recycled to save time.In essence, much like the origins of Daredevil, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) unwittingly signs a pact with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), and indirectly caused the death of his father. Blaming himself, and because of the sale of his soul to the devil, he abandons all hope in life, and his true love Roxanne (Eva Mendes), and leads a dangerous life as a stunt biker who throws caution to the wind, knowing that he can't perish because of his secret ""guardian angel"", and awaits the day when he can be free from fear and blame.Fast forward to the quick introduction of the main villain Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of the devil, who recruits the Elementals (Earth, Wind and Water spirits of sorts) in his cause to bring hell on earth. Yes, it's Constantine all over again. The plot was too vanilla plain, lacking much conflicts to challenge our anti-hero, besides his love interest. The villains, especially the Elementals, were a joke, and were so easily dispatched, that you'll scream for your money back.Given that it's an origin story of sorts, you'll get to see how Johnny becomes the rider who can walk on both worlds, and slowly get introduced to how he got his tools of the trade, including his jacket, gloves, chain, bike and shotgun. Unfortunately, one of the Rider's powers, the Penance Stare, is overused, and to cinematic audiences, we've probably seen a similar version in Alex Proyas' directed The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee. While there are some remotely funny moments, most of the time the humour seemed contrived, and you'll probably cringe at some of the cheesy Western reference, no thanks too to one of the tracks performed by Spiderbait.If you're on the lookout for Stan Lee, who frequently pops into the Marvel films, don't. I think by steering clear, it's another indication that well, perhaps it's not as good a job as it should be. The narrative sagged in the middle, and contained some illogical, lazy plot moments, like a public transformation, and a busy jail house with no cops (yeah right).Nicolas Cage could have been Superman with a hairpiece, but I thought he looked good as Johnny Blaze with a hairpiece. To his fans, you would've already seen the acting range he showed here, especially from John Woo's Face Off. That crazed look with the eyeballs almost popping out is repeated here, and at times, his Castor Troy scene comes to mind. Eva Mendes was largely wasted as the buxomy Roxanne who cock teases Johnny, and you actually wonder what Wes Bentley is doing in a movie like this. Sam Elliot shows up as the Caretaker, and is actually involved in a pretty cool scene which you might have seen revealed in the trailer.All in all, I would still say an enjoyable movie if you don't compare to, or have seen some of the other movies which I've mentioned above. It should do well at the box office in the initial week, before word of mouth gets to it. Fans of Ghost Rider, I sure would like to hear your views if you've liked it, or not, because after all, the fans are the ones who hold their hero dear.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Two hours of my life that I won't get back!,"Bad acting, bad plot, bad bad bad. I really can't believe they a) made this movie and b) got Nicholas Cage to star in it.The acting was so incredibly horrific and fake. I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. I would suggest that you instantly turn the channel even if it is on cable.I actually realized 10 minutes into the movie that it had all the foreshadowing of a really bad movie. I should have trusted my instincts. But alas, I did not.Two hours of my life that I won't get back. At least my girlfriend fell asleep an hour into it. Don't make the same mistake I did.

fun movie to watch,"just saw the movie I'm a big comic book fan and a lot of movies based on comic books are terrible. now I'm not the biggest ghost rider fan but I'm a Marvel Zombie so i had to see the movie. i thought it would be a terrible movie had flashback to the man-thing movie from last year. instead i was surprised it was very fun to watch. you can clearly see Cage enjoying the movie. the story isn't the best one,the cast isn't great but when you watching the movie you don't care.

so bad its funny,"I cant stress how bad this film is....so I wont....but trust me, its absolutely abysmal Some of the scenes and 1-liners r so bad, u can only laugh! Don't know what N.Cage was doing in a film like this but this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen a few, I used to work at a cinema! Truly awful - do not waste your money....I'm laughing right now at how bad it was...the ghost rider oozes cheese, appalling 1-liners, poor effects, the story-line is very poor - this was truly a film made for some quick cash and not a lot of thought was put into it. the 'bad guys' in the film seem pointless - N.Cage kills them in such silly little ways that they weren't worth including in the film. and the attempts to scare you were truly abysmal...the care bears could have done a better job....'LOOK INTO MY EYES!'..i MEAN...COME ON?! The ghost rider says: 'YOUR STARTING TO P*SS ME OFF!'...correction....THIS FILM IS P**SING ME OFF!' ......appalling film...the screen was quite packed and at first it was only me and my friends who seemed to realise how bad it was from the first couple of scenes but by the end, the whole audience was in stitches at the cringe-worthy 1-liners and action scenes.....'YOU'RE INNOCENT!' oh dear! you know what, I've changed my mind, go see it, its gotta be comedy of the year. Marvel comics would be ashamed...they should stop cashing in on any possible film for their characters. i thought daredevil was bad and others alike but this is definitely the worst. Eva Mendez, nice cleavage but other than that....there was noting i liked...well, the ghost riders duo storming through the desert on bike and horse was quite amusing....that was until i realised i paid a fiver for this crap and could have been doing some important university work instead, but thats life...we all make mistakes....and this was one of mine...2 hours of my life ill never get back. ill survive, it was traumatic but life must go on.....",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher,"Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher and what Schmacher did with Batman Johnson did with Daredevil and now, Ghost Rider, namely give a bad name to comic book adaptations. Ghost Rider is the epitome of what turns people off about comic books and the movies made from them: all special effects, little logic, characterization or drama.Admittedly, the movie starts out fine by telling the story behind Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil. But once Ghost Rider is introduced, Johnson eschews coherent narrative for a series of ""cool"" scenes cribbed from the comics, with little logic or coherent dramatic context.Among the actors, the movie's saving grace seems to be Wes Bently, who aptly plays the role of Blackheart. Nicholas Cage is entertaining to watch, particularly when he tries to explain his ""situation"" to childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) but his flippancy otherwise undercuts his character's should-be mythic status.Overall, the film is a big disappointment, although it shouldn't have been given Johnson's track record with Daredevil.

Moderately entertaining generic superhero flick.,"Reviewed By Sarhan ""MyWord"" Rashid, SingaporeEvery cinematic genre sooner of later arrives at a point of stagnation. A point where the characters, their conflicts, challenges and circumstances may vary but the plot doesn't stray too far away from a given formula.Good examples are rom-coms. How many times have you sat through the story of an ugly duckling who transforms herself into a glamour queen so the high school stud would finally take notice of her only to realize in the penultimate scenes that her prince charming was always her nerdy best friend who saw her real beauty (Awww!). Make a few changes here and there and you have the script to another predictable and often lucrative rom-com.No genre can be free of this curse as long as the Hollywood money machine is willing and able to fork out the big bucks for the ""visions"" of uninspired creative minds such as the director of ""Ghost Rider"" Mark Steven Johnson (MSJ).Comic book adaptations, namely those based on superheroes, have largely stuck to a simple structure -01. Lead protagonist gains one or more extraordinary powers. 02. Learns to use them. 03. The evil plan(s) of a sinister villain is unveiled. 04. Title character(s) sets out to stop sinister villain.By now you should know how it ends. Just like rom-coms, or any other genre, sticking to a formula isn't always a bad thing (see ""Batman Begins""). It is however a step backwards for the genre when the movie fails to set itself apart from the rest. ""Ghost Rider"" lavishly succeeds at that.That isn't to say it is without any merits or that the makers didn't try.Kudos to MSJ and his team for adapting a complicated character such as this whose convoluted back story would be enough to deter most away.The problem lies in the entire movie feeling like one big ""been there, done that"" moment. Hardly anything grips you and each scene plays out just as you would imagine it to.Fortunately there's Nicholas Cage to save the movie with his fun performance. His dual performance as both Johhny Blaze and the Ghost Rider light up (no pun intended) the screen.The film makers however seem dead set on canceling out any positive element with a negative. Here it's Eva Mendes showing off the wonders of the push-up bra. Tantalising as her mammaries might be they can't distract from her miscast appearance as Roxanne, Johnny's love interest.For a hero to win over an audience one needs to pit him against a formidable foe. A creation so reprehensible the viewers would want nothing more than to see his demise at the hands of their hero. In this case we're treated to Wes Bently hamming it up to laughable results as Blackheart, the son of the devil (Peter Fonda as daddy dearest Mephistopheles). A lot of detail has gone into the appearance of all the characters including the Blackheart's poorly utilised henchmen. Too bad they didn't spend as much time etching their characterisations.Besides Nic Cage's energetic performance the only other saving grace are the fantastic effects on display. Don't be fooled by the shoddy special effects you've seen in the trailers. The Ghost Rider has been visualised perfectly. I just wish they didn't ruin his first transformation with all those quick jarring cuts.""Ghost Rider"" succeeds moderately as another generic superhero popcorn flick. Sadly it is easily forgotten by the time the end credits roll. This doesn't weigh in too well for the chances of a sequel but $30 million plus over the weekend (plus foreign box-office gross) will go a long way in proving any critic wrong.Reviewed By Sarhan ""MyWord"" Rashid, Singapore",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Good & Bad Of 'Ghost Rider',"It wasn't that easy to figure out exactly what was going on until Sam Elliot's character explained things 60 percent of the way into the film, but it sure was a fun ride watching it, at any rate. Watching this, I wondered several times how or why a veteran actor like Nicholas Cage (or Elliott) can play these goofy roles. I can't imagine actually immersing oneself in roles like this for several months. No wonder most actors are whacked. Anyway, I like Cage and he's fun to watch, whatever crazy role he plays. He was good in here, and they gave him some excellent lines to deliver.This movie had a comic-book style for much of it, but then seemed to go more with a horror story, becoming too dark, in my opinion. Then again, my comic book experience goes way back and today's comics apparently are mostly-dark stories. If Marvel Comics have become that dark well, I am sorry that kids can't enjoy some lighter material and still enjoy real ""super heroes."" However, the end of the film espoused some good values, I'll give it that.Speaking the ending, that was my major complaint. It went on too long. This film, with the fun special-effects that were really ""hot,"" pun intended, would have been far better had it been cut down 20 to 30 minutes. Two hours was too long, as it turned out.The other complaint would be the acting of Peter Fonda. He had a great role as the Devil but botched it up with one of the most wooden deliveries I've ever heard on film. After all these years, you'd think a little of his father's acting talent would have rubbed off....but not so.Overall, this turns out to be what a lot of other people thought: better than anticipated in some areas, and worse in others and making the movie as a whole just ""fair.""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good popcorn flick...,"Those who are part of the motorcycle culture will definitely appreciate this movie a lot more...but you don't need to ride to have a good time here.Awesome special effects, a great soundtrack, a few good ""jump out of your seat"" startles, and some decent chuckles all contribute to a worthwhile couple of hours for those willing to check their brains at the door and just enjoy the fantasy ride.Don't believe all the critics trashing this one. Go into it knowing full well that Nicolas Cage will over-act like crazy...that many of the lines and scenes will be very cheesy...and that the story will be ridiculous. Armed with those expectations and a bucket of popcorn, you will definitely be more impressed than you thought you would be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nic Cage cracks me up again,"This was hilarious! OK so it sucked big time, but i got great laughs out of it. Eva Mendes is a complete robot, her chest the only useful thing about her character. Nic Cage is great...he seems to be doing all these crap movies lately and I think it works out great for him (Wicker Man...wow!!!) Every look on his face, everything he says, it s downright hysterical! The movie itself: The plot sucked, the dialog sucked harder, the special effects could have been way better...the close-ups, the slow motion, the one liners...it is way overdone. I expected way better from the guy who brought us Daredevil, a Marvel-production I did appreciate as a movie. Ghost Rider just isn't a movie, it's a joke...But that didn't stop me from enjoying it just this once... on the contrary, I m glad I've seen it (just this once) 5 out of 10 for this comedy classic",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable and one hell of a ride.,"This is yet another comic-book movie that, this time, doesn't dissappoint. It certainly does not. It's definitely one hell of a way to start off the 2007 movie blockbuster list.Ghost Rider had high expectations of showing off a new side to comicbook based movies: horror. There are some pretty cool horror moments, especially involving Blackheart. When Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider for the first time, it scared me not only by the look of his eyes, but how frighteningly realistic it looked as well.That brings me to another point: visual effects. They're a lot better than your average comicbook visual effects. When Blackheart's face turns into his more demonic-looking face, it looked so REAL.There were a lot of amazing things about this movie that caught my attention, but like every comicbook based movie, there has to be something bad about it as well.First, the GOOD things:1: visual effects were off the chart in Ghost Rider. They all looked extraordinarily real, including Johnny's first ever transformation into Ghost Rider. Other nominees include Blacheart's demonic face, and especially Gressil's sand transformation.2: Most of the acting was well put and directed quite well. Nicholas Cage isn't the best Ghost Rider, but Ben Affleck sure as hell isn't the best Daredevil. Cage still stayed true to the role. Eva Mendes and Roxxanne Simpson was OK. It wasn't the perfect acting, but it worked for me. Last, but CERTAINLY NOT least, is Wes Bently as Blackheart. There was something about Bently that made me believe Blackheart was actually real, that it was the actual Blackheart acting as himself. To me, his best line had to be ""He sent you to bring me back. Well I'm not going back!! I LIKE IT HERE!!!"". Thanks to the voice sycncronizers, this wouldn't have been possible. He definitely brought the character to life, and thats why he is the best actor in this movie.3: Electronic guitars and drums in a original soundtrack: INSANE!!Now, unfortunately, the BAD things:1: One thing that kept bothering me throughout the movie was Cage's acting. Some of it was OK, while most of it made me feel like I was watching a mix of Saturday Night Live/Soup Opera. I think the cheesiest line was when he told Roxxanne who he really is. Was he mumbling? Was he trying to exagorate? I'll never understand it.2: Now in most action/superhero movies, there has to be some form of side villain. In all three Blade movies, you got Quinn, Reinhardt, and Triple H. Now in Ghost Rider, we have three fallen angels: Gressil, Wallow, and Abigor. All represent an element of earth. Do they provide a challenge for Ghost Rider? NO. They're OK, but each one had little screen time, and they were all unfocused to a point where we didn't really understand them that much.3: Now not that this isn't important, but isn't this movie TOO scary for little 12 year old kids? When I saw Ghost Rider in theaters, some 11-12 year old kid screamed and cried when Blackheart was walking out in the desert and put his face to the camera to show his demon face!! And he was siting in the very first row, right by the screen!! I got a look at this kid and he had to be around 12 years old. Embarrassing.Ghost Rider is as amazing and breathtaking as any other Marvel/DC Comic movie. It ain't perfect, but it doesn't mean to be. It totally beats the failure of Daredevil and Elektra, but doesn't beat the perfection of Spiderman and Batman.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"AN AWESOME COMIC-BOOK FANTASY, AN UNDERRATED GEM","I admit that when i first saw Ghost Rider on t.v i didn't really like it, i thought it was too cheesy but i recently gave it another try because i love most of the Marvel studios films.
Yes i was a fan of the early 2000's Marvel films, well before the Connected Universe stuff, I'm a big fan of the Excellent 2003 The Punisher, starring Thomas Jane, it's an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion!!! Also the fantastic Ang Lee directed Superhero Drama ""Hulk"" from 2003, starring Eric Bana & then there's the extremely underrated ""Daredevil"" from 2003, starring Ben Affleck, also the Excellent Sam Raimi directed Spiderman Trilogy, Marvel was already making excellent but very underrated movies way back then.
Now, Ghost Rider fits into the very underrated Marvel movies. I recently brought it on dvd & watched it & was totally surprised by how much i enjoyed it, a fantasy western Horror Thriller.
I've always liked Nicolas Cage & here he's perfectly cast as the cocky & crazy bad-ass motorcycle stuntman JOHNNY BLAZE!!! IT'S such a fun character for Cage to sink his teeth into & create an Awesome leather-jacket wearing demon Anti-hero, it's like it was made for Nicolas Cage.Here a Young Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil, played by Hollywood legend Peter Fonda R.I.P, in order to save his dying dad but in doing that he has become a Warrior from hell that has to carry out kills for the Devil himself.
Johnny Blaze goes against the Devil & becomes a type of Anti-hero but he has the fight against some other powerful demons that want to destroy the world, it's full on Comic-book fantasy stuff.
The cast is rounded out with the always Awesome & rugged, Sam Elliott as a mysterious Caretaker that knows alot about the forces of darkness, also Eva Mendes stars as Roxanne, the love of Johnny Blaze's life. The cast are all great in their roles.
A big great part of this movie is the incredible special effects, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider, with flames pouring out of his face revealing a skull & it's done fantasticly!!! The glowing fire against the dark, gritty & grimy streets is a mesmerising visual treat, the cinematography really is fantastic.
Yes the look of the movie is stunning & the music is Cool & the action is fast & furious!!!
Seeing Ghost Rider riding his moterbike with flames pouring out is just such cool scenes & creates such great imagery.
There's some great bits in here like the police chasing Ghost Rider & he rides up a building, it's so cool & when Ghost Rider gets a mugger & literally scares him to death & lots more great fantasy moments & some Great fight scenes with Ghost Rider using his big flaming chain as a weapon. There's at times a dark atmosphere but it's all in a blockbuster fun kind of way, i see this as an Awesome summer blockbuster movie that was just very misunderstood & underrated in my opinion, put it this way i would rather watch ""Ghost Rider"" than an ""Iron-Man"" movie or a ""Captain America"" movie, nothing against those flicks as i love most of the ""MCU"" but ""Ghost Rider"" is just simply a more entertaining & enjoyable movie, in my opinion.""GHOST RIDER"" is a pure fun, Action-packed Fantasy Thriller with Horror & western elements mixed into a big budget Summer Popcorn movie that's big on fun & full of Cool moments.
Nicolas Cage is literally on Fire here in his role!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burned Out,"Superficially, this is yet another mildly interesting Marvel comic turned into an excruciating movie. When will these guys learn? When we stop buying tickets I suppose.The comic is mildly interesting for the way it targets a certain demographic. As a matter of mere accident, the devil, skulls and motorcycles have become associated with each other. Separately, power and flames. These by themselves, just the symbols alone, are enough to define a life for some people, so strong is the semiotic power they have accumulated. In a sense, this meme is the demon.The interesting thing about this is how that meme is coming home to cinema.The modern motorcycle gang was an invention of the movies, pure and simple. The history of the Hells Angels, name, style, leather jackets, even the type of bike (war surplus), is all from movies. (A similar thing had happened earlier with American gangsters emulating their film types.)Then that meme was colored by Peter Fonda's ""Easy Rider,"" which overlaid an excuse, even a noble one, beyond a simply justified one, on the ""motorcycle culture.""From that movie manger, this sprung forth into tattooland and eventually into Marvel's marketing department. And now it comes back, Peter Fonda, his Captain America bike and all. The interesting thing is that it is all symbols and no narrative.That's the danger with comics in the first place that the temptation is to go with icons. The tradition is from stained glass and the role it played when people couldn't be bothered by words. Icons first, generating stories, rather than the way it usually is in film: the two coweaving each other.So we shouldn't be amazed that this taxi with one wheel goes only in circles. Its dumb, as dumb as the symbols it uses close themselves into.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Decent,"This movie...well, it was pretty decent. I had seen the bad reviews and thought that maybe i shouldn't see it, but my girlfriend really has a thing for Nic Cage and I couldn't tell her no, so we went to see it today.Now, I did want to see the movie when i saw the trailers. I thought it looked badass. It's the Rider, man. One of the coolest looking comic characters of all time, and in that regard, the movie delivered. Ghost Rider looked super cool in this movie and he did all the cool stuff you wanted him to do. From there, it takes a turn for the worst.""The thing about legends is...sometimes, they're real."" Lines like this hit your ear like nails on a chalkboard and others just seem so forced. There's plenty of bad lines and awful jokes to go around. I had heard that Cage wrote some of the scenes in the movie, I'm betting that every line of bad dialogue came from his bald little noggin. Nic Cage is a good actor, I'll admit that. But if you don't control his performance, he will, and you don't want that.Wes Bentley has a terrible performance, so does the old rider. I don't even know what the actor's name is, and I'm not going to look it up right now. He's the old guy though. The caretaker. And he has some very bad lines, so i guess with the material provided, he did a decent job. The rest of the cast performs abley, but nothing noteworthy.In closing, if you wanna see some cool Ghost Rider effects, then you should check the movie out (The Grindhouse trailer alone made it worth 6 bucks to me), but if you are looking for a great flick, maybe you should wait for 300 (here's hoping 300 turns out as we all dream).Let's ride..",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Bad Plot, Bad Acting and Cheesy Clichés. Everything you don't want.","I saw this movie out of interest. I read the reviews, and watched the TV spots, all of which said it was bad. But that's what they said about employee of the month, and that wasn't half bad. However, this film is bad, It's what we were told Employee of the Month would be.The film contains numerous Clichés, each one cheesier than the other. For the first 20 minutes I thought I was watching something that you would find on Youtube, made by American teenagers, who found their daddies video camera. The Acting is just so bad. In fact the theme of bad acting carries on through out the film, with only Nicholas Cage (Blaze) managing to give a believable performance, and then again it's not that good.The story itself is pretty bad. A young Blaze is sitting working on his bike thinking about his ill father. Suddenly a STRANGER appears out of nowhere, telling him he will heal his father in exchange for the young boys soul, (Pedo alert). The kid obviously agrees, and signs his soul away no question asked. later on in life he realises that he is the Ghost Rider, and must defend the world from the evil BlackHeart (Wes Bentley). Whilst still trying to win back the heart of his once childhood girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Makes you want to burn the theatre just listening to it.However, this film does have soon (well one) good point. Now don't get excited, cause really it's not a surprise. Yes thats right, the special FX. These are very good, and are what really got me interested in the film. When I first heard of it i thought; ""How are they going to make Nicholas Cage look as if he's on fire"". Well i can tell you they did a good job. There not ground breaking, but still pretty good. Also they've done a good job on the element guys, (Earth, Water and Air). All of which are very well done. These are the reason why I give it a mid mark instead of below. I thought all of the SFX team shouldn't go unappreciated for their efforts. It's not their fault the script and acting is vile.Anyway, I'll leave you to contemplate what I've said, and make up your own mind. I don't like to influence people, but I thought I would do my bit for humanity, and save you all a bit of money. So I leave you now, goodbye. I'm off to order my tickets for 300, expect a review soon.Milligan =]",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun and well-made comic book adaptation...,"1st watched 12/2/2008  (Dir-Mark Steven Johnson): Fun and well-made comic book adaptation that was much better than I expected. I had heard a lot of bad talk about the movie and Nicholas Cage's performance in the title role but it definitely wasn't the case to me. Cage plays the older version of the main character who made a deal with the devil(played wonderfully by Peter Fonda) when he was a young so that his dad would get better. Unfortunately, the devil kills his dad during his next motorcycle stunt and the young ghost rider is stuck with being a helper for the dark one for the rest of his life. He's called to bring back the son of the devil back to hell and from this point on at nighttime he turns into the fiery-skulled character from the comic books. There is a side story about a caretaker(a former ghost rider), played by Sam Elliot, who protects and mentors the younger ghost rider and another side story involving an attempted romantic involvement with an old flame who becomes a reporter, played by Eva Mendes. She just happens to be following and reporting on Johnny Blade, who is a popular stunt rider and Cage's normal daytime character. These extra stories add to the piece, but the basic storyline is really all that is necessary to make this an entertaining movie. Cage's performance is dead-on and this unique storyline makes for a different superhero movie. Sure, Mendes isn't much more than nice to look at and Elliot pretty much plays the same character that he's done in hundreds of movies but overall the movie was a positive experience which I'm afraid won't have a sequel although I'd like to see one",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Actually thought to be fair, it had some good music at different parts in the film and the effects were pretty good, but that was pretty much the height of the good, well other than playing rock paper scissors with my friends near the end which was great craic :p. The plot itself was just complete and utter stupidity, each character appeared to be a stereotype from an old mediocre action film.

Good popcorn fun,"Ghost Rider is better than I expected. After all the complaints about the movie, I found myself pleasantly surprised with it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is just simple popcorn fun.Nicholas Cage plays stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who years ago as a teenager sold his soul to the devil in order to save his father from the cancer that was killing him. Jump to the present and we discover that the devil has come to collect on the bargain they made. You see Blackheart(Wes Bentley), who is the son of the devil, has escaped from Hell. He has come to Earth to collect a document which will give him the power to create hell on Earth. The devil of course doesn't want him to have it, and so he gets Johnny, giving him the power of the fiery Ghost Rider, to bring him back to Hell. Of course Blackheart isn't ready to go back and so a battle ensues between the two.I enjoyed the story, and enjoyed Sam Elliot in his role as a cemetery worker who tells Johnny about the curse and explains all the information we need to know. Of course Sam Elliot's character has a few secrets of his own, even though they were not really too surprising. I sort of knew where the story of Sam Elliots character was going when he first appeared on the scene. Enough of that though.Ghost Rider is not the greatest comic book movie ever made. It has its flaws, but it was purely entertaining and has its place among other comic book adaptations. I would give it about the same rating as the Fantastic Four from 2005. And to those people who are trashing it, maybe you should all lighten up and enjoy the movie for what it is, a fun paced thriller that is much better than some of the lame movies I've seen so far this year.

I normally don't criticize movies like this, and like movies a lot of people might think are bad, but this is going too far. This movie should not have been released. It was incredibly drawn out, which isn't surprising given the fact that they had to take no story and stretch it over a couple of hours. The previews make it look bad enough, but if you see the movie you will discover the degree of awfulness this movie possesses. Take my word, don't put yourself through it.

Better Than Critics Think,"Okay, this movie has taken a lot of heat (ohhhh) but in fact, it's good at what it is. You can't criticize a Snickers Bar for not being Creme Brulee. This is not High Art. It's a movie based on a comic book, and it does a great job of bringing that comic book to life, and of keeping the comic book nature of the story intact. This isn't a bad thing-- it is what it is. It's not a chick flick, it's not clever and witty, it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good-- and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended, you will not like this film. If you are, you won't be disappointed. Is it as strong a movie as Spiderman? No. But the story isn't as strong either. It is, however, a good yarn, something my kids liked-- something I liked, and I'm not even a comic book guy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ghost Rider is Just Fun Eye Candy,"I went into ""Ghost Rider"" with zero expectations. I was expecting some cornball, cheesy superhero movie like the ""Hulk"". I actually was surprised. It was still cheesy, but in a deliberate way. But how can it not be cheesy when you have a plot like this. It's about as unbelievably as you can get. Johnny Blaze is a motorcycle stunt rider along with his father. But when his father gets cancer, the devil comes along and makes a deal with Johnny. He will cure his father as long as Johnny sells his soul and becomes the next Ghost Rider. So he accepts. Nothing happens until many years later when the devil calls Johnny to bring back the devil's son, who has decided to go behind his father's back and take over the world. Instead, Johnny chooses to fight against both the devil and his son to rid the world forever of their evil. That's the premise, it's quite implausible, and actually, it's downright silly. Especially since the devil is just an old guy in a trench coat, and his son and his friends look like a Gothic, punk rock band.Even though the plot aspect is stupid, the rest is descent. Usually I'm not a big fan of Nicolas Cage's, but he actually did fairly well as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. He added some intentionally humorous scenes. The action scenes carry the film, and are what earns the positive review. Seeing the Ghost Rider ride his motorcycle up and down skyscrapers while doing battle is pretty sweet. Mostly the visual effects are good as well, but there are some scenes where all you can think is, ""What?!?!"" One scene had Nic Cage in a towel and had CG sculpted abs that looked absolutely horrible. I almost choked on my popcorn. Sam Elliot as Johnny's mentor added a certain grace to the film. He is always brilliant, and always looks like a cowboy with his huge mustache. Ironically, he is a cowboy in this film. Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's girlfriend is really bad. Fortunately, she isn't in the action scenes, so she didn't ruin those. Unlike most Marvel films, this one has some scary visuals that you should probably be aware of before you take your 8 year old along. Just a little caution for you.Otherwise, this is a great geek-out movie. People who enjoy Marvel movies or comic books are going to adore it, and others will think its garbage, and compare it to ""The Hulk"". I liked it for the most part, but still had my quibbles. ""Ghost Rider"" is mostly just mindless, fun eye-candy. It is Rated PG-13 for horror violence and disturbing images.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unwatchably bad...,"'Ghost Rider' failed as a movie because the acting was terrible (save for Peter Fonda as the Devil), the script was terrible, the characters were poorly developed, the villains were laughable, and worst of all, Ghost Rider looked like some crappy Halloween graphic that my ten year old brother could create using greeting card software.I am outraged that Marvel would allow us to waste money on such an unfit product. DO NOT see this film, even for the camp value. I am extremely disappointed in Nicolas Cage - I've enjoyed a number of his movies over the years (Lord of War, Con Air, The Rock) and have come to rely on him for quality cinema. His latest efforts (Next, Ghost Rider) are inexcusably bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good,"I'm not going to say it was ""great"" or ""the best Marvel movie ever!"" Because that would be Spider-man 2 and X-Men 2, IMHO. But the movie was very good. This is the best role Cage has had in years. He's much more fun, much more interesting than in other action fare and that's why I think the movie works so well. Story is pretty good, nothing special. Blackheart (Wes Bently) is the son of the Devil and he has escaped from Hell. His father, Mephistopheles (Fonda), uses the Ghost Rider to get him back. Blackheart collects three demons called The Hidden. I don't think he ever anticipated them surviving the Ghost Rider, but instead uses them to keep the Ghost rider busy while he is searching for the Contract. It's a list of names that he thinks will help him to defeat his father and bring about the end of times. There is FANTASTIC action in this movie and anybody who says that the CGI sucks is a moron who doesn't understand anything about visual effects. The effects are amazing and, in fact, could get nominated for an Academy Award next year. Some of the fights are over too quick -- feels like the money ran out to me -- and I would have liked to see more of Sam Elliott in the movie. He's awesome. But all in all, I had a great time. It's a complete comic book fantasy and I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst comic-adaptions ever,"Watched it last evening on DVD. There's not much to say about this catastrophe. But know this: Bad Screenplay(poor dialogs that hurt your ears), a lot of unfavorable camera-angles(my father would do a better job with his old super8-cam), real bad directing(a lot of scenes are unintentional funny), and on top of this the worst performance of Nicolas Cage to this date(most of the time his face looks like somebody smashed his brain out. You think a stone would trick him). Unfortunately this Extended Cut makes this film not better, but extends the pain to watch.

He Is not Protected by His Guard Angel,"When the motorcyclist Johnny Blaze finds that his father Barton Blaze (Brett Cullen) has a terminal cancer, he accepts a pact with the Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), giving his soul for the health of his beloved father. But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends and his girlfriend Roxanne. Years later Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne (Eva Mendes) again, now a TV reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the ""Ghost Rider"" and defeat his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on earth.The comic book ""Ghost Rider"" is not released in Brazil, but the movie is entertaining and funny, with a good story based on Faust and great special effects. The fight between good and evil has a great cast, with Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda, Sam Elliot and Eva Mendes and I have seen exactly what I expected to watch. For a Tuesday night in a movie theater, and later on DVD, this film is an excellent option. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Motoqueiro Fantasma"" (""Ghost Rider"")",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Annoyingly bad,"I actually registered to IMDb to give this comment. Don't waste your time with this movie. It's the most annoying, dumb and worst movie (3 in 1) I've ever seen. I really mean it. As said before me, no plot, no good visuals. Looks like a 9 Year old's bad dream. I can imagine this worked as a comic book, but not as a movie, for sure. I can't believe such movies can appear in the theaters nowadays. And finally, how come Mr. Cage plays in such a bad movie??? He is one of my favorite actors, with a lot of good titles, e. g. The Weather Man, Matchstick Men, e.t.c. So, even if you have seen these, you better re-watch them, instead of giving a try to this one. I actually watched it till the end only because I did hope that it will still get somewhere later. Believe me. It did not.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
He was running away from Miss Mendes ! (TV),"I must thank the kid for having suggested this movie. It's funny because he has seen the end on TV and wanted to discover the beginning. So we watched it together and back home, I watched the end.I remember that at its release, critics were bad and they make fun of Cage's hairstyle (was it a wig?). As a Marvel fan, I add that the character isn't among my favorites and I only know him for being on the cover of the first Wizard magazine. So it's a super hero whose fame is changing and I suppose the movie won't help, even thought I had fun.The look of the ghost rider is really terrific and there aren't dull moments. I really appreciate the feeling of this road movie in the West and finally, this movie gives an excellent modernization of the western genre: the old town, the lone ranger, the bad guys, the gun fights, the horses. Everything is here but depicted in a new way and it's cool!Cage is fine with his faustian character on the contrary of Eva Mendes who plays like a tart! She never convinced me one second as a poor lover! Maybe with Penelope Cruz, this movie could have been a classic!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wait until it comes on broadcast TV then turn it off.,"Cartoon based or not, this has to be one of the great all time stinkers right up there with The Gauntlet, Con Air and Showgirls. I can't imagine any reason why Cage and Elliott agreed to act in this movie other than money. They have made a lot of good movies in the past and I usually enjoy their work. This movie also demonstrated one other fact. Peter Fonda inherited none of his father's acting ability. Like this is a surprise. They could have pulled a guy off the street, given him 10 minutes to brush up on the lines and he would have done a better job. This movie was so bad I'm going to ask the satellite company for my money back.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm glad Ghost Rider had movie.,"Well, to start it off, the animatuon for ghost rider looks like the animation you would expect to see in a movie from 10 or 20 years ago, so yeah, the CGI of Ghost Rider is bad considering marvel studios IRON MAN came out one year later, and that GREAT animation. However, the story and villains are interesting, and although it wasn't that big of a success, I'd still recommend marvel and ghost rider fans watching it, and I'm glad Ghost Rider still had a movie. I just wish the MCU would make there own Ghost Rider movie about Robbie from Agents of Sheild, or even Johnny Blaze.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peak 2000s comic book movie,"Ghost Rider is the epitome of 2000s comic book movies pre Iron Man & The Dark Knight. In both good and bad ways it's a relic of a time when they still hadn't figured out how to make these so they just threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. It's a romance, a monster movie and a horror all moulded into something clearly inspired by Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films.Nicolas Cage's gonzo performance and his excessively southern drawl are the biggest reason why this film is so watchable. He gives the character so many random idiosyncrasies that makes him more unique than his initially overly generic character. The villains suck and the supporting characters are thinly sketched so Cage's manic screen presence single-handedly carries this.Mark Steven Johnson's direction has no authoritative style or vision but it's so scared of any scene feeling boring that there's so many different ideas thrown into the mix that it works. Christopher Young's score goes unnoticed for the most part however, it still delivers during the most important moments. It's ridiculously close to his own work on Spider-Man 3 though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not the best ever, but one of the best Cage movies so far.Not boring, fast and sparkling - thats what i should say about this movie. Although some part of movie was strange, it all summed up in Ghost Rider. So, this movie was highly over my expectations and highly from lines of it genre. Totally not comedy movie becomes more laughable than most of crappy todays comedies in just 5 minutes? Well, thats really something new.

Soul-less Cliché Rider,"This movie is like porridge. It's easy to consume, yet offers no interesting taste, gives a false sense of being full before it continues its journey and finally ends up where it belongs. Leaving no special memories or useful nutritions behind.It's the story about how the Marvels comic book character Ghost Rider became the Ghost Rider, by selling his soul to the Devil. And how he challenges his own curse in the name of goodness. Sounds kinda cool, and should have been cool. I loved the recent movies of Batman, Spiderman, Superman and most of the rest of them. But, this one is all dumbed down for the masses, and with some totally out of place romance added so that the movie makers wont risk losing money from your girlfriend refusing to see the movie with you.Yep, it's the classic money press Hollywood style movie. Take a comic book brand, mix with a famous actor, add some special effects, action and romance. Oh, and don't forget that sweet happy ending. Viola, you got yourself a safe little money machine. Only this time, it ironically lost all of its soul.As most mainstream movie goers I like Nicholas Cage, and you will find him perform as usual. But, you will need to be less than five years old for this movie to provide any suspense or thrills. You have seen every single thing here before a million times. If you are easily amused it might give you a kick, but then again, you would probably be better off watching Tele Tubbies.The special effects, which are the only possible reason I can think of to see the movie, are on par with what you can expect, although I was surprised to see some very poor budget movie'ish face morphing effects that gave me flashbacks from the early 90s. They wont blow you away, just barely keep you from falling asleep.Tame, cowardly, boring and mostly an insult to the comic strip.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
reasonably entertaining,"Nicolas Cage seems to have a random process for selecting movie roles. The man who won an Oscar for his self-destruction in Leaving Las Vegas has also taken on action movies such as Face/Off and Con Air with great success, and has even found the time to star in family films such as National Treasure.It's not with great surprise then that we find him as Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman by day who, via a clichéd twist of fate, becomes a fiery vigilante by night after selling his soul to the Devil. The plot was clearly not a priority, and it seems to have been overtaken by the CGI, which is successful in its attempt to adapt the comic book style to the big screen. While it never looks real (how real can a man with a flaming skull for a head look?), it's impressive, especially as computer-Cage rides down particularly tall buildings and jumps helicopters.Cage, ever the over-actor, takes to his role with a typical eccentric enthusiasm that effectively sums up the spirit of Ghost Rider: sit back, switch off, and enjoy the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stalls too often to be memorable.,"I was really looking forward to Ghost Rider, not only is the character one of the most interesting out of Marvel, but the actual idea is a lot darker than your average superhero fare. For starters Ghost Rider is actually working for the devil himself, not trying to be good for the sake of it like the X-Men or Spiderman. Ghost Rider did it to save his father, only for that to go horribly wrong for him. When I first saw the trailers for Ghost Rider I thought it looked quite good, the early scenes I saw of the Ghost Rider transformation was equally as impressive. However then the critics sunk their claws into it and refused to let go. What sounded a great movie was massacred by the critics. Now I don't always pay attention to the critics, but in this case I did. I still was looking forward to it as it looked like dumb fun. Unfortunately though Ghost Rider really almost fails to reach that status. The movie is unfortunately a series of letdown only jump started here and there by the all too brief appearances of Ghost Riders itself. What could have been a classic superhero movie becomes a shambles after a while. You see the major problem with it is that simply not a lot happens. It takes forty minutes before we see the first transformation, and after that the actual sequences with the Rider are all too rare. Instead we get a mish-mash of a storyline involving Blackheart and some nonsense to do with ruling the world. It didn't really make a lot of sense so I didn't pay too much attention to it.So where do I begin with the faults of this movie. Well for starters I'll have to rip into the dialogue and storyline. The dialogue in a superhero movie is not something I always look out for. I like it to be average, so long as the action backs it up then I'm happy enough. Unfortunately the action is all to rare to back it up, so instead we get ridiculously cheesy dialogue and a cast that have nothing to work with. Matters aren't helped by the fact the main storyline just seems bland and unoriginal as hell (no pun intended). The opening with Johnny selling his soul to Mephistopheles (or the devil as we know him), works really well. The trouble is that that storyline soon links into the stupid one involving Blackheart wanting to create hell on earth and rule the world. Anyway his storyline is a mere excuse for the Rider to hunt down Blackheart's minions and for lots of bike sequences. The storyline doesn't even try to be original, when you compare the storyline here to something more complex in X-Men 2 or even in Hulk you realise just how pathetic the storyline here is.The cast as well unfortunately failed to make me enjoy the movie any more. Nicholas Cage does a half decent job as Johnny Blaze, I didn't think much of him in the trailers but he does quite well here. Unfortunately the script is too weak for him to be brilliant, but had the script been better he might have done a great piece of acting here. Peter Fonda as well is inspired casting as Mephistopheles, he at least makes the dialogue bearable and whenever he comes on screen the movie seems to come back to life for a brief period of time. Alas the other two main cast members, Eva Mendes and Wes Bentley are pretty much diabolical. Eva Mendes has nothing to do and no decent dialogue to work with here. But judging by the way she performs she seems pretty terrible anyway, so not much of a loss here. But Wes Bentley is just awful. His job is basically to look evil and overact. Unfortunately all he comes across as is a spoilt teenager who wants to cause daddy as much hell as possible. His villain is ineffective that anytime he is off screen is a blessing. And that is not what a villain is supposed to be like, you're supposed to want them on screen, not to want to die whenever they walk on.Thankfully Ghost Rider isn't all bad as this movie obviously gets a few things right. The special effects look brilliant, whenever Johnny transforms into the Rider it looks absolutely amazing. Sequences where he rides up a skyscraper on his bike also look superb. The movies action sequences also make the movie work. Unfortunately there's a certain lack of them for me to really care that much about then. But the movie also has a sense of fun that many comic book movies lack, yes I'm talking about you Spiderman! This movie knows its not going to win Oscars, it never tries to be anything more than a piece of popcorn entertainment. And as popcorn entertainment it does ultimately work, albeit in small doses. Its bound to get all the kids excited and I'm sure that a sequel is already in the works. Its fun at times so that's why I can't completely despise it, but its got too many faults for me to really like it either.Overall Ghost Rider is one big disappointment that just redeems itself from being a bad movie by being entertaining. Unfortunately though it just scrapes average, bad storyline, bad dialogue and a lack of anything really special makes this movie forgetful. One of the weakest superhero movies to date, unfortunately in terms of quality it sits alongside movies like Elektra and Fantastic Four. The latter being more fun then both being combined however.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An entertaining, visually pleasing all be it cheesy comic adaption","A lot of people don't like it, mostly everyone who I know who has seen it found it mildly entertaining at the very best. Most just straight up hated it and think it's a poor attempt at making what could have been an incredible film. I, on the other hand rather enjoyed it. If you can get to grips with the fact that its about a man who change's into a guy with a flaming skull for a head, and the mildly humorous one liners which make the film extremely cheesy then you should enjoy it. The story line isn't up to much, and the enemies are easily defeated in what can only be described as incredibly stupid ways that make you think, ""What was the point in them?"" With that said, if you go expecting a cheesy, action packed film, which is clearly there to simply entertain you, not like some other films, which set out to lull you into thinking this could actually happen in reality for the duration of the film, then you should enjoy it. Just a few words about the storyline's inability to please many of the films critics. With 'Ghost Rider' not being a highly popular comic in the Marvel chain the story had to be improvised quite a lot. With that being said, the writers have done a fantastic job on the storyline, with plenty of action and plenty of scenes as Johnny Blaze as the Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage (Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider), although not exactly challenged by this role, makes it his own and makes it as realistic as is possible for you to believe his character, who essentially is a man who becomes the Devil's Bounty Hunter by night. Finally, I come to the question is it worth going to see? Well my opinion, which is one of a person who enjoyed the film is yes go and see it on the big screen and then buy it on DVD. I know I'm going to be getting it on DVD at some point in the near future, probably on its release date. Having read this review, it is up to you weather you think it's worth going to see or just waiting for it to come out on DVD. Either way I suggest you watch it to make your own mind up about it. Don't just take the word of the people around you, from this review you should be able to realise weather you will enjoy it or weather it is not for you. Just remember...don't expect a highly intellectual film with outstanding acting performances and an incredibly believable storyline because you will come away disappointed. It is merely, in my opinion, a fun, action packed, COMIC BOOK based film, made to simply entertain.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"horrible, just a straight up disaster","Wow this movie sucked. Seriously, the makers of this movie had so much to work with and ended up with this? This joins The Hulk(2003),and Superman II(1980) for superhero movies that can end the world, in which a super hero will not be able to save because they will be so depressed from being so badly portrayed. I honestly almost cried from anger that I payed to see a horrible film of such a high caliber.First off, I would like to break down why this movie was destined for greatness. The story of Ghost Rider I learned was a story that was multi dimensional, and had a dark realism that if executed right could have been made into a movie such as Batman(1989). Obviously, it was not executed properly, and the idea became a cheesy kiddie film. Marvel took an idea full of promise and flushed it down the toilet, demonstrating their lack of understanding for their own comics.The second reason I truly hated this movie was the waste of casting for the movie. Nicholas Cage if given the right character can be very entertaining. HE WAS NOT. A glimpse of Eva Mendes can make almost any movie worth watching. NOT THIS ONE. I would hate the actors for even agreeing to make this movie, but right now I'm contemplating whether or not to sell my own soul to the devil in exchange for the destruction of MARVEL Studios. Lastly, what the hell was up with Blackheart? He was the lamest and least scariest villain I have or probably will ever see. He struck fear in no one, and his henchmen were less threatening than a hamster. Also, what was with the final showdown? I haven't been more disappointed since watching any scene from the movie Poseidon(2006).All in all, I feel not holding back on this movie serves true justice to this creation of momentous failures. I remember trying to get into the movie so hard that I fell asleep for 15 minutes from exhaustion. When I woke up, however, I felt better for myself because I know now that in a situation of extreme measures, I can sleep through it. Friday night, Feb. 16th has been stolen from me, and I will never forgive Ghost Rider for it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great comic-book fun.,"After reading some scathing reviews, I was fully expecting Ghost Rider to be a festering pile of stink. I am glad to report, however, that it is not as bad as some have made it out to be: it's a comic book adaptation that actually dares to be fun (unlike that recent Superman movie!) and as a result, it is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of mindless action.When Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) promises stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze that he will cure his terminally ill father in exchange for his soul, Johnny jumps at the chance. The Devil, true to his word, cures Mr.Blaze senior, who promptly snuffs it anyway when his next stunt goes horribly wrong.Johnny, now in the employ of Mephistopheles, is told that when the time comes, he will become a 'ghost rider'a bounty hunter whose job it is to collect the souls of the damned. Johnny's only hope of being released from his contract is to defeat Mephistopheles's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who is plotting to overthrow his father and unleash hell on earth.Knowing full well that the plot is pure nonsense, the makers of Ghost rider decide to concentrate on delivering as much fun as possible, and with a typically kooky central performance from Cage (plus able support from Eva Mendes as buxom girlfriend Roxanne, and Sam Elliot as his mentor, Carter Slade), some great special effects, and loads of comic-book action, they pretty much succeed.Ghost Rider won't change your life, and it's unlikely to become your favourite film ever, but it is not a bad way to spend your time (unlike that recent Superman movie!).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Enough Super Hero Movie,"I saw Ghost Rider tonight and it was pretty much what I thought it would be. The special effects were alright, they could have been a lot worse but also could have been a lot better. You don't get to see Ghost Rider until like 40-50 minutes in so in a way it's kind of like the movie the Hulk were you don't get to see the Hulk until almost half the movie is over. And of course there's the stereotypical love story. There wasn't really even chemistry between the characters Johnny Blaze and Roxanne and I think the movie suffered for it. And every time Eva Mendes was on screen, every shirt she just so happened to be wearing showed a lot of cleavage but no complaints from me. The weirdest part about this movie is from the trailer is makes it seem like Nicolas Cage is totally wrong for the part and cheesy and don't forget old but surprisingly enough he does an alright job and did what he could for the role he was given. I think a lot of people are gonna compare this movie to Daredevil and say it's just as bad but for a movie about a B-list superhero that really a lot of people don't even know, it's not that bad. It kept me entertained throughout and I recommend it to anybody who likes a good cheesy superhero movie. And don't take it too serious, Ghost Rider is no Spider-Man movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A must see for comic fans,"I stated in my comment for last summer's X-Men: The Last Stand (a movie I loved the first and second viewings, and found many flaws with the third time around) that with 'Stand' and the preview for Ghost Rider that ""This could be the beginning of a long line of great Marvel pictures."" It seems that I was one of the only fans that thought so as the anticipation for Ghost Rider was lukewarm at best. Critics and moviegoers took notice of the delay from its summer release date and lambasted the unfinished special effects as well as the story. Still, I always maintained that the picture would be nothing short of great. It met my expectations.Taking cues from the underrated and brilliant John Landis, Ghost Rider mixes comedy and elements of horror perfectly, combined with over-the-top action and an occasionally unusual sound track to form a truly different and highly entertaining motion picture. Simply put, it's the best John Landis-esquire film not to be directed by Landis himself. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, almost always reliable in the story department (with the exception of 1998's Jack Frost), provides the audience with the right amount of character development, back-story, and exposition to keep the two hour running time from getting bloated. Directing with attention to detail, Johnson has managed to make a comic book flick seem like an art form as opposed to just a blockbuster extravaganza.However, credit must also be given to the amazing cast Johnson has put together. Nicolas Cage IS Johnny Blaze. There could have been no substitute. Eva Mendes as love interest Roxanne Simpson, is actually a character as opposed to just eye candy (although there is some of that). Wes Bentley makes for a fantastic villain. Last but not least, is Donal Logue, an actor who despite almost twenty years in the business, has yet to become the gigantic star he deserves to be.As a fan of the comics, I was not disappointed. My only nit-pick is there were times when it was painfully obvious the filmmakers were forced to stay within the limits of the PG-13 rating (I don't remember a drop of blood in the whole picture). Rest assured, this is nowhere near being the cinematic atrocities of Fantastic Four and Hulk, which are two of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is a must see for comic fans. 9/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doritos for us fanboys...,"I always loved Ghost Rider, although I read the comic in it's second incarnation during the early 90's, not the original 70's version upon which this movie takes its cues. Faux Western and full of horror potential, I feel it would have been heaps better if it played up one or the other of these aspects.The Ghost Rider itself was TRES KEWL, and I enjoyed it, but in the end this film is like a dorito; full of cheese and corn, doesn't nourish or sustain, but enjoyable enough on the way through. Better than... Fantastic Four, Hulk (just!), Punisher, Daredevil, Electra. Worse than... X-Men, Blade, Spiderman (duh!)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun and enjoyable film for all.,"Ghost Rider turned out to be a really good super hero flick. As you can tell though, there really isn't much in the way of story. But hey, that's why I like this movie. Sit down, shut off brain, enjoy the movie with a couple of buddies.Ghost Rider follows the simple story of Johnny Blaze, vigilante from Hell. It takes 45 minutes to really get going, but when it does, it's awesome. The soundtrack fits in perfectly with the film and the noises are wonderful. Some may find the cackling Ghost Rider a bit cheesy and over done, but it gives it the strangely funny/evil feel that the Clown/Violater gave to the movie and comics Spawn.And don't listen to all the idiots in the boards bashing this movie like hell. It still is pretty good. And the CG is better then everyone gives credit for. Plus the end has a really cool Spagetti Western from Hell feel to it. All in all a great movie.

Fun but not great,"Perfect comic movie. Nobody's getting Oscars for their parts, but they were mostly convincing. Couple of funny parts, great effects, cool fight scenes. Also, the storyline stuck close enough to the comic to be ""true"" to it, but it wasn't overdone. I mean, they didn't just pull it straight out of the series or anything, it was an original story, so it wasn't just an adaptation, which is always appreciated (though some other comic fans don't seem to like that, not sure why stagnation is good to some people).Almost every scene with GR in it was so freakin' cool looking that I almost creamed my man-panties.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What a waste...The thing that disappointed me most about this movie is that it completely lacked dignity and elegance. Here I was in the theatre over a year ago, watching this preview for Ghost Rider, and I thought it was cool, you know? Awesome graphics, tough dude on a flaming bike, chains, the whole idea of a biker parading around sending evil away... and then... the plot.I'm not going to give it away... but this movie isn't even worth renting.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People should see it for what it is.,"Call me new-fashioned (haha?) But I think CGI really makes movies great. I can't really expand on it much more, but CGI is the new hotness, I guess. At least Ghost Rider wasn't stuffed with it in EVERY SCENE like Star wars Ep3 was. Ugh.Yes the movie had it's flaws. Every single movie does. Always. The major malfunction in my opinion was how quickly Rider took out the three henchmen. The shortness of those battles were pathetic. They seriously should have lasted longer, and extended to different areas than a bog, a rooftop, and a street. There should have been more violence put into the fights. Their deaths and defeats were awesome, but the battles (or lack thereof) were pathetic. The final battle was impressive, the way they made the Legion was great. Very haunting, very cool.It's funny reading other hateful comments. It's like people don't even watch the movie. Haha.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pathetically Awful,"I know this comment is one of dozens, and probably will only be scanned by other people who hated the movie, but I must say my peace.This movie was the most predictable piece of trash I've ever seen. Even half of the clichéd one-liners were muttered under my breath a split second before the movie said the exact same line, and I was surprised every time it happened.The idea of ""cast a good actor in a terrible role"" simply doesn't work in movies. I enjoy Nicolas Cage and Sam Elliott a lot, but their roles were so poorly written that I wanted to leave immediately. If I had been by myself instead of with friends, I would have left.It's bad when you find a movie funny because of how terrible it is. What's even worse is when you start laughing at yourself for paying money to see said filth. Sadly, I fit into that category after seeing ""Ghost Rider"". Never again...",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Surprisingly fun film,"Okay, look. I sat through both 'Electra' and 'Catwoman'. People who rate Ghost Rider a 1 out of ten need to see 'Manos: Hands of Fate' and get their scales readjusted.I am a long time fan of comics, and read mostly Marvel Comics as a kid. I actually have a reprint of the original Ghost Rider comic that I recently reread, and now I realize just how bad those 1970's comics really were. People should consider how palatable this movie is, considering its source.Things I liked about this movie: Sam Eliot; Apparently he can say anything, no matter how ludicrous, and it will sound deep and meaningful. The song 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' hyped up on heavy metal playing during the scene where the two Ghost riders ride together. The visuals; Yes indeed, a cyclist with a flaming skull for a head does indeed look just as cool as it sounds.Things I didn't like about this movie: The dialog; I have to agree that Mark Steven Johnson should work on his craft. I'm not a fan of one-liners either. Eva Mendez; I never noticed her before, but apparently, either she can't act, or MSJ can't direct.This is not a movie of high craft. It is a fun movie though. It's not quite so bad that you have to completely leave your brain at the door, but you do have to strap on the James Bond one-liner defense guard. It is cheesy in parts. It requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief, even within its own reality, but I mean... it's a movie about a guy that somehow bursts into flames, burning away his flesh, that will later return unmarred, so maybe leaving other questions of logic behind is the best thing for all concerned.In my opinion, it rates under Spider-Man, and X-Men, but better than the rest of Marvel's recent efforts (Daredevel, Fantastic Four, etc.)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Even my watch said I deserved the last two hours of my life back...,"After eating lunch with a friend, we decided to check out what movies were on at the theater. When we got to the ticket booth it was 3:25. I was looking back and fourth from my watch several times just to make sure it was the right time because the only two choices we had were, ""Norbit and Ghost Rider."" We should have just left right then and there; ran for our lives. Being a comic collector, I was at least a bit curious about Ghost Rider.An hour into the movie I wanted to leave. I checked my watch and it said 4:30. I knew there were some other movies that came on at 4:30 and was tempted to sneak into one of them. Unfortunately, I decided to stick it out so as not to embarrass my friend. Looking back, I should have grabbed her and ran.The second the movie was done, I instantly started criticizing it to no end. I don't usually do this, most of the time I just point out the good things about a show rating it by the amount of raving I do. Fueled by my latte, I expressed my opinion in full about how offended I was for having had to set through that. In the middle of naming off one of Ghost Rider's numerous flaws, I looked at my watch and stopped in my tracks...It read 3:30...No joke. It was ticking away perfectly fine, like nothing had happened. I tapped it a couple of times and was quite confused as to how it had set itself back two hours. Then it struck me. The movie that I had just suffered through, started at 3:30. It was as if my watch was agreeing with me. As if it were saying, ""You deserve the last two hours of you life back."" I've heard the saying before, but this was like putting words in my mouth. I'm sure there's some kind of explanation for it, but that's not the point. The point is...Even my watch agreed that Ghost Rider was so utterly pathetic, I undoubtedly deserved the two hours I wasted watching it given back to me.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

All of the characters from hell are not so strong to make the audience surprised,especially the stupid Blackheart.The only exciting part is a scene can be seen in the Trailer:Two different generation of Ghost Rider ride together in the desert.If you want to see a film with no plot and full of meaningless SFX,this is the one!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Ghost Rider, the ultimate supernatural antihero!""","I loved this movie! It was totally thrilling! I haven't read any of the Ghost Rider comics but maybe I will when I have a chance to. This movie has many brilliant visual effects! Including the way the Ghost Rider looks with his flaming skull and skeletal hands and when the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle at breakneck speeds leaving a trail of fire and destruction. I also liked the Ghost Rider's signature weapon, a flaming chain! It was also brilliant the way the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle across the surface of a river and up tall skyscrapers! Nicolas Cage was brilliant in his performance as Johnny Blaze, the motorcycle stunt rider who changes into the Ghost Rider. There were also two veteran actors in this film, Peter Fonda who plays Mephistopheles, and Sam Elliot who plays this mysterious ""Caretaker"". Ghost Rider's archenemy is a demon lord and the son of Satin named Blackheart played by Wesley Bentley. Another of the main cast members is Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's love interest Roxanne, and she is certainly a very beautiful actress. As I already said this movie has brilliant visual effects, but I'll admit some of the visual effects are gruesome, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider for the first time. I like other supernatural antiheroes like Spawn and Hellboy, but I think Ghost Rider is the ultimate supernatural antihero! So if you like comic book antiheroes then I highly recommend that you see this movie!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
connect the dots,"from the trailer, i didn't expect much. the movie delivered as much. some nice scenes, but weak script.i guess it is hard to connect all the dots. ghost rider--devil's bounty hunter on a motorcycle--is an edgy (or rather over the edge) image. how do you give him purpose, make him a character with whom the audience can identify, make him likable, & keep him dark/edgy?i had no previous exposure to this marvel personality, but this film did not whet my appetite. i am not comic-book-clever enough to offer any constructive criticism, but this film missed the mark. i guess more depth (not vague soul-searching), intellect, & control over his power might help--maybe.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great!,"I've never read any of the original Ghost Rider comics, so I didn't go into this film with any preconceived notions.

All I do know is that it was an enjoyable film, and I was thoroughly entertained. Isn't that all a movie is supposed to be? I have highly recommended this film to all of my friends, but I must warn you: if you're not used to horror pictures, this one has a few horror elements, so brace yourself for some unpleasant stuff. Other than that, the action was exciting, the humor was funny and the romance, although a little over the top, was sweet. This film garners a solid 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did we go to see the same movie the critics did?,"My wife and I went and sat for Ghostrider this weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. Sure, some of the dialogue was overwrought and took itself too seriously but I really think Cage's performance more than balanced that out. This is a movie that with some dialogue changes would have been amazingly good but just ended up being an entertaining sit. In some of the reviews I read they mentioned Cage's character wearing a black Elvis wig. That wasn't in the version we saw at all. Perhaps part of why we enjoyed it so much was that we hadn't been exposed to the source material so we were able to enjoy Cage's version of Johnny Blaze more than if we'd gone in with a characterization already in mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

You can't complain if you knew from the start it was going to be about a skeleton on fire riding a motorcycle.,"Having seen this film, I must say it's probably not the best Marvel film, not even close but when you look at the others, there's one thing fans should draw into perspective: Previous Marvel films like Fantastic 4, Daredevil, the Punisher and now Spider-man 3 all did bad(not putting the box office inconsideration) due to the fact that they tried to be too serious and spun out of control turning every moment in the film into something cheesy, unfunny, unrealistic and unnecessary which made those films do bad and not succeed viewer's expectations. This film did the opposite, it was intentional with the cheesiness, unrealism, and humor and in my opinion portioned it out well, so it wasn't over the top much like those other films. It also was more controlled and stayed in its limitations and didn't make a running gag go to long to the point it was lame or embarrassing to watch like those other films did, such as spider-man 3, with spider-man dancing in the streets or Fantastic four having Johnny Storm doing bike tricks at a stadium and coming up with the groups names - very unconvincingly; Doctor Doom with his one liners and Daredevil with Matt Murdock's unrealistic montage.Why else do you think with the Ghost rider film, they created new villains (aka the fallen) instead of doing what every other marvel film did and take them out of the comics to draw in more fans? Because it's not suppose to be taken so seriously and its not suppose to be 100% based off the comics. They don't want to waste fans' times with big villains like sandman and venom just popping up for no reason and doing barely anything to the storyline.In my opinion the whole purpose to the film was to see a skeleton on fire fighting demons and riding his motorbike, why do you think they delayed the film from 2006 to 2007? So Ghost rider would look great on the big screen, not so the story could be developed better or the acting be improved. Your not paying money for good acting or a great storyline your paying to see exactly what the title advertise's and if your not happy then you shouldn't of ever assumed in the first place such an unimaginable thing could be a realistic very well made blockbuster like Little Miss Sunshine (odd comparison, I know) or the Matrix or batman begins(not realistic but was as realistic as you could get a character like that to be)So see this film for what the title actually advertise's and not for what you'd expect it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a possibility for the perennial MST3K movie of the year; it's bad, but it's consistently funny","Did Mark Steven Johnson know what he was doing with Ghost Rider? More than anyone else, I'd figure. Yet it would be probably just as funny as the movie itself to see him try and work legitimate claims to big-action movie clout with this one. It makes Daredevil look classy in comparison, but in a way it's actually better than Daredevil in the point that matters- where Daredevil was just run of the mill, Ghost Rider is a horrendous exercise in the ludicrous in special effects, stunts, cheesy-bread dialog (look how far it stretches!), and Nicholas Cage's ultimate decline as an actor. By this account I shouldn't recommend, but...damn it all if it isn't worth seeing once; it's like a disposable item bought from a mall that works great once in the worst possible ways, and then probably never will again. Unlike some of the bad movies from last year (i.e. Apocalypto, Lady in the Water), it doesn't totally offend the sensibilities even through its numerous faults. Actually, a part of me WAS offended, as I thought seeing it 'this is what action movies based on comic books have come to, good Lord', but the other part of me, that was expecting it to be bad, had a lot of fun in savoring every trashy, campy, whatever-the-f*** moment.And how about Nicolas Cage, huh? Summoned from the spotty parts he's gone to in the dozen years since he nabbed an Oscar, he plays Johnny Blaze, a character who might be one of the dumbest characters in modern movies, and who's motivations amount to 'I love to ride, I love my girl from my teenage years, and I hate the son of Satan (played by Wes Bentley, who's another sign of the decline of the American Beauty kids), and I got to lift the curse from Mephastopheles'. So, he's turned into the Ghost Rider, a creation of visual effects and cheesy grit that COULD actually be a legitimate marvel, but ends up being better for laughs, all unintentional I'd guess. But all the while though- and I might actually give credit to the filmmaker and star(s) for this- they don't make it necessarily a dull-bad movie. Few things get more entertaining than seeing how Ghost Rider vanquishes with his fiery whip his un-dead foes, including one who is made of wind! Or just the appearances of Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot, actors who might've been amazing at one time or another, but now seem like extreme caricatures (I was almost expecting Big Lebowski quotes in the dialog/voice-overs of Elliot's). And Eva Mendes becomes almost a counterpoint for Cage's plastic, trying-to-break-cardboard performance.But there's a lot of great lines to go with the wacky visuals too, as the inanities of style and substance start to go hand in hand (i.e. the cops just seem to know without much evidence that Johnny Blaze is responsible for the first set of crimes when he becomes Ghost Rider the first time, or when Ghost Rider rides up the side of a building). And by the end, my friends and I couldn't help ourselves, and went full-blown into what had already been happening for a while watching the flick- we became like the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000, making wisecracks at every turn when not busting a gut over Bentley's turn into being ""Legion...We are MANY!"". The material just lends itself completely to that kind of deconstruction, yet that's what ends up making it not a complete waste of celluloid at the same time. Well, some would argue it is a waste, and they might not be wrong, but what a waste! It's probably up there in the ranks of the most shamelessly entertaining train-wreck Hollywood spectacles, right up there with the likes of Howard the Duck and Zardoz. Just don't, for goodness sakes, expect a respectable adaptation from original source to screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ghost rider!,"After watching daredevil, I did not have high hopes for ghost rider which was under the same director. Daredevil was not very good, the case it was straight forward. Ghost rider which was slightly different than daredevil, proved that perhaps the director had learnt his lesson. One thing, this is not a kid film like spider-man or superman which means that the director can create violence and scary scenes. There are some suspense but the director made a fool out of it and it turned out not scaring people. The director did a good job on making ghost rider to live. But bad job on finding the actor of ghost rider, he looks to old to be a handsome superhero. The director had learnt his lesson, deciding to make it more thrilling than daredevil. It lacks the violence that was needed. If ghost rider was so capable of killing the bad guy in around five minutes, why not put him into a fight with the devil who caused him so much pain. Ghost rider may not be very good but at least it proved that the director put in more effort than the crap daredevil.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sure there's a few clichéd set pieces, but there aren't many superhero movies (or Nicholas Cage movies) that don't have them, and fans of the Ghost Rider comics will see all the scenes and set pieces they'll be hankering to see done in a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cheesy but fun...,"Ever since the release of Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"", movie based on Marvel Comics' popular superhero team, the first decade of the 2000s saw a revival of films based on the adventures of comic book heroes even bigger to what Donner's ""Superman"" did in the late 70s, and Burton's ""Batman"" in the late 80s. After ""X-Men"" came ""Spider-Man"", ""The Hulk"" and many other classic names of the main comic book pantheons (even the Batman franchise got a reboot) as modern technology made possible what in the past years was impossible: to represent the fantastic abilities of the characters in a somewhat realistic way. After more than 6 six years of troubled development (it was one of the first to be announced), the supernatural hero created in the 70s by Gary Friedrich and Mike Ploog, ""Ghost Rider"", has now joined the ranks of superheroes with a movie adaptation.The movie is the story of Johnny Blaze (Matt Long), the son of a stunt motorcycle rider (Brett Cullen) who one day discovers that his father is dying of cancer. On that day the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appears to him, and offers Johnny the chance to save his father if he is willing to give him his soul. Blaze sings the contract and his father gets cured, but later gets killed on a motorcycle accident, making Johnny's soul the Devil's property, and he'll find a use for him someday. Many years later, Johnny (Nicolas Cage) is now a famous stunt driver, and is in this way where he gets reunited to the girlfriend he abandoned as a teenager, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). However, the Devil also returns to Johnny's life and forces him to become his warrior, the Ghost Rider, as he needs him to kill his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who plans to overpower him.Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (who previously worked on ""Daredevil""), ""Ghost Rider"" is essentially, a movie to spent the time and have some fun. This is not a movie that explores the complexities of its hero, but one that seems to celebrate the fun and entertainment that comic book superheroes represent. Unlike what one would expect of a title like ""Ghost Rider"" (and its themes of demons and ghosts), Johnson makes a story that owes more to adventure comic books and the Western serials of old than to the Faust myth, as he adds a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor that lightens up things a lot. Johnson truly captures the feeling of a comic book in his story, but sadly it also carries the problems that this kind of stories have, like for example a very shallow characterization, several underdeveloped subplots, and a predictable and clichéd plot.Now, while Johnson's work as a writer is average at best, he fares a tad better as a director, as he manages to bring to life his comic book adventure with all the wry humor and action he put on paper. As written above, Johnson's movie owes a lot to Western serials and pulp fiction, and this carries out to the visual style too, as even it makes a big nod to the Phantom Rider, the classic Western character that originated ""Ghost Rider"". Since the main character is literally a living skull on fire, the special effects had to be excellent, and fortunately, they are the best part of the film, as their creation of the rider and his fire is simply outstanding. Sadly, a movie can't be completely about special effects, and to his great misfortune, Johnson's skill as a director of real life actors are considerably inferior to his skill at making great visuals.Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as Johnny Blaze (an improvement over his disastrous performance in the remake of ""The Wicker Man""), and against all odds makes a convincing tortured antihero with a very black humor. Peter Fonda and Donal Logue are also pretty good in their small roles, although the real highlight of the film is Sam Elliott, who plays the mysterious Caretaker of the local cemetery. They all make great jobs in their arguably underwritten characters, but sadly, the film is also plagued by awful performances, starting with the one given by Eva Mendes, whom at best feels severely out of place, and at worst looks like an amateur trying to act. Definitely not her best moment. The other cast member who brings the movie down is sadly Wes Bentley, who not only isn't remotely memorable as the main villain, but also overacts to the point of ridicule.While certainly the bad performance of some cast members hurt the film a lot, it must be said that there really wasn't a lot for them to work with, because as written above, the writing isn't exactly the best material and no matter how good one actor is, the quality of the script will play a major role in the final output. This is specially obvious in the way Johnson fleshed out his villains, as if some characters are insipid, the villains here are dull, uninspired and serve no other purpose that to let the hero show off how amazing he is. A good villain has a definite personality and in ""Ghost Rider"" they only exist to look good, and that's a real damage to the movie, as there's never a real sense of danger with such weak counterparts for the hero. The complete opposite are Fonda and Elliott's characters, whom are easily the best thing about the film.Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed ""Ghost Rider"" for what it was: an action movie with a touch of the Western genre meant to translate the fun and entertainment of comic book adventures to film. I probably liked it more that I should have, but that's mainly because while it certainly lacks a lot of quality, it had a lot of heart, and sometimes that's all that matters. Not a particularly good movie, but it is a good ride. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of those guilty pleasures...,"If ever a film looked like a cert for the thumbs down this is it. Nic Cage, an actor of limited ability with a propensity for wearing ill-fitting wigs, in an effects-heavy adaptation of a lesser-known comic-book character. Early indications gave me no reason to hope for anything better but then, after half-an-hour or so of fairly clunky exposition something strange started to happen: it started to be funMake no bones about it, this isn't a well made film but, like all good films that know that they're bad, it doesn't worry too much about pleasing those looking for polished performances, meaningful dialogue and semiotics. In fact, like a hairy biker gunning his engine, it raises a finger at all those with lofty expectations and goes its own delirious way. This is a film about a skeleton with its head on fire, after all.Cage gives exactly the same performance he has given in every film he has ever made. His syrup sits atop his head like a fat lazy spider dreaming of the time it spied its soul mate perched atop Elton John's dome. Its difficult to be sure whether Cage is trying to play it straight in order to raise laughs or not  perhaps he didn't even know himself. Perhaps director Johnson told him to play it straight knowing it was a sure way of winning laughs. Either way, Cage is at his least irritating here. Eva Mendes doesn't have much to do but looks delicious doing it in a succession of tight-fitting outfits. Peter Fonda makes one of film history's more insipid Satans, while the guy who plays his errant son fares little better. Sam Elliott plays the crusty caretaker of a cemetery who appears to be based on Clint Eastwood's western characters and shares an exhilarating night-time race across the desert with the Ghost Rider to the strains of Ghost Riders in the Sky.This is one of those films that wants you to crack open a beer, kick back, and empty your brain before the opening credits end.

I thought this was AWESOME back when it came out. Now I see it a little differently.,"Ghost Rider is what you call a hot mess of a movie: it's bombastic, over-the-top, testosterone-fueled spectacle that gets you right into the action thanks to its admittedly awesome visuals relating to Ghost Rider himself (though Nick Cage just doesn't fit with the character's 'Clint Eastwood'-like nature); but the story leaves a lot to be desired in spite of some action scenes being well-done.Ghost Rider is your average Hollywood movie blockbuster fanfare: with a by-the-numbers plot that's done in such a bold yet uniquely stoic way it's got product-placements galore and it's set-piece porn. There's no real story per-say. The events in the movie are all tied due to a phoned in romantic subplot that ties to Ghost Rider's fight against crime itself. And I suppose, for the movie that it is, the film actually succeeds quite well; it's a superficial superhero movie and it knows it. So why not get in on the B-grade fun anyway?Ghost Rider is a ho-hum affair that you can readily give a skip. There's really not all that much besides the spectacle of Ghost Rider himself (hen he actually is on screen). 2.5/5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad,This Movie Was Very Bad to be honest it was very boring,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lackluster film with a ridiculous hero,"I was never a fan of Ghost Rider in the comic books. The idea of this demonic spirit inhabiting a man, and yet being used for good always puzzled me. This movie tried to give a logical explanation for how the contracts worked, but I never fully understood what made this different from any other deal with the devil (or Mephistopheles, if you prefer.) I also didn't know why the demons were bickering with one another to the point that one created the Ghost Rider in order to hunt down the other. That's not even addressing the fact that, if Mephistopheles had the power to create these Ghost Riders, why did he need them to do his work for him? But let's pretend the nonsense worked. Even forgiving all that, the anti-hero known as Ghost Rider would still bug me because he has a problem that has always annoyed me in superhero movies...no defined weakness. When he's fighting it's hard to tell when or if something is hurting him, and I have no way of knowing if his ""life"" is in danger. The demons have a similar problem, so all around the fighting loses me because I don't know who's dominating and who's losing aside from their physical body language.As for the human story that plays alongside the supernatural one, well it's a bit weak. I kind of like the craziness that Nicolas Cage brings to the role, because he is the kind of guy you could see taking insane risks with his life. However, his romance with Eva Mendes falls flat since the two have no chemistry. Also, they don't have a full story arc because the Ghost Rider stuff keeps getting in the way, and they end up resolving it without really addressing the underlying problem in their relationship. I did love what Sam Elliott brought to the film. He is an ideal actor to play the mentor in any movie, and he has a swagger that fits with the backstory we learn about his character. The CGI effects weren't always great, but I feel like they embraced their limitations. They allowed Ghost Rider to be this ridiculous thing exactly as he's depicted in the comics, and his penance stare was a delightfully wacky effect. I will say that I found it a bit tedious that they kept introducing pieces of Ghost Rider's costume from the comics one bit at a time. It almost became laughable how the movie would stop so he could put some spikes on his jacket or throw a chain on his chest. But overall, I think Ghost Rider is an average superhero film, that is perhaps a bit more enjoyable if you laugh at some of its ridiculousness rather than take it as a serious story.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not a bad effort,"As a non-fan of the comic, I went to the preview with no preconceived notions and came out feeling that the movie was fairly well done.

The transformation scenes were quite intense early on and parents might want to consider this could be disturbing for younger children(lots of agonized yelling w/up close face shots of NC).The back-story of the previous Ghost Rider(s) felt like it needed more fleshing out to give a complete story but did an adequate job (if you aren't late and don't know the story, you won't be confused.)

They will probably love it in all of its campy goodness. I mildly, very mildly, enjoyed it. But Ghost Rider tries for too many things, and Eva Mendes really sucks in this movie.I'm sorry, but she is such a bad actress, she's up there with Catherine Zeta-Jones as a hot actress who shouldn't be an actress. So anyway, if you're a normal person, you'll probably like it. But if you critique movies regularly, you'll probably hate it. Very cheesy, badly acted, bad graphics, and it has Eva Mendes.

Point Here...Point There....,"I can sum up this film with two words. Pointing and Cleavage. That's right...lots of pointing and lots of cleavage. The perfect mix to get teenage boys in their seats. Oh wait, cleavage, action and goofy special effects gets their asses in those seats. Well Ghost Rider has that down pat too.It's not that I don't like this film, it's just that it's not particularly that good. Nic Cage, whom I have grown to really love as an actor, seem completely out of place here. I don't know if it was his bad hair, bad chemistry or his bad Elvis impersonation, but he did not sell this role for me.Eva Mendes, great too look at and in the right role can really deliver a good performance. She has nothing to really do here except be what I have already ""pointed"", hehe, get it, out to you. Cleavage. I don't know if 'respected' reporters where those types of shirts, but I was distracted every time she was on screen.The supporting cast, which includes Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and the weird plastic bag kid from American Beauty (just kidding, Wes Bently) ham it up. The big villain in this film is a kid that I do not find evil or intimidating. Fonda merely walks around the scenes and never does anything of interest and Logue has too few scenes to really even mention. Don't get me started on Sam Elliott. Here's a guy whose big scene had me pumped, then left me with a sour taste in my mouth after he merely walks away during the big climax.The Ghost Rider effects are neat, but the bad guys were hokey. Earth, wind and water? The way people died was laughable too.

One of the most embarrassing superhero movies of all time,"Okay let me see: You got a b-list Marvel comic book character, you get Nicholas Cage to play him, and you get a questionable director behind the camera: What made any of us think this was gonna be good again? When a motorcycle-riding stuntman offers his soul to Mephistopheles in order to save the life of the one he loves most, he is forced to play host to a powerful supernatural entity whose flaming skull visage strikes fear into the heart of his enemies in this feature-film version of the long-running comic series. By day, Johnny Blaze (actor and comic- book devotee Nicolas Cage) is one of the world's best-known stuntmen, but when the sun goes down and he is in the presence of evil, the death- defying daredevil bursts into flames to become the indestructible, motorcycle-riding antihero known to the world as the Ghost Rider. ( Jason Buchanan, Rovi) So Nicholas Cage can sometimes be good in a movie. And other times he can be awful. In this movie, he falls under the latter. Everyone in this is AWFUL!!!!!! Eva Mendes, well I'll give her a pass because I wasn't paying attention to her acting but everyone else is so dull, flat, and lifeless. You would think goddamn George Lucas directed this movie. The plot doesn't fare any better I might add. The villains are more of a laughing stock than a threat, and the main baddie Blackheart does nothing but act all emo and be all like ""I'm gonna destroy the world cause I got daddy issues"". The action scenes are mundane, and flat out just not interesting as well. Just like the rest of the movie I might add. And you know what is even more surprising: They made a sequel to this! And it is somehow even worse.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

great special effects and decent storyline,"Jeez the special effects of this film were awesome only to be let down by the acting.Nicholas cage was a great choice to play ghost rider BUT for some reason he fails to fully commit to the character and it feels like for most of the scenes he was either bored or just couldn't be bothered.There are a couple of scenes when his acting skill shines through it,s just a shame he doesn't keep it up through the whole film.Ghost rider is one of marvels coolest characters and i was disappointed with the way the film was handled although i suppose at least the acting and storyline wasn't as bad as that of daredevil.Worth watching at least once because for all it,s faults it,s still a decent film just not an outstanding one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Time,"I got to see Ghost Rider at a sneak recently in Los Angeles and I was pleasantly surprised. Johnson has said in his interviews that he didn't believe in taking it too seriously and I think that was the right way to go because the film is a lot of fun. It balances humor and horror and adventure in a way that I haven't seen since Army of Darkness, the 3rd in the Evil Dead Trilogy. Nicolas Cage is hilarious. He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy, especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Standard issue comic book movie- just fun, not philosophy","I saw Ghost Rider today , matinée price, and left the theater satisfied. GR was a colorful, simple, COMIC BOOK movie. It was not brainy, or deep - go see Babel if that's what you want. For a quick, light, good time, this will do just fine. Nic Cage works as Johnny Blaze ( I thought he'd look way too old, but he was believable). Sam Elliot was great as the Caretaker, Eva Mendes was good as Roxie, and everyone else was acceptable or better. The actual Ghost Rider effect was well done. This movie was better than Daredevil, not as good as any of the X-Men movies. Don't listen to the critics who trashed this film- they're allergic to fun.

"Not the best Marvel film adaptation, but a good one still.","Of course it would be tough to exceed the level of X-men or Spiderman, or even come close, but regardless, it is nice to have the Marvel comic characters being made into enjoyable and watchable film versions, rather than those lame made-for-TV or animated series. Before the current group was created, the best Marvel film was Punisher with Dolph Lundgren, and that was a little better than mediocre film. This one is rather in the middle as far as being compared to all recent Marvel films, but that still means it's a good one. Nick Cage is a superb Ghostrider, and it's hard to imagine anyone else doing so well with it. The supporting cast is fine, and of course the effects are super. though it may have weak points, it moves along at a pace that lets you pretty much forget about them. Marvel fans won't want to miss this and others will probably like it as well. Don't expect it to be one of the best Marvel films ever done and you'll not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good effects with low story line,"We have seen the movie and now it is the time for us to write the review on ""Ghost Rider"" First, i was very excited. I though when i glanced through the preview and observe how they create the skeleton-on-fire effect, that's really cool but..... the story didn't even have any adrenalin to be pumped, just like another action movie,worse, completely dull and empty.To tell you the truth, what i like or maybe the audience like from this movie was the sequence where Mr Nicolas Cage transformed his head to a skeleton, and that's really neat.Secondly, the plot is slightly weak and the characters are not up to date. It means that they are not properly introduced by the scriptwriter and we only know the characters from his name. I mean you should be able to let your audience know your characters without mentioning his/her name and that's what i called a ""Story"" Last, people create movie to entertain people. Some audience do not like to think much so you must be able to give what the audience want without involving them to think. ""Ghost Rider"" does not have that.

When you see a bad movie you still have some urge in you to see the ending, but there was no urges in my body at all. People actually left the cinema during the movie. The special effects was all rubbish and laughable. If I was to point out one good feature in this movie it would be the ending credits because of two reasons: 1. The movie was over and I could go home. 2. The song 'Ghost Rider'.In summary: The story is worthless and the special effects is rubbish.

Ghost Rider,"The latest effort from Marvel and Daredevil director Mark Steven Johnson is a loud and messy film that, whilst it has some merit, has too many flaws that weigh it down. Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Storm, a stunt rider who, as a child, makes a deal with the devil (Fonda) to save his father's life. Later on in life he must uphold his end of the deal  he must become the next Ghost Rider, acting as the devil's bounty hunter to rid the world of Blackheart, the devil's son, who has just returned to take over the world.Cage is clearly enjoying himself as the oddball Storm  laughing at chimpanzee kung-fu and drinking jelly beans from a cocktail glass is his natural way of life  as he should be given he is a life-long fan of the comic book this is based on. However, the other cast members don't quite fit in: Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (as a graveyard caretaker who acts as a mentor to Storm) both seem to be acting in a far more serious film; Eva Mendes is obligingly cute but does nothing other than pose as background scenery as Storm's childhood girlfriend; Donal Logue provides comical side-kick responsibilities in the same way that Jon Favreau did for Daredevil; and Wes Bentley brings as much menace to the film as an Andrex puppy.In fact, the villains are all non-threatening and highly non-entertaining. When they are on screen the film stalls, and given that Blackheart is the reason for the Ghost Rider's existence that means the film stalls too often. Blackheart just comes across as camp, whilst his potentially cool and evil henchmen merely provide more imaginative ways to die. The films best bits don't involve the villains  Ghost Rider outrunning the entire Boston police force on his flamed-out motorbike is a highlight  and when Cage gets to be cut loose the film picks up. Also on the plus side, the effect of Ghost Rider, with his flaming skull, looks amazing, and the effects of CGI flames have been pushed to a new level. Sadly though, the rest of the effects are lacking and, come the finale, are reaching into Van Helsing territory  too many effects that are not developed enough to convince. Storm's transformation in the Ghost Rider is meant to emulate the pain from An American Werewolf in London, and the first transformation does, but after that Storm changes instantly and without any effect on him; we are not given the rules that define the Ghost Rider's world, and a lack of consistency is clearly noticeable.Designed to be simple popcorn entertainment, Ghost Rider simply isn't as much fun as it should be. It has too many elements that quite simply do not work, making it a loud noise of a film that does not belong with other Marvel films of far superior quality.Rated: 5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good action movie,"I noticed that a lot of people are hating on this movie so i figured it's time to set things straight:1.Script: It's an action movie made after a comic book series, so don't watch the movie expecting a script a la ""Pursuit of Hapyness"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" etc. (you get the picture).Doing that it's just plain stupid.2.Acting: Nicholas Cage does a great job bringing Johnny Blaze to life.One thing is clear: the man knows how to act and proves that he's one of the best Hollywood has to offer.The ""funny moments"" in the film could of been easily transformed into embarrassing and ""cheesy"" ones but Cage does again a very, very good job (there were moments when the whole cinema was laughing).Eva Mendes does exactly what i was expecting: looking good and displaying ""decent"" acting skills.There is however allot of room for improvement.3.Visual Effects: Superb.This film has so many awesome CGI scenes that you should watch it two or three times in order to fully appreciate them but....yes there is a but.....in a couple of close-ups the Rider's skull looks kind of awkward.However the movie more than makes up for them.This is one of the best comic book based movies ever made.It stands right there with X-Men 2,definitely better then The Last Stand and probably a little under Batman Begins.So put your preconceptions aside and go watch the movie for what it is : a Marvel based movie with a good cast and strong visual effects.You will have a blast!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was bad.,"I don't know much about Ghost Rider. What I do know is he has a wicked visual: he's a scary mofo in black leather with a burning skull for a face. Please watch this movie for a textbook on how to make that idea boring.I liked most of the other comic book movies that came out: the Spiderman flicks ruled. Blade (the first one at least) ruled. Batman Begins was cool. I don't know what the problem with this movie is. No plot? Crappy dialog? Boring characters? There are some good ideas here, like Johnny not knowing if it is his skill that protects him, or his deal with you-know-who, but these are missed opportunities, far outweighed by boring crap. Actually, the part of the movie BEFORE ghost rider appears is much more interesting than the latter parts. Maybe because they were focusing on the characters and not the demonic effects.Like corn? You'll get a lot of that here. The speech he gives at the end is terrible. Movies based on comics don't have to be like this. Spiderman has a heroic motivation, but he doesn't make a speech about it at the end of his movies.Yes, Ghostrider's cg looks cool.

Spawned from the shallow end of the gene pool,"This turd was served unto me thanks to my 13 yr old. I expected an evening reminiscent of Chuck E Cheese birthdays parties- you suffer through it for the kid, but if a little creative, you can find ways to enjoy yourself. Its for the kiddo, fine. We pay the fees. We sit. We chat and laugh. Time well spent with my offspring.... and then this turd falls into our lap and something that can only be described as torture began.We stayed. We persevered. We have overcome. However, this film adds yet another nail into the coffin of our society. The idea that there a significant percentage of people who enjoyed this movie scares me. They ""thought"" it was great. There is a reason why this movie was made. There is a reason why there is a mile of cleavage 4"" per frame. There is a reason Peter Fonda cameoed (which was a most unexpected irony). There is a reason that any depth or substance was removed and replaced with flames, explosions, cheesy graphics/effects, 200 C/D cup extras in tight low cut shirts, and the underlying theme of this stool sample. it was as if the creators intentionally attempt to hypnotize you with the sub-par special effects. Its as if the creators were making a film for a nation of testosterone fueled high school quarterbacks that live in the projects. I can just picture the campus military recruiter taking his prey out to see this on a Friday night. WHOA!! that was Awesome!!.... well that is kinda dumb, Why is th... WHOA!! Did you see those t!ts?!!.... HM...DAMN!!! did you see that Harley? WOW!!!"" The military needs a few good men just like you boys.

It was over the top and like a toothache, I couldn't leave it alone. We stayed just to see how far this would be taken. With the country being at ""war"", you have to expect Hollywood to step up and provide plenty of ""feel good"" movies for family members and even more Gun-ho movies to inspire future recruits. It's become so commonplace that subtle isn't even necessary. Apparently, neither is depth or intelligence. Edward Bernays would be proud. As a matter of fact, this is EXACTLY what Bernays would do. Unjustified and unsupported war that the country cannot back out of.... in fact it requires more support... HM... let's see- people are stupid and they are dangerous in masses. Aha! Solution- use emotion. Use the media. Make retarded films for retarded masses and then stir up their emotions. Irrational and emotional are keys to control. I really wish people would wake up. Watch the ending as the ""hero"" denies his personal life and his love so that he may go fight crime and somehow spite Mephisto for killing his father. The World Trade Center should have been in the background with some firefighters logo fading out with a transparent flag slowing flowing in the wind.... This film IS the dumbing down of our society. This is the catalyst for our retardation. This type of ""entertainment"" along with video games are crucial right now. This is the realization I have come to from reading and learning history. This film appears to be made at the request of the DOD or least partially financed by them. The Nazi's weren't the only ones with propaganda, nor were they the best at it...It will be a long time before I return to the theater because of this film. If by some remote chance, I am blowing this out of proportion and simply being paranoid- then it will get better. Soon our troops will be home and Hollywood will go back to making decent films.

Another superhero felled by Ho'wood greed,"ANOTHER BELOVED HERO SHREDDED Hulk, Daredevil, Electra, and now ""Ghost Rider""...the list, unfortunately, is liable to lengthen. All of these beloved characters could have been delivered to the movie-going public with as much, if not more, success than Spiderman. Alas, it was not to be... It seems that those who take it upon themselves to bring these characters to cinematic life choose instead to serve a kind of fast-food product to the hopeful, who are destined to be woefully disappointed if searching for some real fiber and sustenance among these flash-fried concoctions forced upon them. They can only watch in utter grief and dismay from their high-dollar theater seat as a hero they had likely grown up admiring is sliced and diced by over-dependence on CGI, paper-thin character development, wooden performances, and a lukewarm, sometimes confusing plot.SERVE UP CRAP, THEN FUGEDABOUDIT These movie-makers know it is a sure bet that a comic book character will draw a faithful audience...at least for a first installment. It seems this is often all they're actually shooting for. The all-too-familiar specter of entrepreneurial timidity seems to engulf whatever possibilities for success such projects might have held. Of course, big money, as well as reputation among one's Hollywood peers is on the line, so formulaic plot and CGI razzle-dazzle rule the day, and squashes any chance that this character might once again appear upon the silver screen. Batman, thankfully, is a notable exception. Dast we hope that this same phoenix-like rebirth will save some of the aforementioned characters? I hope so. I still have some hope for Electra. I dig kick-a** women.WRITERS, DO YOUR $%#@& JOBS!WHERE'S YOUR ADAPTIVE GENIUS? To be fair, I do acknowledge that when Stan Lee created these characters, he had high hopes only for a successful comic, not a movie. Also, certain aspects of a character might have worked well back in the 60's, 70's, etc., but not necessarily in 2007. But this is a perfect opportunity for writers to let their true genius shine, and for directors and producers to exercise some trust in the vision and commercial adaptability of their writers. It seems the writers of the ""Ghost Rider"" screenplay were heavily dependent upon the years of monthly comic book issues of ""Ghost Rider"" to develop the characters. Uh-uh, guys. Remember, some in your audience may not be comic book fans. Development is YOUR job, and you have 114 minutes to do it...but it can be done. Heck, I could have done it. I wish...CAGE, WERE YOU HIGH?EVA MENDEZ: PRETTY, HISPANIC, EXPLOITABLE; ZERO TALENTConsequently, not all aspects of a character, regardless of any digital magic, will transfer readily into a movie. This requires some tinkering, which carries the risk of alienating a character's fan base. However, TOTAL lack of character development is inexcusable. Wooden performances and characterization on the part of the actor?...off with their heads!(for wood, check out the scene where Cage is pointing and laughing at the television, until Mack changes the channel...).Eva Mendez is surely a better actor than the one I saw in ""Ghost Rider""...my gosh, has the marketing machine sunk THIS LOW in attempting to rope in the Hispanic movie-going public? Check out the scene where she jumps out of the van when Cage's character blocks their passage with his bike...uhhh. She was just repeating lines and posing (...and posing), that's all...Eva Mendez portraying an actor, and badly, at that. But hey, she's a lovely hispan-magnet, right?The graying couple sitting next to me in the theater while watching this turkey were surely thinking the same thing I was as they shifted incessantly in their seats-WHEN IS THIS STINKER GOING TO END? I'VE PAID FOR IT...MIGHT AS WELL ENDURE TILL THE END... I almost just walked out.The writers could have made G.R. much darker...far more mysterious, and therefore far more substantial. All this could have been done without losing the PG rating, and a younger audience. They could have upheld what seemed to have been an effort to downplay, though not eliminate, the Satanic stuff. However, the writers tried to straddle the line between campy, and darkness, exposing (forgive me..)their tiny little creative balls! Sometimes, a character's very nature makes it difficult to write him/her seriously...take werewolves, for example. Think Frankenstein, in the ""Van Helsing"" travesty. Now consider a character with a flaming skull for a head, riding a flaming chopper. He could have been painted as a joke, or as a tormented monster, with a penchant for doing good. In ""Ghost Rider"", he was just painted, ""blah"". Writers, I want your pens on my desk...NOW! YOU'RE THROUGH!IF THE LIGHTS FLICKER, SATAN'S HERE!The over-reliance of flicking on and off, and busting all those street lights and carnival displays had to be about the cheapest stunts I've ever seen in building a menacing character. Apparently, Satan has a childish side. For those of you with children, how many times have you had to scold them for playing with the light switch in your home? Had he any crayons in ""Ghost Rider"", might Satan have defaced Roxanne's (Mendez)bedroom walls, as well?***SPOILER*** There was one, and only one, shining moment in this entire movie. That was where Roxanne attempted to touch G.R.'s ""face"" affectionately. He turned away, saying (echoing, whatever...)""monster"". In response, Roxanne said, ""I'm not afraid."" Then, it seemed that her love for this ""monster"" flowed from her hand and extinguished the flame's of even Hell's wrath from the face of Johnny Blaze. I almost said, ""aw..."", out loud, at that one.Now I'm exhausted. In writing this, I'm only reliving the agony endured while staring in disbelief at this dud, yet another tumbleweed in the movie-going experience which sadly could have been a fiery rose. I can only hope this review might have saved YOU some agony and distress.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting Marvel movie!,"Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) was once a teenager who had a stuntman for a father and was sick with cancer. So he made a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save his father's live and fulfill his dream of becoming a stuntman, now Johnny's all grown up and has become the world's most popular daredevil. With fame and fortune by his side, he soon transforms into a flaming skulled-faced demon avenger with special powers named Ghost Rider and is equipped with a supernatural motorcycle. He's reunited with the former love of his life (Eva Mendes), meets a former Ghost Rider (Sam Elliot) and now the evil BlackHeart (Wes Bently) who wants to bring hell literally on Earth for only Ghost Rider must stop him in order to retain his soul back.Exciting supernatural horror action fantasy thriller from Mark Steve Johnson (Who brought you ""Daredevil"") is based on a popular Marvel Comics character. Stan Lee does a cameo as usual in Marvel movies as this movie is no exception since he produced it too, the performances aren't too bad but the visuals and creature effects are cool including the stunts. Nicolas Cage wasn't too bad playing the main hero and Eva Mendes was certainly a cutie in this movie, i personally think the unrated cut of this movie certainly helps improve the movie better.It's not bad but it's fun and certainly not up to the standards of ""Iron Man"", ""Spider-Man 1 & 2"", ""Blade 1 & 2"" or ""X-Men 1 & 2"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ghost rider was decent,"the previous comment definitely came from someone who never even looked at a ghost rider comic or even heard of ghost rider before he made the idiotic claim of how bad this movie was. i will say this, the movie could have been better johnny blaze in the comics i thought was a little funnier then what they wrote for him on this, but he is a corny jokester and they got that right but some parts of the filming was kinda bad and where kinda dead. this movie serves its point as a decent comic book movie is somewhat accurate but as usual is very different then the actual comic but in some cases was right on point expect the next ghost rider movie to be quite better with better writing and better fight scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst superhero movie ever,"So many reasons the movie was bad, but lets just go through some of my top ten. In no real order:10. Eva Mendes shows us cleavage throughout the movie, except for the last scene. I enjoyed this aspect and had a good laugh about it throughout the film but why have her buttoned up at the end and only at the end, how about some consistency.9. Fight scenes were god awful. I was hoping the last fight would be something worth sticking around for, but it was only marginally better then the rest. Why was it so bad, cause there was no exchange of punches in battle, each battle lasted only a minute. GR was never in any danger, hell a street thug did more damage than any of the demons. The sun was probably his worst enemy.8. The demons hiding in different elements, what was with them. They sucked, sure they looked cool, but they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag. The first scene with them has them all lined up and posing. Hey guys, you have the whole bar, why not spread out, this isn't an ad for jeans. They couldn't fight, and each fight scene only made the movie longer than it should have been.7. The first time GR transforms it was done really well. I enjoyed it, but after that he turned into GR in a second, no skin melting or anything.6. The dialog, dear lord why couldn't it have been a silent movie. My favorite line had to be ""A man who believes in love, is a man who can change the world"". Then gave Johnny Blaze the contract for the 1000 souls and possibly the end of the world. I laughed so hard I was crying.5. Was that the bonanza theme I heard as both the Ghost Riders rode off.4. Why did Sam Elliot just disappear. He rode with Johnny Blaze to the town, but that was it. He ""had enough for one more transformation"", so why didn't he stay as the GH till after the battle, just come out later. My point is why did he just ride with Cages character and use his last transformation for absolutely NO REASON.3. Can Cage please stop doing accents.2. The love story was so bad, so very bad.1. The director has a good visual feel, but no substance. There is so much to this story, I don't know how he managed to mess up so badly. This movie was way to long, at least it felt way to long.This movie is made for 10 year olds, and people who know nothing about Ghost Rider. The start of the movie looked really interesting, and they should have stuck to that. Set it in the old west or something. The special effects were decent, the ghosts at the end were done really well, as well as the first transformation. How Blackheart kills his victims was pretty cool. They may have been trying to make a campy movie. If you like campy, and corny (and yes crappy) then this movie may be for you otherwise, beware. This is not only the worst movie I have seen this year, it's the worst movie I have seen in many year.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty Damn Good,"First off, let me say I am not some Ghost Rider or Nic Cage fanboy.. That being said, this movie was pretty damn entertaining! I am familiar with the character in the comic and it is a very faithful adaptation. THe acting is top notch with the exception of Wes Bentley who conveys no real emotion... Eva Mendes is hot as ever, Nic Cage does a fantastic job and looks fantastic for a man in his 40's. Sam Elliot was perfect as the Caretaker and Peter Fonda does well also.. Lastly, I don't know what all the negative comments on the CGI was for...I thought it looked pretty damn good myself... anyone who likes comic movies or action movies that are a little darker that spiderman and superman (think Punisher in the sense it is more dark) needs to see this damn movie!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better upon further viewing,"The first time I watched this film, I thought it was OK. However, after many viewings I have come to embrace the film a lot more.Everything from the villains, the plot and the sets are over the top, but what should we expect from a film based on a character that has a flaming skull of a head? I mean come on, this is not high art. It is an opportunity to stretch and have some fun. Cage does so in spades and gives us a modern Texas cowboy.As with Dare Devil, Johnson knows the material but is not so much of a fan boy that he doesn't miss the opportunities to take an already absurd story and treat it too serious. Johnson has tackled two of the more dark comics in the Marvel catalog, but he has a touch I appreciate which is respect but not so much that it becomes blind reverence. I know, I know, comics are the modern day lore and myth. But they are not so steeped in lore and myth that their intent should be missed and that is to take reality and stretch it.I absolutely love the settings that Johnson uses, at times this feels like a modern day spaghetti western. Were it me, I would have kept the story strictly in the desert. But that would bely the setting of the comics. As is, we get a really cool story told in two worlds.Sam Elliot is the man plain and simple. His Caretaker is the grounding element of the movie, the anchor. Fonda's take on the devil is both inspired and genius. He gives the ""red one"" a much needed makeover and I love watching Fonda chew up the scenery when he is on. He is over the top and under the table, all in the same scene. I love that.Eva Mendes comes off as pretty much window dressing, which is what the comics usually do with their female characters. I don't fault Johnson here, but would have liked a little more substance than boobs from Mendes.All in all, gets better with every viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far From Perfect but Entertaining,"Ghost Rider (2007)** 1/2 (out of 4)Based on the Marvel comic character, Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt driver who escapes death countless times because he sold his soul to the Devil (Peter Fonda) years earlier in exchange that his father would beat cancer. The Devil doesn't totally keep his end of the bargain so Johnny escapes to fame but soon the Devil shows up wanting him to become the Ghost Rider and destroy his son who is trying to take over his power. I'll admit right up front that I'm not a comic fan and I've certainly never read anything this film is based on so I can't compare it to anything. I went into the movie hoping to at least get a popcorn entertainment and for the most part I think the film delivers, although it's certainly far from perfect and it's not even a good film. I viewed the Extended Cut, which I think was a mistake because there are certain scenes that just dragged on for no reason and sure enough, after watching the movie I looked up the differences in the two versions and these scenes were what was extended. There's way too much build-up and talk leading up to what the film is really about and I'd say that the ending goes on way too long as well. With that said, I thought the film was somewhat fun. I found the special effects to be quite good and after it grows on you I found the skull-on-fire character to be fun as well. Cage is such a terrific actor that it's really amazing to see how bad he can be at times but it really does seem like he's turning into the John Carradine of his time. The talent to give amazing performances but he also appears in some rather cheap stuff, goes over the top but at least makes it fun. I'm really not sure what Cage was trying to do here performance wise but it doesn't work in terms of being a ""good performance"" but it is a fun one. The supporting cast includes a fun turn by Fonda playing the Devil and we get Sam Elliott in the renegade role. I've never been a huge fan of Eva Mendes but she's good here as the love interest/sex symbol. GHOST RIDER is certainly far from a masterpiece but I think it works well enough for a rental if you enjoy this type of thing.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
the worst film ever made,"ghost rider is simply the worst film ever made. the story follows johnny blaze as he does his deeds for devil whilst juggling the love of his life roxanne, really a simple story storyline but it makes a pretty good job of spoiling what could of been a half decent film. the only thing thats on ghost riders side is that it has some pretty cool special effects and that for once in his life Nicholas cage is at least trying to act , but its not enough to hold this movie together. let me explain why i look so harshly towards this film1.the devils son in the film is totally unconvincing and unscarry2.the stupid cheesy rock music that comes on every time you see the ghost rider really starts to get on your nerves3.the film seems to come with the promise of an fantastic and exciting climax, but of course there ain't one4.instead of fighting they make fun of each other and just say the stupidest things e.g(when the devils son is holding the ghost rider down he says "" try and get it into that thick skull of yours)ha ha comical geneuise5. each character appears to be incredibly stupid and it just becomes annoying6. this piece of craps over an hour longreally i must implore you not to watch this film to will totally regret paying the admission fee, wasting good money to buy the DVD pr allowing it to waste an hour and a half of your life that you may never reclaim.ghost rider simply leaves you with the felling of regret and sorrow that for one moment you thought it may be good, its a really big disappointment and a step backwards for the comic book adaptions",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unique film,"At some part in my life I must have walked out of a movie theater before because the film on show was too bad to be bothered with. Ghost Rider was unique in this sense that I didn't only walk out, but asked my company if they were just as through with the load of c**** we had been fed up till then. Little to my surprise they were just as ready as I to get up and out.I'm still traumatized and was happy to hear that even my sister, who definitely has a more base taste in films also was totally disgusted with it and told me off for not warning her against this horror.As for the film itself; for those who might not have guessed. That consisted of characters that were barely two-dimensional in a story so predictable that even without knowing the comic you could tell everything coming about half an hour ahead. If only IMDb would allow for negative stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great? No.  Entertaining? Yes.,"I'll say this right from the start: Ghost Rider is in no way, shape or form a great motion picture. Still, I enjoyed it. I find that sometimes movies call for different approaches. Sometimes you have to take them for what they are, and this can help enhance the viewing experience. Case in point, I was not expecting much from Ghost Rider. I could tell from the trailers that it wasn't exactly going to be a masterpiece, but still I was hoping to find some redeeming qualities and I did.As others have suggested, the acting is a bit iffy at best. Personally, I quite enjoyed Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. He brings a sense of discovery to the role that works well. I also liked Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles. Yes, he's very understated and people have said that he seems bored, but honestly it worked for me because he comes off as a very cool customer and who's cooler than the devil himself? I'll also give props to Sam Elliott, who by this point is one of those actors who I think can do no wrong. It probably doesn't hurt that he basically plays the same character in every movie, but that's a moot point. On the other end of the spectrum, I was a bit disappointed with the casting of Wes Bentley. He just lacked any real menace. If it weren't for the CGI fangs they randomly added, I don't think there'd be much to fear at all. Likewise, Eva Mendes just seemed out of place. Don't get me wrong, she's a beautiful girl and her wardrobe throughout the film is certainly great (let's just say that her ""girls"" steal almost every scene she's in) but her acting chops aren't nearly as great as her cleavage.All this aside, I don't think most people go to a comic book movie hoping for Oscar-caliber performances. They go to have a good time, and in this regard I think Ghost Rider delivers. After all, it's a movie that rather prominently features a flaming biker skeleton riding a demon motorcycle. If that's not cool, I don't know what is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic book adaption,"First off, here's the tone of my message: ""I didn't like it due to it not sticking with the comic books."" My argument here is to all of the Ghost Rider comic book fans and not to anyone who doesn't know anything about Ghost Rider. If you pick up a Ghost Rider comic book, what did you typically see in it? Ghost Rider inflicting vengeance and hardly any ""good or funny tone"" in the comics. GR and his friends were always in a very serious mood in the comics and hardly did you ever see a smile or happiness in it. You might see a smirk every once in a while whenever they would catch the bad guy or some good came out of something that horrible went wrong. I really was looking forward to and compared this movie to the comics because that's what made the Ghost Rider. Yes it's true that in order to make money and to appeal to all audiences that you need to lighten up the mood. However, let's take a look at a successful movie that didn't change the tone such as Batman Begins. Ghost Rider should have been made into a R rated movie just like Blade! GR was known to inflict horrible pain on his enemies and that's why people feared him. That's why cops were trying to capture him, it wasn't because he just looked evil. Even the so called good cop who turned into Vengeance later realized that was why GR was feared by ALL OF HIS ENEMIES. If Ghost Rider couldn't do the Penance Stare on you then he would break your bones and beat the crap out of you until you would know what emotional/physical pain was. I remember an issue where GR had to face Snowblind and since he couldn't do the Penance Stare on him. GR just decided to almost break all of his bones in his body. This is the reason bad guys feared GR. He was ruthless when it came to his so called Justice. He truly got revenge for the innocent blood that was spilled. Unlike Spidey movies, which should have a ""good or funny tone"" in it. The GR movie should have had a dark tone to it. Take a look at the Crow movie, dark and revengeful movie that was somewhat successful for its time. The GR attitude in the movie was not the same as I received in the comics that really got my attention for making this character stand out from the rest. The only good thing that I can comment about this movie was that of the special effects that made GR seem very real and the actors/actress parts that did their best to make the movie appeal mix to all audiences.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Occasionally dumb, sometimes ridiculous, but most of the time fun as hell (pun not intended)","This film was never going to be a masterpiece in comic-book adaptation. Where other Marvel-based movies (Spider-Man, X-Men etc.) focused on their protagonists'inner struggles, it was clear from the earliest teaser that Ghost Rider had no such ambitions; it was just going to be a loud, hopefully watchable action movie. And that's exactly what it is.However, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson (who previously explored comic-book territory in the flawed, but somehow underrated Daredevil) deserves credit for trying to provide us with a believable back-story for this unusual character. Shame it's all stuff we've seen before (an unbearable loss and its life-altering consequences), the only variation being the contract young Johnny Blaze signs with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save Blaze Sr. 's life. Predictably, the old man dies anyway, leaving Johnny (Nicolas Cage) alone and forced to serve the dark forces: by day, he's an ordinary man who earns his living by impressing people with his motorcycle stunts; by night, on the other hand, he becomes the Ghost Rider, an avenger who punishes evildoers by making them feel the same pain they have inflicted upon their victims. Naturally, his nocturnal persona isn't the kind of guy who walks unnoticed (how could he, his face being a flaming skull?), and so he will also have to deal with the authorities. Oh, and then there's Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a rogue demon who's trying to take over the world. You know, business as usual.Knowing that any psychological digressions would be a waste of time, Johnson puts all his energy into the action sequences, and that's where the film truly succeeds: whenever the Rider gets on the motorbike and starts causing all kinds of mayhem, it's easy to see why comic-book readers are fascinated by a character who, unlike Spidey and friends, isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, no matter what (including a skyscraper) comes in his way. Ghost Rider is an uncompromising bad-ass, and Cage has a lot of fun playing him, although even he struggles to keep a straight face while delivering the line ""I sold my soul to the Devil"". And speaking of devils, the villains are actually the main reason the film occasionally clunks: while the riotous Fonda is a joy to watch (the Easy Rider in-joke being the stand-out), the same can't be said of Bentley, who swaps the chilling subtlety he mastered in American Beauty for stereotyped overacting (but then again, what else can you do when you've got the most ridiculous lines and sidekicks since Batman & Robin?). Another weak element, though not as dull as Bentley, is the romantic subplot involving Eva Mendes, primarily because even the most inexperienced moviegoer is able to guess the outcome.Final verdict? Well, romance and bad guys aside, Ghost Rider is fun, especially when the titular character is let loose in the second half of the film. Certainly not among the year's best movies, but worth a look on your average Saturday night.6,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolute worst film that I have ever seen.,"This 'film', by far is the worst movie I have EVER seen. The acting is disgusting, the script is like something spewed out of the mind of any ten year old who has ever seen 'Power Rangers', and the constant cliché's are irrefutably the bullets that shot this film into the toilet. Thankfully, I didn't pay when I saw this in theaters, because if I had I would most definitely demanded it back. After I saw 'The Wicker Man' I didn't think that Nicholas Cage's performances could get any worse, but this movie proved me wrong.

Just for entertainment,"(To start, I am not a reader of comics, so this comment does not include any relation to the original Ghost Rider work.) There are many reasons that we choose to watch a film, and for the most part we have somewhat of an idea of what to expect prior to actually watching it. If you are looking for a film that is unique and is of great quality, in acting and in plot, put this back on the shelf. If you are just in the mood for some action, and a bit of entertainment, this film in right down your alley. In all, Ghost Rider has received both positive and negative reviews, and I can see why.

Real disappointing.,"Of course my expectations for this movie weren't too high but I figured that there would be no way the movie would be as bad as the critics made it sound it was. Well let me tell you that ""Ghost Rider"" is just as bad as everyone makes it out to be.The main story had me confused at first and it was hard to figure out who all these characters were. At first I seriously thought that the Blackheart character was a young Johnny Blaze and the scenes involving him were flashbacks of what happened when Johnny had just sold his soul to the devil. Yeah, call me stupid but it wasn't until when Blackheart and Johnny Blaze were for the first time in a sequence together that I realized they were completely different characters. But also when things were 'clear' to me the story remained bad. The story is totally not engaging and it lacked some fundamental things such as a strong good and interesting superhero villain and other characters. Some of the characters that get introduced in the movie suddenly disappear out of the movie, despite showing some potential. Nevertheless ""Ghost Rider"" manages to still put in all of the other clichés you could expect from a 'superhero' movie, based on a comic book character. It's really a shallow movie to watch, that offers nothing new to the genre and on top of that is made with less quality and style than other recent and more successful attempts.The special effects weren't much good. Well, perhaps the special effects are not that bad but they just got overused so much in so many different sequences, often leaving nothing more but a pointless impression, plus the fact that the CGI look for the Ghost Rider was just rather fake looking at times. It at least didn't met up with the usual 2007 standards.It's not that I'm a Nicolas Cage hater but he just wasn't good for the role. Also the entire love story between him and the Eva Mendes character is hardly convincing and really doesn't work out also due to the lack of chemistry. The movie further more also features movie veterans Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott. Most of the other actors don't really know to impress in the movie though.Despite that the movie featured lots of pace and action, the movie still feels like a real lackluster. It lacks one big good fight and instead features little action bits all the time, which are only leaving you hungry for more instead.With a different director and certainly a better script, the Ghost Rider character and franchise still show potential. Let's hope that those involved shall realize this as well and ""Ghost Rider 2"", which is currently in its early production stages, will be a more interesting and better movie to watch, or at least more entertaining.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the tribute to easy rider,"I loved this movie...mainly because I love motorcycles and the forces of good and evil battling with each other. Ghostrider is a super entertaining movie, good action, thrilling rides, cool villains, I loved this movie. I especially liked the following that I noticed. I may be dating myself a little here but the not so subtle homage to Easy Rider was definitely there and appreciated...not only was the devil played by Captain America himself, Peter Fonda, but Johnny Blaze's regular chopper is a blend of the most notable motorcycles in bike history, the Captain America and Billy bikes from Easy Rider. The characters and the special effects are good enough to keep you watching, the acting is all as good as you would expect for this type of movie.

"No Classic, Still a ""Fun"" Ride","Ghost Rider - I didn't expect anything at all from this Marvel film after reading it's awful reviews. But I really still wanted to check it out - you know, to see what I think.?The very start of the movie with the narrating & the explaining of the Ghost Rider, is amazing & well-done. Really reassures you that the critics may have been wrong. But what follows for the 15 minutes following the introduction is ridiculous. Badly acted. Rushed. Script completely all over the place. The meet with the devil could've been done much better. But still - not boring.?When we see a few years into the future though, the movie steadily begins to please, not very much but still MUCH better acting & script. Proof that Nicholas Cage & Eva Mendes are much better actors than the younger actors of the characters.?The films peak is in the middle - the character actually being the Ghost Rider scenes. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps only because I'm a wimp - but I actually got really scared during some scenes. During the middle of the film you begin to forget the start's flaws & the reviews.?Just as the film got into it - the end came. An end just as bad as the start. A showdown which bores & is completely predictable. A cheesy & badly scripted couple of scenes which make you leave the cinema feeling 'Blah'. ?All in all - a good movie, which doesn't have average scenes, but great scenes & awful scenes. Would I see it again? Not for a few years, but possibly eventually. Who do I recommend it to? Fans of movies like Hellboy, Van Helsing & Daredevil - nowhere near as good as those 3 though.?It was still a fun & thrilling ride, I recommend to anyone looking for a fun action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OK for die-hard Marvel comic fans,"I had to see this, cause I have such interest in comic translations to the silver screen.I thought this movie was OK, but mainly because of pretty Eva Mendes and good special FX. They manage to make you feel the intensity of a full-blown Ghost Rider, so I was happy...Nicholas Cage is acting like his talents are in a ""cage"", very limited somehow.People complain a lot about bad acting in this movie, but I feel you must remember that this is converted from a comic book, so I feel like the acting is emphasizing that.The plot is crap and unoriginal, but who cares, it's Ghost Rider!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did not hate it,"Is this movie memorable? Apart from the flaming scull, no. Is it a great movie? No. Was Underworld a great movie? Not really, no. Was Resident Evil? No. They are not bad movies, but they are not meant to be works of art either. They are quick dark superhero B-movies meant to appeal to the emo 13 year-old boys (including the ones locked in some adult minds), so I do not think it is fair to hold Ghost Rider to a different standard.The main issues with the movie are:1. A weak villain. Wes Bentley was not bad but he was more like a villain's henchman rather than the villain himself.2. Nicolas Cage's acting did not fit the movie. He played it straight. He was acting a poor tormented man, taking his drama way too seriously. Why would the director go with that approach? The premise of the movie clearly required some goofiness, which Cage could have totally provided. That is what you hire the guy for and yet his potential was not used.3. The story...I can't remember any of it. The script as a whole was a bit of a mess. Something about the deal with the devil and the flaming scull. That is all.But the movie also has a few positives:1. The Ghost Rider. The action parts with the Ghost Rider were a lot of fun. He looks great. I never got tired of that flaming skeleton on a bike. Yes, of course it's just CGI, but it still looked awesome. There was a scene where he rides on the side of a building. It was ridiculous and exactly as God intended.2. The sound design. The roaring engine of the bike, the dark music, the metal chain smacking around. There is an excellent cling-clang sound pallet to complement the art.All in all, I do not know what people expected this would be. It's a B action movie with little to no story in it.

An Honest Review,"Here is the deal. Johnny Blaze was possessed by an evil and dangerous entity called Zarathos who was a fundamentally evil being. What good he did was due to the constant inner struggle with Johnny Blaze, who was a very good man.Dan Ketch was a kid from Brooklyn what was possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance, who was fundamentally a good spirit. And though they both struggled for control, the entity and its host trusted one another and worked together.What this movie does is tries to mesh Blaze and Ketch and the spirits that possess them together...and it doesn't work.The amalgamation robs the story of the intense inner turmoil and the fight between Blaze and the evil entity possessing him...that was a very good, very fun, very intense story that this film NEVER tells.And Dan Ketch, the story wasn't as interesting, but it was still good focused more on the community, the town, the family life and the stress that the entity caused in the hosts personal life...it was still a very good story, it was still very fun, and it was, again, NEVER told here.By trying to push the two of them together--including the supporting cast--the movie loses the stories from BOTH of them. What you get instead is. vapidity, and all the CGI in the world can't save a movie with no story.There was no direction. There was no grand scheme. There were no real characters. It tried to be two different things at the exact same time and, because of that, didn't tell a story.It ended up being special effects without a story and nothing more.Had it chosen a direction, either direction, even an entirely new direction, the movie could have told a story.

Very enjoyable movie.....,"Thought it was a fine movie based on a comic book. Never read the comics so didn't have preconceived notions about it. There will be no Oscar nominations from it (wink wink) but who wants that in a movie such as this. I wanted to be entertained and was. My kids also loved it. I've read reviews saying the movie was cheesy and it was, but really so has every movie based on a comic book. That's kind of what Ienjoy about them. I very much recommend this for people that aren't going to take it seriously. If you want that go rent ""The Piano"" or something. Want to have some fun with the kids...have a good time with this one. Had some scary moments so use your own judgment if your kids can handle it. Mine did fine but lots of folks getting burned up and changing into monsters and stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Honest Review,"Bad. Horrid. Awful.You can choose the word for it.Who is Ghost Rider? Is it Johnny Blaze or Dan Ketch? Is it the evil spirit of vengeance or the good one? It's hard to tell, mainly because the movie never seems to make that judgement call.They tried to combine them both and failed horribly.And then Blaze himself, Nick Cage just can't really pull it off. Too earnest, he over acts a little too much, he tries to make the tortured Johnny Blaze a little too light and likable, but that could just be because they couldn't decide which Ghost Rider they were depicting.Sure, it was fun watching his fiery alter-ego ride around dispensing vengeance, but in the end, at the final stand-off, we got something rushed and under-cooked.You sit down for a movie, and even on a mindless popcorn crunching level, you leave disappointed.They just can't force an audience to care at all about this Ghost Rider or his human host.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyed watching it,"I don't know much about Ghost Rider comics or if this movie was good adaptation of it but what I know is that when I watched this movie at that time I enjoyed watching it. It is good with action and entertainment. Yes, casting was not strong and story felt little bit loose but overall it is a good entertainer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Daredevil is no Longer the Worst Marvel Movie!,"The acting in this movie was laughable. I mean if you were to make a movie and pick pretty much some of the worst and most bland actors of all time you would get this film.Nicholas Cage's facial expressions were also making me crack up.When Nicholas Cage nails his face off of the ramp I was pretty much dieing of laughter as well.And lest we forget the giant age gap between him and Eva Mendes. When the two were teen sweethearts they were the same age. The he ages an extra thirty years and she ages like four or five.The best part of the whole movie however was when Peter Fonda says ""Nice Bike"". I practically peed my pants. Anything that guy says is funny. He can't be serious because his acting prohibits him from doing so.All in all I give this movie 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The movie was pretty good,There were many metaphors alot in this movie. The movie said the battle betwwen the charitable human and evil will not finish and it is on. It an open end to prove it.

Hollywood once again ruin another Comic book.,"Nicholas Cage last made a good film in what year? I can think of Moonstruck and Birdie. They were last films he actually did any acting in. These days he's either really not trying or grimacing like he has a neurological disorder. Everyone involved in Ghost Rider should hang their heads in shame. - actually Nichols ""I'm NOT BALD"" Cage can just use his unconvincing hairpiece to cover his face. I cannot believe they made a sequel. When will the Studio system stop doing this to the fans? I will be honest and say that Ghost Rider was one of my least favourite titles but it was Kafka compared to this ill-conceived, poorly written, offence to the intellect.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Extremely Entertaining escape into delirious Blockbuster Heaven!,"I saw Ghost one week ago, and I was very impressed! Nicholas Cage brought pathos and pity to the character of Johnny Blaze, an Evil Knivel-esquire stunt rider who sells his should to Mephistopheles, AKA Satan, in return for saving his father's deadly cancer. Every night, Johnny transforms into Ghost Rider, the demonic servant of the Devil, with a flaming skull for a head, rides a supernatural Chopper bike, and uses a motorcycle chain as a whip/lasso. His job: to hunt down the devil's son, Blackheart, who has gone rogue and has enlisted the aid of three vicious demons to help him find an ancient document hidden by the original Ghost Rider, which will unleash Hell on Earth.Okay, here's the facts. This movie is a typical Blockbuster with effects, some action, and lots of demonic imagery. It does star Nicholas Cage. It it a comic book film that differs greatly from the books.Now that we understand that, let me tells you the things about this film that make it a fine pic for watching. The acting is fine, with momentary lapses, but so what? The characters are fairly likable, and I especially like Johnny's good friend, who's name I cannot remember, who is the most sensible person in the film. And if there's one thing every movie needs, It's a great villain(s). And we get that with the super-evil Satan and Blackheart, well-played and extremely menacing. And Ghost Rider himself is VERY cool!!! In the end, Ghost Rider wins! I loved it, and you should too!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ouch!,"Quite possibly.......the worst movie ever made. Shameful performances, horrible plot, and even more shameful performances. Cool effects though.I'm sorry I'm not a fan of the comic book, but I hope that this movie satisfies all those fans, because I can see no other reason to like this movie. Movies based on comic books need to do one thing, and that is STAND ON THEIR OWN! It's great to read all the great reviews that start out ""I was a huge fan of the comic book, and WOW....."". If they were really trying to market this movie just to those die hards, they would have made 12 dollars at the box office. To put this horrible movie out for general consumption is a crime.But the effects...wow...somebody really did their job there. Way to go effects people! But whoops, somebody must have forgotten about the script, the acting, and everything else that makes a movie bearable.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Would love to see a sequel,"I kinda have to agree with some of the negativity of some of the comments, with regard to the anomalies of the script. However, I think the basic story was interesting, and the FX were great, especially the ghost rider. Now that he story has been told to explain where the ghost rider came from, I would like to see a sequel with a whole lot more action in it. One might compare it to the original Alien movie versus the Aliens movie(#2), in that the second version got right into the action and never let up. Ghost rider two could be a top notch action flick. You would not even need Eva Mendes to come back for the sequel, but the eye candy she provides would be welcome as far as this viewer is concerned!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Most I've Laughed In Ages,"... which is bad when the movie you are watching isn't a comedy. The script is cheesy, the acting is hammed up at best - when it is not just God awful, and the action sequences were not even exciting. The plot sucked as well. Skip unless you enjoy movies that are so bad they make you laugh. Which it DOES deliver.The ending makes you cringe and want to lash out at the screen.Nicholas Cage's head is CGI-ed onto a younger man's body at one point to give him six pack abs.The villain is not even scary nor does he present a real fight or dilemma. I also could not figure out why ""Johnny Blaze"" had an accent while his girlfriend did not even though she was from the same area as him.The movie was one big action genre cliché, gone bad. Skip the $10 and wait until it debuts on TV sometime.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Riding With The Devil,"I have chosen to do Ghost Rider as my film review because it is a very action packed movie. Some of the major movie actors in this movie are Nicolas Cage who plays Johnny Blaze, the person who does all the tricks on his motorcycle just like his father; Donal Logue, also known as Mack, plays as the famous Johnny's assistant; Eva Mendes, or Roxie, is a news reporter and Johnny's childhood sweetheart; Peter Fonda is the devil that tricks Johnny into selling him his soul.The events of this movie begin when Johnny discovers that his dad has cancer. A few days after Johnny finds out about his dad's cancer he is visited by the devil. The devil promises him that if he sells his soul to him, he will cure his dad's cancer. Young Johnny does not realize is that the devil makes no deals with anyone and cares for no one. The next day Johnny's father's cancer is gone, but his dad dies upon doing a stunt for the circus that day. The devil does not care that he lied and cured his father's cancer, but killed him another way instead. The devil shows up upon Johnny's dad's death and promises Johnny that he will be back at a later date for Johnny to pay his part of the deal. Johnny is now a famous, older stunt person who will try anything because he is invincible in his eyes. Now the devil decides to come back to retrieve Johnny's part of the deal. The devil asks that Johnny find the one known as Blackheart and permanently get rid of him. This where Johnny turns into Ghost Rider, with the flaming motorcycle and body in a leather jacket. The flaming bike with the Ghost Rider can go up and down buildings, fly through streets, etc. in no time doing tons of destruction. Roxie, Johnny's childhood sweetheart, comes around again in an attempt to get an interview from Johnny for the television. Johnny sees Roxie as his way to possible get help out of his rut with the devil and reaches out to her.This is the coolest by far that I have seen in a long time. I like this movie because I love motorcycles and the movie is just so eye-catching with all the flames and action. From a normal motorcycle turning into a flaming skeleton, to a human turning into a flaming person, it is awesome. You will not be able to take your eyes off the screen!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of what could have been good,"Being from Melbourne, I was interested in seeing what parts of Melbourne were in the film. I recognised afew which was cool. Also saw some local actors and one guy who always plays a funny kind of guy in commercials produced locally.That was where my interest remained unfortunately. Even Nicholas Cage could not save this movie. The story line was really lacking. The puns and one-liners were nor really that funny and in most instances extremely cheesy.This could have been really good. Apart from the CG being a little lacking in parts, a good storyline would have held it together. Parts of the movie that really could have had you hanging onto your seat were really ordinary and abrupt. Some parts were extremely presumptuous and left me wondering why this or that was happening with no given explanation provided.Definitely wait for the DVD to get to your local video store. I wish I did.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Despite it's own problems, I think I really like this film","A friend of mine showed this to me on DVD at school a few days ago and at first, I wasn't very interested, but since this is one of the few superhero movies I've recently seen, I thought, ""Oh, well. Might as well give this a shot."" and watched it with little expectations. A few minutes later, when I see the Ghost Rider started appearing for the first time, I was left speechless, but in terms of story in narrative forms, I don't think that this is a masterpiece of superhero films, although I do think that this is a very good movie.I understand all the criticism it had when it first came out in theaters and I'll admit that the dialog is pretty silly along with it's inept script containing it's schmaltzy moments, but in my opinion, I liked this for what it was.I like the music from Christopher Young. His blend of Gothic and western themes along with some guitar pieces fitted well for the film. The CGI effects, although below par, are at least decent with some neatly detailed look of the Ghost Rider and his awesome bike. The action is also pretty cool too with Ghost Rider killing his enemies, but I think the acting steals the show. Sam Elliot did great with his role, Eva Mendes did very well as the lead role's love interest and Peter Fonda did a decent job as Mephisto. Now, I don't hate Nicolas Cage as much, but I personally think that he was miscasted as the leading role. I think a much better actor (like Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps?) would have fitted the role. Wes Bentley, however, is uninteresting as the villain due to his lack of emotion.OK, I know you guys are going to hate me for this, but... I really like the story. Now, I never read the comics this was based on, but I think that it's really faithful to the spirit and tone despite it's disappointing ending (which was the only problem that I do have with the plot) and has some nice visuals; not to mention it has great cinematography. The editing however, is rather choppy at times.So, is Ghost Rider's a masterpiece? Not exactly. Is it as bad as the critics and others say it is. Not quite. Like I said, I understand the criticism it had in a superhero movie, but that kind of hatred goes to Batman & Robin and Steel (those were terrible superhero movies). So, overall, not great, but I liked it for what it was and it's a faithful adaptation of the comics I never read.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I want my money back,"I can't remember when was the last time I walked out of a movie. Wait, i believe i remember now, it was Catwoman. Actually, Catwoman is an Oscar contender compared to the trash i just saw in the cinema. I'm sorry, i really wasn't expecting much. I remember reading the comic a couple of times as a kid and from the previews it didn't look too bad. Yeah yeah, it's a guy on a bike with a flaming skull, i get it, but at least I though i was going to be entertained for an hour and a half. Well, about 50 minutes into it i refused to sit and waste my time on a movie that i would give all the Razzies to unchallenged. Other than the special effects the story is complicated for someone not familiar with the comic book, the dialogue is awful right from the beginning and the cheesiness is unbearable.

One of the best bad movies I've seen,"8 years after the original release, I finally got around to seeing Ghost Rider. It was not much loved by the critics, so it was never on my ""must see"" list. Having procured an inexpensive copy, I thought I'd give it a go.Let's clear the air first. This is not a good movie for many reasons. The writing is bad. The plot is predictable. The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, and this movie definitely slows down at one point.Having said that, it is still a lot of fun. Early on, we meet the main character and his love interest, which is one of the things that plays our predictably for the most part. We find out about his young life and an important life changing decision he makes. We come to the present day Johnny Blaze and witness his evolution into Ghost Rider. He's given a very specific task he has to undertake, which he does begrudgingly. Watching him handle the early transitions from human to Ghost Rider, I kept thinking of a flaming Hulk. Dr. Banner would have been proud.Johnny continues his mission, and finds out the answers to some mysteries along the way. Now wanted by the police, he must figure out how to handle what his life has become.The effects in this movie are pretty great, and I found myself admiring touches like the flaming trails left by the motorcycle. There were a few humorous moments, and of course a lot of Nick Cage... well... being Nick Cage.If you don't mind very imperfect films, this one is a fun way to spend an afternoon. Just don't make a list of holes or errors, or you'll run out of ink.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
simply BRILLIANT!,"this movie opened a new field in cinematography. it's a comedy without them actually telling you it's one, so you can enjoy it in two totally different ways, depending on your affinities. although, if your looking for this type of entertainment i'd rather recommend 'breakfast at tiffany's'.but that's just a bonus (no extra charge). the real genius of the movie lies in the fact that they managed to animate nicolas cage without anyone noticing! - Japanese people you can kiss our white, Christian, round-eyed, not-all-black-haired, much nicer and more masculine bums!OK, i must admit, if you look REALLY REALLY close you might find some flaws. for instance, it's not recommendable for children (not even if your the devil himself). then it might make you sell your soul for eternal imprisonment of ego and thus lead a linear and mechanized life deprived from a phenomena some prefer to as empathy. also, it lacks a sense of devotion, creativity, originality, belief that people haven't forgotten terminator 2, about 40 million dollars and goggles more of ingredients a decent blockbuster Otha have.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The GOOD kind of comic- book film,"Unlike many comic- book based films, Ghost Rider doesn't take itself too seriously. Nicolas Cage was a real shock for me, i could NOT imagine him as any kind of Comic- book hero, let alone a burning skeleton on a bike. However, he was good and somehow believable as the dare- devil. I enjoyed this film, not because the acting was brilliant or the story line grabbed me, but because it was fun, the special effects were excellent, and it is a good action/fantasy movie to cheer you up. I found myself grinning and laughing at some of the 'camp' moments and music choices. The script sounds like a comic which works well with the comic- like atmosphere this film creates. I don't know how true to the original Marvel it is, however as a stand alone movie it is great fun and easy to watch- no puzzling out difficult story lines- or thinking at all actually.Silly and enjoyable for a rainy day.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Eva Mendes was horrible. The villain Black Heart was the wussiest character ever. The beginning had the young Johnny and Roxanne, both played by terrible, terrible actors. Johnnys dad gave no reason to be kept alive. The guy was a dick.Don't see this movie. If you value your time, don't see it.

watch a cartoon...but not the movie. it sucks,"Based on an absurd LEGEND of GhostRider, Could it get any stupid than this....? i never expected this from Nicholas Cage to star in such a stupid and absurd movie. i would like to ask the director and the person behind this movie, when did devil start to work for the betterment of humanity? how come devil has a son in the movie but where the hell is the mother devil? All of a sudden devil's son wants to rule the world...hahahaha. why the hell the devil wants to bring his stupid son back to hell and why does he need a human bounty hunter for that. i cant believe it that i actually got that movie on DVD. Leave everything aside, who is the real devil in the movie, the old man or his son? if there had some skin Eva Mandes, i might have enjoyed the movie a bit, perhaps. it had been better if i had watched a South-Indian (tamil/Malyalam dubbed in Hindi/urdu) instead of Ghost Rider. u can't expect this kind of thing from a Hollywood movie. i being a Muslim believe that Satan was exiled from heaven for not obeying God's orders, when God asked him bow before the body of ADAM (peace be upon him). Satan refused to bow and thus he was exiled. and later he persuaded ADAM and EVE to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree. so how come the devil is helpless in front of his own son?i recommend....donot watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In preparation for the sequel that i hope never comes...,"I really find it hard to believe how someone can expect more than ordinary, for a movie where the main character is a skeleton on fire, CG has come a long way but even if we ever reach the stage where real actors can be replaced by Animated ones there is no way you can extract more than this much facial expressions from a flaming skull.For the reasons stated above i went into the movie expecting nothing more than a 5, and this movie didn't for once look like it was going to cross that figure.From the beginning you know that this movie is going to be as cheesy as it gets, even big fans of extra cheese like me (i like B-movies) will find it hard to digest the corny scenes and stereotypical dialogues that this movie has (hell sometimes you can predict it to last pause), any hope this movie had of rising above the ordinary is thrown away in the scene where Peter Fonda makes his appearance as the devil.From then on this movie follows with one ordinary scene to the other, it felt like the entire movie was like walking of top of a wall, however it always felt that like the movie would fall on the wrong side not once did it look like this movie would fall on the right side and then breakaway from the ordinary.The dialogues are corny, the computer graphics are ordinary (IN A TIME WHERE CG RENDERED STUNTS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE OUTRAGEOUS, showing us stunts that may be yet attempted by Robbie Knievel, using CG don't even extract an ounce of excitement). The rest of the stunts are equally ordinary not a single one is worth a mention, to add to that the CLIMAX IS AS ORDINARY AS IT GETS.Save for the presence of Nicholas Cage this movie would have made a great B-movie.Shockingly the acting to is completely ordinary Nicholas plays a spaced out character that would have been better suited in movies like mall-rats, clerks etc. Not a single character rises above B movie standards.By far the best this about this movie is Eva Mendes she looks sizzling, she brings much needed humour to the film and even though i hate to say it there love angle is by far the best part about this film, and did i mention THAT SHES MORE SIZZLING THAN THE ON FIRE GHOST RIDER.The soundtrack is disappointing too, and character development is minimum, the entire movie feels like an exercise to make the mandatory 3 sequels (atleast) that we have come to associate with Hollywood in recent times,THANK GOD THIS MOVIE HAS NO POTENTIAL FOR THE EVEN MORE TORTOROUS SPIN-OFFS (think Electra and cat-woman).What could have made a great B-movie is not only a bad/ordinary A-movie.The film-makers could have got the hint when the best power that GR gives the people a taste of their own sins,hardly exciting when by Christian standards MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD AND THE WHOLE OF America HAS A PLACE RESERVED IN HELL.Even though I've hardly written anything good about the movie pulls through on some good one liners, EVA MENDES, LOADS OF ORDINARY SCENES THAT JUST ABOUT HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND Phenomenally LOW Expectations.Watch only if really really bored, if you like B-Movies and are willing to see this as one, and love Eva Mendes (shes wearing clothes fit for a nun though), free tickets for the premiere(in my case) or really cheap matinée show is a must.-s weak on all technical fronts including acting (suprisingly), no excitement whatsoever.+/-s would have made a good/great B-movie.+s EVA MENDES, good one liners and humour, lots of ordinary scenes that hold your attention.total 5/10 (facoring in expectations (lets not talk about PG-13) if you watch it like an A-list movie with Nicholas Cage then the rating will be much lower)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a very uneven movie with some worthwhile elements and some painful sequences,"Ghost Rider (2007) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows a young man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange to help his father battle cancer. The young man knows one day the devil will ask for a favor in return and because he knows this is coming he refuses to fall in love, settle down and have a family. When the Devil's son decides it's his time to rule planet Earth the devil decides to cash in his IOU and asks the young man to stop his son. Meanwhile, love is on the young man's door step but he's scared to commit. Can he do both, save the world and be in love?This movie is directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Love, Guaranteed) and stars Nicolas Cage (The Rock), Peter Fonda (Easy Rider), Eva Mendes (Hitch), Sam Elliott (Road House), Donal Logue (Blade) and Wes Bentley (American Beauty).This cast is absolutely amazing, top to bottom. Sam Elliot was tremendous in this picture, both as a character and as a narrator. The CGI is a bit inconsistent with every scene with the Ghost Rider being outstanding and every scene with Dark Heart being awful. The writing, specifically the dialogue, was cheesy and inconsistent, but the overall premise and circumstances were fun and entertaining.Overall, this is a very uneven movie with some worthwhile elements and some painful sequences. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mark Steven Johnson: Please Stop Making Movies,"Until now, I thought Daredevil was the worst movie I had ever seen. Then I watched Ghost Rider. The connection: Mark Steven Johnson wrote both screenplays. I'm angry because this guy keeps taking these comic books and ruining them on the big screen (compare Sam Raimi and Mark Steven Johnson and you'll understand my point).I'm a professional writer with a life-long passion for comic books, and I can tell you that, when done properly, comic books are written tightly. They should keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, Ghost Rider is incredibly slow. It actually made me angry to see any semblance of good, tight writing ignored and replaced with stunts and special effects.Ugh. Don't waste your time with this one. I hope Marvel and DC don't give this guy access to any other titles in the catalog.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Never Catches Fire,"The trailers have finished and the lights are dimming completely now. That familiar torch lady in the Columbia Pictures logo has appeared and quickly vanishes into the Marvel Comics flipping logo which transforms into a Ghost Rider inspired font. Finally the Crystal Sky logo is shown, then it comes; a somewhat interesting, but not quite exciting narration by Sam Elliott, who here plays the Caretaker. After we are told the ""backstory"" the high energy, fire decorated opening credits begin. It's here I think to myself, come on Johnson, impress me. About an hour and fifty minutes later I accept the fact that I asked for too much. Don't get me wrong, there's lot of sparks, most being the visuals, but the fire never really gets going in 'Ghost Rider'.The storyline here really isn't all that complex. When Johnny Blaze, first played Matthew Long, was a teen he made a deal with the Devil, better known here as Mephistopheles, played by Peter Fonda. This deal was to save his ""father"" from the cancer that was slowly killing him. Mephisto keeps to the deal, but Johnny's ""father"" dies later that same day during a motorcycle stunt. In exchange for his ""father's"" health, even though short-lived, Johnny will one day be called upon to become the Ghost Rider and do Mephisto's bidding. Years later, Johnny, now played by Nicolas Cage, is a famous stunt driver and is haunted by the deal he made every day of his life. The time comes and he is revisited by Mephiso and told to seek out and destroy Blackheart, played by Wes Bently, who has his own team of thugs known as the Nephilim. Once he does, Johnny is promised his soul will be returned, thus ridding him of the curse he currently bears.So there you have it, the basic outline for 'Ghost Rider'. That is where the film first starts to fall apart. The real story of Johnny Blaze's life and how he becomes Ghost Rider is slightly different. Crash is not Johnny's actual father as we are led to believe. (That's why I put quotations around father in the above description.) His wife Mona isn't even in the film and Mephisto is never driven away by Roxanne's purity either here. These among other things are some of the ways Mark Steven Johnson's take on 'Ghost Rider' isn't true to the comic. I myself aren't a Ghost Rider fanatic or anything close, but I'm sure those that are will find these alterations unnecessary and questionable. For the rest of the public that are unaware though, they'll just take it as is as they're force fed Johnson's $120 million adaptation.Oh, but that's not all that's bad folks. Acting skill was apparently not a priority. If it were, I believe someone else would have been cast in the role of Roxanne, played by Eva Mendes. I'm. Not. Going. Anywhere. Digging deep, that's how Mendes' lines come out. It. Was. Almost. Robotic. The. Way. She. Spoke. Bently is not very good either. He's just doesn't come off villainous enough. He's got the look I guess, but that's about it. It's not entirely the actor's fault's though. The combined effort of Johnson, Shane Salerno, David S. Goyer, & Jonathan Hensleigh that's called a screenplay is far from good writing. A couple weeks back and again this week I was warned that the comics weren't written too well either. Let me just say to that person now, Nick, if they're anything like the dialogue in the film, you were dead on. Too much comedy was added in as well. Continuously jokes are spread throughout, which takes away from the sense of seriousness and drama that I believe was crucial for everything to work.The visuals are what in the end strive to be the focal point of the film. The fire doesn't always appear to be real, but everything is just plain cool looking. The most memorable moment for me was when the water element member of the Nemphilim's eye drips down his face and he wipes it off while instantaneously another eye appears. That was pretty awesome. I can't forget about the bike though, it's beautiful. As a whole though, the pricey CGI isn't enough to compensate for all the mistakes. 'Ghost Rider' makes it clear that Johnson should leave comic characters alone. He obviously can't do it right, so why even attempt?",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Take a ride,"Very unaware of why this marvel film has such a low rating, maybe it's because it requires a bit of patience and concentration rather than recent CGI slugfest current marvel mash heads are used to, with style but no substance. This however does have somewhat of a story with heartfelt empathy combined with character development. The love interest in Roxanne played by (Eva Mendas) gives (Cage) as Johnny Blaze something more to work with. Although Nicolas Cage is one of the stand out performers he has plenty of support, the entire cast are on top form in this. I have often thought in this type of genre it is essential to have a strong villain, for me some of the best cinematic films of this type are enhanced by having that antagonist present. (Wes Bentley) as Blackheart fills the shoes pretty well in my book, he has memorable moments claiming to be alpha whilst telling his father it's time to step aside. Lacking his fathers approval it appears he takes matters into his own hands. Another stand out character for me was the caretaker of the church/graveyard (Sam Elliott) who inadvertently seems to step in as the new fatherly figure of Johnny Blaze. The love story between Blaze and Roxanne gives both hope of what could be alongside all the chaos of Johnny being the devils servant. Cage and Mendas share a nice chemistry, they are likeable, which in turn makes me invested to root for them. The special effect are fantastic however they aren't overused, they freshly blend in with some great camera angles, shots and sets. What's interesting is how Johnny Blaze has very little control as well as awareness as to what is happening to him. Even though he made the deal with the devil we can see he never really expects anything to come of this. The transformation of Cage into ghost rider isn't just great special effects it's a testament to Cages acting, along with his disbelief we experience his challenges of honing the curse as a new skill.

my notes,"This is a joke of a movie. decent hilariocity. i couldn't think of one redeeming quality. the villains are jokes, the story is a joke, the acting is a joke, the cgi is a joke, it's just a bunch of madness. it's also really boring and doesn't have a spec of good action. possibly the worst marvel movie of all time, probably worse the the fantastic fours.

"I knew I would love this before I watched it, and I was right.","About 5 minutes in, I turned to my husband and asked incredulously, 'why does everyone hate this so much??'
The opening was great, the character was great, the story was great, the cinematography was great, and Nicolas Cage was brilliant, as usual.Honestly I thought this was so much fun, and the only problems I had at all were the villains, because they did feel a little bit lame and underpowered, and sometimes an awesome Cage scene was interrupted to show a scene with the villains instead, which was mildly disappointing, but not too big of a deal.Also, as a side note, it was really cool to see a character eating and doing odd things just as a normal part of their life, instead of just being 100% normal and 'relatable'.As someone who eats ice cream in the shower, seeing Johnny Blaze eat jelly beans from a wine glass while watching Ape programmes on the TV was much more relatable than 99% of cool movie characters.Bring back weird character habits!Overall, I'd give this an 8/10, but as this is my first viewing I expect it will probably grow on me next time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst movie experience I have had in a long time.,"There are reviews that say, ""The plot wasn't gripping and the characters didn't bring a tear to my eye"", and there are those that say, ""If that is what you are after in this kind of film, you are missing the point.""To me, the point of a movie is to be entertained. To hear a story, if not a good one--at least one well told. To have fun.There are films that are bad, but still a good time because of the feeling you have when you leave the theater. Then there are bad films which are so incompetent that they make you more cautious about how you really want to spend your time.This film was bad in every way that matters, unless special effects are your reason for living.The dialog is so jarringly terrible, a viewer almost expects every line to end with a smile--to be part of some joke before they get on with their real lines. The actors seem bored and uninspired in their roles, and Nicholas Cage seems wooden even for... Well, even for Nicholas Cage.If it weren't for movies like National Treasure, I would have sworn to never see another Cage film again. I do not know how any actor's agent let them have a part in this movie without a letter of resignation, but this happens sometimes. Look up ""Gigli"" and ""88 Minutes"" for other examples.Please do not pay money for this movie. Viewing it is like pushing rusty carpenter nails into your abdomen. It is so bad that it is a running joke among everyone I know. When a bad movie is released, we say, ""Well, it isn't Ghost rider, but it was still crap."" Avoid this movie. For the children.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stop it, Mark. Stay off any more comic book characters !","Dude, I want this to be as personal as movies come to me really personal.

Critics hated it; I LOVED it!,"As strange as it may be, 'Ghost Rider' is one of my favorite Nicolas Cage movies. I just think Cage's unique appearance is perfect for the Rider (and that's a compliment, Mr Cage!). He does the character justice.There's been Riders before. Riders who ride for the Devil, collecting souls and contracts. However, one Rider went against the Devil many years ago, and now another one is about to do the same. His name is Johnny Blaze, a daredevil motorcyclist who was tricked by the Devil into becoming a Rider. Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, and he does a mighty fine job, me thinks!Eva Mendes stars as his love interest, Roxanne. She allows for most of the humor elements and I just love her in the movie. Ah, and then there's the legend: Sam Elliott. That voice! That moustache! Elliott stars as a character simply referred to as Caretaker - a somewhat mysterious man whose identity is revealed as a twist, so keep an eye on this character! Although the Devil - or Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appear to be the villain, the main antagonist is his son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) - a ruthless and determined 'angel'.I enjoyed the many different elements of the movie. There's drama, humor, horror, action, adventure, and in the midst of everything it is also a sweet love story - and a classic good versus evil story, as well. All these genres blend perfectly to bring us an action-packed, visual spectacle superhero movie. The action sequences are fast paced and the stunts truly amazing. Love it, love it, love it!'Ghost Rider' was followed by a sequel 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance' but rather give that a skip, as it was really awful!Would I watch it again? Yes.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only effect that was special was the special effects,"Serviceable comic book translation gets by on unique, well implemented computer animation, but cannot rise above it's underwhelming plot line, mechanical pacing, and wooden performances despite a reasonable enough attempt to make this superhero action film more fun and accessible then most of it's ilk. The Marvel-based, skull-burning character finds his script adaptation feeling methodically predictable even to non-fans, despite the special Gothic and Texan flavor that tries, unsuccessfully, to pull the movie further away from it's generic trappings.Playing out a little too unintentionally comical at times, Ghost Rider's action sequences nonetheless provide the only distraction from the not-so-great acting, of course fronted by Nicolas Cage's overdone, ego-driven theatrics. While a few of these blazingly violent and vibrant physical scenes seemingly indulge the opposite in essence of our freakishly looking, damned soul of an antihero to a silly degree, on the whole this movie is saved from an irredeemable pit of tedium by the always reliable and ever increasing detailed effects design, which stands out from many standard comic book approaches, often implemented with thoughtful, sharp focus.The visceral heart of these effect sequences may not be enough to justify a viewing from anyone who is not already a fan of this stuff, but it will be enough to pump up a general audience with it's hell-on-wheels aesthetics. Ignore the climax's dull relaying of a theme and enjoy this for what it is, a mildly fun little airheaded motorcycle ride through the desert with some inventive eye candy.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was decent,"When the motorcyclist Johnny Blaze finds that his father Barton Blaze has terminal cancer, he accepts a pact with Mephistopheles, giving his soul for the health of his beloved father. But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends, and his girlfriend Roxanne. Many years later, Johnny Blaze becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne again, now a television reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the ""Ghost Rider"" and defeat his evil son Blackheart, who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on Earth.I thought the story and plot was decently done. The music was excellent. Though when it comes to Nicolas Cage as Ghost Rider I thought he was okay but not exactly my first choice.However Blackheart was a very weak villain.Still a decent film and far better than what came next.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worse Than Batman and Robin...,"I saw this movie (as with ""The Benchwarmers"") at the behest of my best friend who usually has pretty good cinematic tastes. These tastes have gone downhill in recent years and this concerns me. We may have to have a movie intervention for him, but that's another story.I suppose if you're into movies where the dialog consists of ""I'm gonna kick your butt"" / ""I don't think so"" for about two hours, you won't be disappointed in ""Ghost Rider."" The script, which sounds like a fanfic written by a seventh grader, is simplistic enough to hold the attentions of even the most ADD-riddled viewer. So much so, that it seems implausible that Cage's Johnny Blaze (a well thought out name if ever there was one) would have the knowledge necessary to understand the theology books that are central to the plot. Maybe he just saw the bitchin' pictures and pieced it together in his head.While the script is the movie's biggest problem, there are several others that make a bad situation even worse. Such as the terribly long pacing, the XBox-worthy CGI effects and the wooden performances of all actors involved. Particularly those of the comely love interest Roxanne Simpson, a roving reporter who seemingly got through Journalism School by her cleavage alone. Sam Elliot makes a cameo in an attempt to bring a bit of dignity to the film, but all he does is spout some faux-religious bunk about the Ghost Rider being the Devil's gofer. You'd think by now, somebody would have just challenged him to a fiddle contest by now. It would have been more interesting to watch.Also of note is the movie's anti-smoking message, which is more heavy-handed than anything truth.com could have come up with. Young Johnny's father smokes Marlboros and is dead five minutes later. However, in a later scene, many of Blaze's friends are seen playing poker and smoking Lucky Strikes. The moral of the story: smoking Marlboros will kill you. So will this movie. Especially if you payed to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and play ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Home Game"" with it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie sucked,"I have been waiting for this adaption for years. Who picked Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendez for the leads needs to have their heads checked.

Marvel movies are either a hit or miss and this totally missed. Sigh, maybe the next marvel movie will be a hit.

A good popcorn flick with a healthy dollop of cheese......,"I agree 100% with w00f's previous comments - not Oscar material by any stretch but check your brain at the lobby and go along for the ride.The bad acting that, it has to be said, is prevalent throughout the movie (especially by Wes Bentley, I feel) can be forgiven if it is taken in the context in which it is intended, i.e a comic book strip. It plays out exactly like a comic book of old with menacing close-ups of the villains eyes and over-exerted facial expressions and cheesy dialogue abounding. Whether this can translate effectively into a movie is still open to debate but for my part, I reckon that the cast and crew have made a fine attempt at carrying it off.It's a bit slow to start, can be irritating if taken too seriously but is ultimately, viewed with the right attitude, a good fun action movie with some nice effects.Oh, and did I mention that Eva Mendes is BEYOND fine in this movie...? Never really been a fan before but HOT DAMN!!If for nothing else, it's worth a look just for her......",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fun Ride...but in need of some tweaking,"Ghost Rider was a pretty good popcorn movie.Overall, I had no problems with it. The issue for me was the acting of the main characters. It seems like the writer and director had someone else in mind. Someone who is revered for his physical and over-the-top acting. A particular B- movie icon that can be convincing as a hapless-schmuck-turned-hero.Simply put, Nick Cage could have been yanked out of the picture and Bruce ""The Chin"" Campbell easily (and more convincingly) could've been inserted.Cage is an Oscar-worthy actor. You don't need a ""Leaving Las Vegas"" caliber lead playing a guy who becomes a walking inferno on a chopper from hell. You need Bruce. Hell, Bruce is to me what Affleck is to Kevin Smith. He can play anything, yes even the shark in Jaws.Ghost Rider was a fun ride, but when you see it, imagine the guy from EVIL DEAD as Johnny Blaze. You'll see it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a good action flick,"Yea, I know this movie isn't exactly 'plot heavy' and yea, N. Cage doesn't really seem like the ghost rider type. But he doesn't say much of ANYThinG and when he does its kinda a joke... yea a real joke, not like a super funny one, but more like hah..ha, that was kinda amusing amongst the linear predictable plot line. And I mean LINEAR, have anyone of u guys played a 2 dimensional video game... yea the plots like that (a series of lesser bosses that must be dispensed with before the main boss...).AND these lesser-boss battles with the devil's son's minions are VERy Disappointing, because approximately 4 fights have to be crammed in they all last like 2 seconds. Mainly he fights like terminator, but worse, he is super slow/strong and just hits things and thats it without even a resounding impact...

A really poor effort,"Let's get it out of the way upfront, I am a huge fan of the Ghost Rider comics but I still found this movie to be very, very average.The first 5 minutes were bad, then after Johnny sold his soul to save Barton Blaze (whoops! what happened to Crash Simpson?) who died in one of the lamest crashes ever caught on film I knew I was in for some serious suckage.What do film studios seem to consistently think that they can take a proved hit comic book script and throw it all out the window and totally rewrite the script to make a 'better' movie? The Ghost Rider effects were cool, the fights totally lame, the story was also lame while at the same time being inconsistent with the comics and the dialogue was generally dreadful. On the plus side, Eva Mendes must have the most gorgeous rack in modern cinema, this alone should keep the young male fans entertained.Where was the love story? Where was the witty, cowboyesque banter? Where was the Blaze/GR duality? The struggle between GR and Satan for his soul? Sorry all cut to make the story 'better' *cough* *cough* *hurl* In the end I give this movie 5 stars, 4 stars for finally seeing GR on the big screen, 3 stars for Eva Mendes' boobies and -2 stars for choosing Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghostrider.

Makes for a fun ride even if it's not as ablaze as it could've been,"The string of superhero movies goes on and this time, it's Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider's turn to heat up the big screen.During the day, he's Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) - a stunt motorcyclist who once sold his soul to Mephisto (Peter Fonda) in exchange for a cure to his father's cancer. However, the contract involves Johnny transforming to a blazing skeleton by night in the presence of evil, bound to work for Mephisto in defeating Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the ambitious son of Mephisto who wants to make a hell out of the world - literally.Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the film has an introductory note for Johnny Blaze which clearly feels a lot like the filmmaker's previous Marvel project ""Daredevil."" The way it's presented does seem formulaic but it manages to decently portray the main character to the viewer. Cage also doesn't seem to be a good idea to play the role but as the film progressed, the more he managed to prove me wrong by doing a good job of combining a sense of grit and humor for his character.The characterizations of the supporting characters, however, were rather insipid. Eva Mendes as Roxie Simpson, Johnny's love interest, serves more like a perfunctory female touch to the film as her character has been devoted with so little concern. I'm tempted to say that the villains are too one-dimensional but they're demons, which may be the point.The movie overall is a decent way to spend a Valentine evening, although at times, the plot becomes a little confused. The fight scenes lack a sense of urgency, and the love angle feels too casual. But Cage gives a good performance and there are enough humorous moments to make for a somewhat fun if bumpy ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ghost Rider is not to shabby,"The film is actually good. The storyline is creative and it kinda catches your attention. Both Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes give great performances. Nicholas Cage, I feel, pulled off the Johnny Blaze character and made it work. Ghost Rider looks visually stunning, and the special effects are impressive. It felt like the film moved pretty fast, but it didn't lose it's direction. This film isn't a 'knock you out of your shoes' blockbuster, but it can stand on it's own. Compared to other comic movies, I would have to say this one stands a little higher than the Punisher film starring Thomas Jane. Ghost Rider leaves you wanting a little more.

I think he was channeling Elvis. I just feel bad for Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda... even those two great actors couldn't save this horrid script.

Roundly mediocre film that never really engaged me,"As a teenager , Johnny Blaze naively makes a deal with the devil in order to cure his father's cancer. When his father is cured but dies in a motorcycle stunt, Johnny lashes out at the Devil but ultimately accepts his fate. As an adult he has forged a great career for himself as a motorcycle stuntman thanks to his strange inability to be killed in any of his outrageous stunts. However when the Devil's son Blackheart comes to conquer the world, the Devil chooses his moment to summon Blaze as his ""Ghost Rider""  his demonic messenger  to stop him.At no point did I really expect this film to be any good but I did hope that at least it would be quite entertaining and thus I hired it on DVD. I wasn't prepared for quite how mediocre it would be though and I found myself losing interest more and more as it went on. The plot is the source of the problem as it does seem to plod along without any real sense of event or spectacle. At times it has its moments which are quite impressive (and were used heavily for promo and trailers) but it is the rest of the film that doesn't offer a great deal. The story doesn't grip or engage and it is quite dull at times; it doesn't help that there are no characters (good or evil) to really care about or root for and what I found myself left with was just a lot of special effects that play like cut scenes from a video game.The effects are technically impressive but they do lack heart and I felt almost no ""wow"" factor on any level. At first it seemed cool but it got old quickly. It night have avoided this by making Blaze more of a person before he became an effect, but this doesn't happen. This leaves all the action quite cold in the delivery and I wasn't actually that bothered by it since I had never been bought into the story. Cage isn't able to find a character and just ends up delivery a rather obvious performance. He also fails to make his Rider have much in the way of character  it was never going to be easy but it didn't help to be stiff and unconvincing even before your head turns into an effect. Fonda is a reasonably nice bit of casting but has limited impact. Bentley lacks presence and threat as the Devil's son, which again undermines the action and story. Mendes suffers from a lack of material and we learnt here that she can only get so far with her playful brand of sexiness; true she is the most fun part of the film and she is a great presence but she has little to do and no real character to speak of.Overall then, a pretty mediocre and lacklustre film. It does the basics and has solid effects but where is the heart? Where are the characters or indeed any strong emotion of any sort whether it be love, hate, desire, vengeance or anything? Without any of these I'm afraid that the film pretty much fails to spark at any point.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poop Rider,"This is a terrible movie that I was lucky enough to avoid in the cinema, and boy am I glad I did. With the spate of recent good comic book movies this is just awful. It starts with a terrible script and waste the basic premise of Ghost Rider. The direction here is shabby and about the only good thing is some of the special effects are descent especially the more than okay first Ghost Rider transformation and some of the bike scenes. The script is bad an the acting is just as wooden. Nic Cage is rotten and I am beginning to think there is no hope left for him as an actor . The bad guys are nothing to write home about and Peter Fonda is completely wasted as Satan. This should have been the beginning of a great franchise where Johnny Blaze seeks and finally gains some sort of redemption. Instead it was about me holding me head in hands and cringing.

Better than it looks ...,"Although I can't really recommend watching this movie, it was a lot better than I thought. I generally like sci-fi/fantasy/monster movies, but this looked ridiculous.

When he learns he got a bad deal, it's too late ... but he is then given a mission which could free him.The movie was much better than it looked in the trailers. However, the result was still not that great. Part of it may be that the idea of a supernatural motorcycle superhero may have been appealing in the 70s, but it doesn't seem very potent today.

Also, the use of a famous actor makes the a$$hole director to use him as much as possible. Therefore, throughout the movie, you will see Cage ride his fairy bike in situations obviously more suited for his fiery alter-ego.The film just stinks folks, and the best thing about it is Eva Mendes, just because she's beautiful.

"Ghost Rider rides the highway to hell, leading to a lifeless dead end of hopeless talent.","I should've known. No, really. I should've. The same director who helmed that super successful superhero masterpiece known as ""Blind Battfleck"", I mean, 'Daredevil'. Perhaps Johnson learnt from his past mistakes when it comes to dealing with superheroes that mass audiences aren't entirely familiar with. Maybe, just maybe, the irreverent use of the ""Cage Rage"" could spontaneously combust this adaptation into a ghoulish inferno of apocalyptic excellence. Or, just to restore some remnants of faith, produce a film that is mediocre. Alas, not the case.Ghost Rider is terrible. Woeful. Dreadful. Fully exorcising the ineptitude of amateur comic book adaptations that preceded this monstrosity and somehow tainting them even further, granting this hellish anti-hero no chance of retrieving his soul back. Johnny Blaze, the ""Human Torch"" who ""flames on"" whenever he needs to, sells his soul to the devil in order to spare his father's life. A supposed antagonistic demon makes his debut and thus Blaze must become a Ghost Rider in order to stop him from acquiring the contract of ""I-Don't-Give-A-Toss"".If there was any ounce of literary creativity within this screenplay, or any other element of the film, I may have paid more attention whilst being perched on the edge of my seat from the sheer velocity that Ghost Rider rides his skeletal metallic motorcycle. Flames etched onto the road. Demonic dubbing that echoed the streets of wherever the heck this film was set. Cage screaming his lungs out as his face melts from the inside. It's fundamentally incoherent. No matter how much lunacy Cage injected into his vicious pointing or how minuscule Mendes' acting capacity may be, if the storytelling is executed with no common sense whatsoever, there's no point. None. And it's abundantly clear in Ghost Rider.It starts off with an emotional acceleration, between Blaze and his father, which in turn produces some required apathy. After those introductory moments of tenderness were over, tackling an uninspired origin story, Blaze propels himself off a ramp and never lands. Look, he's still gliding over those CGI helicopters now! There were approximately seven minutes of action. Four antagonists, each harnessing a differing elemental power, are defeated in seconds. Don't ask me their names, I haven't got a clue and the film doesn't deserve to be researched prior to this decimation. No build up. Just a vacant stare and we're moving on. The absence of threat was abundantly clear, and as soon as Mr. Monotonous (that's the villain's name now...) reads a piece of paper and obtains glowing red eyes, the film was over.So with no action or real substance, what the heck was happening for two hours you might ask? Just a road trip back and forth between a romantic sub-plot and Sam ""Exposition"" Elliott, spelling out a plot that had more lore than a frickin' 'Lord of the Rings' compendium. I just...don't care. If Cage didn't care, Mendes didn't care and Ghost Rider himself didn't care, why should I? I had to sit through two hours of complacent visual effects, for nothing to actually happen. The cheesy tone that Johnson outlined didn't suit the darker apocalyptic world that Ghost Rider resided in within the comics. I don't want to hear another ""skull"" pun. I don't!And if there's only one thing I'm going to take away from this endurance test, it's consuming jelly beans in a martini glass. However that minor positive, which may or may not change my life forever, did not substantiate me sitting through the entirety of this boring adaptation. Quite simply one of the worst Marvel films in their canon, and I've still got the sequel to watch...",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not as bad as I expected,"I remember when I first saw the trailer last year for Ghost Rider, I just kept thinking ""Oh, no, what is Nicolas Cage doing to his career?"". But I had a free rental and I have no idea why, I just decided to go ahead and see what I expected to be one of the worst movies of all time, I watched Ghost Rider this morning and really, I'm not that upset with this movie. Granted, it has the ultimate cheesy dialog that I've heard, but it is based off a comic, so I actually let that go. Nicolas Cage, while I still question the casting of him as Ghost Rider, don't get me wrong, he does look good, but he's a little old for the action hero gig, but he does make the film work pretty well. I understand a lot of people not liking this movie, besides the dialog, the effects are a bit much, but I feel like this was an honest comic book film and had all the action and excitement it should have.Johnny Blaze made a very bad deal, a deal with the devil when he learns about his father having cancer, the devil will cure Johnny's dad, if Johnny agrees to be his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider. Johnny's soul is now in the hands of the devil, meaning that nothing can come between them: family, friends, or love. But when Johnny's old love returns to his life, he takes this as a sign, and wants to tell her about his curse. But the devil's son, Blackheart, who wants to bring Hell on Earth, must be stopped and Ghost Rider is on the mission.Ghost Rider really, honestly is not that bad of a movie. I would say that it is average, but it delivered what it promised. I do hate CGI effects, especially the cheesy ones, but the effects were pretty cool in Ghost Rider. I thought the effect of Ghost Rider riding up the side of the sky scraper was so cool to look at. Ghost Rider is definite eye candy, it has good actors, and a cool story; I'm not going to lie, it's flawed, but I feel like people were a little too harsh and just didn't want to give the film a fair chance.

Not Bad but could have been better,"I am not a comic book junkie but I do like watching the Marvel titles. Ghost Rider was one I was really looking forward to. The special effects are very good and the story line is enjoyable. Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda play very good roles. I understand that Nicolas Cage is a big Ghost Rider fan but I have always thought his acting is too limited to be able to grasp particular characters well and unfortunately this is one of those times. I think with a stronger actor this could have been one of the best marvel movies. Also if you want an actress who can act forget about Eva Mendes (only good in Once upon a time in Mexico) but if you want some eye candy then by all means cast her.

Average Comic Book Adaptation,"Fantastic Four. X-Men. Spider-Man. Superman. Daredevil. Batman. Hellboy. The Hulk.The past few years Hollywood has dipped their money grabbing hands into the comic book hero cookie jar and have pulled out pure chocolate chip glory. From the more popular and well known characters such as Spider-Man to the obscure independent titles like Constantine and Spawn, it seems like every month a new title is being released to the masses. And due to the built-in audience these characters bring with them like traveling luggage, it almost guarantees the studio a strong opening week-end no matter how good or inferior the product.This month's release is Marvel Comic's Ghost Rider which stars Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze by day  Ghost Rider by night crime fighter.Ghost Rider might be a little more obscure for the casual comic book character fan so let me get you caught up to speed on the skeletal hot-head.Johnny Blaze was a young hot shot motorcycle stunt man with his father when he makes a deal to sell his soul to the devil, Mephistopheles (played in the film by Peter Fonda) in an effort to save his fathers life. Johnny later finds that the deal has more side effects than prescription medicine for hair loss. For ""in the darkness, in the presence of evil, the Rider takes over"", transforming Blaze into a skeletal beast with bones and skull afire that rides a hell bent pimped out motorcycle that would give the guys on American Chopper an erection.The evil villain in the film is none other than Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of Mephistopheles, who looks to overpower his father and turn our world into a hell on earth. Think of it as if someone from Hell was a designer on Trading Spaces.In an effort to bring his bleak and death sucking vision to us unassuming humans, Blackheart solicits the aide of three interesting but otherwise useless supernatural beings representing the elements of earth, wind and fire (Great! Now I can't get Let's Groove outta me head!).Of course, complicating matters is Blaze's old flame Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). Simpson is now a local reporter and she and her cleavage (which I might add should have their own listing in the credits as they transfixed my eyes more than any of the characters that graced the films running time) just happen to be executing a bit on Johnny Blaze when things start to go the way of Hades. As this is a comic book movie, there is no doubt that Roxanne will be used against our flaming skull hero in some manner before the story comes to a close and director Mark Steven Johnson who went from Simon Birch to Daredevil and now Ghost Rider, does nothing to deviate from this formulaic plan.When the sum of all its parts are calculated and reviewed, Ghost Rider barely gets by with a recommendation. Maybe if the film was pre-Spider-man and X-Men, the film might have been more interesting and inventive, but with such a paved path already laid, Ghost Rider feels like you are walking barefoot on cobblestone.One of the main successes of any superhero fantasy comes in the form of the villains and it is with these characters that Ghost Rider falls short. Don't get me wrong, the villains are all fascinating and some might even argue terrifying, but they are beat so easily by the Ghost Rider that you don't get a chance to even recognize their powers before they are sent back to wherever it is these beings go after being defeated. I don't think they collectively had a page of lined script before each one is individually eliminated.That leaves the Blackheart character that is the least interesting and terrifying of the bunch. Wes Bentely looked more like some kind of character from a Dawn of the Dead Saturday Night Live sketch than he did a menacing Lord of the Underworld.Ghost Rider did have its good points though. Some of the special effects were well done (I do mean 'some' as others seemed too cheesy to be enjoyed) and the camp is played out like Snakes on a Plane from last year where the dialogue and situations are so-bad-its-good.Nicolas Cage  who was such a huge fan of the comic that he got a Ghost Rider tattoo years before even being considered for the role  looks as if he is having as much fun as a root canal recipient in the lead role. Maybe he should have taken a lesson from Halle Berry who is another Oscar winning actor that looked embarrassed when donning the leather tights for the Superhero film Catwoman.This leaves Ghost Rider in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall product from a comic book character film production. It is certainly higher than The Punisher and Elektra, but a far cry from the superior X-Men and Spider-Man franchises.www.robertsreviews.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comicbook Actioneer is an Easy Ride,"The problem with comicbook films is that once the filmmakers decide to distance themselves from the source material, a necessary step that all films face upon adaptation, the core audience immediately goes on the defense. Pleasing said fans is always a difficult task. GHOST RIDER, then, succeeds on the level that it is a fun, comicbook adapted film. However, placed against some its more successful contemporaries, the campy nature of GHOST RIDER is its chief detractor.The Marvel Comics anti-hero Ghost Rider got his start in Marvel Spotlight #5 in 1972 and the film's origin resembles the comicbook tale close enough: motorcyclist Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil transforming him, at times, to be an fiery instrument of vengeance. Marvel then revamped and updated the character in 1990 completing the skull-like visage with a flaming chain and spikes. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson takes elements from the classic story and incorporates it with the stylizations of the more modern version in an attempt to please both worlds.Opening with an origin that unfortunately lasts the entire first  and lengthy  act, the film finally roars into action as the damned Blaze (Nic Cage) fights against the devil's son, Blackheart (AMERICAN BEAUTY's Wes Bentley) and his demonic horde. Bentley pulls off the rogue with a smile but at times he and his cronies' post-MATRIX get-up have all the posturing of an upstart emo band. Even Cage and Sam Elliott, playing his mentor, camp it up at times playing mere parodies of themselves. Topping off the cast is the ultimate Easy Rider, Peter Fonda, playing a laughably-scary devil with a grin-and-a-wink that seems to channel Jack Nicholson.Once the action begins, the film pits the flaming Ghost Rider up against elemental demons and, predictably, the police. And like all cliché Westerns or their rock-n-roll, comicbook counterparts, there seems to be nothing his American Chopper-possessed bike cannot do, which even comes to his side when whistled like a loyal steed.What the film desperately lacks is any sense of a real and natural environment. Story aside, what made the SPIDER-MAN and X-MEN films successful is the fact that these unreal events were happening the world right outside the window. Here, the humor  both intended and ridiculous  prevents that barrier from ever entirely withdrawing. Another impediment is the film's rating. Taking a similar path to the BLADE films and first CROW, Marvel should have pushed for a R rating to truly give the devil his due. More dark horror and less toothy one-liners would have made an electrifying film, something that video game-looking ghosts and goblins cannot properly achieve.At best, Ghost Rider is a b-grade superhero; his film falls into the same classification. But true fans should already be aware of this. After all, boyhood fantasies of a flaming skull warrior on a tricked out bike can only go so far. This film meets you half the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disgrace to what could've been great,"This movie had one serious problem and thats Mark Steven Johnson. I mean Daredevil was a B- movie at best but this movie is a complete failure on all levels. The script was one of the worst scripts i have ever heard. If there were more anymore cheesy lines, then this movie didn't deserve to hit theaters. Very poor writing and shocks you on how a studio could pass the script and not have rewrites on it.Nick Cage is a talented guy but not in this movie. He was not right for the character and played it as a boring, depressed guy on drugs.Eva Mendes was pleasant on the eyes but thats about it. She didn't play a good love attraction and you don't feel the connection between the two actors.The villains were weak and both poorly cast. Peter Fonda is not scary and doesn't come off as evil. His son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has the looks of a devils son but not the talent. Weak actor for the role. Blackheart is a very dark character that could have been truly scary and villainous with the right actor in the part.Besides some visual effect highlights, not mentioning the final battle between Ghost Rider and Blackheart which was a visual effects disaster, this movie is a failure on all levels. From the direction to the screenplay to the cast, Ghost Rider is one of the biggest comic book adaptation failures ever.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disappointing Ghost Rider movie,"This movie is way below average comic book movie that has almost no appeal going for it. The movie starts out alright but as it progresses it gets worse and worse. The plot is horribly written to the point it has too much plot holes and while your watching you will be constantly asking the question ""why?"". The characters makes no sense what so ever and even the villains are not developed and some are just pointless to the plot while not bringing any cool in the action department either. The dialogue is just laughable and not in a good way either and comes of very corny, even the direction is corny. Which is a negative for a Ghost Rider movie. I like Nicholas Cage as and actor and he is basically the only thing that makes this movie semi-watchable. The back and forth plot in this is just irritating to watch and makes you not care for the characters even more. For a movie that had a budget of over 100 million this movie just didn't seem like it and just looked cheap and lazy. Mark Steven Johnson should stop making comic book movies.4.6/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
entertaining action,"I have to admit, I thought a fiery skeleton on a blazing motorcycle was a pretty good idea. I liked the whole Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider character. I thought the special effects for the Ghost Rider and his motorcycle were well done. I did think Nick Cage looked weird with that dark hair piece he was wearing. He felt sort of miscast in the role.And for some reason they had Eva Mendez wearing shirts that were too small and only buttoned half way up. I mean, it looked like she was fixing to explode out of her shirts. But, I guess that was to appeal to the teenage boy audience.I liked Sam Elliots's role too. His deep voice just sounds so perfect for the movies.Blackheart looked like a wimpy goth. And the bad guys are defeated very easily by the Ghost Rider. But the Ghost Rider's pentance stare was awesome.One glaring plot hole: How did the police connect a bunch of frozen bodies to a motorcycle stunt driver and arrest him for their murders?FINAL VERDICT: Much better than expected. I thought visually, the movie was great. The script could have been better, but it was interesting enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good movie as all with Nicholas Cage,"Only today i've seen this great movie in first place because is with Nicholas Cage and of course Eva Mendez ! I think is a great movie and i've watched him with great great interest till the end. I think the special effects was extraordinary, the subject and the role played by Nicholas Cage the same. . . In my opinion the best movies were made in year 2006 and 2007. I'm a big fan of Nicholas Cage and i think this is the type the role that fits to him very good. All the actors in the movie played very well. It is a film that i rate it with 8*. I recommend you watch this movie if you haven't done till now . .. . . Enjoy it !",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It Captures your attention,","I've seen it twice now, and with the videos that I have screened and thought about, comic book wise, Ghost Rider has make it to the top of the list. Not only were the CG's amazingly accurate and well spotted throughout the film, but it also had a strong-held storyline that wanted the watcher to see more. Viewers all around the theater were leaning forward on most scenes, if not grabbing their drinks or popcorn, or settling down after and exciting part!The film literally captures the audiences attention to leave you with more. The comic books were well followed, unlike some movie-series, and that alone made it good to watch!

A Solid Movie,"As I realize Ghost Rider is based on comic books and I have no detailed familiarity with the comic book I cannot judge the movie according to the comic book details. I can tell you this movie meets the expectations of the Marvel comics and provides entertainment under those aspects. While it may not have been the blockbuster we saw with Spiderman, that may only lie in the fact that Spiderman was more well known. The special effects are very good.Realize you are being introduced to a character with this movie. It is not like seeing the first Batman where most people were very familiar with the expected storyline. Ghost Rider starts from the beginning giving the character purpose. You will not need a future movie to build the character's beginnings. Even if the numbers do not exceed expectations I fully expect a sequel from this feature.Some people may have expected more dramatization or more side stories. I think you will see that in future sequels. Sony and Marvel have installed a foundation and now we see if they build on it.The movie is fairly decent for all ages except the extremely young who may have a slight problem reconciling some of the ghostly images. It does touch to the edge of fright without delving into a straight out horror flick, which is not its goal.Go see it. It is worth the initial viewing and fans will probably buy the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"On the level of ""Daredevil""","I watched it tonight since I am in Taiwan and it showed couple days earlier than the states. I must say I am a bit disappointed as it reminded me of the movie ""Daredevil"" few years ago and upon some research, surprise, it's from the same director. For people who watched Daredevil, than you know what I am talking about, famous casts, good CGs, but a very average plot and directing. The fights with the villains are lackluster especially with the minor villains. The acting from Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Eva Mendes all seemed very routine. All Eva Mendes does in the movie is consistently showing off her cleavage, while it's great to look at, the chemistry between her and Nicolas Cage seemed non-existence. Give this movie the same expectation as ""Daredevil"" as they are very the same product, different package.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

good film,"ran good film, excellent speruma feelings contrary to what was said by roberranti and tizianoarianti, a name, a guarantee. In the film, I noticed many terrible elements including the terrifying dictatorship of the Taliban and the fear of the inhabitants of Kabul, the film makes good idea of what he meant to live under the Taliban. The problem is that when you are not directors, is behind a monitor, you can write what you want, reaching even to write untruths. On the Internet everything happens often, most of the films are rejected, not because the films are produced evil but because there are few characters particularly receptive. It must be very insensitive and apathetic to define this film minimalist and reductive, if you do not like the film then you become directors as there attenete word by word to the book.

Amazing Blaze,"Once, twice or maximum three times per year there comes a movie of which you beforehand know that it won't change your life with its progressive ideas or mesmerize your mind with its poetic dialogs, but nevertheless you simply have to watch it on the big screen, otherwise you risk missing out on something extraordinary cool! ""Ghost Rider"" is such a movie, based on dark comic book characters and featuring a whole lot of spectacular action-stunts. It's definitely not a masterpiece or even very memorable, but thrills and entertainment are guaranteed throughout the entire playtime. It's a rather gruesome comic book adaptation, dealing with contracts with the devil and doomed souls, but the execution is light-headed and enthusiast. In order to save his father from slowly and painfully dying of cancer, young stunt rider Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to the devilish Mephistopheles. Several years later, Johnny Blaze is a successful daredevil stunt-rider who seemingly can't get injured, yet Mephistopheles approaches him to live up to his part of the contract. He'll become Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter assigned to prevent Blackheart  a fallen angel - from unleashing a new hell on earth. There are a whole lot of sub plots, for example Johnny's reunion with his former girlfriend and the mysterious cemetery caretaker who suspiciously knows a lot about Johnny's dreadful situation, but the main focus here is Nicolas Cage's flamboyant outfits and fiery skull as he transforms into the Ghost Rider overnight. The battles between him and Blackheart's associates (representing the primary elements) are pretty exciting and the visual effects are competently presented. The action sequences result in a lot of damage and mayhem, which is always entertaining to behold from a comfortable seat in the theater. Cage is a terrific actor, clever enough to not take his role overly serious and therefore adds quite a lot of comical elements to his character, like dry one-liners and eccentric tics. It was particularly pleasant to see Peter Fonda star again in a big-budgeted production, especially considering the role he plays! Just a couple of days ago, I watched the movie ""Race With The Devil"" in which a much younger Fonda desperately attempts to flee from a bunch of pursuing devil-worshipers, yet in this comic book vehicle, he plays the Devil himself and clearly enjoys it. The filming locations and the majority of set-pieces look effectively sinister, Eva Mendes is hot as ever, skull dude's motorcycle and armory is awesome and there even is a modern update of Johnny Cash' great song ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" on the soundtrack! I can't possibly talk too negative about a film like this. It's great, mindless entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ghost Rider does have a life, but not yet","Here you have a great opportunity for a film: Ghost Rider. Johnny Blaze who makes a deal with old Satan and becomes his 'bounty hunter'. Gosh what an interesting idea...but THIS telling of the story doesn't live up to what this film could have been. The best part of the film is the Ghost Rider. He just needed a better, tighter story.I thought Peter Fonda was a perfect cast as Satan choosing Johnny Blaze. It's an ironic cast, which is what made it good. Same with Sam Elliot as the Caretaker. After those two actors, it gets kinda muddled. I like Nic Cage, he has the ""melancoly"" of Johnny Blaze, he just couldn't fully pull it off --- and some of that is not his fault, but the fault of the script. The Roxanne storyline, fell flat for me as well as Blackheart's did. Every time Blackheart and his minions were on screen, I thought of the TV series ""Buffy..."" and they did it better.It's sad that this version of Ghost Rider came out the way it did, the story has such potential but I gave it a middle of the road score for the nice graphics of the Ghost Rider and the potential of something better up the road.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid Hellride,"Ghost Rider is one of those countless trashy movies Nicolas Cage did and is even famous for. What I like most are the scenes with Johnny Blaze transformed into the Ghost Rider, they are all fun and entertaining. Everything else, storywise is, well, rather predictable and your pretty standard story of such kind of movies. Verdict: Ghost Rider belongs for sure not to the top movies of Mr. Cage but also not to those, well, very bad ones. Production is solid for a B-movie, the cast too. A watchable and for sure to a certain degree entertaining movie. Recommended for those who can dig stuff like Hellboy, Spawn, Priest, Legion, also Warlock and Constantine comes to mind.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Cheesy, but good cheese.","Ghost Rider was not as bad as some say it was, but then again it wasn't as good as some say it was. It had little originality of its own, the romance was cheap and frivolous without a thought to it, and most of the actors were not suited at all to the film, and their roles were jokes. The only one who, I felt, gave a decent performance was Peter Fonda.However, on a lighter note, the action was appropriate and the special effects to boot. Despite the obvious cheesy hilarity of this movie, it could have had a chance at being something, had the lines been classier and more original, and the scenes less unintentionally funny, and the actors less willing to admit that they are, ""FAKE FAKE IT'S ALL FAKE.""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

However, at times the movie became too ambitious and it really made things look corny and fake.The idea behind the story was good, but the story that made it to the screen was too rushed and not thought through enough. Considering ""Ghost Rider"" is what I can only imagine as the first of more movies to come, the story should have been primarily about the build-up and the introduction to Ghost rider - who Ghost rider is, more of his background, and not just tell a story which could only be described as a script on speed.I recommend you watch it, but primarily to check out the cool special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The action sequences were really short and weren't that brilliant anyway. The film was just going know where. For me it was just about ghost rider trying to stop Blackheart from possessing one thousand evil souls on to the earth and thats it. If i was you i wouldn't waste your money on this at all.

"""Ghost Rider""  Blazes, But Not Nearly As Expected","""Ghost Rider"" was never my favorite comic book series as a kid but I did enjoy it a lot and overall it was probably one of the better ones. However while the movie adaptation was decent it wasn't nearly as good. The biggest difference I noticed is they took a lot of the darker edge away from the story, which seemed to now cater to a much younger audience in obvious anticipation of boosting ticket sales. This'll undoubtedly work monetary wise but as far as quality is concerned it definitely took a hard blow.The film itself is entertaining enough and is kind of cool considering how it blends a mix of genres such as fantasy and western. The acting was okay but some people were completely miscast and not just by how they appeared in the comics but also how they behaved. A grand lesson the filmmakers hopefully learned afterward is that dialog which works in print does not necessarily translate well to the big screen. Some of the one-liners were absolutely heinous and literally made me cringe each time I heard an utterance of either, ""youinnocent,"" or, ""youguilty."" Some raw nacho cheese quotes to say the least. The special effects are great, however somewhat overdone. It seems CGI was thrown into just about anything the editors could get their eager hands on and this added to the corny factor as well.Nevertheless I still think Johnny Blaze is a neat character and contains a very alluring back-story. Not to sound trite myself but I really like how the allegory is based on solid morals and life lessons. The main plot is what sets this apart from a run-of-the-mill movie for me. That being how long should an individual have to pay for a stupid mistake? Surely it's not fair to have to suffer for the whole duration of one's life and that's what Mr. Blaze here discovers, that he can't be scared anymore and he must move onto learn from the past and fight the good fight.I also can't help but complain about the soundtrack, as that was procured for the teenyboppers too. The one huge exception was when ""Crazy Train"" was blasting during a well-suited stunt that synchronized perfectly. That whole warm up and death defying leap will forever be ingrained in my unforgettable moments of cinema. On the other hand ghost rider's nemeses were wholly unimpressive. The biggest of all disappointments had to be the final fight since it led the viewer to believe there'd be this giant showdown between two titanswell let me just say this idea fizzled fast into one immense letdown instead.The irony is that although this film is flawed beyond belief, it's enjoyable and worth watching as questionable as that sounds. My best prediction is that this'll be one of those installments where there'll be a much better sequel as the first in the series usually serves as the establishing point and has to contain the more obligatory conception sequences. True fans of the comic might be a little disappointed but it's by no means a complete catastrophe and any teenager will love it. It appears that ""Ghost Rider"" will be setting down the path of justice after all with this debut, but it might not be the right one just yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fellowship of the flame,"OK, this is my most interesting encounter with writing a movie review so far.....I'm under the safe assumption that like all the other marvel comics turned movie, this one will have more to follow, and in the long run, this one will be the introduction to the character in a series of ghost rider films, like LOTR 1 was purely introduction to a trilogy, , It's much like spiderman 1 in this way as well, get the origin out of the way, then onto the action in the sequels right?... I hope, all that said, when watching this, expect to be placed at the start of the ghost rider story, I know some have said that the film lacks with action, and is slow running, I wouldn't quite say that, there is a fair balance of story, and some great action to crank on the stereo. The storyline is only to properly introduce the origin of the ghost rider, not to bore, so lets hope I'm right and in the long run this is an important introduction piece to a trilogy or something, that would be awesome.

Yee-haw?,"I mean, 'Ghost Rider (2007)' is coherent - in the most liberal sense of the word - but it just keeps making choices that are questionable at best. It sticks so incredibly close to the 'early-2000s superhero' formula that you'd swear it was at least five years older than it is. It also thinks it's so darn cool - though, this is probably par for the course with a film about a motorcycle-riding stunt-guy who has a flaming skull for a head. When you think about it, not much of it really makes sense, beat-for-beat, and the story itself just doesn't go anywhere. Don't even get me started on its use of flashbacks. You can't even 'turn your brain off' because the visuals are probably its worst aspect. The only positive about the cinematography is that it's usually in focus, and the editing is so brash that it makes you feel as if your skull really is on fire. The visual effects are somehow so poorly conceived that they usually look like horror-themed Snapchat filters. The acting is hammy but not entertaining - I mean, Nick Cage's intermittent southern drawl just makes him intermittently unintelligible - and most of the main players just seem like they're in it for the pay-check, often clearly reading their lines from just off-screen. The action isn't exciting; it's slow, cumbersome and clumsy. It doesn't help that the eponymous skull-head looks and sounds plain goofy, stumbling about from punk to punk squawking about penance and sometimes making strange pseudo puns (""yee-haw""?). The whole thing occupies this strange space where it simultaneously seems to be trying way too hard and no-where near hard enough. It's not entertaining - like, at all - but it isn't rage-inducing, either. However, it's so poorly made in almost every area that I wouldn't recommend it, even to fans of 'so bad it's good' cinema (because it's not 'so bad it's good', it's 'so bad it's bad'). It doesn't engage on any level, really. Yee-haw? 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But the Ghost Rider himself isn't one that's after bad persons like in Batman or Spiderman. He's more out to catch the devil's son and other bad spirits.

A stylish but completely empty comic book adventure,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningComic books would appear to be such a good commercial investment for film makers they're making them left, right and centre nowadays, even these obscure ones that would be simply too violent or scary to make into family adventures. Yes, comic book enthusiasts may suffer at the taunts of the intolerant and ignorant, with cries of 'nerd' and 'loser', but never doubt they're almost unrivalled appeal to the box office consensus. And so we have Ghost Rider, another obscure Marvel Comics adaptation that made it to the big screen. But while The Punisher managed to be a none stop action thrill ride, this effort sadly derails off course fairly early on and never stops from there.The plot, for what it's worth, has Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, who as a young man was conned by the devil into selling his soul to him, only for his father to die in a freak stunt-gone-wrong at his carnival. Years later, he's still a daredevil only to sell out crowds in Las Vegas rather than country carny folk. But the devil returns (his name's Mephistopheles, by the way, and he's played by Peter Fonda) and calls on a bargain to free his soul. He must use some skills given to him to take care of his son who wants to take over the world. Instead, he uses them to fight evil, seeing into the souls of the wicked and stopping any future crimes. As events build up to a cataclysmic showdown, he tries to rekindle his romance with teenage sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who's now a news reporter, and is given advice and guidance by wisely old man The Caretaker (Sam Elliot.)Real life comic book enthusiast Cage was an obvious choice for the role, but turns in what is becoming a typically dour performance that brings nothing to the role whatsoever. Mendes is okay as a feisty love interest, but is really just eye candy, while gravelly voiced legend Elliot is sadly equally as fruitless in the wise old warrior role. The only one who really makes an impression is Fonda as the devil, giving it that devilish charm the role requires but the script fails to lift anything higher because of it.The film itself is slick, stylish and polished enough and had it been ten or maybe even twenty minutes shorter it might have passed as harmless hokum. Unfortunately the result is overlong inanity, with a weak, apathetic plot, a slack script and poor performances that make it an instantly forgettable comic book disaster.Mark Steven Johnson's previous film was the other comic book adventure, called, appropriately enough, Daredevil. This manages to make that seem like, well, The Punisher. *",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth wasting away a few hours,"Despite the special effects and smooth way the film moves forward it has a very 80's feel to it, the plot the layout, the voice over, the 'acting' as cages rides off into the night all hark back to that era. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.The special effects are great but then again we expect that now, nothing new really grabs you they simply enable the story to move forward and keep your attention.Havign never heard of the ghost rider before i had no baggage when i watched this film and so have no gripes as to the portrayal of the character which again probably isn't a bad thing.

"GHOST RIDER {Theatrical Version} (Mark Steven Johnson, 2007) **","The recent spurt of comic-book adaptations about superheroes have been extremely variable: some – like the “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” films – were pretty good but, then, HULK (2003) proved a major disappointment; others still, like DAREDEVIL (2003) and the “Fantastic Four” series (just yesterday I checked out the second instalment!), were enjoyable but essentially bland. About the worst of them has been THE PUNISHER (2004) – but now I can add GHOST RIDER to that unenviable list; this is one lame movie (made by the director of DAREDEVIL) which, for all its CGI effects and name actors, really comes off like a cheap 80s ‘indie’ horror flick! The would-be Faustian plot is ludicrous to begin with, but the vacuous presence of the perennially grimacing Nicolas Cage (an actor I can’t stand) renders it even less interesting (bungling even the potentially cool “Ghost Rider” persona); ditto, the motorcycle stunts (it doesn’t help that I’m the antithesis of a sports enthusiast!). Besides, the hesitant love story doesn’t have the effect that it ought to – while the obnoxious gang of ‘hellish’ villains provide the final death-knell to the film! At least, Peter Fonda (teetering on the brink of camp) and Sam Elliott – both of whom, appropriately but perhaps unintentionally, seem to have strayed in from another era! – have fun with their roles of Mephistopheles and Cage’s predecessor as “Ghost Rider” respectively...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A thrilling thrill ride that's...thrilling.,"I saw this movie at a special sneak peek at our movie theater yesterday and I could not believe it! 'Ghost Rider' is the best action/thriller movie of the year so far.Nicholas Cage's performance is absolutely incredible. His performance (and the movie) is stunning. The special effects are awesome. And the motorcycle scenes (especially when it's riding on the skyscraper, as seen in a trailer for 'Ghost Rider') would be great in IMAX. I can't believe they aren't releasing it in IMAX. It would look so cool! I think this movie will be a great hit when it comes out in theaters. I'm hoping the box office for 'Ghost Rider' will be at least $150,000,000.Like I said, the special effects are awesome. The way the creators made Ghost Rider is so cool. I love the design for the Ghost Rider character.And the climatic fight between Ghost Rider and Blackheart is absolutely stunning. The sequence kept my heart racing and my pulse throbbing. 99 out of 100 people will not be disappointed with that sequence between the two characters.The movie is a furiously quick movie that seems to go by in a half-hour, although the movie is 114 minutes (1 hour and 54 minutes).When I walked into the special sneak peek at our theater, honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting a clichéd comic book thriller that would be a cheap, cheesy, B movie that would last in theaters for at least two months, but I was wrong. This is not a clichéd comic book thriller, and it's not a cheap, cheesy, B movie. It will last at least four months in the theaters...I hope so, anyway.All in all, an awesome movie with cool special effects and awesome performances.This is a must-see!Official MPAA rating: PG-13: Horror Violence and Disturbing ImagesMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Horror Violence, Disturbing Images, and Some LanguageMy Canadian rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rated 15....for age 15 and BELOW,"How could a film starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda be bad? Lets ask Mark Steve Johnson, the director of this lacklustre cheeseball of a movie. Okay, hes a newcomer to the directing game, but that doesn't excuse how this movie turned out.I'm not familiar with the ""Ghost Rider"" comic, but this film has done nothing to spur me into getting my hands on a copy. If you were to cross the average episode of Angel or Buffy, with Torque, then the result would be something like this. So if your no fan of those sources than I would not recommend watching this. The lines are so painfully tired and stale your left wondering whether its meant to be an all out spoof. It just seems to move from one embarrassing example of dialogue gone wrong to the next, interlaced with flashy, slow-mo action scenes, which maybe the only thing that stopped me from turning it off.As for the performances; it would be fair to say that this movie would come very near the bottom of the resume for most of the main cast. Cage at least puts a little effort in, but is really pushing it for a man of his age to star in a film like this, I mean ""The Rock"" was over 10 years ago! His fancy wig and semi naked flexing in the mirror fail to impress. Peter Fonda puts on a grim face as the Devil, but...isn't the Devil supposed to be scary? As for Wes Bentley, the strange kid from 'American Beauty', couldn't they have found someone more sinister looking to play Blackheart? A little make-up and dark clothing doesn't really suffice.If your a special effects hound, then you may get a buzz out of this. If your a fan of cinema, then I recommend you prepare for a disappointment (if you feel the need to watch it). The director seems to think that by throwing fancy special effects, rip offs of better movies and cleavage into a stirring pot, the audience will fail to notice how lazy the film-making is.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mark Steven Johnson's 1 of 2 scheduled reboots,"Johnson must be a fan of Uwe Boll or the last thing he watched before taking on this project, was of Boll's. This crap resulted in a ""reboot"" which wasn't much better, and Daredevil which is also up for an overhaul. Not a good batting average. The ""plot"" for this movie was lackluster at best. The acting by Wes Bentley was horrid and I believe it's 50/50 director and actor's fault.Bentley obvious wasn't concerned about his performance or watched his dailies to adjust his ""method"" or ""approach"". Even worse is the awful grating of Ghost Rider's ""voice"". Sounds like Ghost Rider has a carton a day habit. Then there's Eva Mendes trying to make the best out of a bad project along with Cage. But this movie is just inexcusable for looking like a 20 million dollar flick with a supposed 80+ million budget. I think Johnson spent it all on Cage's hairpiece.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Don't listen to the haters, this movie is not a 1","I see everyone on the net complaining about this film. You'll notice I gave it a 6. This movie is not as bad as Elektra, Batman and Robin, or Daredevil. I would list those movies in order from suck to less suck as Elektra (POS), Batman and Robin, Daredevil. The only reason I put Daredevil at the top of that pile is because the other 2 were just completely awful. Back to Ghostrider. This movie starts off very slow. It takes a long time to tell the story, show us some past, etc. And actually, it takes longer than it should to tell the history, and tells it incorrectly vs. the comic books. So far, most of the comic book movies have strayed from the comics themselves, and I let it slide. Afterall, I'm here to be entertained, and watch a movie, not read a comic book. They are 2 separate things, and I don't mind them being different. The special effects in Ghost rider are awesome. I saw it on a DLP projector, and it was perfect. This is what it would look like in real life if you encountered the Ghost rider. Peter Fonda, whose films I generally enjoy, brought nothing to his character. They could have had anyone play his role. I'm not sure if it was Peter, or the direction he was given. The history lesson was slow and too long, and several times cage was playing Elvis playing the ghost rider. when it was all over, the effects were great, and there was enough decent parts of the story that i walked away from the experience satisfied. I didn't expect this to be the next star wars or anything, but I did feel it could have been much better.

Entertainment (only) for those who like fantasies,"If you are a fan of fantasy, science fiction or comics, you may find watching this movie enjoyable. The basic premise is not bad. The special effects are very good and Nicholas Cage seems to try his best to make this into a complete picture. So, I would recommend it for those who like fantasy and wish to pass some time in a somewhat enjoyable movie that is simply entertainment.As far as the movie being great, however, that is quite another question. The script writing seems one dimensional and contains too many past clichés to have any real depth. Therefore, do not look for any true depth in character portrayal or in the plot itself. It just isn't there.Movies that also dealt with fantasy but which had a much better script and therefore depth of plot and character I would say include Spiderman and Hell Boy. Hell Boy was a find for me since I thought the title might suggest a bad script, but I was quite surprised by its depth and quality.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I saw it last night!,"And it was awesome. Seriously, wasn't expecting to have such a good time with it after all the internet bitching. It's a straight on popcorn flick, unabashedly pure fun.

Screaming and laughing while his skin is exploding and burning, it's intense (surprisingly so for a PG13). Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors and he does an awesome job as well. And Wes BEntley (where has he been?) shows that he remains one of the best actors of his generation. Eva Mendes is hot!!!!! There were so many huge set pieces here -- the biggest one would be a spoiler so I won't give it. But the final fight is awesome, reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the spirits flying all over the place. Warning to kids thought -- it's scary at times.

"""You can't live in fear""","Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When dad is diagnosed with cancer Johnny is misled into making a foolish deal with the devil, which results in his being cursed to become the Ghost Rider - a supernatural flaming skeleton.Mark Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but its main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. I suppose someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that ""Ghost Rider"" has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with bits of humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.If all you want out of ""Ghost Rider"" is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick ""Ghost Rider"" delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here is a smattering of noteworthy elements:Note that Johnny is misled into ""selling his soul"" to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally ""sell their soul"" to Satan but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, ""selling our soul"" to the devil; that is, giving over our lives to evil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will?Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.Love is an important theme in the story. Johnny ""sells his soul"" for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in its highest and purest form, which puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.This is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be an enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and ""spirit of vengeance"" during his initial conversion.Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscraper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky."" (I love that song! Who doesn't?)The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, with the Extended Cut running 13 minutes longer. It was shot in Melbourne, Australia, and other areas of Victoria.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ghost Rider; Nothing I'd see twice but definitely worth watching Once,"Let's just get one thing clear: Ghost Rider wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. In the very least it was entertaining. Yes it doesn't compare to Spiderman or X-Men (The Punisher is the best one of them all) but its better than the likes of Daredevil, Hulk, etc. I think people were let down because like myself the trailer had them sold from day one and this release had been marked on my calender for months. As a result of being let down a lot of people are being pretty harsh. I'd recommend seeing this picture if you'd like to, just, be entertained for a few hours. If your looking to see the best action/comic picture ever made then your going to leave pretty unhappy. Nic Cage is one of the best, there's no denying that, I think he pulls off the Ghost Rider character well. For the males out there Eva Mendes is absolutely gorgeous and there's no denying that either. Her character was undeveloped but being just ""eye candy"" in this picture is a quite a stretch. A movie like this disappoints me in a lot of ways but in the end I didn't leave the theater like I did after watching Alexander a few years back. I was irate because the trailer made that one look like something great but it was the biggest waste of time and money that I've ever experienced in my life. Ghost Rider was nothing like that. Disappointed sure, irate no. Ultimately what needs to be said is that this film, at its worst, is an average picture. It's not some atrocity that some people are saying it is. Go see it and you'll most likely respond to it the way I did. Just give it a chance. You may love it, like it or hate it. Everybody's critique is unique. This was a vague representation of mine.Oh yeah, I just wanted to say that Nicolas Cage had his finest performance in his finest film; The Family Man. I don't care what you guys say its the truth.

"Alright, but has many problems, especially with its humour","Despite knowing very little other than the basic mythos, I was still rather hyped to see Ghost Rider. I was disappointed at first at the fact that its release date was pushed back from last summer until now, but figured there was a good reason for it. Unfortunately after seeing it, I think they should have held it off even longer.As a child, Johnny Blaze does death-defying stunts on a motorbike alongside his father. When he receives word of his father having cancer, he makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), to save his father's life. In exchange, he signs over his soul to him to do a job that will not be required until much later in life. Zap forward at least fifteen years, and Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is doing positively insane bike stunts and thrilling crowds all over the United States. At the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has arrived back on earth, looking for a long lost contract of souls. Only then is Johnny contacted by the devil again to stop him, and becomes the title character.The movie itself is not all that bad. The storyline is pretty good, and stays consistent throughout despite the addition of a few subplots. Everything just practically flies by.But that is what hurts the film a lot too.The origin of Johnny Blaze is done very well, and quite speedily. He is introduced, signs the deal, and is an adult faster than you can say the devil's name. But after that, when it should begin to meander and slow down a bit, it just keeps up the pace and does not stop. Characters introduced part way through and should get more of a chance to do things are just held back, and random moments go on for longer than they should. It feels imbalanced in some sections, and feels undercooked in others. Battle scenes are especially hit, as they last varyingly between a few seconds and a few minutes. If you blink during some of them, you may miss them.Which leads us to the next issue: it is too damn cheesy. I understand that comics are very tongue-in-cheek and heavily ironic/predictable. But the movie versions usually have some form of seriousness to them. Here, it is almost all laughable moments, and no sheer moments of seriousness. Just listening to Ghost Rider is like listening to a cheap comedian. A cheap comedian who looks bad ass of course. Lines like ""You're pissing me off,"" and ""Guilty,"" are just too funny for words. But they should not be. This comic book story is dark and morbid in its content, so why is that not reflected in the film? A lot less cheese and a lot more seriousness would have gone a long way.The special effects are another iffy area. Ghost Rider himself looks great the majority of the time. His flaming skull head looks natural, and never looks pasted on in any instant. When he jumps on his bike and starts riding is when he looks particularly good, as it is evident that the filmmakers spent extra attention on getting these two details down pat, even during moments of fighting or driving. Clumsily however, when Blaze first transforms into the vigilante superhero, the effects look really terrible and really cheaply done. They still look decent, but in comparison to the easy transformations later on, they stand out as fairly bad.The scene involving Ghost Rider and the helicopter has some of the worst effects I have seen in a recent film (although nowhere near as horrendous as the shoddily produced The Brothers Grimm). The deaths that Blackheart is responsible for look okay, but looks the last one he does looks rather obnoxiously edited in. When he and his cronies show off their powers, it looks a hell of a lot better, but nowhere near as powerfully and majestically created as Ghost Rider's.Cage is alright as Blaze. He is very laid back, and acts up at the appropriate times. I think he tried a little too hard to be seen as being younger though, but he does manage to pull it off. His lack of melodramatics (like in the recent World Trade Center) also helps, as he stays grounded in the role, and does not make it out to be a complete joke. When he is Ghost Rider though, as said, it just does not totally work. Fonda and Sam Elliot who shows up off and on, are both on about the same page of being alright. They do an admirable job, but they just do not make the roles anything more than they already are. Bentley on the other hand, really does a good job as Blackheart. He plays him up and is great in this villainous role. If he was handed better dialogue, and had a few more scenes, he would have really become a force to be reckoned with.Eva Mendes however, is very haphazard as Blaze's love interest Roxanne. She does nothing for the movie except for bringing an added hotness to it. Her dialogue exchanges with Cage are alright, but their chemistry is not all that great. She does not seem like she is all in it like the rest of the cast, and just feels like the weakest link (albeit a hell of a lot stronger than Ms. Katie ""Useless"" Holmes in Batman Begins). And despite how gorgeous she is, it really is awkward seeing every shirt (and dress) she wears undone right down to the exact same button, revealing the same amount of cleavage in every single scene.On the whole, the film is just alright and nothing else. It could have used a lot more work than it got in that short period between last summer and now. As it stands, it just does not hold a candle to some of the better comic book films.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun Saturday afternoon flick,"So I finally get to see Ghost Rider, and unfortunately, the disk I got was damaged, so I missed a few minutes prior to the final battle.Strangely, I don't think I missed much.Let's face it - this is going to be the age of the Superhero Flick. The return of iconic movie greats such as Batman and Superman, the incredible emergence of comic classics like X-Men and Spiderman, and even the creation of new and interesting hero tales such as The Incredibles and Unbreakable are all testament to the Age of the Super Hero Film.And in any such age you're going to get great movies, lousy movies, and OK movies.This one joins the ranks of the Hulk and Fantastic Four as an OK movie. It's not bad - it has fine graphics, interesting general plot, and some moments of surprise and humor that make it a good film to have on-hand for rainy Saturday afternoons, when the charm of Power Ranger reruns and new, pathetic Scooby Doo cartoons runs out. But the acting is, at times, pretty bad - aren't we glad Cage didn't end up playing Superman after all! - and the plot is clearly as forced as the average '80s comic - which is what this film was based on.The worst part of this film has got to be the villains. Without giving away details, I think I'd have rather seen this movie done in the old style of TV serials, where the superhero faces a number of conventional criminals and realistic situations, rather than facing a group of contrived demons that barely come across as threatening.The best part was, undoubtedly, the visual effects. I sincerely had my doubts that they could successfully pull off a flaming skull and a flaming motorcycle, but they did.In the end, though, you just have to turn off the gray matter and enjoy the film for what it is - a fun Saturday afternoon flick.Then, when the kids are in bed, pop in any of the Blade trilogy, to remind yourself of what a really scary supernatural villain could be like.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better LOWER Those Expectations,"GHOST RIDER is an adaptation of the Marvel comics series of the same title. Since I grew up with comic books, I am a big fan of comic book movies. And of course, I was excited to see the GHOST RIDER movie adaptation. Sure, I lowered down my expectations because the storyline of ""Ghost Rider"" has been used and overused in numerous films with vaguely similar story lines. I expected for it to be a movie loved with the highest tolerance to criticism. But a disappointing film is a disappointing film. And if it has too little redeeming factors, then there's no reason not to talk about it.Don't get me wrong, GHOST RIDER would not necessarily make you feel like you're throwing away your money on crap. GHOST RIDER has its moments of utter coolness. The fiery transformations with Gothic angelic chorals on the background, the bits of humor, that hellishly radical bike he rides. I would not have even cared if the storyline would be considered over-used & cliché, because I already did expect that. But just the overall delivery of the movie itself was purely bland. The movie was fun but disappointing.It's no surprise, this film was directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed the Daredevil movie, which also could be considered a failure. well, I guess that's STRIKE TWO! & I don't want to see him directing a superhero/comicbook adaptation movie again. I can appreciate Daredevil with the highest tolerance, and would admit to liking it a little. But it still goes out the same that it was crap, & badly needed to fall on a new director.There was no question of the choices for Nicholas Cage to be Johnny Blaze, Peter Fonda to be Mephistopheles, and Eva Mendes to be Roxanne Simpson. They are all superior performers, and very fitting for their roles at that. But the script never seemed to work well with the direction of the film. Many of the lines looked cheesy, mostly due to the editing which had bad timing and monotony of angles, so much so that Nicholas Cage's supposedly memorable lines end up looking like scenes from a bad B-movie. Same with Peter Fonda, who by the scarcity of film projects made him look like a struggling has-been in this movie. There were moments when Eva Mendes was comedically adorable. But her charm (that usually leaves me lovesick) could not save her from ending up looking like a cheap ""face"" in a sad project. At least Wes Bentley was spunky for the role. But his entire look for the film did not carry on a sense of overwhelmingly cool villain. His costume looked like he was spoofing each and every cliché from each and every badly-made superhero and vampire movie. His hair & make-up looked more metrosexual than demon, he could not intimidate me and I swear I could easily ward him off with smelly feet and a bad fashion sense.The fight scenes were pathetic. Sure, the ""minion"" villains known as The Hidden were cool. But the fighting scenes with them did not excite me. In action movies, nothing's new these days when it comes to fight scenes. But one should at least make it either interesting or at least sensible for the audiences to get a sense of response. Many of the fight scenes in this movie makes you end up mumbling ""Huh?"" or ""What?!"" It's as if some characters were too dumb to stand and wait for a punch to hit them. Giving it credit, the film does make the effort to breakthrough with some kind of originality (with scenes like how he beat his enemy made out of the wind), the problem is, they don't really convince me, as far as I'm concerned anyway.CGI or Computer animation is this movie's main Ace card. The thing which it heavily relies to. But one should not really be strict in CGI judgment because in the long run, this technology will get old. It is actually how a film uses its technology to create a good movie. Ghost Rider may have fabulous CGI, but there isn't too much innovative and impressive scenes for it to be a step ahead of the usual eye candy.I cannot deny that there were moments when this movie made me laugh and cheer. But overall, it was a failure, that will stand aside other disappointing classics such as Blade Trinity, Daredevil, and a bit better than that awful Spawn movie adaptation. Oh well, I hope a sequel with a new director could redeem it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fun ride, aimed at tweenage boys, I suppose, but still enjoyable for most everyone","Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has been a motorcycle stunt rider since childhood, having been trained by his stuntman father. However, when Johnny's father gets cancer, the devil himself (Peter Fonda) comes to make a deal with 18 year old Johnny. He'll cure dad of his cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over to him. Almost before he realizes what he has done, Johnny agrees. However, although Johnny's father is cured, he dies shortly after in a motorcycle accident. Johnny is heartbroken and leaves town, running away from his lovely girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). But, the devil tells Johnny he will come for him when he is needed. Flash forward several years. Johnny Blaze is the greatest motorcycle stunt rider in the world, thrilling audiences everywhere, by jumping over helicopters, among other things. Roxanne, now a reporter, arrives to interview him and Johnny realizes he still loves her. Bad timing. The devil comes back to demand Johnny's services as a ""ghost rider"", a person who tracks down the bad guys and gives them a push toward their final destination, hell. Mestophiles also wants Johnny to battle his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his gang. If Johnny can defeat Blackheart, the devil will give him back his soul. Whew, what a deal! Can Johnny summon the courage to take back his life? This is an exciting movie, based on a Marvel comic book hero. Cage, a very fine actor as evidenced by Adaptation and Matchstick Men, gives a nice turn as the troubled hero and he looks, well, very hot. Mendes, too, charms the audience with her stunning beauty and sweet demeanor. As the devil, Fonda strikes the right note while Bentley, who always looks creepy, poor guy, was made to order for his role as the devil's son. The look of the film is adequate, with mostly well-chosen costumes, interesting sets, and some nice visuals. However, one does get the feeling that some corners were cut in the special effects department, making the film look cheap when compared to a movie such as the original Batman. There are a few disturbing images, too, rendering the film unsuitable for those under 10. Yet, all in all, this is an exciting ride, especially for folks who love comic books and their superheroes. As an evening's entertainment, Ghost Rider delivers a big dose of thrills and chills.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst Marvel Superhero Movie ever made period,"Okay honestly I wanted to give this film a chance. I wanted to think that Nicholas Cage would be decent and bring something different and exciting. No, he acts like Nicholas Cage, not Johnny Blaze, not anyone else he has ever portrayed in his films but himself. Throughout the whole film he never gave me a reason to think he was Johnny Blaze, the ghost rider. Even Matt Long who is the young version of Johnny Blaze did an academy worth performance compared to Cage. Eva Mendes is horrible as well, delivering the same crap Nicholas Cage does. Now other than bad acting, this movie was completely predictable, you can tell what is going to happen each moment that it makes Miss Cleo seem psychic again. Mark Steven Johnson please do not do anymore Marvel movies. Let directors like Sam Raimi do it right. I do not need to go into further detail, this review by itself should tell you not to even waste your money at the theater. This movie probably would appeal to 12 year olds and under.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
At least as bad as 'Electra',"Wow. I wanted so desperately to like this film. I thought 'Daredevil' was a fun, action-filled movie and given that Mark Steven Johnson also directed this I had faith that all of the negative buzz was not true. I was wrong.I'm not exaggerating when I say that 99% of everything in this movie was absolutely terrible. Completely awful. The acting is so tremendously bad that it is a wonder how the auditions for this movie went, if they ever happened at all. Eva Mendes, while nice eye candy, is not an actress in any sense of the word. There is no life behind ANYTHING that she says. The kid who plays Blackheart is so unbelievably over the top that every time he appears on screen gives the audience a reason to laugh. Nicholas Cage is, well...Nicholas Cage. 'Nuff said.The ONLY redeeming part of this movie is the performance of Sam Elliot who is wonderful in everything that he does. He must have gotten a different script than everyone else. Speaking of which, the dialogue in this movie is the most drab, lifeless, second-rate fare that most youth theatre performances could put it to shame.I'm sorry, but did anyone put forth some semblance of soul into Ghost Rider? The special effects were passable. But even if they were awesome, it would not have mattered. This is a blot on the history of comic book movies. I've never read the comics, but I'm certain that anyone who has would find this film to be about as faithful as Brad Pitt was to Jennifer Aniston.I can only think of one really good word to sum up 'Ghost Rider' : WASTE.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I really enjoyed this,"I've been a comic book freak for years but just recently started reading the ghost rider series. After reading countless issues, ghost rider has easily became my top favorite comics to read. Then after going to see X-men: the last stand, i saw a preview for this movie..... and i almost freaked out, not because they were making a movie out of one of my favorite comics, but for the fear of how well it would be made. I have been disappointed with many of the last comic movies over the years, but movie this raised my spirits. Sure there were a couple of lame one liners, what comic flick doesn't, but the cgi was really sweet. i really loved this movie but it probably isn't a movie for everyone. Sam Elliot was awesome and Nic Cage was pretty great too (i was worried when i found out they casted him). This is most assuredly going to be a movie that i will have to get.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An average Summer-esquire comic book flick,"Not in league with Spider-man or Batman Begins, but still a fun movie to watch. Could have used a lot more action, but what was there was fine with me, showed a small taste of the heroes power. Nic Cage had some small moments where his acting reminded me of the wickerman, but all in all he did a good job.I enjoyed the movie, it was pretty fast paced, which kept me interested throughout, not really any boring moments. I saw what could have been a plot hole or two but honestly, it's just a comic book movie, I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece or anything. I enjoyed it and I think most of your average movie-goers liked it also for what it is.This movie is more on par with Fantastic 4 and Blade:Trinity (the first 2 were fantastic though) than some of the other comic book based films, such as Batman begins, a great movie with dark elements I had expected to be in Ghost rider, which seemed a little bit toned down to me, one of my only complaints was the lack of ""disturbing"" elements.So, if you have some free time on your hands and you want to be entertained for 2 hours, enjoy Ghost Rider if you haven't all ready seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disappointing,"Sorry but this movie left me feeling like Mr. Cage could have been so much better but something like the directing kept him at bay. Character development was slow and poorly executed. Satan was not really that believable, the spawn of Satan was so over dramatized for the evil effect it left him looking silly. I was very disappointed. This is just another one of those really cool Special Effects movies with a fickle plot, was poorly directed and weak had a screenplay. It seems like that's all we get now a days. Hollywood if you're listening We're more intelligent than this, at least some of us.I will say that this movie may appeal to teens and some who live on the edge of society due to it's evil spiritual content but, since it's all so surface, to the enlightened it is downright silly and bordering on offensive.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unfortunately, it's worse than Daredevil. . .","I generally will go see a comic book movie because I'm a geek like that. Sometimes it's a good thing, like when you get to see Spiderman or Batman Begins. Not so good when you have to sit through movies like Ghost Rider.The script: Fair storyline, lots of incongruencies, but just don't think about them too hard. Don't let your brain dwell on the dialogue either. It felt like something out of an 80's action cartoon. I swear I heard Peter Fonda use the phrase ""I want you to destroy him!"" The acting: I love drawly Nicholas Cage as much as the next person, but every time he was on screen, I found myself wishing his skull would catch on fire again. Wes Bently gave the best performance, and had the least amount of dialogue -- That may not be a coincidence. Stunning performance by Eva Mendez's chest. The action: Loaded up with special effects, but horribly unimaginative.I thought one would be able to CG some really creative action sequences with a flaming chain weapon-thingy, but no, he just kind of swung it around a bit. It was pretty disappointing.If you could sit through Daredevil or Fantastic Four, you can get through this one. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it otherwise.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty cool...,"I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan, but i must say that at first i was a little bit bored.That's why i only gave the movie a 7. I must admit that The Rider is really cool.So if not for anything else go to the movie just to see what his powers and attitude are... Like said, the beginning is kinda slow but it really picks up towards the end.A little far-fetched, but i guess it has to be since it's not ""based on a true story"". If you're a Marvel fan and always wanted to be a super hero yourself, it's my opinion you won't be sorry you chose this movie. As for the acting...i guess it's OK, but that's not the ""main event"", now is it?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"What a fun movie, Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda are great!","Sometimes you go to a movie simply to be entertained, no thought provoking dialog, or deep message that leaves you wondering. This movie is just pure fun and I felt like a kid watching it, it was ""COOL"". I plan on seeing it again.The special effects were amazing, I couldn't get enough of the ""burning skull"" or the super cool motorcycle. I've loved Nicholas Cage since ""Face Off"" and although this is completely different, his nonchalant laid back attitude shows through. Peter Fonda was chilling, in an unpredictable kind of way. I thought the entire cast was good. Again, if you go into this movie with no expectations, except to be entertained you'll love it.

Who would give that Movie 10 out of 10???,"I am so sick of people telling me i am expecting too much of a movie? HELLO? Guys you don't have a point! Im not going into a theatre thinking ""oh this is gonna be a movie based on a comic book, that isn't so great to start with, so this movie doesn't really has to have a plot, character work, dialogues and acting"".This is a crappy movie. So where is the point in saying ""this is a great movie, because i didn't expect much, and i didn't get much so its perfect!"" thats nonsense.Okay. Cut to the chase. The plot itself 5/10. Not as good as spiderman or x-men. The acting 7/10 When the actors get a chance to act, they do a reasonable job. characters 3/10 very very poor character work on this movie. Action scenes 5/10 (and this 5 is compared to ALL MOVIES. It is not compared to ACTION MOVIES, then it would be 2/10) And that is the bigges flaw of the movie. The Action or fight sequences are just boring. Spiderman doesn't really have a great plot, but the fight scenes are pretty awesome.One last thing i would like to add. some people say its based on a comic book so we cant expect more. What do you think is Batman? The Dark Knight? Ghost Rider seems like an amateur movie compared to the Dark Knight.If you can see the movie for free, like on television. Why not. But i wouldn't waste any money on it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One hell of a ride,"As far as comic book titles too often the directors or producers try to present the characters in their own vision. This can at times be OK, I mean let's look at the X-Men trilogy, Spiderman trilogy, Hellboy and Daredevil. All were presented in the director's visions while at the same time capturing the feeling of the characters in their respective environments (e.g. Hellboy's color and cinematography were dead on as far as the comic books go, and to me remains one of the best comic to movie translations ever.) Sometimes even making steps to create a certain realism which would pass off as more true to us moviegoers! To me Ghostrider delivers as well as these other flicks.Ghost Rider is a personal favorite in terms of comic books and novels because of the tragedy which is Johnny Blaze. And Mark Stephen Johnson manages to capture the concept and look, feel and vibe of this great Marvel Character. It even has the feel of an old 70's motorcycle flick! The story revolves around the protagonist Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his life since making a deal to save the life of his father from the ravages of cancer with Mephisto (Fonda). Sticking directly to the comic book and its storyline we move forward many years later where Johnny is now a celebrity biker/stuntman/daredevil and Mephisto comes calling on his end of the deal. He tells him if he will bring down his son Blackheart he can have his life back and their deal will be fulfilled.Along the way we see Johnny trying to deal with the agonizing pain of losing loved ones (his father and girlfriend played by Eva Mendes.) To me this was a good part Cage played, and the acting while not the best ever was certainly not bad at all. I'll give it a 7 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average production for otherwise great comic book character,"""Ghost Rider"" has his moments but ultimately it lets down. It takes too long for Nicolas Cage to become Ghost Rider. It is when Ghost Rider appears the fun really begins. The action and special effects are quite average though if you compare it to other marvel based movies like ""Spiderman"" and ""X-men"". I did like the story but somehow wasn't dramatic enough! I mean the young Jonny Blaze makes a deal with the devil out of love for his father. But his father only is on screen for three minutes or so. They should have expanded on this relationship so that the audience would care more about them. The same goes for the love of Johnny Blaze for Eva Mendez's character. It just isn't deep enough. And what about his reaction to the death of his best friend, Mac. He calls out his name and that's it. No moment of grief whatsoever. I am suspecting that a lot of scenes were cut and that I will have to check out the extended cut to see if that will improve things. The ""Ghost Rider"" has always been an impressive and mysteriouscomic book character. In the movie this mystery is completely gone. I think that some comics should stay untouched because most of them don't translate that well to the movie screen. Since the sequel also has failed to bring us a good Ghost Rider film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a load of dung!,"Oh my.... this movie was terrible! Seriously seriously terrible.You don't give a title role to an actor because they can do a good southern drawl! This film proves that Daredevil and Elektra were not one off mistakes. Here is the third nail in the coffin of this wannabe director.Please... someone... tell him the truth about his directing style ... before its too late!!! Where to begin on the acting... I actually like Nicholas Cage as an actor, but he obviously decided to leave his skills at home with his baby. And the director didn't really care. The emphasis was always on the graphics, so I don't understand why they just did not make this an animated feature instead.

Good production design but terrible script leaves the whole thing a mess,"This film was quite a letdown. Despite the fine production design and decent Special Effects you still leave the theater disappointed. The flaws are mainly in the script which simply doesn't work. There are some laughable line spoken by the actors with a straight face. Ghost Rider's various powers are never adequately explained, which means the fight scenes make little sense. These flaws could have easily been fixed. Nicolas Cage tries hard to make the material better than it deserves. Peter Fonda is alright but hamstrung by the script. Wes Bentley is wholly inadequate as the villain. Disappointing.Overall 3/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy

I don't fully understand all the negative reviews...,"We rented Ghost Rider last night (July 4th - fireworks - yay!) and we really enjoyed it immensely! I had wanted to see it on the big screen, in spite of all the negative reviews, and now I wish I had because we don't own a monster TV and I had to wear my driving glasses to watch it (which I never generally have to do when watching TV at home...) I completely loved the basic premise of this story when I first heard it.I thought the tone of the whole movie was pitch-perfect. Everyone's movements were so precise. Sometimes they were just acting with their eyes. I dug all the camera movements -- this movie had momentum, which was appropriate to the subject matter. Nic Cage is a fantastic (if limited in range) actor and well suited to this kind of comic book *extreme* role. Wes Bentley was great. I really liked the Police Captain and his dark-haired side-kick. (Lots of Aussie actors in this movie as it was shot there.) Eva Mendes was a little disappointing -- I like her a lot but her acting wasn't great (I blame neglectful direction) and she wasn't given enough to do. Plus, her costuming was appallingly poor. There's one time when she's getting back into the car and we see her from behind and her dress is so ill-fitting and wrinkly. Sure, we got to see lots of cleavage (not too much) but dressing a sexy Latina with olive skin in a brown dress that's almost the same colour as her brown hair AND then putting a brown leather jacket on top of that?

Peter Fonda is giving up his motorcycle,"Peter Fonda will certainly remain the hero of the most famous motorcycle movie made ever, but here he plays a very different role, joining the gallery of famous Hollywood actors who have played the Devil. And the Devil is using a motorcycle because we are in the 20th century comics universe, however the rider is Nicholas Cage acting as the Devil's head-hunter.'Ghost Rider' is a combination of Faust, cheap popular culture, computer effects and comics-deep characters that works to a certain extent but also shows deeply the limitations of the genre, or of the mix of genres I should say. It is the choice of a fine actor like Nicholas Cage with good supporting roles from Finda and Eva Mendes that makes the combination even more obviously look like badly mixed. Cage's melancholy is disturbing in every scene he is in, but is not convincing and not in tune with the quantity of muscles on his body and the spectacular action around. The ending is badly written, non-convincing, and if it was meant to signal the start of the series it did not ignite at all for me the wish to see the follow-up installments. 'Ghost Rider' is not bad, but is far from the other Fonda motorcycle movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Bittersweet Piece of Hell,"Given the early drought of 2007's first wave of movies, it's easy to pick out Ghost Rider as a film you'll indefinitely want to see. And why not? If you've got the main character being a flaming skeleton with a blazing motorcycle, it's hard to resist the eagerness of seeing what action scene they'll take place in. Mark Steven Johnson's latest movie is a lot like his recent Daredevil adaptation in how you might leave the theater. You may walk into the theater expecting something good and fun without much brains, but walk out getting the impression the story was taken serious and that little was utilized in the film.Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze takes on the main role of the film when he signs a contract to save his father in exchange for his soul. But poor Johnny becomes the victim of his own choice when the devil decides to turn the results of the contract around. Fast-forward a few years and Blackheart-the son of the devil-wants to obtain the ultimate form of power; is there ever a villain that isn't greedy? Thus, Johnny is turned into the Ghost Rider at night as the devil's bounty hunter to do his work; in this case, finding Blackheart and stop him from gaining his desired power.The plot isn't terribly deep and it's easy enough to follow even with the fair number of plot twists tossed in the film. Like Daredevil before it, Ghost Rider likes to utilize the light-hearted humor and plot with a serious tone. And just like Daredevil, this really becomes one of the film's major weaknesses in how it leads to some very unnecessary scenes and details. Some of the comedy in the film does work, but most of the time you feel like you missed the point or that there was too little or too much effort put into that joke. As for the more serious parts, Ghost Rider tries to make these parts stand out, but they wind up feeling rushed so that the film can get to the next bit of details.Then there's the characters, who go back and forth between being likable and totally unconvincing. This is especially noticeable in the chemistry between Johnny and the attractive love of his life: Roxanne. While they're both likable characters, the believability between the two goes back and forth between strong and nonexistent. And it's tough to establish just how a character feels when they shift from a comical tone to a serious tone and back to comical faster than I can snap my fingers.Not to say that Ghost Rider is automatically a bad film due to these flaws, there's still some redeeming qualities. Nicolas Cage, while probably not the best choice for Blaze, usually makes for a character that you'll admire for his tragic flaws as individual. Supporting actress Eva Mendes also makes for some solid scenes with her character, and actually tends to be more believable than Cage himself. Blackheart and Mephistopheles (the devil) typically do well to be charming villains, but they do get rather annoying with their almost sadistic tone after a while.There are also a few nice action scenes to experience in the film, particularly in the last hour or so. When the Ghost Rider is doing what he does best it makes for an entertaining and usually exciting experience. Also, the Ghost Rider himself has a few moments that, while containing corny dialog, manages to make them sound cool enough to help make his character all the more likable. And you've got to give it up for a guy with a flaming skull, chain and wicked motorcycle for those more memorable sequences.These aspects are nice and do help Ghost Rider to avoid being a complete failure, but most of these moments take place within the second half of the film only. For the first half you feel like your being treated to a bunch of scenes that add little to nothing other than setting up the premise and helping you get used to the characters. Thus you get a bit of that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in which the start of the film does little but after the half of the film is gone, the potential is finally being realized.Ghost Rider is by no means a bad film, there's plenty to like in the film, if most of it is because of the film and characters' style. But once the end finally comes, you get the impression that it was a missed opportunity. It may not have as much charm as Fantastic Four or even Spiderman for that matter, but at least you're treated to something of better quality than The Hulk. Proceed with caution, for this is one of those films that you may love for its action and style, but might be disappointed by due to the almost completely obvious flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An action movie without the action and twice the lead-up,"I went into this movie with zero expectations, having not read the comic books and seeing the preview only once. However, coming out the other end, I wish I had not bothered.Flaming skulls are cool, no-one is denying that; but this movie is not. Although the first point has been beaten to death, Cage sucks. He's got some good movies, granted, but this isn't one of them. This movie is just lame; the lines are cheesy, the characters are cookie-cut from the dough of Hollywood, and whatever cool fight scenes might have saved this movie are null. I can appreciate not having explosions at every turn in a movie, but this was one where I was consciously bored, waiting for the characters to stop being try-hard and cool and start blowing stuff up to entertain me. The flaming chain whip seemed like it had potential.But no. Despite the lead-up to the dispatch of each of the four main baddies, each one is destroyed within a few minutes each. There are no cool drawn-out fight scenes which destroy half the city in the process, but rather the Ghost Rider is given powers so that he can end any fight before it gets good. I described it to my friends as, ""an action movie without the action and twice the lead-up"". Granted, the motorbike scenes are kind of cool, but the fact that the Ghost Rider is seemingly invincible takes any suspense out of it and just leaves you wondering how long until it's over.You may think that at least the final fight scene would be cool. You would be wrong.I could stand this movie if it had action in it - you know, like an action movie should - but it has extremely little. It is minute after minute of lame characters, uninteresting love interests, and boring dialog. The final scene made me cringe more than the entire movie thus far; it was just that predictable.Just _don't_ waste your time.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Riders in the sky,"The problem with Ghost Rider is that the film never really catches fire however the climax of the film does have a comic book ending when Johnny Blaze fights the bad guy.Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze does a deal with the devil when his father has terminal cancer. He signs a contract with Mephistopheles to give his soul for the health of his father. Johnny learns the hard way that the devil has a few tunes up his sleeve. Although his father is cured of cancer he dies in a stunt accident.Johnny leaves the stunt show and his girlfriend Roxanne. He knows deep down the devil will come calling for him one day to fulfil his contract. Johnny goes on to becomes a famous stunt cyclist who has survived many scrapes, I think Johnny knows why. His ex-girlfriend has become a TV reporter send down to cover his latest daredevil stunt.However Mephistopheles steps in who wants him to slay his evil son Blackheart and in doing so he will be released from his contract. Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider and his motorbike goes like a bat out of hell.The flaming visuals are cool, Cage excels as the Ghost Rider who acts more like a vigilante saving good people from bad. Its just the the plot is humdrum with supporting characters being wasted. Eva Mendes is there to look pretty. Peter Fonda is just there to look cool. Sam Elliot is there for his moustache and that horse ride alongside with Cage before he bizarrely bails out of.Wes Bentley does not bring much as Blackheart apart from a generic son of a devil act.Its an adaptation of a Marvel Comic which Marvel Films might have been able to do something more substantial with if they had made the film rather than just be associated with it like The X Men movies. Cage is hampered as Blaze with a distracting wig although he tries to make his character playful but its really an average time-waster.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Leave your inner movie critic, and your brain, at the door","""Ghost Rider"" was a fun entertaining film in all the wrong reasons. If a filmmaker like Bryan Singer, Christopher Nolan or Sam Raimi made this film, it would have been more serious and a better quality film. Keep this in mind that this reviewer had not read the comic but is familiar with the character. The comic book could have been as campy as the movie. Nonetheless, this film is amusing in a cheesy 80's action film type way.In order to save his dying father, young stunt cyclist Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mephistopheles and sadly parts from the pure-hearted Roxanne Simpson, the love of his life. Years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Roxanne, now a reporter, and with Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery Ghost Rider, a supernatural agent of vengeance and justice. Mephistopheles charges Johnny with defeating the despicable Blackheart, Mephistopheles's nemesis and son, who plans to displace his father and create a new hell even more terrible than the old one.Is this a great film? No, but most Arnold Schwarzenegger action films are not quality film-making either. Luckily, you forgive because that is not what you watch a Governator movie for anyway. This was exactly what ""Ghost Rider"" felt like, an 80's action film. There were many cheesy one-liners. Some lame puns were also thrown in there as well. The best parts of the film were the visuals. Ghost Rider was one of the coolest looking comic book characters around, and was someone you could not help but root for. Occasionally it is neat to watch a movie that does not take itself seriously and ""Ghost Rider"" was that film.The acting was fifty-fifty, but it is acceptable because it is not the focal point of the movie. Nicolas Cage was wonderful as the main character, Johnny Blaze. Thank God, he did not play Superman because Ghost Rider is more his thing. The highlight was Sam Eliot, who turns everything into gold simply because of his insanely deep voice, as the caretaker. Peter Fonda was convincing as the devil, Mephistopheles. Donald Logue was also very humorous as Johnny's best friend, Mack.Unfortunately, there were some poor performances too. Eva Mendez was one of them as Roxanne. Her romance with Johnny was not believable at all. Eva Mendez's character was essentially reduced to her cleavage that was shown in every scene she is in. Another disappointment was Wes Bentley as Blackheart. Wes had only one facial expression, just like Eva Mendez, the whole time, and it was somewhat annoying. Nonetheless, with the way modern technology is, Blackheart still looked like a good villain.In conclusion, you could do a heck of a lot worse then seeing ""Ghost Rider."" The only real bad thing about this movie is that it was the opposite of what you would have expected from a ""Ghost Rider"" movie. ""Ghost Rider"" is not trying to win any academy awards; it is just one to sit back and relax with a bowl of popcorn. Do yourself a favor; leave your brain at the door. In addition, leave your inner movie critic at the door as well. You are not going to need either of them. ""Ghost Rider"" is a recommended viewing!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A dismal waste of good comic book characters,"Bad writing, bad directing and bad casting make this one of the worst Marvel adaptations for the big screen (on par with King Kull). Why the producers felt that Nick Gage was the best choice for Johnny Blaze will be a mystery much debated over the years. I am not sure why Johnny became more country as he grew up but I guess Nick is real proud of his over the top Southern/hick accent and he hasn't got to use it since ""Conair"". The producers would have been better served by letting Matt Long play Johnny for the entire film. While Eva Mendes reminds me visually of Barbara Carrera, she lacks Barbara's fire, making all of her scenes with Nick, in a word, boring. The story was certainly appropriate for a comic book, but even DC comics would have avoided the plot holes that permeated this production.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed,"I was so looking forward to this movie when I first saw the trailer. I even marked the release date on my calendar. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed. The story and concept is great, but the overall execution of the movie was subpar. I've seen other movies that Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes have acted in, so I can fairly say that the Ghostrider screenplay is totally at fault here. Can anyone say ""Velveeta""? Some parts were totally cheesy. The editing was poor in some areas. The pace was lackluster and dull--this is my biggest pet peeve about Ghostrider. There were odd, long pauses in the movie. It was like waiting for a punch-line that never came.I had such high hopes for this movie. I would strongly recommend a remake! Find a better script and a better director...and I'll be there for the next version.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Mark Steven Johnson, a new genre awaits...","Comedy!! Ditch all this superhero adaptation stuff, and give us a Todd Phillips-style no-brainer giggle-fest! Seriously, this movie is often hilarious, in ways that make you unsure if he considered the darkness and tone of the source material. Actually, no, allow me to restate that point: it seems like he has read the source material, and only the first, oh, ten or so years of the title. I've read a lot of GR, and one thing that jumped out at me was that this film was almost exactly like an old seventies issue, crappy dialogue, over-melodramatics and all. Case in point: in the book, when Johnny becomes the Rider for the second time, he speaks in thought: ""OH NO... I CAN FEEL IT TAKING OVER... CANNOT STOP... NOW, I AM THE RIDER AGAIN!!"". People who've seen this film will understand what I mean. It appears as though there's been no attempt to seriously adapt the book; it's more of a straight-up transition, and a terrible one at that. The fact that Nicolas Cage wrote portions of the script makes a LOT of sense, as the man's never tried harder at playing the ""tortured hero"" role.Basically, this had potential to be something awesome: one-part Blade, mixed with a little bit of Constantine, would've rocked. What we get is one-part Van Helsing, one-part LXG, and a whole lot of stupidity. The Rider is fun to watch in action, and is hands-down probably one of the coolest-looking characters to come out of the Marvel stable, yet the brief scenes when he does hold screen are handled too flashily and quickly. Wes Bentley is terrible (for a menacing, powerful demon, he's neither very menacing nor very powerful), and one can almost see Eva Mendes trying to get through her scenes, and to her paycheck, as fast as possible. And Sam Elliot... he's easily the best actor in the film (close second is Peter Fonda, who wisely chose the role with the least screen time), and it doesn't say much for the rest of the cast that he gets to waste his talent delivering such gems as ""Any man who sells his soul for love has the power to change the world"". Even Donal Logue, usually a guilty pleasure to watch in crap films, is risible.So, on the whole: great potential, hopeless execution. And the fact that audiences have jumped on it like a dog on a bone will almost certainly ensure that we'll have to endure a sequel.It's almost enough to make you yearn for another Daredevil. Almost.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
well put together movie,Of course one must start out to state how hard it truly is to portray a comic super hero on film. to even think that one would attempt to put together a motion picture such as ghost rider would seem to be preposterous. I will gladly say that i was very pleased with the outcome of this motion picture. i was a little worried at first that the graphics would not be up to par. but i do believe that they looked pretty good. i think the director portrayed a great vision of the ghost rider and Nicolas cage did an outstanding job in playing him. over all i rate this movie a good 9.5. i look forward to the future. i believe this film has great sequel potential.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flashes of smartness bogged down by poor villains.,"Delayed by almost a year and coming from the director of Daredevil, Ghost Rider was given the death knell by many before even having seen it. Into the equation is that it stars Nicolas Cage, a man whose star has dimmed so badly it's as if Leaving Las Vegas had never been made, Ghost Rider it seems......... had to stink? Stunt motor cycle rider Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mesphistopheles in exchange for his Fathers good health. Some time later the demon Blackheart comes to Earth wreaking havoc and Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to stop him, only Blaze is transformed into the Ghost Rider, a bike riding, chain slinging spirit of vengeance.Ghost Rider is a fun film that sadly is not without flaws, but the comic touches and all round sense of fun, however, should not be understated, so much so that if people go into it with the expectation of a light and breezy comic book picture, then there is enjoyment to be had. The character of Blaze/Ghost Rider is wonderful in the extreme, Blaze doesn't drink alcohol, he instead drinks jellybeans out of a glass. He listens to The Carpenters and gets much amusement from watching chimps doing karate, this is a man who on his motorbike leaps the length of a football field over rotor whirling helicopters! Then Blaze becomes Ghost Rider, a maniacal mass of flame and one liners, an odd character when one thinks he works for the devil and makes his mantra one of striking down evildoers! And it's with that cheeky daftness that one needs to view this movie.Nicolas Cage actively sought out the role of Blaze due to his immense love of the source, and there is no denying that he puts guts and kudos into the portrayal. He perfectly camps the comic book nature of Blaze, whilst revelling in the devil may care side of the Ghost Rider persona. However, Cage is the only one who can come out of the picture with any credit, female love interest falls in the hands of Eva Mendes, perhaps her Roxanne Simpson character is a little underwritten, but her screen presence is more annoying than memorable. Peter Fonda is very poor as Mephistopheles, about as scary as someone making Easy Rider 2, yet compared to Wes Bentley, Fonda looks like Oscar gold. Bentley is Blackheart, and he struggles with delivery and any sort of nasty aura in which to breath life into a potential bad guy to savour, and as for his cohort minions? The less said the better I think.It's a shame the villains are so poor because there is a lot of care and attention here from Cage and director Mark Steven Johnson, both men whom are clearly in love with the source material. Ghost Rider is certainly a fun experience, and it scrubs up well on Blu-ray, but you may want to repeatedly punch the casting director in the face come the end of the picture. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Extended entertainment,"I only watched the extended version on Blu Ray, so I cannot vouch on how this fairs compared to the theatrical cut. I can say, that it is much better than the ""reboot"" or whatever you wanna call ""Ghost Rider 2"", which is just plain ridiculous! They might have been good for Crank, but the directors either have lost their touch or the formula just didn't translate onto the rider.But let us talk about this movie. A fair and balanced story, that has it's clichés but has some nice effects to back that up. Good action scenes and a story that works (for those not familiar with the comic books that is). Nic Cage playing a moderate Ghost Rider, which kinda works!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A perfect example how good marketing is the soul of Hollywood,"Okay, the movie was not bad because it did not follow the comic.It was bad, because of the writing, directing, acting and even the special effects...So everything.First off, Eva Mendes. Besides being terrible in the film, she completely misunderstood her role as a T.V. reporter. The few scenes where she is supposed to be doing a news spot remind me of something I saw in high school auditions from a very nervous freshman. Nothing she did was like a T.V. reporter, and she killed every scene she was in.The script is a type of cheesy rivaled only by ""Evil Dead"". Except that you can have a fun time watching ""Evil Dead"", while Ghostrider was just painful. It was as if the lines were pulled randomly out of a hat and the actors were forced to say them with straight faces. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage, but it hurt me to have to see those words fall out of his mouth.Even the special effects, which were the big marketing tool for this movie,seemed sub par. Particularly when Nicholas Cage transforms. The skeleton is comparative to a cell shaded video game or a claymation T.V. show. And we are expected to take it seriously? The beginning had the intentions of an old romance film and instead pulled off the quality of a modern romance novel. It was clear that the young couple were inexperienced on the camera, but once again, it is not like their lines were worth saying. I work at a movie theater and the reactions afterwords were the same as the ""Harry Potter"" movies. ""Well I had to see it, but man did it suck""",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mugging Victim Unsurprised by Attacker's Flaming Skull.,"Johnny Blaze began a career as a stunt motorcyclist while still in his teens, taking after his father, Barton Blaze, who has become a legendary stunt cyclist. In one of those bizarre quirks of irony that life tends to display, his father achieves fame by cheating death, only to be diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a short time to live. Johnny makes a deal with Mephistopheles, selling his soul to the devil in exchange for the return of his father's health. Sadly, the devil tends to be a bit of a sneaky bastard, so Barton's health returns wonderfully, and hours later he's killed in a motorcycle stunt. Ouch.So now Johnny has no soul, but he doesn't quit cycling. In fact, being an instrument of Satan has a wonderful effect on his career, since Johnny is literally unable to be killed. He performs the most spectacular stunts imaginable and with a level of calm that suggests insanity. He's almost bored as he's leaping over things that other stuntmen wouldn't even imagine trying. Unfortunately, because of his pact with the devil, he also has to transform into the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter.Sounds like it could be an interesting life, although I can't imagine how many new shirts he has to buy after they get all singed by his flaming head. Besides, he gets to ride through the night on this cool flaming chrome chopper finding evil souls and bringing them back to hell. I wouldn't mind that so much. Hear that, Mephistopheles?There is one scene where a mugging victim is being attacked, and the Ghost Rider approaches, stops the mugging and dispatches some flaming justice. It's a satisfying scene, but then later there is a television news crew interviewing the victim, who doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders. When asked for a description of the man who stopped the attack, she says, ""he was all thin and bony and had a rad chopper with flames and stuff.""Anything else?""Oh, and his face was a skull and it was on fire. It was an edge look but he totally pulled it off.""There you have sort of the tone of the whole movie. It's about a guy who sells his soul to Satan and becomes a tool of the devil by night, but it's certainly not afraid to laugh at itself, which is important in a movie like this. Besides, when the girl was given that interesting description, the look on the cameraman's face was classic.There is also a totally ineffective love story between Johnny and Roxanne (played by Eva Mendez, who seems far too beautiful and sophisticated to fall in love with a stuntman like Johnny). Johnny flees his life after his father's death, leaving Roxanne for years without a word from him, but when a strange twist of fate brings them back together he is faced with the challenge of winning back his true love while also doing something about this pesky devil's slave thing.You see, he does that foolish thing that people in half-witted movies like this tend to do - he tries to tell her the truth. He explains earnestly that he sold his soul and now has to work for the devil at night, and he's somehow surprised when she doesn't believe him. I love how he lets her get angry and storm away from him without ever thinking to just show her. I'll tell you this right now, if I'm ever in a position where I have to convince someone that I can fly or travel through time or turn my head into a flaming skull or anything else like that, you better believe I'm not going to do much talking beyond ""Okay, watch this...""Enter Blackheart, the devil's son, who is embarking on an ambitious plan to possess a thousand souls and thus release hell on earth. I would have thought it would take more souls than that, but no matter. Johnny is offered the opportunity to anull his contract with the devil if he can defeat Blackheart and send his soul back to hell.All this taking and sending of souls gets so tiresome for me, and it may be one of the movie's biggest weaknesses. Buying and selling a soul tends to be something that most people have little experience with, so they offer this explanation:""The host can gain control of the possessing spirit through concentration on and manipulation of the fire element that exists within man.""Hence the flaming head, I suppose. I'm reminded of that classic scene in O Brother, Where Art Thou? where they pick up that kid Tommy on the side of the road with the guitar. He explains casually that he sold his soul to the devil to learn to play the guitar real good, and Delmar asks incredulously, ""For that you sold your everlasting soul?"" Surprised, Tommy replies, ""Well, I wasn't usin' it...""I have a feeling that a substantial portion of Ghost Rider's target audience feels somewhat similar about their souls, which may be part of the reason that the movie has gotten such terrible reviews. Yeah, it's goofy, but it's not that bad. Most of the confrontations between Johnny and Blackheart and his gang are fantastically stupid (""My name is Legion, for we are maaaaaaaaanyyy!!!!""), but the movie is fun in its own way. Columbia Pictures, at least, certainly wasn't too disappointed with it, because they have now officially green-lit a sequel.For some reason this makes me think of the relevance of one of the more interesting lines in the movie:""Raise no more devils than you can lay down.""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'd sell my soul for a better script.,"""During the day, at a matinée, people may leave feeling somewhat satisfied. But at night, in the presence of this script, people may demand their money back."" I was fortunate. I saw the matinée. Unfortunately, I had to pay for the Director's hall at Showcase (for those of you who don't have a Showcase, or they do not offer the Director's Hall, just imagine paying 2 dollars more for Slightly more comfortable leather chairs.) I should have immediately known that this was a bad idea when I saw Norbit playing in the Director's hall next to Ghost Rider.I stuck with it, and managed to sit through the nearly 2 hours of film, and I have to say, I have seen worse movies. I must also say, that I saw much better movies.One of the big problems (besides the script, and the lack of vocal range on Mr. Cage) is trying to cram too many villains into an origin story. Origin stories, by necessity need to start slow. To jump into the action right away would destroy the tone a good origin sets. This movie sets up a Great origin story. And did fairly well, until Mr. Cage rolled into the scene. From there, it becomes a garbled mess, as not one, not two, not even three, but 5 villains are put into the mix. Entirely too many villains to be introduced, established, and then dispatched, especially considering a good portion of the first half of the movie is Origin material. The result, is more akin to a severe beating, then to an exhilarating ride.It was a joy to see the flaming skull on the big screen, and I hope, that if a sequel does get made, that they learn from their mistakes. Tighten up the script, and fix the pacing issues. Oh yeah, and teach Mr. Cage to add some new Vocal inflections, make him seem a little less robotic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Being a superhero,this film is all it's supposed to be ---FUN","Ghost Rider, despite receiving many negative reviews and a great deal of cruel criticism grossed a total of 228,738,393 dollars. Ghost rider imitates the everlasting battle between good and evil through a past and present legend for legends are a way to understand things beyond our knowledge as said by the movie narrator. It has action sequences, suspense, and a love story that leads to nowhere –but still fun to watch. Being a super hero (apparently a fact neglected by reviewers) it's all it's supposed to be –FUN.The film is based on a comic character of the same name appeared in Marvel comics, the story starts with Barton and Johnny Blaze, a father and his son performing death defying motorcycle stunts, Johnny being in love with Roxanne (Eva Mendes) decides to leave town to be with Roxanne who is sent by her father to live away with her mother but Johnny accidentally finds out about his father's medical condition and the fact that he was diagnosed with cancer, trapped in anxiety Johnny becomes an easy prey for Mephistopheles ( Peter Fonda ) who offers to cure Barton Blaze's cancer and have Johnny's soul in return and tricks Johnny into signing this contract. Years later Johnny becomes the most famous stunt rider known for cheating death and surviving killer stunts and that's where the action kicks in. Johnny Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to retrieve the contract of San Venganza , a thousand souls worth contract and prevent it from falling in the hands of Blackheart (Wes Bentley) his own son ,despite Johnny's disapproval he is turned into a ghost rider by night with furious powers and no mercy at all. Returning to himself in the morning Johnny meets a man called the caretaker (Sam Elliot) who lives alone in a cemetery chapel reveals important information and answers Johnny's unspoken questions of the mission awaits him.The Characters are well cast; Gothic Makeup and dark outfits were used by actors to resemble the evil looks needed for their roles. True no one will get an Oscar here for their performance but Johnny Blaze the ghost rider who tries to defeat his fear, the cold pure evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and Roxanne (Eva Mendes) reporter still in love with her childhood sweetheart, all seemed believable to me.Cinematographer Russell Boyd relied on black foggy scenery creating the perfect mood and feeling of the old American west. As for effects, amazing computer generated visual effects were designed on a shot by shot basis to create Johnny Blaze's skull flames which turns smaller and blue to display any emotion other than rage. As for the ghost rider's voice manipulated by academy award winner sound designer Dane Davis, it was described by director Mark Steven Johnson as ""deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar"" a precise description I thought.For all superhero movie fans, this one is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Everything about Ghost Rider is AWESOME, and with that in mind how could this movie be anything but AWESOME?

Eva Mendes provided great (and possibly organic) distractions, but even she wasn't enough to take one's mind off the tedium, the illogic, and the general stupidity. The waste of talent was shocking.

Ghost Rider review,"Ghost Rider is the introduction of Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I find it is an alright supernatural superhero film. Sometimes with the more supernatural superhero movies, a R rating could be justifiable and tend to be more of the ones done a little better with it. I find Ghost Rider alright even with the PG-13 rating. It is fit for the Halloween season despite being released in February, of which is considered more of the Saint Valentine's Day month. It fits Halloween way more than Saint Valentine's Day. What I mainly have to complain about, which could be pretty nitpicky, is that Mephisto doesn't have any red on him. Blackheart's outfit is pretty much just black, but Mephisto doesn't have any red on him. Mephisto in the comics is red skinned and clothed, so it would be good if they gave red makeup and/or red clothing to this Mephisto. If going for a more human look with a natural human skin color, give him the red clothing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie sucked.,"Where do I start. The screenplay was done poorly. The dialog was inane. Nicolas spewed out all these stupid one liners which really annoyed me. When will movie studios recognize that one liners alone do not make a good movie?! The special effects were fine. They were not ground breaking but good for what it was. That is the only positive thing I could say about this movie. Like the movie Daredevil, the wrong actor was placed to play the main character, Johnny Blaze. I am not saying Nicolas Cage is a bad actor---far from it. However, he should not have been chosen for this part. Whoever chose him should be fired. Remember, Michael Keaton was chosen to play Batman and he was a good actor but as Batman, he sucked. It was not until Christian Bale was chosen to play Batman that you could really see what Batman was about. Also, the last Batman movie in ""Batman Begins,"" the story was told in a serious and thoughtful manner. Previous Batman movies were campy and just stupid. Ghost rider, unfortunately, follows those terrible Batman movies by being campy and just stupid.In this movie, Nicolas Cage was comical. You could tell by watching this movie that he thought this movie sucked so he overplayed his part.Just stay away. Wait for it on video or cable.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst Comic Book Film (and worst film period),"Now, I love comic book films and I love Ghost Rider and I have to say, quite honestly, that this is not only the worst comic book film I have ever seen it is in the running for the top 5 worst films I have ever seen in my life. It is the first movie I have ever watched at a theater and honestly felt that I should get my money back (and I am quite forgiving). There is no redeeming feature about Ghost Rider. The casting is TERRIBLE. The script is COMPLETE TRASH. The soundtrack SUCKS. The acting is Horrendous, though I think it is not so much the actors' fault as the director and scriptwriter. The only parts of the movie that were even redeemable in any TINY fashion were a couple funny lines that had absolutely nothing to do with the movie at all. Honestly folks, I would almost never do this, but really, really, REALLY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or YOUR MONEY!!! The entire audience left the theater in a really somber and clearly unsatisfied manner. Don't let that be you. Don't even bother to wait and rent it. It's GARBAGE!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst written movies with the Marvel name attached.,"Wow, what a dud of a movie. The catch lines were terrible, and the acting in this film was just as bad. The story line and special effects were not horrible. However, the fluidity of the main character throughout this movie was just as poor as the lines he had. Ghost Rider's movements were not very smooth; it looked like this character was made with the special effects from about ten years ago.Do yourself a favor, and wait until this movie comes out on DVD. By then you will have had a couple of friends that had seen the movie, and they can try to detour you from renting it.I had every intention of enjoying this movie, despite the somewhat low rating it received on this website. (Note to self, never doubt IMDb's ratings ever again!) However, when leaving the theater I was amazed that it had gotten the 5.9 rating that it did. That's basically why I gave this movie a 1, to counter act the 31% that gave this movie a 10. (I'm glad I'm not one of those deprived souls;>) This movie actually deserves about a 3 or 4. Yes, it really is that bad. I just hope this little spill will save someone a couple hours of their life, much less the $15 you'll spend at the theater. If I can do that, my time spent writing this thing up will have been well spent.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun to Watch!,"Ghost Rider is actually not that bad of a film. In fact, it is a very good film. I must be in the minority when it comes to liking this film. This is not going to win any major awards, but it's just a fun movie based off a comic book that one could easily enjoy on a rainy Friday night.This film is about a stunt bike rider named Johnny Blaze. The devil himself gives Blaze the power to hunt down demons who escaped from hell and send them back to the depths. His mission in this movie is to rid the world of Blackheart, who wants to control all souls.The acting is pretty good, if not a little over-the-top. Nicolas Cage really played Johnny Blaze well. Eva Mendes is a good actress as well as eye candy. But I truly enjoyed watching Sam Elliot as the cowboy and Wes Bentley as Blackheart.Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable film with great special effects. I thought the image of Ghost Rider looks awesome! i rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bellamy Brothers gone Ballistic,"Who would have thought the Australian outback would one day become the One True West, where undead horsemen roam the plains in pursuit of the lost souls of greedy gauchos? This is one cool customer of a movie. It's hard to place in terms of genre. Mostly action, some suspense, minor chills, a little romance thrown in for good measure. Maybe that's a weakness, trying to cram in something for everyone, but ""Ghost Rider"" never tries to be more than the fairground attraction that it is. Small town bike-riding daredevil Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda) in return for his father's health. Much to his surprise, Johnny finds himself double-dealt by the prince of darkness. Ah, the moviegoer saw it coming. Johnny is now a middle aged has-been by day and the skull-faced Ghost Rider by night, throwing flames and wreaking havoc on the guilty. Nicholas Cage is in the shape of his life and obviously enjoying himself. Sam Elliott reprises his role of the Stranger from ""The Big Lebowski"". Recommended as a dating movie. Fun for the boys, sufficiently creepy for cuddling, but not rough enough to scare the ladies too much. My personal favorite is the way Roxy Simpson (Eva Mendes), stood up by the Rider at a fancy restaurant, clutches her sizable wine glass like a mug of hot chocolate. Thumbs down though for the tit-squeezing outfits she keeps wearing. I didn't like them in ""Hitch"", and I don't like them here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Daredevil director isn't enough,"Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) accepts a contract with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his ailing father.

Later he becomes a famous exhibition stunt rider, and meets up with former girlfriend Roxanne (Eva Mendes). Meanwhile Mephistopheles is threatened by his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to take over. So Mephistopheles proposes to release Johnny from the contract if he defeats his son.There is a lot of background to go through. The first act is a mess of different actors and many characters. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. Also the powers these characters have are pretty random. This is directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed Daredevil. It is yet another mess of wild CGI and camera moves that overwhelm the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the trailer!!!!,"Most movies shoot everything cool about the movie to you in the trailer. Bless Ghost Rider for saving some of the best scenes for the actual film!

Painfully predictable.,"Right off the bat, I have never read the comics, so I have no idea how close this was to anything that's actually canon.Taken by itself, this movie hurts; I don't know if reading the comic would make it better or worse. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, and it did have some very funny moments.Unfortunately, the melodrama was laid on disgustingly thick, the acting was terrible (Cage was decent, but the rest of the cast was either completely inept or having a bad year), the special effects were sub-par considering the quality most CG-based movies are attaining now, and the plot was just generally uninteresting.The worst thing about this movie, the one that really drags it down and keeps the entertainment value low, is the complete predictability of every character and situation. Stock characters abound, and you never see anyone doing or saying anything inspired, interesting or even remotely insightful. Basically, the plot as well as the characters lack depth.A prime example is the beginning of the climactic fight (which, by the way, you'll see coming a mile and a half away). It's painfully scripted and (even in context) pathetically unrealistic.This is a popcorn flick -- not a good one, but a popcorn flick. Watch it for the no-talent eye candy and the amusing lines and deliveries by Cage, but do yourself a favor: Wait until it hits the dollar theatre.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Easy Mummy""","As I laughed my way out of the theatre, I couldn't help but thinking the movie wasn't as dumb as it sounded! It was funny!

Then again, it's all f/x, isn't it? In this case, good enough to please a jaded gamer But why even bother with actors anymore? Oh, right, a good vehicle for Mr. Cage, Mr Fonda, and Mr. Elliot, who looked like they were having a ball filming this ""cowboy/biker"" camp film.Towards the inevitable ending: hero swears vengeance on evil, but loses girl to fulfill his vowsI'm seeing other pop movies themes here! But that's o.k.You might think this was Mummy meets Easy Rider, meets Zorro Perhaps ""Mummy Rider""? Or, ""Easy Mummy""? Either way, it was entertainingly forgetful!

Nicholas Cage got burned again in a movie.,"I really think Nicholas Cage should start talking like a normal person rather than a junkie on shrooms with a raspy voice. I have only read about one comic book about this classic legend and so know very little about the comic book hero itself (provided that I read the comic at a much later date hence mentality and emotional stimulation has evolved or devolved since the time period it was created.) Once again my ""friends"" have recommended a movie thats not worth almost anything. The acting was typical Nick Cage movie style so I wasn't shocked by it but I was shocked by the alarming rate his status as a movie star is going down. I am not ashamed to admit that I had gotten a pirated copy of the movie (because I could not bare to bring out seven dollars for a movie worth even less than three dollars). The copy was indeed horrible and people keep telling me that the movie was very good. I decided that perhaps the quality of the movie print somehow took away from the movie itself and so I decided to rent the DVD. I should have left that fact unsolved so I did have a much higher opinion of Nick Cage but now that I saw it twice and it was still the same level of sewage material (my apologies to all G-rider movie lovers and Cage fans) that almost made me blind. The acting is passable, the villain was hollow and the love story was as pale as legions face (cant remember the villains actual name before the transformation and don't care to). The, hero when transformed into the flaming skull, had as much personality as a..a.. corpse (and not much better as Nick Cage either)and the action sequences were lamer than usual. This movie should be displayed in Cage's funeral to show the struggles he had in his Hollywood career. Simply put: this movie sucks as hard on any video print (quality) and no nostalgia (if I ever get into reading the comic) will ever make me buy this movie again. NEVAR!!!! I mean wtf? Here you have a rip off Death, might as well add a scythe in his hand so the weapon could have at least carried the film by itself.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hmmm,"I had such high hopes for this movie. ten minutes in I was really set to hate it out right, but it kinda-sorta started pulling up from the crash that I feared was on it's way. Peter Fonda. Is he the most underrated actor of his generation. I find him so watchable and entertaining in just about everything he does. There was The Limey a few years back (talk about an underrated film, I loved it!) But Peter Fonda has no facade about him. I never see the tools of his trade peek through... Like so many other actors nowadays. Maybe I'm just growing up and more aware of it. Nicholas Cage is pure bluster, isn't he? I almost didn't go and see this because he was in it.

It's a trap... get an Ax!,"This movie is bad. And not that ""I don't know how I feel about it"" when it's over bad; its more like the punching yourself in the face during the middle of it bad. People walked out during the showing and at the end there was a general disgust for this film. IMDb cost me 7 bucks with one of its users review which rated this movie at a 10 and said it could ""stand toe to toe with the original Crow or the original X men movie"". I'm guessing that was the director posting that comment... because this movie has the face only a mother could love. I would post up a spoiler about the dialog but there's no dialog to spoil. Seriously if you've seen the commercial you get the hang of the entire film. Another thing I will warn you of is that this movie doesn't contain action scenes. There's no reason for the bad guys in this movie seeing as how they disappear as soon as they're introduced in the most mundane ridiculous fashion. The CGI is also horrendous, I've seen better work on a sci fi channel production. The only reason I could think of to watch this film is to pick away at it's many many flaws and deficiencies but there are so many that even that gets tiring quick.

Cage's Weakest to date...,"I'm a Nicolas Cage fan. I've liked every film of his that I've seen, and suffice to say this one is possibly his weakest. He has a certain charisma that saves his movies from being total train-wrecks, but even here it's an iffy save. His portrayal of the character is decent, although I did find a lot of the dialogue, particularly whenever they would start the whole ""is this my destiny' style monologues, very tedious and cliché. And this was certainly not Eva Mendes' best movie, although you think the director wanted it to be considering the ridiculous number of nice-and-close shots of her. Her character existed entirely to be a reactionary person to Cage's lead, which gives her almost no depth and masks what skill Mendes has behind the 'ooh, save the pretty girl' device. Cinematographically, it wasn't bad. I didn't see as many painful homages to other Marvel movies as we saw in Daredevil, although I might need a second look to confirm that. The effects seemed fine to me, although personally the skull CG didn't seem quite to par with the fire effects. All in all, it's a good 'turn off your brain' popcorn movie, but it's certainly not going in my top 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie has the look and feel of a western. Cage's delivers truly bizarre performance.,"Bad fun if you're in the right mood, and a large part of the credit goes to Nicolas Cage. The movie has the look and feel of a western. The final showdown is in a ghost town in the desert. Improves on the Spawn formula. Fonda is smart casting as Mephistopheles, while sultry Mendes is topnotch eye-candy.Ghost Rider had some excellent one-liners, comedic breaks, and enough excitement to keep me wondering when and where the next battle might ensue.As comic book movies go, this delivers pretty much everything you could expect from a film about a guy with a flaming skull for a head.Nicolas Cage plays Johnny Blaze as a homespun dunce who 'drinks' jelly beans from a martini glass, listens exclusively to The Carpenters, and busts a gut laughing at chimpanzee slapstick on TV.Sometimes it sizzles.

Why Nicholas played this role, I don't know. Very bad choice, in comparison to some of his much greater acting (such as Matchstick Men or even Weather Man). It was basically a silly excuse for another comic book movie. Just because it was a comic book doesn't mean it should be made into a movie. How long will it take for the game to come out(Not that it would be even remotely worth playing)???? Save yourself the trouble, don't see this movie.

Enjoyable But Not Notable,"25 February 2007. If only Nicholas Cage could have used his talents throughout the movie. Unfortunately, Cage only provides a series of his fun character in this movie while at other times, it's pretty monotone. The special effects are also somewhat on the weak side. However, the storyline and the delivery are mostly interesting, entertaining enough to capture notice. Nicholas Cage does add much needed charisma to the movie and the emotional romance while fairly traditional is maintained with the expected level of twists and turns. Some of the superhero battles are not all that sophisticated nor fantastic, barely making the grade. Overall, it was a pleasant movie-going interest, if not a great one.

Buck-toothed Blaze and the movie I shouldn't have seen.,"This movie was horrible, its only redeeming value is the special effects and when ""The Caretaker,"" Sam Elliot, is in the scene. This movie had so much potential and fell extremely short. I was expecting a VERY DARK movie that I waited quite awhile for and instead I get ""Ghost Rider"" - a light-hearted tale with a cheesy love story.I saw the movie and was shocked, I wanted to leave halfway though but I paid $9.50 so I had to stay. To tell you the truth I kept hoping it was going to get better but it didn't. The movie has great foundational ideas about coming to grips with the ""darkness inside of you"" and if ""executed correctly"" could have been better than Batman Begins - but they took a very adult storyline and tailored it to seventh-graders.By ""seventh-graders"" I mean this: the dialogue had no ""big words"" and no intellectual depth; the characters act as if ""a flaming skull-demon-man"" isn't the scariest damn thing they have ever seen (i.e. there is even a joke about the flaming-skull during the movie); the ""demons"" in the film look ""scary"" at different points for no reason, it doesn't fit the tone of the movie, I can only guess it provides a ""quick trill"" to the little kids watching; Eva Mendes bouncing breasts were particularly annoying in the movie and undoubtedly fueled the fantasies of countless hormone imbalanced teenagers, Mendes' breasts are LITERALLY at the center of the screen in EVERY SCENE and her shirt is frequently unbuttoned at least one or two buttons too far which I guess helps provide a distraction to her melodramatic-soap-opera acting style during the film; Matt Long (Young Blaze) is also a horrible actor and ruins the first part of the movie, which sets up the rest of the film to be as equally hard to watch.I will not go into depth about about the different parts of the film I thought were horrible since this is not a ""spoiler"" review. I will tell you that if you are expecting a good movie that ""Ghost Rider"" hits very far from the mark. If you can stand the cheesy jokes and melodramatic love story then this film is probably for you; but if you are looking for X-Men, Batman Begins, or Spiderman type quality then this is not your movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So much potential...,"The main problem is that it had so much potential. It had enough potential to be one of the better comic adaptations - Right up there with X2 and Spider Man, but there were things that pulled it down, I'm sad to say, to a level of mediocrity.Let's start with the potential. Nic Cage as Blaze wasn't bad in my opinion - just a bit uninspired. If they wanted a huge name, there were about a hundred other fish in the sea. Something tells me John Travolta would've been a good choice. As you see, with a pretty nondescript hero role, many actors could've pulled it off. Now, the biggest waste of potential was Blackheart and the Nephilims. Blackheart sure was beautiful, and you could tell he was an interesting character, and Bentley did his best with the tacky lines, but the director turned him into Damian Thorn all grown up instead of more true to his character, a ruthless demon with blood lust. Blackheart is not just a creepy kid trying to emulate Daddy. They missed that mark completely. The Nephilims, well, they were cool, but were not used as much as they could've been to benefit the story.The bad? All the scenes with bonding between Blaze and Roxanne are laughable. I'm sorry to say the two have no chemistry. The back story of the dying father and abandoned girlfriend are mighty depressing, but the way it is presented, the main punch of Blaze's life being a literal hell on Earth is just not felt as strongly. I understand we cannot spend that much time in the exposition, but we can at least be given more time to feel sorry for our young, hopeless hero.The good? The action is good, keeps you interested, and the special effects are decent too. The transformation from man to Ghost Rider was done very well, and I applaud them on that. The one character that was got almost completely right was Mephistopheles. (I would rate Fonda up there with Pacino and Stromare as far as my favorite portrayals of Satan). But that is a smaller part. Not too hard to screw up. I do look forward to seeing more of that character should there be a Ghost Rider 2 (which I do not doubt there will be).As a movie, it is a good popcorn flick. I would say see it once, give it a chance. I liked it, despite it's flaws and apparent lack of ambition. While not the most amazing comic adaptation, it is not the worst either, and I give it a solid score of 6.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mix this in with a confusing storyline that was just stupid and you get a complete flop. I was also disappointed that Stan Lee was not in this.

Not what it could have been,"I haven't read any of the comics, or particularly any that feature him... or ""it""... at all. I certainly wouldn't mind doing so. Now... I like Mark. I think he did a very nice job on Daredevil(most of the less-than-great in the theatrical version was fixed in the Director's Cut). Realistically, I don't fully understand why he was given another chance, as that didn't do all that well, and it's very unfortunate that his next effort wasn't any better than this is... frankly, in a lot of ways, this is inferior to DD. Let's get the good said. Cage isn't half bad. Neither is Mendes, though their chemistry is questionable. Those playing the young versions of the two leads are reasonable. Humor in this is decent enough, in amount and fun factor alike. Pacing is fairly even, and I definitely wasn't bored during this. The music is almost invariably cool and fitting. The Penance Stare is quite nicely done. From there, it all goes downhill, at a speed the Rider would envy. The acting is, at times, lacking, including for the names who have proved themselves elsewhere. Dialog, as with other areas of the writing, holds clichés. There are holes in the script and plot. Any movie has the right to make up its own logic, but it is then under an obligation to remain true to it, unless there is a point to it not doing so. The CGI is OK, and some of the visuals are attractive, although this has next to nothing memorable to it(that refers to this as a whole, sadly). Honestly, while this is an origin story, there could have been more action, and what there is, varies. The villains were interesting, however, they were defeated in dull and unimpressive ways. I was also not sure what the limits to the powers were, and I didn't always ""get"" the intentions of characters... including the hero, and that probably has to do with his lack of eyes. The similarities to the Spawn flick in no way help this. There is little, if any, language in this, the horror, disturbing material and violence are relatively mild(I agree with the PG-13 rating for this), and there is no sex(beyond a tad of eye-candy). I recommend this to those who watch every graphic novel film, and/or fans of the subject of this, who want to see him depicted on the silver screen, whether or not it's the best portrayal. Oh, and motorcycle enthusiasts, they may get a kick out of it. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I am also a Nicholas Cage fan but was very surprised not only to see how his acting has deteriorated over the past films, but the fact had he accepted this role with such a poorly written script and previous flops in the box office. The acting was horrendous from almost every actor especially Eva Mendes. There was no connection between the characters to make the audience feel the acting was natural. The film ran way too long and I watched several people leave the theater half way through it. The first half was slow with no substance and didn't start to pickup until half past. I remember thinking the whole time that I would benefit more from this movie by closing my eyes and taking a nap. I've never been so upset at a Marvel movie much less Nicholas Cage (for taking this role) and how this movie seemed to get pushed through without anyone screening it to realize its crap. I even bought the Hulk when it came out on DVD just because it was a Marvel movie but this is certainly one that will not go on my shelf. IF ANYTHING, wait until this comes out on DVD.

Another mediocre Marvel movie...,"Everything about this movie was mediocre - by which I don't mean it was bad, but it certainly wasn't good.Let's say, it didn't fulfill my hopes, but it didn't disappoint my expectations.At times slipping into sophomoric melodrama, at other times tripping over metaphysical speeches that neither actors nor director seemed properly prepared for - surprising because the director is also the screenwriter.The ""creature effects"" for Ghost Rider go over the top - a CG visage combined with a heavily processed voice mean that there is nothing accessibly human about the character. A more 'natural' voice would have upped the pathos and the audience involvement.The thematic material is pretty light - the best theme I could come up with is that Blaze realizes that in order to live his life he must come to terms with the ""monstrous"" aspect of himself and embrace it. But more could have been done to connect this self-image of ""monster"" with the character's rhetoric about second-chances.In other words, he saw himself as a monster even before he ever transformed into a flaming skeleton. Is this what we are supposed to gather from the film? It's only there piece-meal, if at all.And I have some issues with casting. Eva Mendes is a true beauty, but she's ten years younger than Nicolas Cage - and their characters are meant to have been teenage sweethearts at 17. How does that work? And while in the late 90's I would have said Wes Bentley was an up-and-coming great, his performance in this movie leaves a lot to be desired.In the pantheon of recent Marvel movies, Ghost Rider for me ranks somewhere above Daredevil and Punisher, and somewhere below Hulk and Elektra.

Blackheart and his gang looked really bad ass and I definitely got a boner when I first saw them on screen. Wes Bentley's performance is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand I liked it b/c of the look he gave Blackheart, but on the other hand I didn't like the way he talked. I can't explain it, judge for yourselves. I liked the way he killed ppl, but it got old quickly. Anyways, one of the highlights of the film is Donal Logue's character, where most of the comedy comes from. He plays Johnny Blaze's sidekick in the motorcycle business and best friend in life, and his presence on screen almost takes away from Nick Cage's bad-ass persona. also, the film picked up pretty fast. the exposition was quick but very enjoyable to watch. When Matt Long's Johnny Blaze turned into Nick Cage's Johnny Blaze, i was kind of sad to see Matt go. he was charismatic and characterized by young love, and it was sort of sad to see that young loverboy go away. And this is coming from someone who is a #1 Cage fan.Cons: Though Blackheart and his gang look bad-ass, they really aren't. They seem to go down without a fight, which is depressing, for I was hoping these super cool villains would provide a good battle and some interesting special effects. In general I liked the special effects, but sometimes the action of the movie was less like action; the effects and adrenaline of the movie derive from Blaze riding his motorcycle, such as climbing up a building or driving in the water. very cool to watch, but I think the audience was hoping for a little more resistance from his enemies. Also, there were, as suspected, a lot of corny lines. But i mean it's a comic-book film, it should be expected. Actually, in my opinion, I kind of liked the corny lines. But i have a feeling others won't feel the same as me.All in all, I enjoyed the movie and it fueled me for a couple of days and I am still thinking about it now. Though I see its flaws, I can look past them and realize that not every movie is perfect. And in regards to the chance of there being a sequel...Let's Ride! ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A LIVING HELL (on wheels to boot!),"Due to the recent comic book adaptation craze including ""Superman"" and ""Spiderman"", ""Ghost Rider"" is no different. Unless you read the comics (which I haven't) there is nothing to compare it to. For me it's a cheesy, poorly crafted piece of overly redundant CGI garbage which results in nothing more than 10 seconds action sequences and over the top talk-talk-talking about ""being the rider"". The only time the screen justly held my attention was when Nic Cage first changes and the few scenes that don't concentrate on his stupid Nemesis Blackheart. The villains are lame, the effects were even worse than ""The Hulks"", and Eva Mendes had nothing more to do than show off some cleavage. Over all skip-able and way to hyped up, lets pray to god there isn't a sequel but with Hollywood adapting every comic there is, chances are 2008 can call for ""Ghost Rider 2"" - **",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should have been played by Mickey Rourke,"Out of all the actors in hollywood that can do a ""burning look"", Cage should be last on the list. He's more of a crystal ball, magician, story teller.Eva Mendes acts as well as Cage and is a good fit, but as the theme is closer to Sin City (theme - not story), someone with a light touch would be better.It's basically Spiderman, but everybody acts tough.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Toast Rider!,"This is simply the best windshield movie to come out in years. For those of us lucky enough to live near one of the last drive-ins, this movie presents the best opportunity to incorporate your vehicle into the view experience. There are more than enough point-of-view shots from the bike, creating the illusion of movement as your car tears across the movie screen. Try going straight up the mirror windowed building with your tires leaving snakes of flame, it's fun! All this is enhanced by setting green sticky nugs alight. In fact, play a game where you smoke a bowl every time Nick Cage's skull catches fire (those without drive-in access will have to wait for DVD, poor shmoos.) This movie has many appeals for the Herbal-American viewer, such as the first superhero who sits around watching a lot of TV. Lines like ""I'm watching TV"", ""I watch a lot of TV"" and ""What's wrong, don't you people ever watch TV?"" will resonate in any stoners' resin smeared heart. Peter Fonda is the devil, so bring that Easy Rider (also seven leaves) soundtrack in the car with you. The plastic bag kid who sells pot in American Beauty (five leaves) is back from oblivion as the villain, Hell yeah! The visuals are primo; we have computer animation used very sparingly, creating the Mickey Effect, so named after the CGI that was used on Woody Harrelson after he vomited the shrooms in Natural Born Killers (eight leaves.) The Mickey Effect allows the basic composition to be rooted in reality while adding wild embellishments in places you wouldn't expect. Lots of weird things going on in the eyes. The filmmakers also understand the aura of cool around the 70s-ish source comic and are able to get it into the big screen devil's bounty hunter. That's what keeps this from being a Spawn (four leaves) or a Phantom (Seeds and Stems). Back you fattest bag and get to Ghost Rider, or a least smog out in the parking lot so that you can take you inner windshield into the multiplex with you. Seven Leaves: High Glow. One of the best, has lots of wonder to make your head spin.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Oh, Nick... where did it all go wrong?","Once upon a time, the name 'Nicholas Cage' could be associated with setting the cinema box office alight. Then, after one weirdly-awful choice of film after the next, he's been reduced to this - Ghost Rider. You can probably see what he was thinking... recently the 'Marvel' stamp has been very lucrative, what with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and, of course, The Avengers. Nicolas Cage probably thought this film would be spoken of in the same breath as them.He was wrong. Poor old Nick - just his luck to pick the one 'Marvel turkey.' Ghost Rider is an example of a comic book character that should probably stick to the pages of a comic book. Nothing really works here, even though everyone does their best to make it happen.The acting is average, with the actors doing their best with the lacklustre script. But the script doesn't give any of the characters much depth and Nicolas Cage just looks a bit embarrassed to be wearing a blatant hairpiece throughout.However, who cares about the acting if there's plenty of fun action to keep us entertained? Well... there isn't much here. When Nick changes into the 'Rider' the flaming skull just looks bad and the set pieces of action don't really shout out to you that they're really that special.Ghost Rider is one of those films that, if you have nothing else to do and happen to catch it on telly, then you might think it's okay. But that's all it'll ever be - okay. Although, saying that... if you compare it to its sequel - it's actually a masterpiece of film-making!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A truly bad film,"I popped into see this on a stinking hot day here in Melbourne and the only reason i didn't walk out after 5 minutes was because i was enjoying the lovely air conditioning in the cinema.The acting - goddawful - and the story and screenplay - dreadful.The only good thing about the movie was because it was filmed in my hometown Melbourne and was nice to see some of our landmarks.And yes - I am aware it is based on a comic book character and not meant to be Shakespeare - but it is an insult to one's intelligence.Shame Cage has sunk to such a low - all because of the almighty $$$ - cos he can actually act! And the less said about Peter Fonda the better.Make room for your Razzie Awards guys - cos you are now front-runners!

Unusual Devil's Deal,"First half of the movie was really boring and it looked like a worst manifestation of a comic book. But then story boosts up and touches the sky.The transformation of Johnny into ghost rider was terrific. Although, it gives a semi-comedy touch but as story moves the business gets more serious. I didn't like the Roxie when she first appears for interview but by end she started looking stunning. :)The story ends well and the best was when Johnny says ""thousands soul to burn"" and villain realizes what he thought was his supreme power is actually his death.And finally the devil finds out that he make a really unusual deal.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I learned a valuable lesson.,"As I sat watching this movie, I realized I must be a sinner. I felt the Penance Stare the entire movie through. From bad acting, terrible mixing of lore (the Christian elements added in REALLY did not fit.) and horrid script.... This movie was the spirit of vengeance on anyone who would watch.I did however learn something of love. Love is Flatulence. It is a given than Methane burns blue. When Ghost rider see's his ""love"" his fire burns blue. Conclusion: Love is a wafting emanation, much like this movie.Thus I learned that: I am a sinner, and true love = flatulence...

Fast and entertaining,"Ghost Rider is another comic to movie transition that's fast becoming popular in today's world.Like several of it's predecessors, it's adaption from page to screen is sometimes stuttering, but is a hard action ride which is just fun to watch.Cage delivers an energetic performance as Blaze/Ghost Rider that keeps you rooting for him in either incarnation. His sometimes childish behavior and obviously enhanced eyes keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. Sometimes laughing, others gasping, always entertained.Mendes delivers again as a beautiful woman who can show insecurity and doubt better than any other actress out there. She captivates with sexy looks and her stunning figure, yet shows us that she can portray a woman not totally full of herself for having those qualities.Fonda's performance as the devil is sometimes wooden, but exactly what the character needs to portray a sense of subdued danger and menace.Overall, Ghost Rider is what is supposed to be. Fun, exciting, sometimes comical.Come on, It's a comic book. See it to laugh, see it to cheer. But GO SEE IT!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Then I Thought,"This is first off by all means NOT a bad movie. I have heard people complain how bad it is, and critics alike. I watched the movie, and was actually entertained. The effects were pretty well done, and since the ""rider"" is mostly CGI, Nic Cage doesn't have many lines (always a bonus). As for ""the rider"" He is pretty awesome on screen. He also has little lines which is appropriate since ""the rider"" hardly spoke in the comics. I have heard the director referred to as the ""next Joel Schumacher"". Schumacher single handily destroyed the Batman series (to be revived by Chris Nolan). Mark Steven Johnson, who directed Daredevil also, which I did not enjoy because of Ben Affleck, not because of the director. If you go into Ghost Rider and let go, and not take it seriously it is a fun ride. If you expect it to be a realistic movie (like Batman Begins, or even Spiderman) then you are going to be disappointed. Enjoy the special effects, somewhat decent plot, and cool villains and you have a pretty cool movie. Eva Mendes is also fantastic as the heroine. She is very spunky, and adds appeal to every movie she is in. Without her, I feel the movie would lack in some appeal. Overall I give it a 6.5/10. Considering it opened with $44.5 million in its first weekend, there might be a sequel. After all, in the comics there are 2 separate men who become a Ghost Rider. Stop being so hard on this movie people, and lighten up. Ghost Rider is an action packed, well shot, stunt filled, special effects laden mindless fun! Ghost Rider is one hell of an Anti-Hero!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Mixture of Good and Bad,"Ghost Rider(2007)Review: After seeing this a few more times, my perspective has grown. Here's my official take:Ghost Rider has good and bad all over it. This is a rather screwed up movie at times. Let me sum it all up.The Good: The special Fx are stunning. Ghost Rider looks quite amazing. The effects enough do justice for the Rider. There is quite a good level of character development too. We learn about the sorted past of Johnny Blaze and how he became cursed. There is also a some good action here. It's enjoyable at times. The Rider's voice is demonic. He sounds cool. ""Look into my eyes!""The Bad: The dialog of the Rider is small, reduced to such corny lines like, ""Back to hell"" or ""You're going down"". The Rider does not have much dialog and most of it isn't that good. Nic Cage is good as Blaze, but at times over-acts. I do agree that he isn't the best choice, but beggars can't be choosers. The are some very noticeable continuity errors. The scene at the jail rubbed me the wrong way and felt flawed. The Rider's penance stare scenes are way too long. Should have ended after 10 seconds, not over a minute. The villain looked like a Emo god, and his subordinates are merely nothing more than that. One fight ended too quickly.Overall, Ghost Rider suffers from lots of flaws, but I was entertained enough. This is by no means terrible, not at all. Just above average and rather cheesy.The Last Word: Enjoyable, yet corny. This could have been far better, but could have been much worse. Not bad, just not good either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Serviceable!,"I haven't yet read the original comic, so I should not comment on the extent of the legitimacy of this on-screen adaptation, nor do I have the slightest idea about the actual tonality of the character, but this story certainly portrayed him as indomitable; driven by nothing but boundless rage and undying (literally) determination.Simply put, the approach is mainly over the top and exaggerated, so much so that some instances make you wonder, ""Did they go overboard?"" And I think they did. Now, that could be a blessing in disguise for some but an inescapable nuisance for others.This is something you have to figure out yourself in regards to which way the scale will tip for you.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty average,"Not a great movie but not a terrible movie either. The storyline is fairly well developed, the acting is pretty good, and the effects decent. Nick Cages ""accent"" comes and goes and he delivers lines deliberately aimed at being southern platitudes which is completely unnecessary. Eva Mendes' character is underutilized and it's annoying that they make her so self conscious.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Laugh on the movie....!,"This is a good movie for a laugh. But sadly enough for the director, it is a laugh on the movie not because of the movie! The movie is full of clichés to the degree that while I was watching it with a friend, we were able to expect the following sentence and, guess what, we were right most of the times.! The plot is clear and stupid. The acting is unconvincing. Maybe, the special effects were the only power thing in this movie. However, believe me, special effects don't make a movie of nothing. Don't expect that I took the movie very seriously or something. No, I expected it to be just a entertaining 2 hours of time but, again, the movie failed to deliver these two hours. Thanks god I didn't watch the movie alone cuz it would have been the most boring two hours of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Closest Marvel Movie to Comic Book Yet,"This film shows how versatile of an actor Cage can be. He demonstrates, to me, an Oscar worthy performance. The story line follows the original Ghost Rider comic book almost exact, not to mention it's an incredible thrill ride. The special effects are amazing. If you enjoy watching a film for its pure beauty, this movie is for you. Between the camera angles, transitions and scenery; it makes totally worth seeing. People may think that the entire Ghost Rider is CG the entire time, i feel this is not true, he looks to good, or maybe it was just amazing CG. I waited years for this film to come out. Now that it has, i feel that it was well worth the wait. If you don't want to spend so much money to go see a movie, or if you only see one movie a year, make sure this is the movie that you see. The story line, the acting, the soundtrack, and the SFX are so extraordinary. All in all I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Needs a Flaming Facelift,"Let's face it, Ghost Rider was never a popular character. He was always rather obscure and known mostly known only to comic book geeks. And whatever popularity he had was mostly due to the awesome visual of a flaming skull on a motorcycle. He had two cameos on animated series in the 90s and an appearance in Marvel Ultimate Alliance. So adapting this obscure character could have either been awesome like Blade or completely forgettable like Man-Thing. The end result is disappointing and forgettable but does look cool.The movie, like far too many others, is an origin story. Like every other origin story, it follows the exact same formula. That's the same problem Fantastic Four had, and these producers didn't learn. I don't know why more first movies don't follow the Tim Burton's Batman and Blade format of showing a hero already with his powers and explaining the origin later on. At this point even the most basic of movie audiences can predict the story beats.Unfortunately it takes on a campy tone. Cheesy dialogue is said with the utmost sincerity. Silly scenes are played seriously. Many of the actors chew through the scenery. I understand that there's a certain silly factor to comic book superheroes, but this movie embraces that idea far too much. This is supposed to be a movie about demons, sins, Hell, and the fate of the world. Yet I can't help but laugh at moments that were never meant to be funny. Then moments that are supposed to be funny just come off as awkward.I will say this, the opening act is quite good. The scenes of Johnny with his father, selling his soul, and the father's accident are pretty dramatic. It's the point where Nic Cage shows up that I started losing interest. These scenes have enough darkness to convey the proper tone but enough lightheartedness to keep them interesting. If the rest of the movie had only followed suit this would have been quite good.The cast is hit or miss. Nic just doesn't have it in him to convey being a serious superhero. He's trying too hard to be his usual goofy self that he is in all his other movies. (Brief aside, I'm absolutely glad he never got to play Superman as was once planned.) Peter Fonda is the bright spot in this movie. He's dark and manipulative with just enough creepy playfulness, perfect for someone supposed to be the devil. Eva Mendes looks pretty, but doesn't do much else. Wes Bentley is tolerable as the villain but never memorable. Donal Logue does a good job, if only he had something to do. Sam Elliott is great, but again he needed something to do other than simply offer exposition. Honestly, Matt Long and Raquel Alessi have the best scenes and do some of the best work. Those two should have been the stars of the movie.If there are two things consistently good. One is the CGI. The bike, the demon spirits, and especially Ghost Rider look great. The visuals are what people remember about the comics and the movie nails it. I wouldn't expect anything less in this day and age. The other is Christopher Young's score. It's effective and has some memorable themes throughout the movie. I also love the version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" by Spiderbait in the movie. There's also an instrumental version in the film that works quite well.Overall the film is disappointing. It isn't quite awful but it's certainly not good. There are little moments here in there to keep you interested through the otherwise lousy movie. As I write this, they're making a reboot/sequel. I certainly like the idea, but I wish they had gone with someone else for the role besides Nic Cage again. I believe that each and every movie has the potential to be good. But somewhere along the way, someone forgot that the most important thing is having a good story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Descent Movie Ruined by Bad Romance,"Romance works as a genre, it even works as a sub-genre, heck sometimes it works in superhero movies. I think that the romance between Spider-Man and all of his love interests make those movies 100% more enjoyable. I just saw Daredevil (2003) and while the romance between Daredevil and Elektra isn't executed well in that movie, I understand why it's in there; it's integral to the plot and theme of the movie.But now we've gone too far. Is romance just a default for movies now? Is every movie just supposed to give us a love interest? Ghost Rider is a pretty cool and interesting character, and I could think of a lot of ways to integrate all of that coolness into a really solid Ghost Rider movie. He's honestly one of the more complex anti-heroes. I don't like the punisher movies but at least those movies didn't give Frank Castle some boring love interest that deterred the narrative.If you ignore the romance subplot in this film, is it even that good? No. I'm not mad that a good movie was ruined by a bad subplot because let's be perfectly clear... this was never going to be a good movie, but it could have at least been interesting. When you look at the main poster for this movie, this problem is exemplified. The poster is split into three portions, one with a motorcycle on fire, one with Nicholas Cage and one with a random lady who he's in love with. Having Ghost Rider be in love with a random lady makes him look so much less cool.Stop putting romantic subplots in movies that don't warrant one. It doesn't work. If you wanted someone to bounce off Ghost Rider well, you could have just used Mack, because I was actually invested in their friendship with Mack being concerned about Johnny's obsession with danger. If this movie focused a little bit more on either Ghost Rider himself or Johnny's psyche, we could have had a pretty descent movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage","Another Marvel comic book story reincarnated on the silver screen, Ghost Rider is a story of redemption, good vs. evil and the other complexities common in this genre's lore.Johnny Blaze, a young motorcycle stunt driver does carnival acts together with his dad, whom he tries to save from certain death by accidentally entering a pact with the devil. He grows up doing increasingly more dangerous stunts while trying to redeem his ghastly self and protect the woman he loves.The unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage with hair plugs and seemingly fake abs (which Cage has reportedly defended as real and not CGI as suspected). At least the beautiful Raquel Alessi, who plays Johnny Blaze's love interest Roxanne Simpson, grows up to be the equally luscious Eva Mendes. Peter Fonda plays the devil Mephistopheles, and Wes Bentley (from American Beauty) plays his son, Blackheart, who calls on the other forces of evil to help wrest from the Ghost Rider a prized contract.CGI-effects were heavily used, which is why the movie was about a year late in its release, so I might as well comment on it. When Blackheart transforms into his evil face, he laughably looks like one of those ghosts in Asian horror flicks like The Grudge or The Ring. Blackheart's minions were also not worthy adversaries, very easily defeated by Ghost Rider in the incredible situations, which is perhaps why the children in the theater were not scared.Ghost Rider is fun stuff, nothing so amazing but it is definitely entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Blackheart, well, he did some pretty freaky stuff, but at least he had great computer graphics. His minions were gross too, and all the broken dialog made me feel like i was watching rain man. And some things did NOT make sense. Nicholas gets stabbed while he is on fire and when he changes back, he has a wound. 50 cops shoot the guy and not a scratch on him.

"It entertains very well, but that's all it is, and may be forgotten in a few years.","If it weren't for this movie, I wouldn't know the Ghost Rider character, who is perhaps one of the darkest and most little-known characters in the Marvel universe. I'm not a comic expert, I just know some characters (the most famous ones) and I've seen some movies. So I'm going to ignore the source material and focus on what this film brings us, assuming I'm not the best person to say if this is a good adaptation or not.The script has some notes of interest, especially for those who appreciate a more adult and denser universe: Johnny Blaze was a young acrobat who performed impressive circus acts with motorcycles, along with his father. However, upon learning that his father is about to die of cancer, Blaze decides to accept a pact with the Devil in hopes of saving him, which he is unable to do. Forever bound by the pact made, he becomes a monster that seeks out and punishes violent and cruel men... until the day he has to recover a contract of hundreds of souls that would doom an entire village, which would give whoever had it enormous evil power.If we consider the film as a piece of entertainment, I think we'll leave reasonably satisfied. The film is not an example of art, and I don't think anyone involved will miss it very much, except perhaps Nicolas Cage, for whom the film was a good financial bet, despite not being particularly successful with the critics, and have been heavily criticized by the public. Directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson, it's a film with less action than many would expect, although I didn't have any problem with that. I found it more difficult to deal with the uneven pacing of the film, which wastes time in certain scenes in a way that is difficult to justify.Despite being undoubtedly popular and charismatic, Nicolas Cage is not at his best here and gives us an interpretation that is, to say the least, unsatisfactory. However, Cage has revealed over time that he is not a steady, balanced actor either. He's very good, he's capable of doing great work, but he can also be disappointing. Peter Fonda is quite good here, but his participation is relatively paltry, appearing only in a few scenes. I have doubts about Eva Mendes' talent for acting, I still haven't seen her play a character that doesn't depend on her sex appeal, and what I saw here didn't convince me. However, what she did is enough for the character, who is just a hot girlfriend. Sam Elliot does well and gives his character an old-time ""rough tough"" scent, which I liked.The film consistently and intelligently bets on strong and impactful special effects and quality CGI. Obviously, not everything works well and those fire effects, on the character's face and motorcycle, are so obviously fake that they don't convince anyone, even though the result is aesthetically beautiful and matches the character and the environment. After all, burning skulls are still a classic of tattoos and prints for biker jackets. The film makes good use of the chosen filming locations, it has good sets, good costumes, a dark environment that is not overly dense and does not frighten. Anyone who considers this film a horror should avoid films like ""The Exorcist"" and others, so as not to end up dying of a heart attack, because this film, as it stands, does not scare a fifteen-year-old teenager.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lack of care damaged this film,"Director Mark Steven Johnson (of ""Daredevil"" and ""Electra"" movies) and his screen-writers made this homage to a cult-70's Marvel book a real mess. If I could I'd ask the people involved : ""If you don't like a subject or a specific comic book (like our case) why go and make a movie about it?"" Yeah, it's the money, stupid. Except that,in the end, your lack of interest is going to be very obvious. With comic adaptations stealing the spotlight they could surely do better ...This movie fails miserably even in the visual level were similar films usually excel, which is kind of surprising since even old Mark Steven Johnson hacks like ""Daredevil"" packed some eye-candy. It seems like instead of progressing with his career and evolving his techniques MSJ goes one step backwards at a time.""Daredevil"" had some good moments (namely the first 15 minutes) ""Electra"" was worse and this hits rock bottom...You could easily blame the original comic but that's not the case. Movies like the ""Blade"" trilogy (the first two parts actually) or even Sin City are based on similar books but are actually a lot better. I think that's mostly because directors like Guillermo del Torro (Blade II, Hellboy ) observing the weak and schematic scenarios, cover it all up with nice visuals and set a steady pace in their films, while MSJ works mechanically using as little imagination as possible.Nickolas Cage, who seems to be picking his roles without any thought or care, also fails miserably here. He tries to fit in the role of the undead Avenger but lacks the charm and the guts of a powerful performance. He sports a melancholic expression that is out of place and can even provoke laughter and not compassion.Peter Fonda's participation as Mephistophelis could bring a lot of charm but in the end ridicules a man best remembered from the epic ""Easy Rider"".Eva Mendez is simply as wooden as it gets.Small budget, bad effects and mediocre acting, make this movie hard to watch even for the die-hard marvel fan.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An action film for teens.,"I saw ghost rider opening day, actually the first showing in my area, and I have to say I really could have waited. I have read a few comics, but not nearly enough to say I have a firm understanding on the big picture of ghost rider, however I can say this movie isn't it.The movie starts OK, and spends enough time establishing Johnny Blaze's character (even with some rather large changes in the back story), and actually achieves a relatively charming feel. Its when the movie tries to be serious that it falls apart.The rest of the movie is an anti-climatic spiral of events, that seem all too familiar, and focus completely on special effects. The opponents Ghost Rider must deal with are a joke, offering completely unsatisfying battles. Even the ""climatic"" ending leaves you feeling as if there MUST be more. Unfortunately this seems to be a common theme in action films these days.On top of that, this movie fails pretty much where other Marvel films, with dark comic origins, fail. Spider-Man, X-men and Fantastic Four are great because they can be translated easily into a movie for many audiences. However films like The Punisher, and now Ghost Rider suffer because they fail to accept their darker origins, and compromise the story with dumbed-down action, lightened stories and unnecessary love interests.My advice to you, is if you're going to see a mediocre pop-corn movie, and don't particularly care about a good story, then you'll enjoy this. However if you enjoy depth to your films, and like them to be faithful to their origins, save the 10 bucks and wait for a rental.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The song remains the same,"I too enjoyed this movie, just for what it was. With nice small parts for the actors of Oz. Yes its a comic book, so who is looking for Shakespeare? For me Cage has limited acting abilities so this movie suited him down to the ground. He does action well. Fonda does a great Mephistophiles and Wes a great Blackheart (bet that sounded funny at the christening)I also found the mirror scene to be laugh out loud funny, and another nice touch. I would have like to see more of the demons work but maybe time and money was an ingredient. Pity! Not too sure about the love interest, didn't gell for me. But on the whole this was a good way to spend some time it kept my interest and loved the fire effects. Sam is one of my favs and I enjoy his laid back acting style in all he does. So to those who didn't enjoy it fine but don't put down the rest of us who do.. The Song, though not a surprise was a nice touch",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a good bad movie,"i read a few GR comics, mostly with Dan Ketch (the next Ghost Rider after Johnny Blaze). Unlike most of the comics, it was dark, and somewhat twisted. And it lived up to the whole ""spirit of vengeance"" thing.The movie was nothing like it. it was more Daredevil and Catwoman than Spiderman, Batman Begins and Superman Returns; but unlike DD, it really BOMBED. they tried to make Johnny Blaze and GR come off as ""cool"", but it just didn't work.think of a biker who doesn't touch alcohol but instead ""drinks"" jelly beans from a martini glass, finds chimps to be extremely funny, and whose fave song is by Karen carpenter. As GR, he pulls off one-liners that just come up SHORT. And the finger pointing thing (you'll find out what I mean when you watch it) is just so... lame. In addition, there's a lot of useless scenes that tries to do more of the same, but they just ruin the whole movie. Also, Nic Cage as GR just doesn't work.But being a big-budget Hollywood flick, it had nice special effects and some pretty cool scenes. and some of the intentional humor were okay, though the unintetional ones were a whole lot laughable.The movie would have worked better if they focused more on the penance stare-""spirit of vengeace"" theme and presented GR as a dark superhero.Overall, i predict you'll find it bad but entertaining",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Ideas that just didn't connect,"Overall, I like the movie. It appears very tough to make a great comic book superhero action movie. It was 22 plus years between Superman 2 and Spiderman, so you know it isn't easy. Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were really, really close to being great. X-Men was just below those. I would ranked this one just above Daredevil and Elektra, although it is hard to resist Jennifer Garner in red.It was OK. Not the best, but I like Nick Cage and Eva Mendes, although maybe not together. Their chemistry lacked. I blame writers, directors, Cage or story lines, because Eva has a smile that melts steel. The other actors were very good. Peter Fonda as the Devil and Brett Cullen as Johnny Blaze's father were excellent. The other bads were effectively bad and creepy. Sam Elliot was excellent as always, but the part they wrote for him could have been better. Donal Logue and the crew should have been used to help us care a little more for Cage's character.My kids got me the extended video. It was much creepier than I thought it would be, which is good, unless young kids are watching. I think they did the whole skull on fire thing as best as they could. You can't give a straight skull much expression without animating the eyes, brows and cheeks. And because of that, the body with the skull attached to it seemed a lot like a Scooby Doo villain, which became more acceptable as time went one or I imagine you hated the movie.Overall, I liked it. The action was cheesy fun, acting was fine, the bad guys sufficiently creepy and it appeared to follow the Ghost Rider legend.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
To all the people who thought this was good....,"What were you watching. Please do tell. I work at a movie theatre and had just worked the world premiere in times square. Now I should have judged how nobody clapped at the end of that premiere. But no I didn't. I went and I screened it with my projectionist at midnight at my theatre. Now there have been good reviews and now a lot more bad reviews. This is the latter. Someone said this director is the new Schumacher. Its worse...he might be the new Uwe Boll, with alittle schumacher mixed in. Where was the fighting...there wasn't any. All the battles lasted seconds at best. The dialogue was cheesy and the acting horrible. I don't mind cheese especially with popcorn flicks but this was absurd. I also accept i must give up my sense of reality in a movie like this. No problem with that I love spidey and other marvel heroes. But when a guy has a flaming skull you cant exactly create a friendly environment. Out of all of this i don't really know what powers ghost rider had other than the penance stare and a magic chain he picked up somewhere. There was some good. The transformations were good especially the first one and the others were also nicely done. I just think this movie could have been so much more. I like ghost rider, I think the character had potential. I just don't know where it went wrong. Maybe the villains had something to do with it as Peter Fonda is the first devil that couldn't scare a kitten and Wes Bentley really wasn't that fierce either. The fact that some scenes dragged and some scenes made no sense hurt the movie. They also rushed through parts especially the fights. And the one liners...were they necessary. They really could have gone a totally different way and the movie would have been amazing. Instead of cheesiness why not make this a dark moody piece. I was not holding out much hope and then I saw the amazing transformation to Ghost Rider and thought alright here we go but it never came...how can anyone think this was good???",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Enjoyed !!!!!,"I haven't read that many reviews on this film and only happen to pick it up because it was going really cheap. I am really disappointed it has taken me this long to find this film as i really enjoyed it and would have paid full price to this on the big screen.I am sure there will be lots of negative reviews for the film and I can't be bothered to read through all of them. At the end of the day what i ask myself when going into a comic book movie is - Was i entertained ?. Ghost Rider had some great visuals, a solid story and great acting (loved Cage's maniacal transformation into the Ghost Rider). I will go on record and say i enjoyed this better than Spiderman but then i am more a horror freak than an action one so i liked the more dark side of the film than the light and poppy friendly Spiderman.I don't mind Nic Cage and can basically watch him in anything though i have friends that hate him and thus hate the film so i guess it is all personal preference. everyone keeps raging on him cause they don't like the guy or the films he does. I am not saying that The Wicker Man is a freakin classic but once again i could handle it because i like watching Cage. I would never say the guy is a bad actor though as he has proved over and over that he has a certain screen presence and has had some great roles. I mean Pacino and De Niro considered greats have been in some crap films. doesn't mean that they are bad actors all of sudden.I don't know .....sounds like i got a hard on for Nic.....but i really did enjoy the film and his performance !!!! :P",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*Sigh...*,"Strike two for Mark Stephen Johnson. Why does this guy insist on making campy films based on Marvel's grittiest characters? To be fair, the director's cut of Daredevil was worlds better than the butchered version he was forced to release in theaters. However, even that contained many elements that just didn't match the hard-boiled superhero and the environment he inhabited. Ghost Rider, unfortunately, is much worse in this regard.To sum up, there is a cheesiness to this film that oozes off the screen. From acting to dialog to plot, this film falls flat and is so laughable in all the wrong spots. The only shining moments come when Ghost Rider himself is on the screen and even then he is, at times, dumbed down to cracking puns.Normally a comic-book based film is so bad I would say it is only for the die-hard fans. This is the first case where the film is so far off the map, only people who know nothing about the character should see it.The Fuzzy Dan Speaketh",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All Cage,"I watched this with some hopes of it being a great movie... my mistake. The movie starts out with some history of how the rider becomes a ghost rider. That's all well and good, but there was too much history. In my opinion much of it could have been cut out. On top of that I felt absolutely no connection between the actors. I was hoping for Cage to show up asap. He didn't - not his fault.Nicholas Cage saved the movie. It would have been a B rated flick at best without the monumental ability for Cage to fill the entire big screen and carry the entire script. NOTE: I didn't say ""carry the entire cast"" b/c Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, Brett Cullen and Donal Logue all did fantastic jobs in their respective roles. They just weren't melded together well.Wes Bentley, as Blackheart, seemed at home in this role. But I was glad that he wore a scarf to cover his chest - if the chest was open then the entire movie would have seemed cheap. Matt Long only has talent for soap operas. (Then again Jack Nicholson was the worst actor ever when he started out, so ...)Eva Mendes totally belongs on a romantic comedy set. The little snippets where she gets to perform a bit of comedy made me ""fall in love with her."" She pwns romantic comedy. NOTE: Raquel Alessi is not related to her in any way - other than she looks like Eva's sister! I thought she loved Johnny more than her older character played by Eva.The cgi of the skull on Cage's shoulders was well done when he spoke, but it looked awkward in place. However, the flames were awesome.Overall I only give the movie a 7 out of 10.-LD____________________________________________my faith: http://ww.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/PS: I rented the DVD from NETFLIX and got to listen to the producer's (Gary Foster) commentary. At first I thought that I would listen (this was my first DVD) for a chapter or two ... 28 chapters later I was glad I listened to it.

low expectations surpassed(not by much),"I was not a huge Ghost Rider fan as a kid. I believe the only true exposure i had to the character was in a series (going from memory here) where he teamed up with Vengeance. As a comic movie Ghost Rider for me ranked along the lines of other lesser known heros including Hellboy, Blade, and Punisher. A very solid popcorn flick complete with cheesetastic dialogue and fleeting moments of true talent. The problem for me about the movie didn't stem from any of the performances. The weakest link in the chain was Wes Bently as Blackheart. I'm unsure if this was due to his delivery or the material he was given. It's very easy for a comic book villain to come off as campy in movies if not given the proper treatment. The special effects were great but for me the battles with the villains weren't as spectacular as i expected. I don't want to post any spoilers but it hardly seemed anyone was much of a challenge for the rider.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Literally a Comic Book with a Flicker Rate and Sound.,"Ghost Rider had something none of the other, recent comic book movies had - the feeling that you were really watching a comic book. When you watch Spiderman, you can forget that this was once stationary drawings and just appreciate the movie. I didn't find that to be the case with Ghost Rider. The lines seemed like they were lifted right off the page, and while the actors all did good jobs with their delivery, there is a factor of just being silly (think R2D2 in Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith). The action sequences are also a lot like a comic book - in that it's got dialog and specific actions placed with higher importance than good clean action. That having been said, it was fun to watch, it just wasn't breathtaking or spectacular in the slightest. Nicholas Cage was also the perfect person to play Ghost Rider, and he fits the part in both looks and attitude. Six out of ten for being watchable and enjoyable, but no immersion and a lot of mediocre qualities.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun and entertaining. Don't take it too seriously,"I see a lot of people really hate on this movie. Like, to the point where they compare it to some of the worst films of all time. And while it certainly isn't a great film or even really a good film, it's a fun, kinda turn-off-your-brain and just enjoy type of film. Sure, Nic Cage does his overacting thing that he likes to do a lot, and I can understand people being turned off by that. But, honestly, if it wasn't for Nic Cage's crazy antics, I don't think this movie would really be watchable.

Negative Ghost Rider,"Ghost Rider had what it took to be a epic motion picture based off one of the biggest Anti-Hero characters in comic book historyNow this movie look better on paper and it is without a doubt one of the most awful films I ever seen.This goes to show how not to make a comic book motion picture. Now I know there are those who like this movie I am not one of those few who enjoy this movie at allOther then the special effects which were pretty impressive to see Ghost Rider with his Motorcycle and the fire around them that is some good effects and Sam Elliot's performance which he pretty much makes the match watchable with his performance and his character is the most interesting one out of the entire castWhen you got one actor who pretty much stole the show that's bad.The rest of the movie is just a blur to watch because there is so much wrong that went into this movie.Plus the acting in the film is border line that's the best way I can decided it plus there is hardly anything of interest about this filmIt's just hard to give this movie any thing of worth because it has such bad casting, terrible looking characters and overall just a movie where the special effects are what makes the film worth watching that is pretty badI give Ghost Rider a 3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Could have been better, but still enjoyable.","Ghost rider, sounds like a creepy title to me. How about you?The latest version of a Marvel comic to film is here, and I must say, while I feel it could have been better if targeted primarily at adults rather than teenagers, I still enjoyed it enough to leave satisfied. The movies core audience is going to be teenage boys seeking action, not adults who are looking for a darker thrill ride. While certain parts of the movie do show the possibilities for what it could have been, it is mostly kept to a lighter style. The acting is OK, if not somewhat cheesy given the material, and the special effects are rather well done. Johnny Blaze, to my understanding was supposed to have been a Bourbon drinking tough guy after all he had been through by the time the devil came to collect on their deal, but here, he is portrayed by Cage as a softer, gentler, sensitive if not quirky man who eats jelly beans out of a martini glass rather than drinking. All this leads back to my earlier remark about the target group of ticket buyers, if this movie had been aimed at a slightly higher age group we might have gotten something a little more along the lines of the Crow, or Sin City. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it as is, just that it could have been something that I, as an older more mature viewer might have liked a bit better. Still, a good time can be had if you need a fun flick to go see.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's a bit of a bumpy ride, but still a reasonably enjoyable one","It's hard to enter this movie with an entirely open mind. Nicolas Cage has had his ups and downs over the years; comic book movies have had their ups and downs over the years; computer-generated imagery of the early to mid-2000s was kind of in that awkward teenage phase where it was boldly determined to be everywhere and do everything, but lacked the maturity to always succeed (and generally less so the more it tried). Zeroing in on Marvel flicks, in particular, before the unified Cinematic Universe was inaugurated - well, some hold up well, some were swell at the time but are weak in retrospect, and others had clear issues from the get-go. With all this in mind, in fairness to this 2007 feature and whatever else might be true of it, it's readily evident from the beginning that all involved were having a really good time making it. Just as much to the point, 'Ghost Rider' only wanted to entertain, and is that not what we want out of genre romps in the first place? I'm not saying that this is without its flaws, because it absolutely has flaws, but I'm a little pleased that it's actually somewhat better than I expected. Take that as you will.Let's get the bad news out of the way first, because there is a lot of it. I mentioned the dubious mid-aughties CGI, and for good reason: the more we see of it, the worse it looks. This is true throughout the length, but first really comes into play in the sequence that culminates in Ghost Rider first being visualized (replete with flaming skull), and becomes a more dominant factor thereafter; Mr. Rider's skull itself often looks either too big OR too small to belong on his shoulders. It takes almost 45 minutes for the fiery fellow himself to show up, which leaves just over one hour for the real plot. Before that we're treated to ""Johnny Baggage,"" intercut with scenes of ""Hell Guy and the Spooky Boys."" All the while there's a fair bit of dialogue and scene writing that's outright terrible, made more so when the gauche vocal effects are employed; even as the scenes and narrative are built for fun, there's a considerable portion of filmmaker Mark Steven Johnson's screenplay - even some characterizations - that are too kitschy for their own good. Quality is sacrificed for cheap thrills or amusement, or moments that are intended purely to emptily mimic the Slick And Cool imagery of comic books; these account for nothing beyond their immediate dispensation, and rapidly grow tiresome. In fact, there's much of the title that should have been left in the pages of a comic book, or perhaps instead rendered in a fully animated film (preferably 2D). And while overall the cast ably adapt to the needs of the extravaganza, all eyes are on Cage here. He's enjoying himself, and there are times when he infuses some detectable earnestness into his performance; there are also times when he's in full ""The bees! Not the bees!"" mode, and one can only laugh at the preposterousness; in other instances (including the last few minutes) his acting is just sadly limp.On the bright side, the story itself is fantastic, and no matter the medium it's primed to be a delightfully gnarly, horror-laden blast. There are some truly outstanding ideas scattered throughout these 110 minutes, both in the writing and in the visuals, and one simply wishes that the exact means by which they had been realized were more careful and judicious, or had shown more restraint. While the excess of digital wizardry is unfortunate, the designs thereof are appreciable, and some examples are better than others; tangible creations, meanwhile - sets, practical effects and stunts, costume design, hair, makeup - are all splendid. While no few moments are rather tawdry as they present, at large I like the cast, and from one to the next no one can say the actors aren't committed; Johnson's direction is likewise capable, if imperfect in overdoing various odds and ends. The use of popular songs on the soundtrack is a smidgen ham-handed; alternatively, though Christopher Young's score tends to be a tad overzealous, the least that can be said is that his music lends to the flavors on hand. 'Ghost Rider' is well made in broad terms, really, and anyway, maybe all this is slightly beside the point: even while peppered with tinges of horror and notes of a tragic backstory, more than not the overarching vibe is light and lively. I'm quite reminded of Sam Raimi's first two 'Spider-Man' flicks with Tobey Maguire, or maybe 2015's 'Ant-Man,' all of which leaned into the mirthful side of comic books; this earns some genuine laughs at a few points. Once again, everyone contributing here only wanted to give audiences a good time, and for better and for worse all elements are bent toward that goal.No matter one's impetus for watching - or how generous one is inclined to be - it's surely a step too far to think of saying this is a ""great"" movie. It's just as easy to get stuck on the faults and weaknesses here as on the advantages and strengths, and to weigh one against the other, I'm unsure if there's a meaningful, quantifiable disparity. Specifically in recognition of the fun-loving ethos that defines it in all ways I think the picture is better than not, and it is enjoyable; exactly how enjoyable one finds it will depend on how powerful your inner child is. All told I think it turned out to be more worthwhile than I'd supposed, sights unseen, for the past sixteen years; I also doubt I'll ever find need to watch it again. Watch, by all means, and just soak in the overcharged reverie. Just sit with modest expectations, and maybe that's the best way to get the most out of 'Ghost Rider.'",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spawn + Blade + Electra bad guys = Ghost Rider,"When I first seen the internet trailers for this movie, I was seriously pumped up for Ghost Rider. Then after seeing more and more footage from the television commercials, with Nicholas Cage's limited acting range  which never seems to improve between films (Gone in 60 seconds, Snake eyes, etc.), I got that somewhat familiar ""Hollywood slapped something together to make a quick buck"" feeling. You know that sinking feeling you get in your stomach when the family pet dies? Whelp, Hollywood has again proved that leaning on the CGI crutch, and skimping on a solid script, makes crappy movies! This film could have been the next Blade for crying out loud! All it really boils down to is a two hour advertisement for a sequel  one that will never be made - because the ticket sales will not be enough to warrant a Ghost Rider II. So I have to ask""Why bother making this mediocre piece of junk? Why Hollywood, WHY!?!"" If you've seen Blade, Spawn, and Electra you pretty much know what to expect from the Ghost Rider movie.

"Bad, oh SO bad...","Picture this, A father and son in a carnival doing daredevil stunts and one day his father is diagnosed with cancer. The devil turns up on the sons doorstep and offers him help in offer for his soul. This sets the scene for the comic which to be honest isn't the best of story lines for a hero story but it seems to work on paper. In Cinema its a different story altogether.The cast for this film were poorly chosen as Nick seems to be a very powerful actor and has a great screen presence for many other genres but not this one. As the film progresses this comes more and more evident. The story line loses its way somewhere in the film and for some reason we have a hero and no real bad guy. This is kind of a fundamental to be honest and makes the whole film rather pointless.There was not one redeeming feature in this film. This has to be some of the most terrible acting and story I have ever seen. Original comic was not done any justice and Nick Cage was horrific in this. The dialog was positively comical, I mean sometimes you could almost see the actors smirking as they say their lines. This has to be the worst of the worst for 2007 films by far.

It was as though he was an un-beatble ""super hero"" who could do no wrong, and never die. Some of the dialog was a bit odd at the end.

Eva... done an OK, job. I believe there could have been some better writing for her lines. You have to realize that this movie is based on a comic. And you need to watch it as such. You can't just sit there and watch it like a normal movie. You need to have that comic mind set. If you have ever read comics, you probably know what i am talking about.

Hell's baddies are no match for...anyone?,"The stated aim of Nic Cage and Mark Steven Johnson was to make a funny horror film, in the same vein as An American Werewolf in London. As a massive comics fanboy who is often blinded by that I still have to say  they didn't quite make it. However, Ghost Rider is still an enjoyable film, and certainly represents an improvement over Daredevil, Johnson's last Marvel outing. Cage is the star attraction, and his turn as Johnny Blaze strikes the right notes of comedy and confused sincerity, whilst Eva Mendes and Sam Elliott both give able support (and special mention to Mendes' breasts which virtually deserve a mention of their own on the cast list!) and, crucially, the look of the Rider has been nailed  an interesting mix of Blaze and Ketch, for those who know what that means. The big problem here is when they bring on the bad guys  all of whom are just a bit feeble, and are disposed of by GR with less fuss than swatting a fly. This lack of menace undermines the whole movie, as you never get a knock-down, drag-out scrap that you need to root for Ghostie in. Which is a shame, as with a tougher villain, this could have been a top film and, as it stands, it is just an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Jeckyl and Hyde of a film,"I cant quite put my finger on it, but there was something definitely missing in this film. It might be the direction or it might be the acting but after watching this film i had a feeling of being double crossed. The hype and the build up to Ghost Rider seemed to have lasted years so my expectation was high. What i got though was a film that felt like half had been filmed on one occasion with a big budget, the other half on another occasion when cash seems to have been tight and the actors couldn't be bothered to act. Some of it was eye candy, some was pure monster. I have a feeling this could go down as a turkey. I give the film 5 stars for the half that was good.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth the money!,"I have to be honest... the only reason I went to see the movie is because my husband wanted to go. That, and after seeing Epic Movie last weekend, I thought Ghost Rider had to be better than THAT at least. But that's another story... So my friend and I sat together at the theater ready to mock it (quietly, of course), but we both ended up being totally engrossed in the movie.Even though I'm a huge Nic Cage fan, I thought ""motorcycles?"" and ""the devil's bounty hunter?"" - how dumb! I was surprised to find that it was actually a good story line and funny too! It had it's cheesy moments, but overall was pretty darn great. And there were lots of familiar faces like Sam Elliot, Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and Matt Long that had us saying, ""Hey - that's the guy from (fill in the blank)!""I highly recommend seeing it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outlandish But Fun.,"Feature Film adaptation of the comic book has Nicholas Cage playing motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who unwisely made a deal with the Devil, only to find himself turned into a flaming-skulled crime fighter! OK...This is at least acted and directed with style and energy, even if you never believe a word of it. Peter Fonda plays the devil, in a very droll performance, but it is Sam Elliot who steals the film as a mysterious caretaker who guides Johnny into how he should handle his destiny and powers, since he understands all too well. Fun climax with Elliot and Cage will leave you cheering, though again, suspension of disbelief is quite high here! There was a sequel, which I haven't seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Plus did anyone ever teach him to ride a motorcycle? By the time I was 15 minutes into the movie I was secretly wishing him to crash and die on that thing (I swear I saw training wheels though.... I'm pretty sure this is why Evil Keneval died...).All in all I highly suggest NOT wasting your time on such a waste of money.

Brutal,"The computer generated special effects and Nicholas Cage can not save this disaster of a movie. The plot and acting are so brutal that I kept waiting for the punchline to an awful joke. If you go see this with a wife or girlfriend be prepared to have to suffer through at least three chick flicks to make up for it. Nicholas Cage, the unfortunate carnival worker who sells his soul to the devil for his father's health, plays this role as though he were cracking a private joke with the director. How do the stars of these movies sit through Hollywood premiers and have the audacity to look their peers in the eyes afterword?

"An potentially good action movie, but the heart wasn't there.","When i mention this movie to my friends, they all say stuff like "" Oh it sucked"" and "" Is was such a bad movie "" Although i must admit, it wasn't the best action movie i've seen. It is still very interesting to watch.I think people who annoyed by the fact that the movie had the potential of 4 great fights with Blackheart and his 3 ""friends"" from hell, they were finished off very easily and the fights didn't last long enough to engage us. Even at the end, Blackheart was finished off pretty easily with the Ghost Riders stare to burn the souls. This movie had all the factors of a great action movie, the most important factor wasn't touched on enough. Which is why i think people thought this movie was bad.So overall, a 6/10 but if the fight scenes were prolonged and more interesting, this movie could scored close to a 10. But nonetheless, i give this a MEAN 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A very solid comic book adaptation,"Ghost Rider is one of those rare films for ole' BloodStone because before walking into the theater I was expecting it to be subpar (mainly because of Nicholas Cage-I have nothing against him). I was wrong! Ghost Rider is a very good comic book adaptation. Cage was very believable as Johnny Blaze, the effects were very well done, lots of humor, demonic images & overall just a fun movie. If you're expecting gobs of gore well.. keep waiting because this film has little to none. Is Ghost Rider ""Spiderman 2"" good? No! Is it ""Daredevil"" bad, No! It is however a very solid film with something to offer everyone, IF you like these types of movies.BloodStone's Recommendation: Ghost Rider works, is loads of fun & worth wasting almost 2 hours of your life on...IF, IF, you dig comic book films. If not, you may be bored with it.BloodStone's Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Above Expectations, but still just OK.","So this movie wasn't disappointing because pretty much my expectations for the movie was for another Fantastic 4 Debacle. Honestly, it wasn't a great movie, and I don't think I could stretch it to be a ""good movie"" but I have to say it wasn't that bad.The imagery was pretty sweet at times, the plot moved along so I wasn't bored, and the story wasn't horrible. GASP. This isn't the negative post I expected to write. But there was SOMETHING horrible in the movie. Yes... You guessed it Mr. Coppala himself, Nicholas Cage. OK, horrible may be a bit too strong. I think the word for it is annoying. What the heck is up with his mouth! I can't stop looking at it and wondering if his teeth and lips are real. Actually if I didn't know him before this movie I may have thought him to be funny or perhaps have good timing, but nope. Can't do it. I guess this blog falters in equality. He is ripped like a GI Joe in this movie, so he looks the part. But something just doesn't click for me.The problem I really had with this movie (other than Roxy's shirt popping open in every scene--honestly it was a little much) (and the whole cheese factor) (and the whole Texas factor) was the ending. I have a much better ending which is far more tragic and believable, but would still lend itself to sequels to satisfy the companies behind the Benjamins.For those of you looking for a grade, I refuse to put a grade on this movie out of principle.

marvel comics,"i bought this movie mainly for the action and story that it presented, my son went to go see this at the theater on opening day. Anyway i thought that Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job as the Ghostrider. Second Sam Elliot was a great lift for the film excellent choice there, but why i ask why does these movies have this stupid love interest in them,, Eva Mendez please.. how about J. Lopez. anyway; the whole story plot seemed very interesting, here you have a man making a deal with the devil. aka. the devil and Daniel Webster. The devil of course will break the deal, so he can sucker the young man in for the rest of his life. now the young man has to somehow defeat the devil in the end. What i liked about the movie is that you had Peter Fonda as Mephistopholes.. then they introduce his son. Blackheart who him and the angels got kicked out of heaven , supposedly by Micheal. Somewhere though the movie got disjointed, and my daughter whose opinion i highly value said the same thing. For instance the whole deal about the caretaker.....towards the end.. black-heart's fight near the end with ghost rider.. it seemed like the movie's storyline jumped at tad to much and felt out of place. also i didn't really care for the ending.The graphics were great, the action, and i love Nicolas Cage, i guess the only reason i am NOT giving this film high marks is that it was so HYPED by the media. that expectations are so high. at least mine was, and i feel that if a movie is hyped to death it needs to be better,, not a bad film, at all, i just expected more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Ghost Rider"" vs. ""Daredevil"": This Barely Wins","Ghost Rider is my favorite Marvel character, and I was really looking forward to this. What a mistake that was. As a movie, I find that this was better than ""Daredevil"" (which I hate). But as a superhero movie, this pisses me off so badly. I am happy to say it wasn't as campy as I thought it would be. But, at the same time, it wasn't as close to the comics as it should have been. Now, it doesn't bother me when people depart a little bit from the comics. But, come on, they messed this up so bad. It seemed like Johnny Blaze was turning into the Ghost Rider whenever he felt like it. That's not how it goes in the comic book. If he's around evil, he'll turn and it doesn't matter who's around. Second of all, unless the demons possess a body they don't look like people. Yet, in this movie, they do. They changed the character design of the villains TOO MUCH! Also, the Ghost Rider is capable of carrying out conversations. But in the movie, he can only say a few words at a time, most of the time those words being some one-liner which HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY! Don't even get me started on Roxanne Simpson. The only reason I tolerate this movie more than ""Daredevil"" is because I'm just not that big of a fan of that character (or of Ben Affleck, for that matter). The acting was mostly bad, although I did like Nic Cage, the fight scenes weren't great, as was also the case in ""Daredevil"", but the special effects were pretty cool. At least they got the back story mostly right.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Tripe, but entertaining tripe","I came out thinking ""Well, don't expect it to make any sense,"" then I realised that I was talking about a film where the main character's head turns into a burning skull, and he rides a motor cycle up and down the sides of skyscrapers. Expecting it to make sense is possibly a case of unreasonable expectations.Amiable nonsense. Popcorn movie. It has a sense of fun about it, much of it looks good, and you don't look at your watch wishing it would be over. There are some places where it will make my wife jump when she watches it on TV (she'll be happy to watch it as a quasi-light horror film rather than a super-hero film - it has a kind of Van Helsing vibe to it).Even from my limited exposure to the comic Ghost Rider, it's clear that Cage is far too old to be playing Johnny Blaze. He's good in the part (albeit I don't think it places huge demands on him), but Johnny's supposed to be a young man, and Cage ain't. Sam Elliott is better than he was in Hulk - still mumbles, still talks through his moustache, still can't understand a word he's saying in the sub-Elvis bass rumblemumble, but at least he doesn't have that lemony squinch plastered all over his face.The story is idiotic, and I don't know why they even mentioned the hallowed ground thing, it didn't appear to have any plot relevance anywhere.I went with my son (comic fan) and a friend (civilian). My friend enjoyed it quite a lot, my son and I rated it higher than Daredevil and the first half of Hulk, lower than the second half of Hulk.I can see why it would annoy someone whose expectations were higher than mine.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why?!,"You'd think that when you hear a movie where the plot is a man who sold his soul to the devil that it would be a dark movie, well in the case of Ghost Rider you'd be wrong. I was hoping for a Spawn type feel since the plot is quite similar, but a miss usage of jokes instantly killed that dream. The one thing I liked about Ghost Rider was the one thing I liked about Spider-Man 2 great effects. The bad things where also a lot like Spider-Man 2. What kind of Devil chooses a professional stunt driver as their bounty hunter? Well I know Malabogia from Spawn didn't, he choose a man who was a ruthless killer born and bread. Why does Nicholas Cage have to over act so much in this movie, and why is his voice so low when he pointed at Mephisto I was laughing so hard, btw that's not supposed to be funny. And what kind of an official bounty hunter for satin eats Jeally Beans out of a Martini Glass. See I can take a little bit of humor in Action movies, but this and Spider-Man 2 over did it way too much especially in this movie. Why was Mephisto's name Mephistoles, I'm not 100% sure but I think that's not the original name for the character. I do love Caretaker though, but mostly because I'm a big fan of The Big Labowski. Also why with the special effects of today they can't make Black Heart look like his awesome self instead of a half-ass version? All in all I give Ghost Rider 3/10, that 3 is only for when Cage turns into the Ghost Rider, which wasn't a lot, I thought he looked really cool.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, nothing special.","First and foremost, this film is not in the vein of Batman Begins. Nor is it very similar to Spider-Man 1 or 2. As a whole experience, it is probably most like Daredevil, the director's other stab at the Comic Book genre.The start of he film is much too fast, therefore rushing the back story. It's a shame, because the film should have really utilised the western setting to a far greater degree. The atmosphere could have been really great, with John Carpenter style Gothic settings. Instead what we got was a fairly generic Texas.However, the film was still entertaining. Cage is always fun to watch, and it was clear he was having fun in this role. The comic touches between him an Mendes was cool and definitely made the film flow better.What I was there for was action, and Ghost Rider delivers this well. Although the film is rated a 12A in the UK, I was still fairly impressed with the special effects, where the people were all consumed of life. The CGI was blatant, but I didn't mind.You see, the director's intentions were pretty obvious. This was an entertaining film, which had hardly any surprises, but did pack some good action and fun performances from Cage, Mendes, Bentley and Fonda.There were moments of soppy-sweet bullshit that makes me cringe in films like these (the Spider-Man 2 wedding moment - eurgh) but overall it was a fun film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very entertaining worth watching,"I have just been to see the movie and I found that going into it I was skeptical as I knew the characters history and with the reviews being more neg the positive , I hoped for the best. I was happy and very pleased with the total production. The effects were amazing and the character history and development were well done that even if a person had no background information they could walk in and see the movie and understand the character.I have see all the movies that took comic book characters and displayed them on the big screen and this is one that was more true to the original story and did not do a hatchet job to the character of the supporting characters, I think the production team did an excellent job and as far as Nicholas Cage in the lead role I was skeptical about that but it was handled by a professional and he made it work.I give the film two big flaming thumbs up and it is one hell of a hellcycle ride from start to finish.Never mind what some of the negative reviews say GhostRider is worth the full admission price enjoy it for what it is one very good action adventure movie, and Sam Elliot was wonderful as the caretaker.So enjoy or not it is really up to you to decide.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good,"Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to become a hellblazing vigilante. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice.

Against this backdrop, our hero must fight. The acting is very effective. I finished this film, thinking, ""There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out.""

Sunday Bloody Sunday,"In at least a better world (asking for a perfect one would be foolish), my 200th review would be for a movie that is both a very good one *and* a favorite of mine. However, ours is a world where too many ""reviewers"" don't seem to grasp the concept of objectivity and also a world, where, for a good while now, a certain broadcaster here has deemed it a great idea to offer to us on Sundays movies that, at best, are mediocre: moving backwards, I've had to endure Four Brothers, Iron Man (the one exception to the rule), The Sentinel, Spider-Man 3, Wild Hogs, Sex and the City, Twilight, Pretty Woman, Reign Over Me, Righteous Kill, Fun with Dick and Jane. Well, at least they help to remember what good movies are like...There is a fundamental flaw in Ghost Rider the Movie that makes it a significant movie, especially as the flaw has become an alarmingly recurring one among movies released since - but to a lesser extent already existed before - 2007: The misjudged Must Be PG-13 Clause. Like Die Hard 4: We Can't Decide on the Subtitle. Movies about subject matter, that, by definition, *demands* to be made into an R-rated movie. Remember how *good* the R-rated Blade was in 1998? (A 7/10 *is* good, 8/10 is great.) Now imagine if it had been PG-13 and you're close to what Ghost Rider the Movie is like. For example, the transformation into Ghost Rider is supposed to be horrific and messy. Here all the R-rated stuff like flesh *really* burning and peeling off has been left out. The Penance Stare is supposed to be hellishly torturous: here we see only its aftereffects.One could list all the common flaws that would limit this movie to a maximum of 7/10 even if this were R-rated, but it'd be pointless because of that fundamental core flaw. In this sorry 4/10 mess there are moments of brilliance that hint at a movie that could have been: The very good CGI, the use of *that* song at just the right moment (NOT the crap version during end credits), the skyscraper scenes, and naturally, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott.

"Dull, Lacklustre, fails to make an impact","Ghost Rider was just the movie I expected. Visually stunning, but fails to make a long term impact. Its small run time contributes to the fact. Nowadays almost all comic adaptations are close to 125-140 minutes long. Compared to Ghost Rider's 114 minute adaptation will disappoint the fans of this franchise. Packed with a star studded star cast(comparing with other comic adaptations of late) a regular movie goer might have thought this would be a decent watch. But I'm afraid they will be highly disappointed.The entire story of Ghost Rider, the history, everything seems to so hurriedly paced. Although the starting scene seems to think otherwise. I cant understand why it was so hurriedly paced. Also the director and the screenplay writer could have included a few sub plots, which would have made the movie mildly interesting, instead, it focuses on the central plot which is why the movie finishes just when it was getting interesting.There are few things that are worthy of praise in Ghost Rider. And one of them is the Visual Effects. Visual Effects for this movie have been stunning. Mind Blowing. The stunts were also cool, no scratch that ultra cool. Even the viability of the stunts are questionable, still they are good. Eva Mendes looks gorgeous, just like everyone hoped. Wes Bentley looks superb as the villainous Blackheart. Peter Fonda is underutilized. And Nicholas Cage. What can can I say about him? He sure can act and he has proved that here also, since he has retained his suave nature. But his physique isn't good enough for action roles such as this. He is losing his touch if he keeps on acting in such movies as these.The background score is decent enough. And even though the screen play was short, it was good. The dialogs were pretty good.

Probably Eva Mendez was picked for this movie just because her looks and her fame, but she does not seem like the perfect actress for this role.

I normally quite like Nicolas Cage, but he really does disappoint in this. He is miscast, you just can't help but see Nicolas Cage and not the character. The plot is so stupid, and stupidly slow. To top it all off there are so many clichés and the bits that seem original are just silly, which all adds up to one pointless film capitalising on the success of other comic book adaptations.

Yes!,"I have been waiting for this film for over 13 years and MSJ delivered a darn good movie. Having kept up with up to date news and the evolution of the special effects, I was a little spoiled. But when the lights went out and the movie rolled, my eyes never once left the screen.By now, everyone knows the story so I won't get into that. What I will mention is that Nic Cage acted spot on (though there were a few instances where it felt jilted, the same for Wes Bentley). The first transformation scene exceeded my expectations (and yes, I saw spoilers for that too) and the Rider's reaction to the cops on the bridge...I won't spoil that, but keep a lookout near that scene for a little chuckle.Oh yes, people laughed during the movie, but none of it forced like some critics would have you believing (though I thought the chimp karate thing was a little awkward). I worried that it would be a little too jokey.Music. Thank God Johnson didn't use all modern bands to date the movie. Listen to the Spiderbait's rendition of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"".

The best example would have to be Johnny's heart to heart with his fist... trying to lure out his dormant powers. This movie had potential. I have come to terms that Marvel movies do nothing for cinema. I hope this movie flops after word of mouth. There were scenes that were so uncomfortable for me to watch, just because the dialog was that bad. "" I'm going to fight fire.... with fire ..."" Wow. The fight scenes were abysmal. They introduce these menacing baddies who die rather quickly, rather pathetically. Johnny Blaze's younger self looks nothing like Nick Cage. Eva M can not act, and you know why she's there.

Its good,"""Ghost Rider"" rides onto the screen with a 6/10 rating, and it's safe to say, it was just okay. Nicolas Cage's performance as Johnny Blaze brings a unique blend of quirkiness and intensity, though the script doesn't always do him justice. The film editing maintains a steady pace, but the narrative tends to lean towards predictability. The film's strength lies in its visually striking transformation sequences and the intriguing concept of a cursed, motorcycle-riding antihero. However, its weaknesses become evident in a somewhat convoluted plot and lackluster villains. The music adds a heavy metal edge, and the cinematography captures the fiery spectacle of Ghost Rider's supernatural powers. ""Ghost Rider"" may not be a blazing success, but it offers a decent dose of supernatural action for those willing to dive into its fiery world.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is just terrible,"That is it. I say it. This movie is just terrible. I have never read the original comic books but if they are as bad as the movie I don't think I have missed too much. I even don't want to comment it but I think I must warn you. Now I have to write ten lines of text...First I will tell you something about the story. There is no such thing here. We have some pathetic excuse of a story which does not make any sense. Believe me, that is the truth. I knew it was not going to be some ""Oscar"" winning screenplay but... Even 'Batman and Robin' had much better story and screenplay.Now I will tell you something about the characters and the acting. It is quite obvious that the makers of the movie didn't know what is character development. They tried to make me care about Johnny Blaze but they failed miserably. And there are just no more characters. About the actors... Cage looks drunk all the time. How could an actor as talented as him act so bad is beyond my imagination. Eva Mendes acts terrible and even looks terrible in the movie. I seriously doubt she is that ugly. Well... At least Sam Eliot looks cool but his character is completely useless.About the action and the effects? The action sequences are just pathetic. I guess you have seen at least one of the new Steven Seagal movies. Well, the action in them is better than the action is 'Ghost Rider'. Much better. As for the effects... Have you seen the trailer? If you have you saw 90% of the visual effects. And the rest 10% are not worth seeing. And the effects in most of the sci-fi or fantasy movies in the past ten years are much better. Ghost Rider looks like he came out from an animated movie, not from a live action one. His bike is just ridiculous also. And demons... They are not even funny.So what do we have.
