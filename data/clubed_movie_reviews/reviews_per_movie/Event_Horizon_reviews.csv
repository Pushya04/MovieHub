Criminally Underrated,"This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. If not for the studio trying to water this movie down, we might be talking about it with the likes of Hellraiser and Alien.I first saw this in the theater in 97 and it has only gotten better with time. Great sci-fi movie with traditional horror elements. The thunderstorms and fog add to the ambience.Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne give fantastic performances that are not reflected in the box office earnings.I wish we could see the original version that had test audiences fainting but apparently the film has been destroyed due to improper storage.Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I would love to see the director/s cut of this.,"Ah test audiences, if not for you, we would of had a way more disturbing and horrific movie. They pick random people, probably a broad variety, but bland as all get out to help the studio execs gut a director's vision. Probably not even horror fans. What we get is good, but the potential is there for it to be way more disturbing, a horror film that is totally fabricated, but still resonates. Though, this one is good as I so enjoy the supernatural and then to combine it with science fiction...awesome!The story, a ship, 'Event Horizon' has disappeared and seven years later as reappeared. A crew is set with the task of going to this vessel and discovering if there is anyone left alive and to salvage the ship if possible. On board this crew, a Dr. Weir, who is the man who invented the special engine used to propel the ship forward. Of course, it does this by opening a black hole and we will learn over time that where it leads, no man should go. As they explore the ship, stranger and stranger things keep happening and hampering any chance of the rescue team making it out alive!I thought all the actors and actresses did good. I knew Sam Neil would be good and so is Lawrence Fishborne. The.visuals are really good too and the film has a very good atmosphere essentially being a spaceship that is haunted. I just think it would have been better with more extended peeks into hell, because who wasn't curious to see what the makers of the film came up with? Unfortunately, they got a squeamish test audience who thought it was too much and us horror fans are left to wonder. Of course, my biggest question is how the heck did a copy of the film with the extra scenes end up in a Transylvania salt mine?So, I liked this film as I have been trying to watch all the supernatural horror in space I can. Got The Dark Side of the Moon too. Wanted Nightflyers, but that is not even on DVD. The only other one I can think of is Lifeforce which does have some cool visuals, but mainly takes place on earth. This one is probably the best of the ones I know, but could have been even better had they left the deleted scenes in.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intelligent scary ride.,"This is actually one of my favorite horror movies. It is smart, scary, and yes, even a little disturbing at times. While some of the ideas behind the science are absurd, that is why it's called science-""fiction"".The cast does a good job in their roles, and the setting for the movie is dark, creepy, and perfectly done.I have read several bad reviews in these comments, and I have seen basically two categories of such. One is that the science involved is ridiculous. This is a movie. A horror movie. A horror movie on a spaceship in the future. I think it's time to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the movie.The second complaint I have been reading is even worse. That the movie is too scary and disturbing! I don't think I have EVER sat down to watch a scary movie and been upset that it was...scary. Perhaps the movie was accidentally placed in the children's section.Regardless, the movie is fun and scary. Exactly what most people look for in a scary movie. I highly suggest renting this gem and enjoying it for what it is: One of the better horror movies of the late 90's.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
90s Gold,"Edge of your seat from start to finish. Excellent cast and score. I heard about this from multiple friends and it definitely didn't disappoint.Event Horizon is a horror sci-fi goldmine. Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne bring the heat in this one. The cold, calculating, tough captain vs the conniving doctor of evil. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Jason Issacs is always a treat and Joely Richardson was an impecable addition.The atmosphere in this one is everything. They pulled no punches in creating some believable space ship tech. I can't imagine how hard hitting this was in the 90s. Makes me wanna give ""Alien"" another go just out of horror sci-fi nostalgia.All in all this is a real piece of 90s gold. It holds up well even today. You really can't miss with a solid sci-fi scare. None of us have been in space so it's easy to let the imagination run wild. Event Horizon is sure to cover any and every fear within the final frontier. Give this one a launch!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good mix of horror and sci-fi,"This film was a lot better than what most people gave it credit for. The cinematography was excellent, and the lighting gave the film a very eerie feel to it. Certainly better than the average sci-fi film. Not only did the film mix two mediums almost perfectly (sci-fi and horror), it completed the union almost flawlessly. Not a perfect movie, but then again, Sam Neill was amazing in this film. Virtually all of the technical aspects in the film were top-notch. While it didn't advance the film industry overall, it did make an impact in the sci-fi genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent sci-fi/horror - Underrated,"EVENT HORIZON is a pretty good sci-fi/horror movie which you'll either love or hate. It's a very dark and depressing movie which completely justifies the 'terror' in the tag-line. Perhaps the continuing terror is why some people probably dislike it.As far as I know, most horror movies lack a decent story or decent acting or character development. That's why I'm not into horror movies that much. But Event Horizon has an interesting story that is an ideal and most of all original environment for a horror movie. Even though character development is limited, as the film progresses you'll get to know most of the characters better. Especially Sam Neill's (Dr. Weir) and Laurence Fishburn's (Cpt. Miller) characters.The acting was done very well by most of the cast, most notable Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neill who did a good job. The sets on the other hand are brilliant and creepy at the same time. I would not feel comfortable walking around in any of those rooms, especially the engineering room featuring the Gravity Drive (sphere with 3 magnetic rings within a room filled with deadly spikes on the walls and ceiling). This adds more tension than there already is to the movie which makes the experience only better and worthwhile.The special effects in this movie are quite a treat. Ranging from an external view of the gigantic Event Horizon around Neptune to Dr. Weir and his 'HANDywork' with his eyes.In my opinion, this is a good but underrated sci-fi horror movie with lots of freaky moments that will keep your heart racing. If you like the depressing endless terror, you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs, you'll probably dislike it.For the best experience, watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.Rated 7/10 on IMDb, but I personally would give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hell's Horizon,"'Event Horizon' is very much an atmospheric sci-fi horror. It does not rely on gore (although there is enough of that) but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. Andersen successfully creates a tense, depressing, and claustrophobic atmosphere. The suspense and pace are well maintained. It pays tribute to several movies of the same genre (like 'The Shining', 'Aliens' etc). Character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs do a fine job with what they're given. The sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. The special effects and sound effects are good. The cinematography is superb. The plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. In my view, 'Event Horizon' is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough 'monsters' and 'blood' or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A promising start, but a disappointing end.","The film starts well, and is enjoyable up until right after the crew boards the Event Horizon.After that, it degenerates into a bad copy of several well-known horror films, which all have better gore scenes. The plot disappears in quasi-religious babble, and the impression of a good sci-fi movie disappears.While the first part of the film was good, I was very disappointed by the conclusion.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Save yourself...from hell""","To this day, ""Event Horizon"" is THE scariest horror science fiction film i have ever witnessed!I was 14 years old when I first watched this film on video and to put it lightly...it scared the shiz out of me! I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD (ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand) and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child, too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!Now I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid, cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that ""Saw"" series (when will it end?) is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller, which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.Which is exactly the reason ""Event Horizon"" works. It is a stand-alone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so un-believable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and un-able to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.I really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.If you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped, lying, or talked all the way through it. i suggest a re-watch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions (laptop, cellphone) switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.And if you enjoyed this film, you should also check out ""Pandorum"" as it is also fairly good, though not quite in the same league as ""Event Horizon"".""Liberate tutame...ex inferis.""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Space Madness!,"For context, I'm not a big horror guy, so I usually stick with the older movies; the effects tend to be a bit old-fashioned and it diminishes the shock value. That didn't help a whole lot with this movie though.It's all fun 'n games and '90s sci-fi until the crew actually reaches the Event Horizon - not so much a derelict as it is a demonic spacecraft. After that, it kinda feels like being trapped in an asylum. I don't care who you are, you're never really ready for the sight of a human being with no eyeballs (hats off to the makeup department on that one). To that end, who among us ever thinks ""terrifying"" at the mention of Sam Neill? Well, he certainly is here!I think the real surprise (for me) was the extent to which self-harm was a real scare factor. To be blown out of an airlock or hunted by a creature, yeah those are expected hazards of deep space. But all of the cutting really bothered me.The movie's twenty-five years old and it had me rattled. That's impressive.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decently structured sci-fi horror,"Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality, or anything else, frankly, but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship, which disappeared just under a decade ago, reappearing mysteriously, prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise, so no more will be said. It is all set in the future, as much sci-fi is, and deep in outer space, of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill, as the doctor, and Laurence Fishbourne, as the scout ship captain, so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish, but what else would you expect from an 18 (UK) rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments, and cliched lines, but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round, and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not Your Typical Space Horror Movie,"A doctor who designed the ship and a crew of rescuers are sent to pick up the crew from the space vessel Event Horizon, off the orbit of Neptune. What the rescuers don't know, however, is that the ship is powered by a black hole and is capable of opening portals to other planets or maybe even dimensions. What might have come through?It seems appropriate I chose to watch this after ""Snow White"", the OTHER 1997 Sam Neill horror film (but he's more like the Neill from ""In the Mouth of Madness"" here than the Neill from ""Snow White""). Never a bad time to catch two connected movies back to back.I can't help but compare this film to other Paul Anderson films such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Mortal Kombat"". There is a distinct look he is good at with technology and particularly the costumes. While I doubt Anderson designed the costumes, you get a sense he likes characters with jumpsuits. If I had to guess who directed this film without knowing, Anderson would be my first guess based on his scenery alone.Paul Anderson also loves the techno-industrial music in his films (Orbital, The Prodigy, KMFDM) -- he's like a more lighthearted David Fincher in this way. I grew up on industrial music, so this really works for me. But also, I see metal or more specifically industrial crucial to good horror -- to really make the point, see Charlie Clouser's contributions to ""Saw II"". The whole violence and alienation vibe that is given off by industrial is very appropriate to horror.The film in general is very likable. Sam Neill is an amazing actor, Laurence Fishbourne (after being Cowboy Curtis but before being Morpheus) is wonderful. And there's a sense of gore that is more hinted at than shown (most of the gore scenes are very quick, leaving an impression on your mind for you to create your own imagery). Many horror space movies are just really stupid (do I need to mention ""Leprechaun in Space""?) or follow the same paths, but this one really stands out as unique. It needed both the horror and space aspects to work.I could compare this to ""Doom"" (the game or the movie) with the portal to Hell in space... but I won't. Or how about comparing it to ""Solaris"" (George Clooney's only bad film) with the images of dead friends coming back to life? This is vastly superior, by far. Really, I can't stress enough how awful ""Solaris"" is.The inclusion of the tesseract is really great. I don't think they used the word ""tesseract"", but they used the idea. I grew up with ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and another book about tesseracts (or, more precisely, wormholes since ""tesseract"" just illustrates extra dimensions and not so much how to travel through them) and this always gets me pumped. If such things are really possible, the future will be awesome.Well, anyway, if you're looking for a horror film that's unlike all others you've seen -- but good -- this is a wise choice. Sam Neill cannot steer you wrong, and the elements needed for a good movie are in place here. It's not like the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror, but maybe the ""Jurassic Park"" of horror. Check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbingly Good,"I tried to remember the last time I found myself scared or disturbed by a movie. It was so long ago in fact that I simply couldn't recall. I was 35 when I first saw this movie; after it had finished I felt like I was 10 years old and had just finished watching an old scratchy B&W werewolf flick.It had been so long since I had truly been disturbed in a scared way I'd almost forgotten what it felt like. Schindlers List troubled me, but not in this way, this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded, I'm still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!I love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that, ""Oh my God!!!!!!"" look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie, you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is.YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
So brilliant its hard to believe Paul Anderson directed AVP.,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made! I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi even though it does pay homage (or some would say rip-off) to many of the greats, such as Alien and The Black Hole. This is a pure horror film and also has a b-movie charm. This is the kind of movie William Castle would be directing if he was still alive today, but much better! It is the best haunted house movie of the lot, but its set in a spaceship.OK, the movie doesn't have the most complicated plot or character development, it works because of the atmosphere and Paul Anderson has pulled off a one-trick pony here. The atmosphere in this film is so friggin brilliant that you forget you're watching a movie and it physically affects you! James Cameron and Ridley Scott reached this level of brilliance in the Alien films and David Fincher with Seven.I've seen this movie over 20 times. It is incredibly entertaining, with fine performances, amazing special FX, one of the best and creepy music scores ever, the best space production design ever, the best subwoofer explosions, the best cinematography, energetic and brilliant direction...I could go on....It's also become a bit of a cult classic nowadays. I've loved the film since it was first released and every friend I show it to agrees and considers it a sleeper. It is also one of the only films I know that induces fear into the audience and provokes them to curse in awe. Every time my mates and I watch it, we are gobsmacked in its craziness! 10/10 - Easily in the top 10 horror films of all time! One of the most entertaining movies ever made. Paul Anderson has never surpassed this film and it will be the one he is remembered for.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sci-Fi Shock sensation,"Its not the best film I've seen yet this was the best experience I've had in a cinema. After getting lost & sh*t scared driving around dark English country lanes I arrived at the cinema already in quite a state. And from the moment I heard the rocking Orbital opening track I was transfixed. I was in the perfect mood to watch this film and it delivered more than I could have hoped in a cinema experience. After repeated home viewings it does lose its shock factor yet it is still a great film, though I have to add it really was meant for the big screen. The sets are great, the gore is shocking & the ship design is truly beautiful. Admittedly the Event Horizon borrowed its look from '2001' yet they took that long majestic shape & gave it a more modern gritty feel. A few bits of ham acting (listen to when Richardson says ""the hulls been breached"") didn't detract from this excellent Hellraiser Vs 2001 style flic. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up.10/10 for the Cinema experience.8.5/10 as a complete film",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Always a good watch,Always really liked this film since it first came out its dark scary like a kinda if hell raiser in space voyage.. all the acting is acceptable. The settings and effects are good especially for the time. Tbh things back then are better than now. I think watching this alone at night is best to get the most of the eerie effect & the terror of the unknown.. its said there was edits mainly of I think a extended version if of the log of previous crew which I wish we had as this film and premise is something that you wish you got even more a peek at into the terrors. Sadly I heard the edits had got lost such a shame so no directors cut.. Honestly rewatching this now for the first time in a long time ive realised out of all the crappy remakes OR long over due sequels we get now.. with the right writers this probably could have had a amazing sequel over where our wonderful Mr Fishbourne went.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"They can keep the money, I just want my time back","How in blue hell did this movie get released?  There seems to be no point to it except for scenes of intense gore, violence, and torture.  Like everyone else says: it started with some promise, but shot after shot after shot of nothing but torture, dismemberment, maggots, and sharp spikey things made this movie unwatchable.  I like a good horror film as much as the next person.  But this has a LONG way to go before it's a bad horror film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, but could have been so much more","Originally conceived as THE SHINING in space, by the end I think EVENT HORIZON has become more like HELLRAISER in space, although of course one of the later HELLRAISER movies was just that. This is an intriguing and interesting sci-fi/horror movie that initially feels like an ALIEN clone before becoming something else quite different.The problem is that the story is sadly flawed, spending too much time on all-too-familiar situations and not enough time on the true horror envisaged by the screenwriter. It seems to take the crew an age to get to their destination, and even when stuff is finally happening, the ending is quite choppy. Apparently, 20 minutes of violent footage were excised after a poor reaction from the test audience, which I think is a real shame.Another problem lies in the choice of director Paul W. S. Anderson, who is and has been one of the worst directors working in Hollywood in recent years. This and DEATH RACE are the only films I truly like of his, and even in these two movies his direction is poor and over the top. The laboured comic relief is particularly noticeable here.It's a pity, because the story has real potential, with undertones of Clive Barker and H. P. Lovecraft on occasion. The cast is decent too, with nice performances from the reliable Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, as well as turns from the underrated Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs. I hope that an extended director's cut may surface one day and add more to the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dark and Rather Brave Film,"Event Horizon (1997)*** (out of 4)Dark and sometimes disturbing mix of sci-fi and horror about the spaceship Event Horizon, which went missing shortly after its mission. Seven years later it reemerges so a rescue crew goes after it trying to figure out where it's been the entire time. I saw EVENT HORIZON when it was first released and really couldn't understand why it gained so many negative reviews. There's no question that the film contains some flaws but it's also a rather ambitious film that relies just as much on its story than just the special effects. I thought director Paul Anderson did a fantastic job early on really making the viewer feel uneasy. There's a brief line where a crew member talks about how far they are from safety and this scene perfectly builds up a rather dark tension because you realize that these people really are on their own with no one to help them. The entire atmosphere of the film is incredibly dark and while I'm not going to give anything away, what the story attempts to do with where the ship has gone was rather unique and I think that for the most part it works. Now, if you've ever heard of this film then you know about the various issues it ran into during the test screenings. There's been talk of a director's cut, which I think might help out many of the flaws. The story takes us to a rather dark direction but it just seems as if something is missing. There are a few questions that need to be answered and there are a few things that don't make much sense but perhaps these were forced to be left on the cutting room floor. If so, hopefully we can see the complete version at some point. Another thing that works here are the extremely strong performances with Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson delivering great work. The special effects are also another major plus including an incredibly beautiful opening sequence as well as the effects really making you feel as if you're in space the entire time. Some have been critical of some of the graphic and bloody violence but I thought it actually played well into the story and didn't take away from anything. As it stands, EVENT HORIZON is a rather brave but flawed film but hopefully a complete version will give us a better look at what it was really trying to do.",,Anonymous,Horror

Great suspense,"Event Horizon brings two kinds of fear to the table: Being millions of miles away from civilization in outer space, and being haunted by an unknown force. The movie starts off great with some good tension building. The tension has a steady line upwards, that makes you interested in the developments until the end. The characters are well written with most of them having a motivation for their actions. The the downsides are that the movie feels a little dated, but with limited special effects and most practical effects you hardly notice it. The story also contains some cliche moments, but nothing too bothersome. I would've loved to see the directors cut, but i'm afraid that that is gonna stay wishful thinking.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good sci/fi horror mix that does more than jump scares or lots of clichés,"I've never written a review before on IMDb but I had to write one for this movie, I thought it was a very standout movie for its time. I'm not a fan of horror movies not because they scare me but because of reused clichés and cliché characters.It might not seem like a very important movie based on ratings or it's own trailer but I felt there was a great mix of atmosphere ,survival, horror, suspense with Sci/Fi bridging a gap to a touch of super natural(depends on how you view the outcome as it could just be Sci/Fi only) I felt the movie didn't go crazy with jump scares , it creeped me out but provided an entertaining premise as well. I'd highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it unless you're not a fan of Sci/Fi or survival",,Anonymous,Horror
Event Horizon A Spooky Horror Thriller With Some Flaws,"Event Horizon is a spooky horror thriller with some flaws from director Paul W.S. Anderson whose admirable in making this movie about a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned with someone or something on board lurking in the shadows waiting for it's chance to strike. The movie is suspenseful, with some gruesome deaths, and solid performances by the cast. But there are some flaws that weigh the film down. I'll get back to that. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Laurence Fishburne as the hero, Sam Neill in a rare hero/villain role, Joely Richarson, and Kathleen Quinlan. Jason Isaacs, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, and Jack Noseworthy are effective as the supporting characters but some of them lack development because their roles are cut short. The special effects are impressive and the film does offer enough suspense but the ending wasn't the greatest. If they had changed the ending somehow it would've been a little better. There was some suspense but there could have been more and there weren't any real scares except for a couple of them. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered except for a few brief explanations from Neill's character about how the drive works and where it could have taken the other crew. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a clearer explanation to what exactly happened. The deaths however were well executed and brutal. The brief glimpses of people being tortured in grotesque ways were graphic and realistic. Neill's character was right when he says, ""hell is just a word the reality is much much worse."" Well his character was definitely right which doesn't mean good news for Laurence Fishburne and his rescue team who have responded to Event Horizon's distress beacon. Despite some flaws Event Horizon is still a decent horror thriller with enough gruesome deaths, suspense, and good performances by the cast that's sure to please most fans of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
just what i was looking for,"Event Horizon isn't a typical alien like slasher where each cast member gets picked out one by one, the killing doesn't start until the last chapter and there are no aliens in this movie (for the most part). The movie more focuses on what happened to the titular ship, it's crew and the mystery of it's transportation method. Ignoring couple of weird sound effects and weird line delieveries in the final fight the atmosphere is great, it's that claustrophobia and fear of the unknown that is expected from sci fi media. As for the characters, they're alright but i would lie if i said that i haven't forgot or mixed two of them with each other. Overall it's a good movie and i recommend it to people who enjoy sci fi.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"I don't know what happened here. Despite a strong cast, the story or better this movie goes nowhere. I was ""glued"" to the screen in order to see when this movie would ""take off"", but nothing happened.

Now, I *am* a scifi fan of the genre, but please do stop making movies that haven't a good story behind. A movie is not made only of effects, but also of dialogues, structure and psychology. This one looks like having shred tons of scifi movies and pasted ""something new"" together. Forget this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terror Has Arrived From Afar,A Sci fi thriller with a batch of Horror involving a rescue crew to find out what happened on the ship Event Horizon. The setting is dark and already puts you on edge just by seeing the massive ship.The story becomes more elevating when we learn about what the stranded ships core is used for along with what the characters are going through bizzare physiological events.Fear of guilt is a small but crucial part as to what's happening on the ship and we see what Hell looks like when we design our own portable.Sam Neil portrays a strong but also vulnerable character and Lawrence Fishborne the opposite fighting his own guilt and refusing to allow his past repeat itself onto his current crew.Even though the design of the film is Alien influenced they made it their own vision.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
sci-fi haunted ship horror had potential,"The first permanent moon base is established in 2015 and commercial mining on Mars begins in 2032. In 2040, research vessel Event Horizon is launched. It disappears past Neptune. In 2047, spaceship Lewis and Clark is sent to investigate. The crew consists of Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones), and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs). Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) joins them and tells the crew about its innovative gravity drive.The design is interesting and this has the potential to be a pretty good sci-fi horror. This is essentially a haunted house but the chaos overwhelms the movie. Sam Neill doesn't really fit as the mad scientist type. That role needs somebody creepier. Captain Miller is too clueless. In fact, Starck is a smarter character and in a better movie, she would be revealed as the lead. This movie has a great cast, an interesting look and great potential. It's too bad that it's not actually that good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Am I really the only person who thought this was the cheesiest movie of all time?,"I have a handful of friends who refuse to watch horror movies because they think they're all pure cheese. Event Horizon is definitely gives their argument some backbone. Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why: - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinemalike, ""Look, a corpse-sickle!""and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.The entire movie is filled with melodramatic scenes. Something bad will happen, then it's accompanied by a laughing man imitating Dr. Eviland everyone still takes him seriously. One of the absolute cheesiest lines is, ""Once you're evil, you don't need eyes . . ."" as Dr. Evil-wannabe cackles in his chair. Sorry, I didn't know I was watching a comedy.There is no atmosphere, tension, suspense, or terror. The movie jumps strait from the opening to the scenes that are supposed to be scary, but never gives you any suspense or atmosphere. The ship is so abstract it looks like one of those play places at McDonalds or something, not a bearer of doom that the movie expects you to think of it as.Why does EVERY sci-fi movie have to rip-off Medline L'Engle's book A Wrinkle In Time, then think it's the first movie to come up with the idea? I could list at least 10 movies that have done that, and this makes number 11. Great, we get it: if you fold space you can go from one place to the other faster. We get it already. Think of something new, please. We understood it in the 60's, we understand it now. What I don't understand is why EVERY sci-fi movie can't think of something even slightly new instead of using the same old tired cliché and acting as if it's the first time we ever heard it.There were at least 5 wake-up-and-it's-just-a-dream sequences in this movie, and every time they just get cheesier and cheesier.I'm not even sure there is more for me to complain about because all that is fresh in my mind is how cheesy Event Horizon was. I cannot remember a single minute of the runtime that I actually found something serious or scary. Sure, I can understand why some people would find this movie scary, because as Stephen King proved hundreds of times, cheese scares people. But for someone like me who is spoiled by truly good sci-fi/horror movies, like Alien, I simply can't take this seriously. The premise is great, but that's all I can give it. I think this movie proves that everything Paul W.S. Anderson turns to cheese. If he directed it, even if it's somehow acclaimed, don't see it.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary Stuff,"I watched this film alone the other night, not realising that it was a horror film. How wrong was I! I am not good with scary films at all so this terrified me!

Bad points are too much gore, too much blood and it's a little confusing. You never really find out where the Event Horizon went to, this other dimension of pure evil, and I still dont understand what happened to Sam Neill's character!

Underrated Flawed but Great Film,"I wish there was some more added tension and not as much bad CGI. The practical effects were really impressive and the the way the shots were blocked, I just wish they'd done more of that.

Perhaps his best,"Like the other genres, horror is not limited to being done one particular way, or any single type. Too bad W.S. has yet to look beyond... this. Here, it truly starts out well. I watch more or less everything he's been involved in, but I haven't spent a lot of money on it, several of them were lent or given to me by acquaintances. He leaves something of a finger-print on anything he's done(harshly put, some might say that once you've seen one of his... yeah), and with both the actual quality and the audience response(they don't always go together), it's odd that he keeps getting to direct. But before its drowned out entirely in something of an ocean of blood(oh how I wish that was hyperbole... something else that's evidently alien to him is the concept that less is more), this has merit. The whole thing is pretty much bathed in CGI, mostly well-done. Some of it is there to distract and show off. The humor isn't bad, and it's seldom forced. The plot is reasonable, and the concept certainly is interesting. The pacing is OK. Acting varies, some of it is relatively good. The effects tend to be great. The film is just uneven... where it starts with hinting, and at least some measure of build-up(which Anderson seems to have since just about completely abandoned), it ends with a comparatively inordinate amount(if they were going for contrast, they missed the mark) of gore, at times grotesque. I'm not saying there's something wrong with that style, the main thing here is how it doesn't fit with the rest, and the overall issue is that this appears to be the only kind he'll make. Throwing violence mercilessly at the viewers, underlined with loud heavy rock. This is, or can be, scary, and unsettling. It just doesn't deliver what it sets up as what is to come... maybe Paul got bored half-way through, and subsequently made whatever was left of the flick the way those of us who've seen at least two are used to him doing this. The references herein would be better received in a more expertly done piece. I recommend this to fans of Paul W.S. Anderson and his work. Failing that, those who like their movies more or less laced with guts. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hellraiser meets Alien in a Kubrikesque way,"We need a director's cut!! Great movie, is more about characters secret fears and explicit hellish imagery, all this with a sci-fi bias (black holes, space travels, all that toing wrong). If you hear once stories about the Hadron Collisioner, this is the movie that came close to that! But in space. The weakness was all happens, maybee, to fast, specially with the Sam Neil character. It could be more! Like a Pinhead in space, exploring more in his past, is just too weak and secondary until it blooms. Laurence Fishburne was amazing! Not strange if this was the rol that justifys his Matrix rol as Morpheus. Such gravitas Mr. Fishburne. Excellent, i recomend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such sights to show you.,"'Alien (1979)' meets 'Hellraiser (1987)' is perhaps the only way to describe Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Event Horizon (1997)', a slow-burning sci-fi horror movie in which a rescue crew travel into deep space to board the eponymous ship and save its crew after the long-missing vessel reappears while broadcasting a disturbing distress signal. The first half of the flick is shrouded in mystery, with its cast of characters travelling to the Event Horizon and wandering around its hollow halls and blood-slicked medical bays. The movie has a distinct, dread-soaked atmosphere to it even before its two major inspirations start to intersect. Its setting is really enigmatic and, despite literally being empty, has a sort of life of its own. It gets into the characters' heads as soon as they step on board, prompting horrific hallucinations and the realisation that all is not well here. As does a gruesome video that the crew unscramble around halfway through the film, causing the captain to rightfully claim ""we're getting... off this ship."" The film isn't infamous for the gore that's in it, it's infamous for the gore that isn't. Apparently, the original 130-minute cut that was test screened made people so uncomfortable that some of them were fainting in their seats; needless to say, the studio didn't like that. The piece was cut to remove most of the blood and viscera, as well as a good chunk of its runtime, but thankfully its spirit remains intact. In fact, the reduction in violence perhaps makes the horror even more effective. Presenting quick flashes of brutal mutilation tricks your brain into thinking what you've seen is much more graphic than it is (though, make no mistake, the moments we do see are certainly graphic) and allows the piece to have a much more cerebral effect, which is what it's going for overall. It works really well, actually, and doesn't feel like it's missing anything in the death department. Of course, the movie has its issues. Firstly, the characters are quite flat and the plot is noticeably thin. The slow pacing doesn't do the barebones narrative any favours, either. There are also some further pacing issues that reduce the impact of certain characters' arcs due to the fact that they're more rushed than they ought to be. It's only ever so compelling overall. Still, it's certainly engaging for its majority. It's an entertaining and somewhat distinct entry in its genre that has a good handle on its material.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's a difference between darkness and blackness.,"Darkness is frightening, because we don't know what it contains.  Blackness isn't frightening - it's just ugly and off putting, like the flourescent greens that also figure so heavily in the colour scheme, like the sudden loud noises and the lascerated flesh.  ""Event Horizon"" doesn't know the difference between scary, startling, and sickening.But what makes the film really bad is the complete absence of characterisation.  How many people were aboard the rescue ship to begin with?  Five?  Ten?  If only I'd counted.  There's the ship's hubristic scientist - so utterly lifeless a hubristic scientist that I bet if you were to tap him on the shoulder and ask, ""Why did you do what you just did?"" he would look puzzled and reply, ""Because I'm the hubristic scientist."" Similar remarks apply to the jivin' black guy, and to the tough but capable captain (although he, out of everyone, comes closest to being an actual character).  Everyone else on board is utterly unmemorable.  Is this better, or worse?  Hard to tell.  I think Laurence Fishburne's captain is easier to take than the average faceless crew member; Sam Neill's scientist is much harder.Don't think for a minute that I'm blaming the actors.  It's the script.  No more than half of the lines CAN be delivered with conviction, so no more than half are.  The cast spends most of its time shouting at one another, explaining things (in a sort of a way) to the audience, and wandering off suddenly to investigate this or that without telling anyone only to come back having forgotten whatever it was they had been doing before they left. It becomes tiring after a while, watching conversations you know won't lead anywhere because they'll be forgotten as soon as the camera turns to something else.P.S.: I can't help noticing that an earlier reviewer tells us that if we don't want something scary and suspenseful we should watch ""Bambi"" instead. He can't have seen ""Bambi"" recently.  Concede for the sake of argument that ""Event Horizon"" is scary; still, ""Bambi"" is far more suspenseful.  One cares whether or not Bambi survives.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hell in space,This film is the child of Aliens and the shinning.

"Although flawed, ""Event Horizon"" is still entertaining with great production design.","The sum of its parts are better than the whole, but ""Event Horizon"" features terrific Producrion design, strong visual effects and performances that drive the film.

It also doesn't make sense as to why Weir (Sam Neill) doesn't mention the delusions he has on the ship (acting as if nothing is happening) doesn't share what is happening to him. Is he in denial? It might have been interesting to find out a bit more about that and what drove his wife to suicide.End of SpoilersThe deleted scenes (some of which exist in low quality video) would have helped the film providing us with more background info but, as is, it's still entertaining with a brisk pace.Although far from perfect, this is one of Paul W.S.

An underrated gem...,"Director Paul Anderson has let me down on a number of occasions but Event Horizon is not of of them. In fact, this entertaining adventure in space is his best film.The main reason Event Horizon is such a success is that it visits many genres, jumping nicely from one to the other. At its heart is ""horror in space"". Science-fiction with overtones of HP Lovecraft and Clive Barker. But the key to Event Horizon is that it always aims to entertain and never takes itself seriously. We don't dwell too much on the science, it's just made as evocative as possible for the story to work. The characters are sketched just enough for us to care about them, but Anderson is aware this isn't a character drama, so again doesn't lose too much time with sappy backstories. It helps that the cast absolutely rocks. The brilliant Sam Neill, Larry Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and the very underrated Jason Isaacs. Despite the high tension and graphic horror, Even Horizon even has well-placed humorous bits, thanks in great part to the character of Cooper (played hilariously by Richard T. Jones).The architecture and science behind the ship (called the Event Horizon) is simply beautiful and great and contributes to the thrill ride. The ship itself becomes a character. The direction itself is a little sloppy. Some scenes rather uninspired and the editing a bit sloppy. Anderson hints in interviews that the film needed to be rushed due to studio pressure and since a lot of footage has apparently been lost, no true ""director's cut"" will ever do it proper justice.What we are left with is a movie that is too entertaining to pass, especially for fans of horror and sci-fi. Repeated viewings show that the film has very few dull moments. A solid and unique entry that inspired subsequent films (such as Sunshine).Highly recommended if you do not take your sci-fi too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very atmospheric space horror.,"The crew of a small ship set off into deep space to recapture the Event Horizon, a ship that's lost in the darkness of space, a ship that's been into a black hole, and returned.The movie is incredibly atmospheric, even after all these years it holds up very well, the ship looks great, well designed with strong production values. The music is particularly good, again adding to the sense of fear.It has some pretty good special effects, sure it rattles a little around the edges, but it was made back in 1997. There isn't an over reliance on gore, but there are some rather grim scenes.I'm a big fan of Joseph Richardson, but she somehow looks and feels a little out of place in a sci-fi movie, I couldn't really buy into her character, talented actress though she is. The real star of the show is Sam Neill, who is definitely a cut above, he's cool and menacing, he has a real screen presence.I'm surprised at just how much I enjoyed watching it once again, it's a film that stands up well to time.Unsettling and disturbing, Event Horizon ranks as something of a sci fi classic.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Looked Slick But Turned Out To Be No 'Alien',"Once I started watching, In some respects, this film started to remind me of ""Alien,"" except it obviously wound up quite a bit inferior to that famous sci-fi-horror thriller.Since it was made about 18 years after ""Alien,"" this movie features more special-effects and some high-tech visuals but it doesn't have the suspense nor the overall cinematography nor the cohesive storyline of the latter. Both movies have the same crude, profane, low-class astronauts that you would never see in real life.

so good at points that it's a shame when it isn't near the end,"This is another of those movies I saw in pieces on TV, which frankly isn't giving Event Horizon enough of its due. It's probably the only Paul WS Anderson movie I can think of that truly deserves your attention to be WATCHED from start to finish, not looking away, not distracted, because it is aiming to be a serious science fiction movie, with some horror elements. And finally seeing it from start to finish I came to the conclusion that, yes, it is Anderson's best... and at the same time it also has derivative aspects, not inherently negative against the movie per-say, and a clever concept (a space ship that takes the emotional readings of its occupants and proceeds to f***-up and/or kill its inhabitants), but near the end it falls apart not so much in script but in execution.So, this is good. At times, it's very good. The set-up is a mixture of, to me, Alien AND Aliens, to varying degrees (and maybe, as Roger Ebert reminded me of in his review, Solaris): Doctor Sam Neill is on a mission to go back to a vessel he had a major part in shaping, the Event Horizon, which has gone past the reach of central space command or whatnot in the orbit of Neptune, and he has made the crew of the Lewis & Clark, led by Captain Laurence Fishburne and including crew such as Jason Isaacs and Joely Richardson, to go with him to find it and what happened to the crew of the ship (there's a recording that sounds extremely distressing). I like sci-fi like this, where the characters talk salty to one another, and you get the chemistry between the characters (and actors most especially) in these early scenes. I genuinely cared what would happen to them, which is a credit to Anderson in the casting.And this has that moment that explains how to bend/travel through space with the paper that you can poke a hole through one end to another, which is so neat! Things like that always spark my attention, and for the first half of this, as derivative as it is in some of its look and the fact that, in its way, this time the alien/aliens ARE the ship itself, it's different and compelling in how it traces the inner fears and phobias of the characters, reaql traumas (i.e. Kathleen Quinlan's disabled son), and manipulates them literally to death. That's all fine, and there's even one genuinely great, masterfully done scene where Sam Neill's doctor has a ""meeting"" with his dead naked wife in a bathroom. That is creepy, if not outright scary, and it ends in a cinematically satisfying shot.But there's also a feeling that the movie could go into more, like what really *is* in that other dimension or other place the Event Horizon has been to, what it means to go into that ""other"" side that Sam Neill seems to know about but is cagey in revealing. More than that though is how Anderson slips the tone in the final stretch, this is what made me realize it wasn't *as* good as I was hoping for: when it finally comes to bringing some action and gore, where Fishburne has to preserve his (dwindling) crew and ship, he goes into filmmaking pyrotechnics of a sort that's distracting and moments and lines even from Neill, who is so good here, that becomes funny in an unintentional way. I found myself stifling laughter in a packed theater seeing parts of this ending (some parts are more intentionally funny, with the black astronaut who has to use his boosters to get back to the ship and says 'motherf***er' every other word, and... it feels organic to him!) and could predict so much of what was about to happen. After a set up and partial pay-off that was working and for Anderson to not have all the follow through I hoped for was a let-down.All the same, Event Horizon represents the sort of sci-fi spectacle we don't get in theaters as much as we used to back in the 90's, and in that sense it's easy to take it for granted, how it does dig into ideas of identity and fears and what obsessions draw out of people when traumas are put to full throttle. To put it another way, this is a brainy-dumb thriller, or a dumb-brainy thriller, and it's good. Mostly. When it's trying. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Run It Through A Few Filters""","WTF did I just watch? Hellraiser In Space!The year is 2047 and Dr. William Weir (Sam Neil) is a scientist / engineer on board a space station in low Earth orbit. He has just gotten word of a distress beacon being sent from the spacecraft Event Horizon in orbit around Neptune. He designed the spacecraft and its unique time-and-space-bending engine core gravity drive and sent it on its way seven years ago. Then he lost contact with it and it was assumed all aboard were dead in some tragic accident.Now it seems to have returned, and he's got to get there and see what happened.He catches a ride there on the Lewis And Clark, a ship run Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and a crew of six. Nobody on the Lewis and Clark want to go on this mission because they haven't had a vacation in a long time, so they are less than welcoming when the good doctor boards.They are even less pleased when they get to the Event Horizon and seriously messed up things start happening. Apparently, this engine core gravity drive has opened a gateway to Hell, and each member of the crew is faced with their greatest fears.Random Thoughts:Sam Neil should not have been allowed to run around shirtless. Nobody wants to see that.The ship log on the Event Horizon was on a CD Rom. Really? The prop people couldn't imagine a more futuristic solution to data storage?Why doesn't anyone on board have a gun? The weapons they choose are knives or saws.For the most part the design of the space ship and various props was pretty darn good, but there were several consoles and a scanning device that looked embarrassingly dated and cheap. The same goes with the special effects - most were well done but the ones that weren't really take you out of the moment. The design of the core gravity drive was spectacular. The ""special effect"" of the crew creeping along in zero-g with ""gravity boots"" looked really stupid.When the very handsome Cooper (Richard T Jones) offers coffee to a crew member by asking ""You want something hot and black inside of you?"" I nearly fell off the couch and onto the floor screaming ""Yes! Yes! Lord Hammercy! Yes!"" *fans self*This is a good film that could have been a great film with a little more time, and a bigger budget ... and a little more of the scenes from Hell (it goes by so quickly).

Cult classic,"This is one of the best movies in its genre. Furthermore, the special effects are great. I also like how realistic scenes like the decompression scene are, unlike other movies where one can somehow magically survive exposure in space. This is a hardcore science fiction movie!I honestly do not understand why this is underrated by the critics, this movie is nothing like Hellraiser, its not a rip-off. Actually i found this movie to have been a lot more memorable then the Hellraiser series.Even in 2015 this movie beats other more recent ""so called"" sci-fi movies. If you are a guy like me who grew up reading sci-fi and has a healthy brain (unlike these critics), i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good sci-fi horror that could've been great,"Event Horizon is a prime example of wasted potential. It's a good film that could've been a great one with stronger scares and a longer run time (studio intervention is the worst). It's the kind of film begging for a remake or a director's cut so that the high concept idea of a haunted house in space can reach its full potential. However, it's still a mostly gripping sci-fi horror with highly unsettling gore in its current form.One of the biggest issues with it in its current form is the pacing. Usually a tight 90 minute run time is always ideal but this needed to be longer with a slower pace so that a sense of unease could properly build and the looming peril could be more palpable. Instead, it moves too fast which results in a film that's never boring at the expense of its characters' descent into madness.Sam Neill is the person most affected by the rushed pacing since his character's motivations change in a way that feels random and yet he's still able to make it work with a very unsettling presence. Lawrence Fishburne is great as a stern captain who excels at tough love and the rest of his crew has a believable bond even if Richard T. Jones as the comic relief feels like he's in a completely different film.Paul W. S. Anderson's direction is really good even with major flaws. A lot of his horror is pretty bad since it's just a bunch of cheap jump scares but they're counterbalanced by all the gore which is suitably disturbing even in brief flashes. The visuals are great, enhanced by the set design which is amazing in how dirty and detailed it is, even if some of it is so close in its love of Alien it could be considered derivative.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A spaceship crew boldly go where only one ship has gone before...and not returned,"Ignore the negative reviews about Event Horizon. It's a cracker of a movie. Great performances from all involved, especially a very young looking (hello to) Jason Isaacs.Event Horizon is the name of a spaceship that is lost in space, far far away. Sam Neil plays the scientist guiding the hapless crew to the vicinity of a distress signal. Then lot's of stuff happens (no need for a 'spoiler alert').I can't believe that so many IMDb'ers are so down on this gem of a sci-fi flick. For me it's imaginative, well paced and ahead of the wave in terms of many more recent sci-fi/horror attempts.Give it a chance, if you're a real sci-fi movie fan you won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Spooky, Creepy","This is the SCARIEST movie I have ever seen, and it still haunts me. The imagery is still very vivid in my mind. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that actually made me cover my eyes. The fact that they keep showing the same images didn't help! The movie was hard to follow at times. But it's not especially the type of movie that I wanted to rewind and go back to certain scenes just to make sense of the current scene. I guess I just didn't expect it to end up the way it did. You always find the alien and kill it, and everything's better, or at least until he sequel comes out. :) I think the reason it creeps me out is because what they find is not an alien or something they could kill, like in most horror movies you watch, but evil itself, incarnated in the characters fears - creepy stuff.

Hellraiser in Space,The film is fantastic scary and shocking. It hits all the right notes without slipping to far into the films other films clique's. The real bugbear I have is that the director was not allowed to fully realise the film to push the extreme horror that is required to really give you an idea of the hell they wanted you to see. There was footage that was filmed but was shot but was forced to be cut by studio executives. Especially the depictions of hell and where they were going!!The footage has been reportedly lost which is a pity I would liked a full directors cut of this movie and show that Paul Anderson can make really scary sci-fi!!I believe the cutting of this movie really scarred him and forced him to make overly sanitised versions of Resident Evil just to please studio executives but at the cost of unique and yes disturbing films but let's face it they are not and should not be billed for kids.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Non-Event Horror,"For some reason this poorly-made film has a rather large cult following. I can't understand why.Initially a rightful flop at the box office in 1997 it found an audience on VHS and latterly DVD and Blu-ray but only the 97-minute theatrical cut (fade out at 91 minutes) has ever been made available. Quite strange for a epic sci-fi horror.It turns out that Paul Anderson thought he was directing a movie that would be as revolutionary as Ridley Scott's Alien was back in 1979 and when he turned in his first 130-minute cut of the film it was painfully obvious that his effort and ability to make a solid horror film were sorely lacking. Paramount cut more than half an hour of footage and released it as a crash-and-burn flick with little fanfare.That's the real story behind Event Horizon. Over the years Paul Anderson has blamed the studio for the film being a tedious bore but it's all down to him and his approach to this lame material which is full of the easiest, EASIEST stinger scares, weak direction, and a superficially ambiguous script that he thought he could go all out with.Even with very low expectations of Hellraiser/Haunted House/Generic Slasher-in-Space tropes you'll consider doing the dishes or the ironing before the movie is halfway over.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You know nothing. Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse.","Event Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy. Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...It is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a ""who is going to get killed and in what order"" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.A great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its ""B"" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.Smart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tries too much, achieves too little","OK so first of all, this movie has the effect of keeping you glued to your chair while your watching. But if we look at it from a critical perspective we can see that it isn't that great.The films tries too accomplish several things, but in the end it fails. It tries to be both subtle and direct, but it ends up as being too direct and too over-the-top (too much unnecessary gore). It somehow tries to merge religious and scientific ideas, but it does not finish the job. The ideas presented are too blunt, too rough to fully understand and swallow. Too much Clive Barker and too little Lovecraft, if you know what i mean.So what is the result? A have baked film, with a lot of gore, a couple of scary moments, a wide range of scientific and religious ideas (taken from horror writers) that don't mix very well, which starts out excellent but ends up as being over-the-top, and concluded with a weird ending.It's not a bad film, it will entertain, but it feels like it could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Horror if you get past the silly parts,"This is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while, it's genuinely suspenseful and creepy, and isn't afraid of being gory when it needs to be. There aren't enough gore-fests anymore. It reminded me a lot of a spaceship version of Hellraiser, though not quite as good as that one. There's a lot of plot holes and silly stuff here, but none of that bothered me cause the movie was done well enough to suspend my disbelief. The only part that I couldn't buy into was the way the ship decompressed at the end: The air and everything else would've been sucked out a lot faster and more violently than it was. I really liked the style of the film, very gothic and reminded me a bit of Alien. Basically this is a good horror movie, not very intelligent for a sci-fi movie tho.

Haunted house movie in space  has good bits and bad bits,"When the space ship the Event Horizon returns, having gone missing, without it's crew a mission is sent to investigate.  However the location of the ship is a mystery and strange things begin to happen on board.  When more people begin to die and some begin to change character and hellish visions become rampant Captain Miller begins to suspect where the ship has been.The debut of Paul Anderson as director in Shopping should have told everyone that here is a man who doesn't need a good plot  he only needs flashy visual style to cover the gaps.  Mortal Kombat backed that up and Soldier showed that he can't always cover the gaps!  Event Horizon falls somewhere in the middle.  The plot and action is semi-lifted from various places.  The space stuff seems like Alien, the haunted house stuff and horror is Hellraiser.  That said it still has creepy bits and good bits.The problem is that it doesn't all work and what you're left with is a very gory movie with lots of cool stuff happening visually but not much substance plot wise.  The buildup is good but once it all starts going to hell (literally) in the second half and everyone stars dying, it just because style without bones.The cast help.  Neill is good but hams it up a it towards the end. Fishburne is great throughout and you can't help but like him  the rest of the film may be falling down towards the end but his parts are like stone  solid no matter what.  The rest of the cast are OK but can't compare to either of the two lead men  especially Lawrence.Overall this starts with some good atmosphere but later falls into gore without substance.

Really scary and really gory,"I went to see Grosse Point Blank in the cinema a few years ago and to my dismay found that the showing was already booked out. There was only one other film starting in the next half hour; something called Event Horizon. I didn't have a clue what it was about (it had only opened that weekend) but rather than waste a trip to the cinema I decided I'd give it a go.Jesus, I nearly wept tears of blood watching this film; it was that scary. There were scenes I actually had to look away from because they were freaking me out so much. But I loved it and came out thinking it was one of the best horror films I'd ever seen.I raved about it to my friends and when it came out on video a group of us rented it and settled down to watch. Unfortunately, none of my friends found it remotely scary and I have to admit, as someone else here has already said, it does lose a lot in the transition to video. This didn't stop my friends slagging me relentlessly about being a pussy.So, on reflection, it is a good film; scary and great to look at but not the horror masterpiece I thought on first viewing.

"If Satan was making me speak Latin, I'd rip out my eyes, too.","Event Horizon has the two distinctions of being the only Paul WS Anderson movie that does not feel like it was shat out by a monkey with ADD and smeared onto celluloid, and off being one of the few movies that have genuinely traumatized me. Today, Event Horizon doesn't really freak me out anymore, but it's still an underrated freakout for anyone who hasn't seen it that can accept the weak script and lackluster third act.So basically it's about this spaceship that gets possessed by evil and terrorizes people by making them go crazy or showing them flashes of their friends screaming and being mutilated in some freaky dimension of chaos or something. The flash parts are really freaky, and along with the scene where the ship's log suddenly starts playing by itself without static over what happened after evil took over--it looks like the kind of porn the dark lord Sauron watches, but with tighter editing. By just flashing crazy gory stuff at you, it makes you think you've seen things that are worse than what you have, since most of it consists of people screaming and bloody or nude corpses impaled through the face hanging around covered in maggots. (on second thought, that is freaky) But it tricks you into thinking you're seeing people being graphically dissected and people eating themselves and gay people getting married.A lot of people upon release found it to be really derivative of Alien, among other things, but I don't think it's derivative, because it feels like it's taking place somewhere else in the same universe, which is also how it gets away with having everyone smoke 50 years into the future.The script is lame. ""I'm now walking. I'm now entering the medical bay. I'm now picking my nose."" a lot of the dialogue can be like that. Or there's the other, non-Morpheus black guy, who seems to be attempting to be the best Funny, But Clumsy Negro stereotype in the history of the cinema, and unfortunately he fails because it takes you out of the movie whenever he appears. They might as well have had Paul WS Anderson play the part in blackface. Also, there's a lot of talk about ""hell"" and ""a dimension of pure chaos"", and it all sounds a little silly no matter how freakishly disturbing the visions of it are.The last half hour houses the biggest shocks, for me, but the movie sort of falls apart into a series of action sequences before the big explosion. You know, the kind that happens in any sci-fi horror movie. It's also unfortunate that they turned the Jurassic Park 1 and 3 guy into the outright villain--it's less scary when you can see the bad guy, particularly if he looks like a more lame, naked version of Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies, but with no pins, so he's really just Head, and that's not a cool name for anybody. The whole last half hour reeks of studio impatience and interference. There was originally another half hour that was cut out, and probably contained a lot of stuff that should have been in the movie, but the studio was a jerk and made them cut a lot of the gore, or the ""character"" and ""story development"", you know, things that aren't necessary to Hollywood studios. It's a shame, because with that footage, Event Horizon might have been an actually good movie, and a jewel amidst the chunks of corn in the turd of Paul WS Anderson's filmography.If Anderson made it today, it would be scored entirely with Marilyn Manson, the action scenes would be hyper-edited and incomprehensible, the characters wouldn't even have personalities, and it would end with Morpheus making friends with the evil force so that together they can battle the alien zombies that Anderson felt were necessary to add to make the movie cooler.

"The most frightening,effective and disturbing horror movie I have ever seen","I had extremely low expectations for ""Event Horizon"".The film was made in a period where a lot of filmmakers thought that when you have enough money to use and abuse CGI your movie doesn't need a decent script.With that in mind I thought ""Event Horizon"" was going to be a cliché horror film that makes no effort to build suspense and just throws CG blood and gore in your face.I was wrong.Dead wrong.""Event Horizon"" is the creepiest and most suspenseful horror movie I have ever seen.It manages to create a feeling of dread and foreboding like no other film I have ever seen before.This is due to a combination of great camera-work,appropriate music and(believe it or not) CG.Yes,the CGI is actually used appropriately here,not just added for the sake of it being there.That said,the special effects are top-notch(for 1997).Another thing I liked was that the ship itself wasn't the main threat.It was the characters.They become obsessed with their past mistakes(things they had locked away in their minds and didn't want to remember) and that begins to drive them insane.True,the ship is the catalyst for this,but the focus is more on the characters themselves.This reminds me of ""Cube""-one of my favorite movies.The characters themselves are a bit underdeveloped,but they aren't cannon fodder like in many other horror films.Each of them has their the distinct personality and background information is given about some of them.I think this was alright for the purpose of this film.In my opinion ,if they did add more character development it would have ruined the pacing.""Event Horizon"" is a very well made,but sadly underrated, horror movie.I strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does what it needs to.,"Event Horizon (1997) -The beginning was a tad rushed, which may have perhaps been due to the editing that was considered necessary by the studio.Based on what's left though I can see why they may have considered it too gruesome, but a little bit more context would have been helpful and it didn't need to be so short.Although I don't tend to favour gory bits, I would actually be interested to see what was cut, to see if it would have enhanced or detracted from what was actually a fairly good story.It was similar to a lot of various 'Star Trek' episodes that I've seen from all of the different generations, so I felt that I could recognise the plot easily enough, although it was pretty straightforward anyway.Fans of Horror flicks, might have made an easy comparison to 'Ghost Ship' (2002), but set in space and I suppose it could be compared to 'Ad Astra' (2019) in a lot of ways too, although that film was more artsy and less scary.I have to say that for me, Sam Neill was not the best actor to choose for the role, I'm sure that there were others that could have done it far more justice. I've never been his biggest fan, perhaps with the exception of his performance in 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and it didn't help that he played a dick too, even before events really got going.I always find that I tend to mistrust Jason Isaac a lot in every role he plays as well. The difference being that he's a good actor, quite sexy and has a certain appeal in other ways also.Most of the crew were quite nice to look at actually. I've always loved Sean Pertwee, since I first heard his gorgeous voice in 'Blue Juice' (1995), but Richard T. Jones should definitely have had a nude scene and even Laurence's tush looked good in that uniform and I haven't liked him since he beat up Tina Turner in 'What's Love Got To Do With It?' (1993), so that's saying something.Aside from the fact that I had the horn for most of the cast, they actually played their parts well too, except Sam of course.The film had action, tension and drama. A little bit of humour and even though the more horrific elements were trimmed down, I personally felt a bit disturbed by some of it, so it wasn't too tame. And also, for the mid 90's the special effects really weren't bad at all.I probably won't watch it before bedtime again, because I can't cope with the nightmares and wet/sticky bed sheets, but I will surely watch it again.633.89/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

There are of course terrible attempts by the director to give you jumpscars that rarely work.The story is interesting until the third arc, at that point it becomes crazy as expected and the story loses strength, fortunately the main actors still manage to hold the film to the end
However, the script is very predictable, you know what each character is for, and when things are going to happen, maybe because it's a period film, but it still ends up being a failure.In conclusion, it's a fun film, if you want an older film with CGI that hasn't gotten so rough over the years and a minimally decent plot with famous actors, this could be your choice. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It has such intelligent characters as a Dr/engineer who cannot explain anything scientific, a captain who only can lament and complain, and lacks any qualities of leadership, a crew that must have gotten their intellects out of a cracker jack box. It is chock full of great junk comic book science like: The law of relativity says we can't travel the speed of light, as if they really understand relativity, and of course there must be the relativity cops on patrol, too. How about this great junk science theory: All we have to do to travel in space is to fold space like a page out of a girlie mag, and there we are! Right, every physicist knows that the third dimension is really only the second dimension in disguise, waiting to be folded. It's the kind of science every thirteen year old wishes were true. And then, this most horrible, evil dimension, hiding like a weasel behind a black hole, that gave life to the Event Horizon, looks like second-rate Hellraiser out-takes not scary enough to be left in. I was guessing whoever concocted this pile of bird droppings must be about 13 yrs old, but of course no studio would give millions to a kid on a lark, would it? So it must be the IQ that's 13.

It also uses graphic and sudden gore, this also adds to the unpleasant feeling.

Such a shame Paramount decided to mess with this flick,"Entertaining, wonderfully creepy, and a very intelligent thriller, Event Horizon is an underrated sci-fi gem that is flawed, but ages well still to this day. Event Horizon has its fair share of flaws, which was mainly caused by studio interference of its head company Paramount Pictures. Due to poor test screenings, and its originally conceived NC-17 rating, Paramount forced the film to be cut down in length and in content in order to appeal better to audiences. Little did they know that they basically removed ¼ of a great film, which still happens to be good, but honestly could have been much better, if the edits were still kept in tact. The film has a long history of battling to find its deleted content, with little to no success, and sadly we may never see the original plan intended for this film, but the result is still certainly worth watching. Its performances, for the most part, are incredibly well done- with Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne obviously leading this stellar cast, as well as some good supporting performances from Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs, and Jack Noseworthy. The only performer that seems off in the cast is actor Richard T. Jones, who portrays Cooper throughout the film, and whose take on the character is incredibly silly and out of place. The script, although having a few issues in terms of dialogue, is rather smart- and does an excellent job of conveying the emotion of these characters as well as the peril and fear that comes with this sort of situation. The look of the film can be quite memorable, although the tone may seem a bit grim at times, its visuals can truly be a feast for the eyes- especially when beholding the Event Horizon ship itself. In the end, Event Horizon is a fantastic sci-fi filmed meddled with enough to become just a good one, but what a good one it is!
My Rating: 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good idea imperfectly executed,"I hadn't seen ""Event Horizon"" in over a decade when I picked up the Special Collector's Edition DVD a while ago on a whim. I remembered it as being a pretty good sci-fi/horror flick but I wasn't sure if it'd still hold up. Also, knowing the background of studio interference, I was curious to see what sort of material was left on the cutting room floor.Now, with the benefit of several more years of movie-watching experience, I can see that the movie is highly derivative. But at least Anderson & company chose good films to borrow from. The general concept of a 'haunted house movie in space' echoes ""Alien"" but Anderson has said himself that his main influences were Kubrick's ""The Shining"" & Wise's ""The Haunting"". Though the film blatantly copies scenes from both of these films and at least a couple of others, this general concept invests the film with some degree of originality.That's not to say that the story completely works, though. Some of the details are intentionally vague, which could equally be the result of sloppy writing. The fact that the third act devolves into a fairly standard action movie climax also undermines the careful building of suspense that provides the bulk of the film's memorable moments.As for the cast, it's not bad but most of the actors are shackled by their clichéd characters. Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill are solid as always but this isn't exactly the best material they've had to work with. The rest of the cast also perform their functions well, even if their characters don't offer anything we haven't seen countless times before.In terms of production values, ""Event Horizon"" holds it's own for the most part. Despite being only the second best Paul Anderson working in Hollywood today, Paul W.S. Anderson's direction isn't bad. There are some nice shots from time to time and he does a good job of establishing (and maintaining) the film's atmosphere. The visual effects are generally pretty good, though I was less than impressed with some of the 'burning man' visuals.Ultimately, ""Event Horizon"" has some memorable scares but its shortcomings limit its appeal to a cult following. A director's cut would probably improve matters a little but I highly doubt that the movie would rise anywhere near the level of the films that it imitates. Nevertheless, it is worth watching as one of the better science fiction/horror hybrids out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Relies more on shock and terror than suspenseful horror,"I have mixed feelings about Event Horizon. I liked the beginning when it was ""The Shining in space,"" but I was less impressed when it turned into ""Hellraiser in space."" In the end, this movie seems to rely more on shock and terror than suspenseful horror, which is disappointing - it had the potential to be an intelligent thriller.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incomprehensible Mess,"""Event Horizon"" is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.  Very rarely has so much talent and money been squandered on such an ugly mess of a movie.  The film deals with an outer space crew who is trying to retrieve a mysterious ship which is trapped deep in the outer limits.  The original crew have all been killed and now this crew must find out why.  Why?  Why? Why?  That seems to be the key question of this film.  The screenplay is all over the universe.  It adds elements from films like ""The Exorcist"", ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Jaws"", and just about every other film ever produced.  If one idea had been used throughout, then the film would have been admirable and watchable if nothing else.  However the references to the aforementioned films make ""Event Horizon"" a movie that wants desperately to be good, but just does not have the goods to make that dream a reality.  Turkey (0 out of 5 stars).",,Anonymous,Horror
"Hell is only a word, reality is much worse","Event horizon is full of fantastic acting and amazing sets but is ultimately let down by a few minor issues that stop it from being the masterpiece it really could be. These criticisms do come from a place of love though, the film is highly entertaining and never has a dull moment.I often found myself not fully being able to follow where characters were due to the sheer pace of the editing in the action heavy scenes. I really do feel that this film could have had more time to really soak us in the sheer dread of being locked in a ship far far away. I do also wish we spent a bit more time with the crew, Alien did it best, spend time with the character to let their deaths have more of a emotional impact.However I can't let this detract from the things I LOVE about this film. The set design is just superb. The action is exciting and unpredictable. I was never sure what to fear, but that dread is really what kept my interest. Also the practical gore effects make up for the sub par CGI In the beginning.Overall a quite effective horror with an interesting premise that while it's characters are let down by its break neck pace the positive elements and scope of the films story hold up what could have been a cookie cutter sci-if horror ended up being a rather enjoyable B movie type horror with a story far beyond what I at first expected. I had a lot of fun with this one!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunted spaceship,"A haunted house movie set in a spaceship. Even though I thought similarly about Alien, this is way more proper haunted house stuff with a lot of cliches. The production design and cinematography are the best thing about this movie for me. The psychological aspects of the film felt criminally underutilized as it didn't really feel like going anywhere after the initial one or two scenes. Altogether felt like it would've been better if some aspects were more developed and others trimmed down. It would be good to see how it would've been if we ever got the original director's cut. Not as bad as the original reception but not as great as the fans make it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freaky,"This is a damn good horror movie. It's especially surprising as the director's best movie that I saw before this was Mortal Kombat. Don't get me wrong, Mortal Kombat is cheesy fun but this movie shows that he can actually craft a well made sci-fi horror. The first hour of this movie builds up an excellent atmosphere. The eerie tone and imagery combine to create a genuinely unsettling movie. Then in the last half an hour the movie turns into a very grotesque action-horror hybrid. I still enjoyed that part, however I preferred the slow-moving atmospheric sections as that's the kind of horror that resonates more with me. Now, apparently Anderson's original cut was 130 minutes long and it got the NC-17 rating. I personally think that cut, which is apparently even more gruesome would drag on and lose it's atmosphere in favour of Hostel-like exploitation. For me, it's one of those instances where studio interference paid off as the run-time feels just right. All in all, the movie is a definite recommendation and much more than an Alien rip-off.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
SCI-FI HORROR!,"I will forever mourn the 2 hour cut of this that supposedly went full Hellraiser inter-dimensional sex and gore but the version we've got is still a pretty nasty piece of textured sci-fi horror design work from anderson that owes a lot to Alien, Warhammer and Doom and has enough vividly rendered possessions, mutilations and portals to space hell to keep me coming back to it. Love how much time is spent observing these beautifully designed spaces in carefully considered compositions like the ships heart and the microchip vents in the first half so that we know exactly where every burning, rotting and dissected body is later on. The rapid cut log of the previous ship's crew raping and cannibalising each other is one of the most disturbing things I saw when I was too young.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not for the weak-stomached.  Lots of gore, and intense horror.","After reading a few of the other comments, I decided to write my own. When you go to see a Horror movie, you have to accept the fact that you're going to see blood and guts.  It's not just a few bloody noses here and there. So for those of you who were ""disgusted"" by the gore in this movie...maybe next time you decide to see something in the genre of Horror...make sure you know what you're getting into.  As for myself, and many others who saw this movie, there was plenty of gore (which is a good thing).  The psychological horror was intense, depending on how and where you watch it.  For example, I first saw this at 2 in the morning, with the Surround Sound way up, all the lights off...that added to the intensity.  Some of the plot is pretty corny. But for the most part, it's an original, good old fashioned horror movie. I mean, come on...a dimension that is the equivalent of Hell...what can be more horrifying, besides a sequel to Pearl Harbor? If you're a fan of horror and senseless violence, this one is for you.  If you can't handle blood and guts...go watch Bambi.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sci-fi  that goes nowhere.......,"I have a friend who religiously attends a 24 hour sci-fi festival each February. I was quite surprised that he had not heard of ""Event Horizon"", considering the number of sci-fi's he has seen. With great anticipation we watched it and his reaction was that it was nothing more than a sound and light show, with a non-existent plot, and minimal character development. So the question is, what is the attraction of this movie?

This needs an R-rated re-make,"I've seen this around 4 or 5 times now, first at release and the last time pretty much just finished it.This movie actually makes me sad since it's underdeveloped in almost every aspect.It is weak as a sci-fi movie, it sucks as a horror since it uses only the most obvious jump scares. The pacing and the editing is clunky. When I watched it the last time I caught myself thinking on how each individual scene could've been easily improved. This movie was clearly inspired by Alien, Aliens, Hellraiser and DooM game series (there are even some Doom easter eggs in the movie). Also, it's hard to watch this in 2019 since the effects really don't hold up, some of them look so bad I don't think they were good even by 1997 standards.This is frustrating since the movie has some really good gore (and it obviously had more, but it was severely cut by the studio), and a very distinct style in set (and ship) design. Some of the sets they have are amazing, and even though it makes absolutely no sense in terms of actual engineering it still looks amazing. Very nice craft. The actors did their best with a script like that. I mean, some of the ending scenes are so comical and unintentionally funny you really can't handle those any better.No real point in watching or re-watching this in 2019, but there is a need to re-make this ASAP. I can see this as a kind of slower psychological horror about space isolation with a tint of supernatural. Get a competent director and this would fly for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cheesy 90s Sci-Fi Horror, but nevertheless good!","This movie has it ALL what you'd expect from a typical Hollywood SciFi flick ""back from that time when movies were still..well...good"" :) It is so laden with Hollywood cliches, I had to outright laugh many times. But I did enjoy the flick nevertheless!I can't imagine that someone these days would direct a movie with ""cringeworthy"" cliches like the demonic voice speaking in Latin that is discovered ""after I run it through some filters"", or the cannibalistic horror on the ""last visual contact to the Event Horizon"". Several moments I wondered how the actors could possibly have kept a straight face as some scenes were so utterly ridiculous. Laurence Fishburne fits perfectly as the ultra-stereotypical commander of the ship. Loved it.Despite the clichés I did enjoy the movie.

23 Years latter good movie.,"Some movies age well and this is one of them, a successful horror story in space.The story is somewhat unique thanks to the space aspect and on the other hand is simple and easy to understand, but it is not predictibile that is for sure, it will surprise you all the way, even though it is a 1997 movie.Our Director Paul Anderson was 30 years old at the time and did such a great job with the movie, he insisted to have as much practical effects as possible, his vision of the movie was much bigger around 3h of movie but was heavily cut down leaving us with the question, what would be like. In the extras he mentioned that to make another director's cut now will be a nightmare because all of the footage is on VHS tapes and they might not even exist no more, reason for that is, at the time dvd was not standard for movies and was not considered to keep extra footage for bonus material on disc, and so it probably got discarded.The performance of the actors is excelent, some say the Director will make sure it will be excelent.As expected the CGI effects look dated but the practical effects they held pretty good, and I am glad that the Director chose the practical effects over the CGI witch was in their early stages.The horror aspect of the movie is mediocre by today's standards but the atmosphere and plot held up good more than 20 years later, so I would recommend to watch the movie on a clear sky night with friends that you usually debate subjects.ENJOY!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An severely underated Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"When rating a movie , one must take into account other similar movies and what they have scored . Only through comparisson can you trully appreciate the score you give a movie .

For those of you who have seen this movie and agree with me , i urge you to rate this title properly as to help its rating be equal to the quality movie that it is .

its a keeper.,The first time I watched this movie me and my roommate made sure that we did not leave each other alone in the room unless it was time to sleep. Needless to say someone got locked outside the room and had to sleep in the cold all alone. There are not many good movies out there that can make a cut for a good thriller. This particular movie made it to a fairly good horror range. A very good collection of cast members (Lawrence Fishburn and Sam Niels being my favorites in the team) and a well thought out plot and special effects. Perhaps I am being partial on the special effects since this movie was made during a time where special effects did matter and it was not just computers that did the image trick. The movie did have its share of gruesomeness that did send some shivers down my back. It is one of the classic movies that I definitely want to own and also recommended to watch in groups or with your significant other. Even today I still consider this one of the classics that should be watched. Even though I admit that I cannot see Fishburn in the same serious manner after seeing him as cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's play house (what the hell was that? A gay cowboy?) but he is still one of the most top notch actors that stands side by side with Sam Niels.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Derelict Spaceship Lands in a Haunted House,"There are numerous Sci-Fi films jostling at the front of the pack for the ""Worst Ever' accolade, and 'Event Horizon' should certainly be considered one of the top contenders. Although the film has upscale production values, penny-pinching in the screen-writing budget becomes obvious as soon as the characters open their mouths. The story's introduction reveals an experimental faster-than-light spaceship had gone missing on its maiden flight. Seven years later it has mysteriously reappeared orbiting Neptune, and another vessel is dispatched to investigate.On board this rescue ship, the astronauts are bickering like toddlers long before they arrive at their destination. When an exploratory team ventures into the derelict hulk's industrial-Gothic interior, their intelligence goes into terminal decline as the hack screenplay plunges them into a crude gore-and-horror fest. They start screaming at one another like hysterics, while the soundtrack ramps up the melodrama in a lame attempt to disguise the deficiencies of the material. None of the routine nastiness makes any sense, and the eventual explanation for the vessel's cursed condition is pitifully weak. After '2001' and 'Alien' had shown the possibilities for modern Sci-Fi, 'Event Horizon' is a severe disappointment which gives the entire genre a bad name.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sci-fi horror!!!,"First of all I've like to make it clear that I think Paul W.S. Anderson is an idiot!!! He Has spoiled some of the best film ideas: Resident Evil & Alien Vs Predator.

I think horror films like these a really cool but not that scary. And this is where I think Event Horizon is different. This movie is also good directed, OK acting... but it is also very spooky.

Back to Hell,"'Event Horizon' is yet another piece of hokum which combines the dream sequences of 'Solaris' and the confined setting of 'Alien' which hides behind the fig leaf a scientific title and gains its interest from depicting a future (it's set in 2047) we're already well on our way to reaching.Sam Neill is rather strangely cast as the man who originally designed the craft and the fact he's is still using a cutthroat razor suggests some things still haven't changed for the better, while the frequent use of expletives show that language hasn't developed very much either.The trouble is you've seen it all before and it goes on forever; but it's a handsome production.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Horror Sci-Fi,"""Event Horizon"" is a lot of fun and shows just how versatile Sci-fi, as a genre, can be. Unfortunately, it also highlights the problems with high concept movies if they don't perfectly execute on their ambitions. I'm not gonna lie and say this is a great or important film but if you are one of those people who has a little Venn Diagram space in your heart for sci-fi/horror films then this is a film for you.First off, the production design in this film is stellar (lol get it?). From the bridge of the Lewis & Clark, to the core of the Event Horizon's gravity drive, and to the neon green crawl spaces underneath the core. The locations are not just designed to feel believable, which they do, but also to play into the eerie feeling of the film which they also do, especially the sequence with Dr. Weir (Sam Neill, ""Jurassic Park"") under the core, lights strobing on and off inside the Jefferie's Tubes he is crawling through.The acting is uneven and feels like certain actors were given different ideas than the rest about what the film was about. Sam Neill is great as usual and the cast boasts a stacked cast with Jason Isaacs (""Death of Stalin"") and Laurence Fishburne (""The Matrix"") rounding things out. Most of the time these actors seem to be in a psychological terror movie set in space and discuss the various terrors in their past and what it means that they are seeing hallucinations about them. They have the sorts of conversations that people facing their fears and imminent deaths might have as they parse their own reactions, psychology, and internal movements.On the other hand we have Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, and Joely Richardson, who seem to be in either a disaster film or action movie. Even Larry Fishburne gets in on the action movie vibes as he occasionally channels a hard edged commanding officer who doesn't take no guff and might occasionally have to choose bubble gum or kicking @$$. While these characters may be exposed to similarly terrifying events they seem to handle it more in the cheesy way that 90s action films do. Characters are known to nickname each other things like 'Baby' and 'Mamma Bear' or yell things like, ""I'm gone,"" as they hit a lever that launches them into danger. It feels like half the cast in is the movie ""Alien"" and the other half is in ""Armageddon.""The break down for me is almost that simple. I love the parts of this movie that are horror heavy and am bored by the parts that are action heavy. It doesn't help that some of the graphics have aged more poorly than a person who completed two terms as President of the United States.There's a part of me that thinks that this is a property ripe for reboot/sequel/re-imagining but there's another part of me that fears movie that would try to recapture the magic of this film. I know that for me, the psychological terror aspects of the film are my favorite but that might not be the case for everyone and I'd hate to think that some people who like this movie would be left out in the cold by whoever decided to remake this movie as 'the version they would have liked to see' rather than keeping the messy quality of the original.The messiness actually adds to the film in some ways. It would feel overly contrived to have every single member of the crew wandering around and pontificating to each other the whole movie about the plight of existence and the terror of the unknown just as it would feel untrue to have them all strutting like Space Marines gunning for another trophy. By putting both aspects in the film they both end up feeling more true to life.Unfortunately, my last criticism is also that while it does attempt to do some psychological terror and philosophical musing, the underlying themes of the movie still end up being very muddled. The plot is very by the book and should leave lots of room for character exploration and connection but ""Event Horizon'' leaves these characters as two dimensional stand ins. There is never any doubt about where our main character's journeys end. Almost before they ever step foot on the ship you can go down the line, one by one. Dead, dead by suicide, dead by sacrifice, turned to the dark side; you know it all from the beginning because these characters don't have multiple personality and psychological traits that make them who they are. They are stereotypes with one or two events that have happened to them in the past.All in all, I really like this movie. It's one I re-watch all the time and has a lot of great set pieces and imagery but it certainly isn't the deepest film. However, I don't think that is what most people are after with a movie of this type so I won't let that stop me from recommending it to almost any sci-fi or horror fanatic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of space in hell,"It's been a hot minute since I watched this film and I didn't recall much before rewatching it this year. I feel the premise for this movie is intriguing and has a lot of promise. However I felt there was a lot more that could have been done to make this film stand out from other space scifi horrors.In the not too distant future, a space ship known as the Event Horizon goes missing on an expedition beyond our solar system. When the ship returns, a team is sent to investigate. Among the crew is a scientist who happens to have been a primary designer and engineer of the EH.In trying to determine what happened to the ship and its crew, we learn that the EH is equipped with technology that allows it to create artificial wormholes in order to travel faster than the speed of light by bending space time. Opening these wormholes appears to have horrifying consequences as the rescue mission soon finds out.Again I'll say, awesome premise. Not great execution. The film essentially turns into a cliched space action horror. I felt they could have done a lot more with the idea of a portal to hell being opened. The story is begging for some Lovecraftianism that I just didn't get and I feel it a wasted opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Neill (portraying pure evil, personified) was about as demoniacally frightening as a frickin' tootsie pop, for crying out loud.Set in the year 2047, a rescue mission is launched to Neptune where an exploration ship known as the Event Horizon inexplicably reappears as mysteriously as it vanished 7 years earlier.The Horizon's crew is gone (wait till you find out where), but there's clearly a disturbing presence aboard (a literal understatement) that appears to be somehow connected to some ""black hole"" business which supposedly warps space.Striking set-designs, impressive visuals, and an intriguing premise do nothing to alleviate the sheer boredom, and laugh-ability, that quickly sets in with this decidedly weak, Sci-Fi entry from 1997.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The only issue for me is that the whole thing pretty much resembles an hybrid of borrowed ideas, situations and elements from the aforementioned movies.By the way, I would stick to the dvd or blu-ray version, as the 4K versions may give away too noticeably those 1990s CGI effects and the miniatures.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I went in expecting the typical sci-fi space movie, with the usual alien invasion and the whole ""Save humanity one more time"" sha-bang, but the threat in this movie was something much darker than I would have ever thought. The movie plunges you deeper and deeper into madness. Some scenes are pretty graphical, but the horror of this film relies mainly of the cruelty of the reality presented to you. There's a disturbing logic to this film and unlike other movies of this type, it doesn't leave any questions unanswered. To me, a movie that manages to affect its audience is a movie that succeeds. In this case I was literally shocked, which is good for a sci-fi/horror gig. The actors deliver great performances and the cinematography is also of great quality.

One of the best and serious films of the genre, with famous actors, excellent direction, mystery, suspense and an interesting central idea.

Solid space thriller.,"Continuing a theme of rewatching old horror films, this one perhaps wouldn't spring to many people's minds. Is it old? Well it's not old old, but 1997 is now nearly 30 years ago, which is scary in itself and right from the get go it dates itself slightly, stating colonies on the moon in 2015 and Mars mining in 2032. We're going to be set in space in case you'd not realised. In 2040 the Event Horizon research vessel has lost contact somewhere around Neptune. Now 7 years on we join a decent cast floating in space. Weir (Sam Neill) is a doctor, not really the caring medical kind, being sent on a search and rescue mission to find Event Horizon with a crew of rough and ready spacedogs lead by Miller (Laurence Fishburne). It's a familiar set up, lots of personalities that are clearly going to clash as things start to get brutal and they will get brutal. Before that though, there's plenty of deep space sci-fi eerieness, compounded by a typically 90s ominous score (stick around for The Prodigy on the end credits). Weir has nightmare visions of his wife and the crew are cranky and downbeat. Brimming with positivity it is not. It rides the narrative well though, once introductions are made, we learn that a signal has been detected from the missing vessel, that it turns out is a secret government ship capable of inter-dimentional space travel... no wonder it's lost. Granted it's packed with tropes, but it's very entertaining, at least to begin with. Weir plays the crew the signal he received, thought to be from Event Horizon, a garbled sounding nightmare of screams and a muffled voice whispering ""Save me"" in Latin. They're going to wish they stayed at home. Weir is clearly holding something back and his power struggle with Miller intensifies as they get deeper into space, find Event Horizon and board her without knowing where she may have been for nearly a decade. Wherever it's been, it wasn't a friendly place. Some of the FX look dated, but it's still pretty stylish and on the whole looks really good, well until all hell breaks loose! Things explode, literally, starting a countdown for survival. That's not the pull here though. It's the mystery that makes this tick. ""I need an explanation"" states Miller with that deadpan Fishburne delivery. Man made black holes bending space time, it's intentionally theoretical, you have to strap in and enjoy the ride. Sean Pertwee as Smith and Jason Isaacs as DJ are both great, but there's no fluff. Even Richard T. Jones as the comedic Cooper stays perfectly on track, in what's largely a decent into madness. On release this was pitched on its FX and its sets, a big blockbuster movie and in that regard it fails really, but revisiting it, there's more to it. Yes it's gets a bit weird, but it's a strength if you lean into it. Don't worry about the cast losing their minds, let yours go with it. It's a tale of loss, of hope, redemption and viscous psychological punishment with plenty of gore, plenty of style. A simple idea well executed. It's not much of a horror though and the dialogue is a bit ropey, but it's a good enough thriller and Sam Neill plays psychotic pretty well. Does it lose its way? Yes a little, but still well worth the revisit.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Event Horizon - A Trip into the total darkness of space,"The 'Event Horizon' is an experimental ship that can use a drive to 'fold space' allowing it to 'bend' the rules that govern physics. Unfortunately, the ship 'disappears' on it's maiden Test run - only to re-appear 7 years later near the Planet Neptune. A rescue Team is sent - along with Doctor Weir the designer of the Event Horizon to ascertain what happened.... On reaching the vessel it is evident very quickly that something went BADLY wrong. Soon the rescue Team are fighting for their sanity...
This is a bold Science Fiction film that really 'mashes-up' a few other Films 'The Shining' and 'Alien' immediately come to mind as influences. That this Film chooses NOT to have the usual Alien-type presence is a bonus - instead it goes it's own way into a twisted psychological and visceral horror.There are a number of truly impressive scenes - the initial approach to the Event Horizon - floating in the upper cloud base of Neptune is well done and the design of the production is excellent.In it's present Form and running time it achieves the chills it needs but there was a LONGER version that really went for the blood-soaked maximum of horror before the Studio ordered the Film cut down. It would certainly be interesting to see THAT version as the one we have only hints at the horrors of 'Hell'.

Solid Sci-Fi/Horror Gem despite it's flaws,"'Event Horizon' is an entertaining old school big budget sci-fi horror movie that features an interesting concept, lavish special effects, plenty of gore and disturbing imagery and some effective chills and thrills. Despite the movie's derivative storyline, divisive nature and unfulfilled potential, this is actually one of the better sci-fi horror hybrids out there and didn't deserve the panning it received from the critics upon its release.The Plot = A rescue crew headed by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) are sent to investigate and salvage the long-lost starship Event Horizon, which mysteriously disappeared seven years ago on its maiden voyage. The crew soon discovers the truth behind its disappearance, and it turns out to be even more terrifying than anything they could have imagined.The direction by Paul W. S. Anderson is top notch as uses some brilliant camera techniques to effectively build the tension and suspense which leads to many genuinely chilling moments. The production design is simply breathtaking with brilliantly detailed set pieces and fantastic lighting that generates the right amount of atmospheric dread and unnerving tension. However, despite featuring a strong opening half which slowly builds, but after that the pacing becomes a bit muddled especially during the final act which lacked any real weight due to it being rather rushed and feeling very awkward which I know was down to studio interference, but you can't help but feel a little disappointed after such a fantastic build up. But there's still more than enough to enjoy here and it definitely stands as Paul W. S. Anderson's best work to date (which doesn't say much).The cast here are fantastic with stellar performances from the likes of Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne who play off each other brilliantly and adds plenty of depth to their characters. Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T. Jones, Jason Issacs, Sean Pertwee and Jack Noseworthy each provides great turns in their respective roles.Overall 'Event Horizon' doesn't quite rank up there with other horror genre classics, but it still manages to be a strong effort that's definitely worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is This SF?,"I saw ""Event Horizon"" on video, and I'm thanking myself for not having wasted even more money seeing it at the cinema, while at the same time I'm rebuking myself for having been daft enough to fall for it.The movie is so bad that just by describing what is wrong with it you are already giving it more attention it deserves.  All I can think of saying is that it's crap.  I leave more eloquent comments to those better-qualified critics whose articles you can read on this database  but amazingly enough if you read through them you will even find some neutral, or even positive criticisms.  Some things I just don't understand.What I'd like to say, then, is that I'm utterly disgusted that such a movie can fall under the genre of ""Science Fiction"".  Why?  If it happens in space and you throw in a few mysterious phrases like ""another dimension"" and ""outside the universe"" does it automatically qualify?   Nowadays such stock phrases seem to me to be just a licence to let anything happen, regardless of plotline or logic.  If you don't understand what ""focussing gravitons"" means, I'll tell you.  It means that a lot of nonsensical stuff is going to happen later on in the movie, which one is meant to accept because when you ""focus gravitons"", anything is possible, really.  Space, or science, are clearly just lame excuses here.  It's not ""Science Fiction""; it's ""crap"".And I thought ""Independence Day"" couldn't be bottomed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic sci-fi horror,"""Event Horizon,"" directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and released in 1997, is a science fiction horror film that has carved out a cult following despite its initial mixed reception. Set in 2047, the movie follows a rescue crew tasked with investigating the reappearance of the titular starship, which vanished without a trace seven years earlier during its first voyage.The film's atmosphere is its standout feature, blending gothic horror elements with futuristic science fiction. The design of the Event Horizon itself, inspired by cathedrals and haunted houses, creates a claustrophobic and eerie setting that heightens the sense of dread. The ship's interior, filled with dark corridors and disturbing imagery, effectively sets the stage for the terrifying events that unfold.The cast, led by Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sam Neill as Dr. Weir, delivers strong performances that ground the film's more fantastical elements. Fishburne's stoic and determined captain contrasts with Neill's descent into madness, providing a compelling dynamic as the story progresses. The supporting cast, including Kathleen Quinlan and Jason Isaacs, also contribute to the film's tense and unsettling atmosphere.""Event Horizon"" excels in its use of practical effects and set design, which give the film a tangible and immersive quality. The visual effects, while dated by today's standards, were impressive for their time and still hold a certain charm. The movie's sound design and score, composed by Michael Kamen and electronic band Orbital, further enhance the unsettling mood, blending orchestral and electronic elements to create an otherworldly soundscape.The film's exploration of themes such as the unknown, the nature of evil, and the fragility of the human mind adds depth to the narrative. The concept of a ship that has traveled to a hellish dimension and returned with malevolent intent is both intriguing and horrifying, pushing the boundaries of conventional sci-fi horror.However, ""Event Horizon"" is not without its flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, with certain story elements feeling underdeveloped or rushed. Some viewers might find the film's graphic violence and disturbing imagery off-putting, as it does not shy away from depicting the horrors faced by the crew. Additionally, the film's pacing can be uneven, with moments of intense terror interspersed with slower, more exposition-heavy scenes.Despite these shortcomings, ""Event Horizon"" remains a memorable and impactful film within the sci-fi horror genre. Its unique blend of atmospheric horror and science fiction, combined with strong performances and striking visual design, make it a standout entry in both categories. For fans of horror and sci-fi, ""Event Horizon"" is a must-watch that continues to resonate with audiences years after its release.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An extremely good film.,"This a very good movie. It creates a wonderful atmosphere. It's very creepy and scary. Plus it also gives one a feel akin to claustrophobia. You get the feeling that everything, the ship, fate, nature, EVERYTHING, is closing in on you and that everything is against you. It also gives one a wonderful sense of isolation, that you are completely alone and that there is no one that can come along and help. The people who made this film said that they were trying to duplicate those two elements in the manner that Alien did. I think that in some ways (particularly for the claustrophobic feel) they surpassed Alien. All films lose something going from the big screen to the small screen. But if you missed this on the big screen, you missed out. You fully feel the atmosphere it creates when watched in a movie theatre. You only get a small fraction of it watching the movie on TV.The film is also good from a psychological view point, as we see the characters reaction to the experiences they are going through, and how this affects their relationship with each other.My only problem is it does display a little too much gore, but if you can bare sitting through the gory parts, you'll experience a great film.",,Anonymous,Horror
More suspense horror than Sci-Fi,"If you're looking for a Sci-Fi film to fill your space nerd void, this might not be the film for you. If on the other hand, you are someone who enjoys space and all its mystery but has a dark and twisted side... step right up. This movie is certainly underrated when it comes to creativity, that much is for sure. The entire concept of the movie is quite the unique take on space, and more specifically black holes/event horizons. The characters are created quite appropriately for a film like this, and the acting is solid enough to keep your attention. The twisted concepts and slight gore really add to the beauty that is Event Horizon. This movie could have used a slightly better ending and perhaps and bit more detail throughout the story, but ultimately is quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Event Horizon,"Although this plot has been through the wringer a few times already, over the years, I still quite enjoyed it. A group of exploring astronauts set off to find out what happened to the eponymous spaceship that disappeared long since but has now returned! ""Miller"" (Laurence Fishburne) leads a team that also includes ""Weir"" (Sam Neill) who originally designed the enigmatic craft. Onboard, all seems fine until things start to go terrifyingly awry for this crew as they discover, quite literally, the remnants of the previous occupants floating around. Pretty quickly, they find themselves facing a shapeless foe of untold power that may well emanate from another time, certainly it does from another place. We are now presented with a creatively entertaining mix of sci-fi and light horror, with some good visual effects (especially the lighting) that complement, rather than overwhelm, the story. The acting - even from the usually stiff as a board Neill (and his creepy eyes) - makes for a well presented and exciting adventure that offers us menace, some decent dialogue and a genuine sense of peril as we edge nearer the quite uncertain denouement. Much better than I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
To hell and back,"Event Horizon follows the crew of the rescue ship, ""Lewis and Clark"", as they embark on a mission to respond to a distress signal emitted by a ship that disappeared seven years ago, the Event Horizon. At the time it disappeared, the Event Horizon was testing out a new drive allowing it to create a wormhole for instantaneous travel. However, something went terrible wrong.This is a rather good written film. All the elements to make a successful horror film is there and so are the characters. No, the story is not all too great, in fact if you think about it it is rather stupid and the characters could've been better, but all in all it could have been a lot worse. The only good thing about this story is that it's set on a space ship, in a locked environment. It is really not the story that is scary about this movie. Towards the end when the solution comes and there are a lot of story going on it actually starts to look more like an action movie. What makes this movie scary is the mood and the atmosphere.The acting is OK. The characters are not great so you don't get this connection too them and the actors does a decent job in bringing them to life. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are too good leads and the others does a decent job as well.When it comes to cinematography there are nothing special that stands out. It's all over good with some occasional cool shots, but you've seen them all before. There are nothing too great and original about them, but they are good and along with very good lightning they are an essential part of what creates the atmosphere witch makes this movie scary.Something that needs to be given a lot of credit for this movie being as scary as it is, is the production design. The interior of the Event Horizon and also the ""Clark"" for that matter is excellent. It is creepy and good looking.The third element besides cinematography and production design that creates the atmosphere and mood and makes this movie creepy is the music/sound design. The music is good and moody, but they also make the absence of music a powerful tool.As for special effects they are good. The CGI is nothing groundbreaking. It's simply good looking, not too obvious and it does it's job.What we have here is not a movie with a scary movie. It has a good amount of gore, but like The Thing it's the excellent atmosphere and mood that makes it scary. Don't pay too much attention to the story, it's not worth it. I'd recommend this one if you like a good horror film. I think you'll be in for a decent scare.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An atmospheric sci-fi horror with a punch...,"I just sat down to watch the 1997 horror sci-fi movie ""Event Horizon"" from writer Philip Eisner for the third time. It had been years since last I watched it, and as I had the chance again, of course I delved back into the depths of space in some really good company.This movie's cast ensemble is just spectacular. It has the likes of Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee on the cast list; to mention a handful of these actors and actresses. They were nicely cast for their individual roles and characters, and they put on great performances, which really helped to carry the story.Director Paul W. S. Anderson did a good job at bringing the storyline and script to life on the big screen.The storyline told in ""Event Horizon"" is one that definitely makes for an entertaining and enjoyable movie experience. The movie starts out slow, but director Paul W. S. Anderson quickly brings things into gear and manages to build on layer upon layer of suspense. There is a very distinct feel to the movie; one that captures the loneliness and desolation of outer space. And at the same time, the ever-building and slowly amassing sense of dread and general creepiness definitely also added so much atmosphere to the movie.The downside to ""Event Horizon"" is the character gallery. I feel that the characters in the movie were a bit too superficial and felt a bit like cardboard cut-outs. I was missing a more in-depth background and motivation for the characters, as it would have added just more of a dimension to the movie. When people die in the storyline, it is merely met with a shrug from me as an audience, as I haven't really connected or bonded with the characters. And I also would have liked a bit more hesitation and struggle to give into the illusions that they experience aboard the derelict vessel; because highly trained space personnel here seems to just buckle and cave in to their own needs and desires on a mere whim.Visually then ""Event Horizon"" is still passable, though the effects are starting to show signs of aging. But they are still good enough, and actually still surpasses the effects in some newer sci-fi movies, however scary that fact may be.Now, ""Event Horizon"" is a movie that actually have enough contents to it and meat on its bones to support more than a single viewing.

Excellent despite a couple shortfalls,"Straight off, let me say that this movie is well done overall, though it could have been more.  Whether I personally could have handled more of this is another matter.The movie has a deliciously dark and claustrophobic feel to it... I found myself looking for an escape while watching it.  Afterwards, my house felt too small and dark to be comfortable.  That tells me the set design if nothing else was effective.The acting was fair, being pretty standard and having its stellar moments (especially from Mr. Neill).  There were some lines I thought the movie could do without and some bits that could have been written better. Overall, however, I didn't feel it was a sufficient enough detraction to remove from the overall effect of the movie.The plot was straightforward and at times, predictable.  I guess unlike other reviewers I don't sit at a movie seeing if I can guess what's next... I expect to be taken on a ride, not to drive.  Only when a movie is so boring that I have nothing else to focus on do I worry about what's next. This one moved along briskly, and lulled at suitable moments to allow viewers to catch their breath.  It interjected enough backstory to keep the suspension of disbelief up while maintaining the proper pacing for a movie in this vein.Special effects were moderate.  They were good enough not to date the movie but nothing spectacular.  The set designs outpaced them handily.  Combined with good cinematography, the physical feel of the movie actually had more weight and impact than the rest of its elements.Overall, I was frightened by this movie.  Watching it alone at 1 AM I almost had to leave the house after I saw it.  There were moments that in all honesty kinda stank, but the overall effect was unhindered by them.  The level of gore was high, but it was properly used, I think.  The subject matter this movie dealt with combined the elements of gore and violence and other taboo subjects in the proper way to shock, but didn't load them up to the point of rediculousness.  However, I do warn that you do prepare to be shocked.  This movie, when it opens up, pulls no punches.  It is a scary, creepy movie that if it had been done to some high ideal of ""perfection"" in what it tried to do might be nigh unwatchable.  I highly recommend it for a good scare.

Look deeper into the obvious,"I saw this movie on opening day in a packed theater.  I knew it would be bad when I overheard the ushers were refusing to go into the theater to do a headcount.  Expecting something on the level of Aliens, I was amazed.Sure, the whole genere of derelict spacecraft rescued by motley crew of quirky deviant types had been done to death, but this movie was not intended to surpass those movies, but encompass and expound on them.  I believe that the similarities noted by so many to Aliens and Hellraiser were not plaguerizing but tribute. If you look deep into the movie and its basic thesis, and not distract yourself with coolant containers and laughable artificial gravity generators, you will see that it is an allegory for the hell within. It has some great symbolism and the much criticised gore accomplishes what it is intended to accomplish--you are affected by this movie.  Sometimes deeply. It leaves you with the feeling that somehow your soul has been taken out. Not for the delicate. Yes, the script is script is a collage of all the sci-fi movies in the past 30 years, yes the characters are one dimensional... but think on this: Were it more realistic, would you ever be able to turn out the lights again? Could you do any kind of looking at yourself inside without seeing Sam Neil staring back, eyeless? Perhaps the best review of this movie is this: After the credits started rolling to the soulless sounds of Orbital, something occurred in the packed theater that I had never seen before.  As everyone filed out of the theater, faces blank and pale, not a single word was uttered. Not one. ***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Horror
Event Horizon is scarier than Alien,"Event Horizon is scarier than Alien. Although many aspects of the film have roots in earlier efforts such as 2001, Alien, and Hellraiser, it effectively molds these influences into a new and horrifying story.  The film has an excellent progression of plot, and the acting of the main characters, particularly Sam Neil as Dr. Weir, and Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, is excellent.My own pet peeve of Horror movies is that the terrifying moments are often artificially created by the incredible stupidity of the characters.  This is mostly not the case in Event Horizon.  The set and special effects lend a very creepy air to the whole movie that makes your hair stand on end, and when action happens you're suitably primed to jump out of your seat.I have two problems with the film: 1) The music at the opening and closing credits doesn't set up the mood of the film at all, and leaves you expecting something else. and, 2)  The ending is a bit unsatisfying, and somewhat cheesy.Overall, however, this movie is well made and conceived, and has only a few weaknesses.  I recommend it, just know that you'll have to sleep with the lights on for a few days.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sadly underrated (IMO)...,"I remember being impressed with this film when I first saw it way back in the late 1990's. It's one of those that, once you've seen it, it keeps coming back to you. I have been meaning to watch it again for some time now and so I though now being as good time as any I popped it in the DVD player, turned the sound up and let her rip! I wasn't disappointed; it's every bit as good as I remember, right down to the pumping 'Prodigy' track that runs over the closing credits. I will give you my take on it after this very brief summary.The experimental spaceship, The Event Horizon, has been missing for seven years after it left the solar system bound for Proxima Centuri. After its beacon is detected in the vicinity of Neptune, a rescue mission is launched. A specialist crew is sent out along with Dr. William Weir, the man who designed the ship. The crew consists of; Captain Miller, Peters, the Med Tech, Lt. Starck, Cooper, Justin, D.J. and Smith. Dr. Weir is haunted with memories of his dead wife, who had recently committed suicide. None of them are prepared for what they find when they reach the, now deserted, Event Horizon. The experimental drive had taken it to places beyond understanding and it hadn't come back alone. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be signing me up for another trip.A very well made film with some really excellent effects. Great performances all round; everyone did a very professional job and made the story believable. So, special praise goes to; Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. William Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Peters and Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck. Honourable mentions go to; Richard T. Jones as Cooper, Jack Noseworthy as Justin, Jason Isaacs (hello to him) as D.J. and Sean Pertwee as Smith.I must admit I really like this film, how it's got such a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes I will never know! Yes, the plot is a little complicated but I did find it truly scary and there a very few films I can say that about these days. To me I think it's probably the best space horror since the Alien films and it's certainly better than Alien 4! I haven't read what the professional critics have to say on it, but I will stick to my guns and say it's a very underrated Sci-Fi Horror that deserves better recognition Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 54,832 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 23/100 (based on 35 reviews (No Consensus) counted at the time of going to press).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frightening rescue in space,"Contrary to what I was led to believe about this film, it was not bad at all.Plenty of action, good dialogue, great acting from some of the cast and a frightening villain.The pacing of the movie is very on point considering making full use of its 90 minute duration. The special effects of the movie were really great for the most part and definitely aged well. The sci-fi material is good and interesting.Although it was a very entertaining movie, the plot leaves something to be desired and the aside from a couple of characters the rest were just placeholder characters with no development or exposition making them boring to watch.Ultimately Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill save this movie with their captivating acting and screen presence.Watch if:you want an exciting movie that holds your attention from start to finishyou want a bit of horror/disturbing materialyou want some of that sweet old school but still cool special effectslike sci-fiDon't watch if:you are expecting a story writing masterclasswant a lot of plot and character developmentsexpect original ideas or a spin on the genreRated 7 for excitement, thrilling pace, great villain and special effects but lack of new ideas and boring characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Solid, but Flawed Sci-Fi Horror Film","This was a film that I remember watching back when it came out and hit the movie channels. After that initial viewing, I thought it had a really had a dark concept. My thoughts were actually that this was a lot like Hellraiser in space. The synopsis is a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned...with someone or something new on-board.We actually start this one with getting back-story of how there was first colonies on the Moon, followed by mining colonies on Mars and then finally they created a ship named the Event Horizon, which is also the name of the point of no return for black holes. The ship goes missing and it is reported that it blew up. We learn this is a cover-up and that the ship disappeared. In the film's present, the ship has returned.The film then introduces us to Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). He is the designer of the Event Horizon. He is asked to join a team that is going to check on the ship that has reappeared by the planet Neptune. A rescue mission is put together with the ship, the Lewis and Clark. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is tasked to lead it. He isn't told what the mission is; just that is rescue and salvage. With him is a medical tech Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson), Cooper (Richard T. Jones), Dr. D.J. (Jason Isaacs), Smitty (Sean Pertwee) who is the pilot and finally Justin (Jack Noseworthy).Something this film does that I like is kind of introducing us to some of the technology. Everyone is put into a stasis to save their bodies as they travel through space. I will admit this film gives off a bit of Alien here with a crew trying to answer a distress call for a ship. As well as try to salvage it.Once they arrive in the area they are supposed to, they find the missing ship. Dr. Weir gives some background on its special engine and how it uses black holes to jump across the galaxy, making space travel much faster. The Event Horizon is scanned for life-forms, but they are getting weird readings. It is decided that Capt. Miller, Lt. Starck, Peters and Justin will go aboard. Part of this is to getting the ship back working to bring it in.Justin goes to where the core of the engine is and something happens. It somehow turns on by itself and sucks him in. Cooper gets him back out with the winch he is connected to, but he's in a coma like state. Dr. Weir tells them this isn't possible as it has three electric fields keeping it in place and has to be turned on manually. The crew starts to see some dark things of their past and loved ones as there's something not right going on with the ship. It gets even darker as Peters uncovers the ship's log and sees the final moments of the previous crew.I do have to admit, that coming into this film I was excited to check this out again, because I hadn't seen it since I wrote a paper about it in an astronomy class about black holes. It wasn't as brutal as I remembered it and of course not as scary either. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy what I saw. The concept of black holes is something that fascinates me. I really want to know if the gravitational pull just destroys everything or if they are really like wormholes that lead to another place or something else.This concept of what hell is really a place that is dimension just beyond ours is something else I really like too. What if bending time and space like this film is doing could really open a door to a world like this. I almost wish this film would have focused more on this than what we got. I listened to a podcast about this recently and they brought up there was a lot of cut footage, with some of that being more gore. I actually wish we could have gotten more of that and a bit less of what we did get to be honest. The film doesn't seem to fit together as well as it should. There are gaps in the story and time wise. That is not to say that pacing isn't good, but it doesn't build as much as tension as I really wanted it to. The film runs 96 minutes and I do wish we got 15 minutes or even push it to a full 2 hours as there is a great concept here.Since I kind of brought up how this does have a Hellraiser feel, we do get this entity that takes what scares or depresses us. It then uses it against us. This is a terrifying idea. Not only that, I love the torture aspects where the bodies are mutilated. I'm not big on pain, so this idea makes me cringe. They don't take it far enough though for me to really feel that way. We just get glimpses of this and I will say, it is some of my favorite aspects of the film as it reminds me of the CD cover to a Rammstein that fascinated me.Next to move to the acting, I would say that Fishburne is solid in this one. He is a fair captain and I think that he genuinely cares about his crew. He turns a tight ship and is fair. Not his best performance, but still good. Neill I think is really good as well. I do think that he kind of disappears through stretches of the film and I'm wondering if part of this is scenes that were cut. I wanted more from him. He is quite creepy though as the film goes on. Quinlan I thought was solid. I do feel bad for her is that her son is disabled and she wants to stay on Earth with him. Richardson is fine in her role. She is pretty easy on the eyes. Jones, Pertwee and Noseworthy are also pretty solid in their roles. I will admit that Jones did get on my nerves a bit. There isn't much of the rest of the cast, but they do round out the film for what is needed.Something that I dreaded about films from this era was the effects. Back to the podcast I listened on this, they were talking about how they didn't hold up. I will say that I'm torn. The effects that were done practically of course look great. I just wish we would have gotten a bit more. For the CGI, this think they are definitely hit or miss where some look really good and others really bad. I do like the look of both ships, but something that also struck me is that you'd think this would feel more contained. The Event Horizon feels so big that you don't get that cramped feel that makes space movies scarier. The film though is shot very well.Now with that said, this film didn't hold up as well as I remember it, but I still enjoy it. I think that there is a great concept here there is just a lot missing. I think this actually hurts the pacing of the film as it moves through some things too quickly and doesn't build enough of the horror as it could. The acting is good though and again, some of the ideas that are explored are solid. The effects are definitely hit or miss. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but it did fit for what they needed. I would say that overall this film is above average for me. I would recommend giving it a viewing especially if you are into sci-fi horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Spooky, Violent and Atmospheric. All in all, a good film.","Event Horizon has taken some basic conventions from the horror genre and mixed them up with a very basic Sci-fi setting. There are characters you just KNOW are going to end up dying some sort of a horrible death, an obvious protagonist and some very clever little plot pointers here and there such as how the ship 'Event Horizon' can travel quickly through space and little things like that that make the film seem a lot more different than others in this cross genre.Several characters put aboard a space ship with a 'no way out' element very much present and the fact it's in space and in the middle of nowhere makes this feel a little more claustrophobic than normal which is a good thing.The twist in the film, I must admit, did take me by surprise and all though afterwards you think that maybe it was a little obvious, it still does set you back a bit. The acting isn't all that good but at the same time, they weren't dire performances. It was the kind of acting that goes unnoticed without any real performance standing out no matter how much screen time one may have. The dark, sinister setting is used very well and it isn't all CGI which has been the downfall of quite a few horror/sci-fi films in the past.I liked the early sense of mystery and atmospheric feeling of confusion almost like some of the characters were private eyes, trying to discover what happened and untangling a mystery that has been made up.All in all, I think you should see the movie and I think, odds on, that you will like it. Maybe not absolutely love it but you will feel a lot better after this film than maybe after certain others.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total Slop,"I have become increasingly convinced that the people posting about this movie were on LSD at the time of viewing.  This movie is utter slop: poorly directed; virtually no scary sequences (only gory ones); and a plotline almost plagertistic of Hellraiser IV.  Horrid, contrite and an insult to the viewer - the few scenes with promise are in the first half, and the ending is so ludicrous that you aren't sure whether to laugh, cry or drool on yourself from the utter stupidity of this nonsense.  The acting is not half-bad, but the direction certainly is.  If you mix the movies ""The Black Hole"" and ""Hellraiser IV"", you have Event Horizon.  That's it.  Move along.

I do think the atmosphere of the film is very old school. There are a lot of cribs from earlier films, but when its done this well who is to ague?

This is a Betrayal of Character for No Earthly Reason.Visually Everything is Impressive and Stylish. All Else is a Dismal and Disappointing Failure, so if You Add it All Up it Amounts to Average or Slightly Above.

A disappointment,"Mixing science fiction and horror has been a lucrative exercise since Alien. Even Horizon, however, is more crap than anything. It started off in the right direction by keeping the ship's past whereabouts a secret, giving the horror an ambiguously creepy feel. But it made the mistake of leaving the audience too much in the dark. The only clue ever given is a dead end.The cast is the only part of the movie that works. Most of them give good performances, most notably Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. You can tell they did the best with what they had.The special effects are pretty good. If Anderson is good at anything, it's making things look real.Event Horizon had a lot of potential. It could have been the next Alien.

Scariest Movie Ever ?,"It might be.  This movie is horrifying.  It was on TV recently and even though I knew it would screw me up, I couldn't avert my eyes.It's on the same level as Psycho and Blair Witch.  Which for me at least means that it's terrifying.  The Event Horizon it gorier than the aforementioned two, but like them, it relies heavily on suggestion and a good dramatic tension -- a sense of unease pervades the entire movie. Conveying this unease is a hallmark of good horror movie (I'm not a fan of the genre, I might add).  Another part of the brilliance of this, and other top tier movies is the strategic use of ambiguity -- the creation of ""gaps"" which are left for the viewer's imagination to fill-in.  The movie establishes a framework, or a direction of thought and the viewers complete the myth in their own minds.  In this case, the results are disturbing.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Short, Silly, Superficial but watchable","Event Horizon is an awkward sci-fi flick. The only thing it really succeeds in doing in being grizzly and ominous (not to mention gory). Over the course of an hour and a half, we are not given much more than a handful of shocks. However, the filmmakers somehow manage to execute this messy story well enough that if you like this sort of thing, you may not be temped to walk away.After being lost in space for seven years, the Event Horizon spacecraft has suddenly reappeared in the solar system in the year 2047. A small crew led by Captain Miller is sent out to explore the ship and get some answers. What they slowly begin to realize is that the ship has not merely gone off the edge of the map, but it has been to hell and back, and now there are supernatural forces aboard. The reasons how and why this has happened are not explained to us, which is kind of disappointing. What follows is a story of survival on the haunted ship with lots of gore, cheap dialog, and typical cardboard acting.Event Horizon is not the worst sci-fi film out. I would definitely recommend it over films like 'Sphere' and/or 'The Fifth Element', but regardless, the movie still needs work. It is just barely entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely brilliant,"This movie is just so difficult to forget. It lingers in your memory for a long time after you have seen it. Although none of the actors or their acting (except maybe Sam Neill), is memorable or worth mentioning, the movie is just so unnerving and disturbingly retained within. It starts out as a normal sci-fi looking movie and then progresses on to become an extraordinarily sci-fi cum horror flick. The movie can never be called boring because it leaves you at the edge of your seats on account of it's suspense and shock-value. The movie is certainly not for the faint-hearted and fickle-minded as it contains certain horrific scenes and gory visuals. The horror works quiet well at the psychological level too. The creators of the movie are certainly imaginative in using superb visuals and brilliant sets. The alleys and the corridors of the spaceship are so spooky and creates a claustrophobic environment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A tale of two movies,"This movie was a big disappointment. The first 30 minutes contain all of the elements to be an excellent sci-fi thriller. It seems that what Anderson tried to create here is a Kubrick type film somewhere between ""The Shinning"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey"". What it turns into is at best a ""B"" movie with a lot of blood, gore and splatter which are a bad diversion from the screenplay and the script which are at times absolutely woeful. The acting is OK to very good considering how bad the script is in places. Lawrence Fishburn does an excellent job but then again he is in my opinion very underrated as an actor. I think Anderson really blew an opportunity here to create a great movie with sequel potential. It's really a shame when you consider other well done comparable deep space sci-fi films such as Pitch Black etc.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bending space-time leads to Hell?,"I have always liked ""Event Horizon"" mostly I think because of my general loving of sci-fi horror, but despite a wonderfull cast (Fishburne & Neill glitter!) this film annoyingly suffers from so many plot holes, a lump of Swiss cheese would be jealous! Unfortunatly it is the plot holes that seriously let down what could have been a masterpiece of this genre & I am talking about serious ""who, what, why, where"" abyssess!The first part of the movie is actually very good, & ticks along nicely (although I don't get it that water can save you from 10g Gravity?) But then my eyebrow gets raised when the first flashbacks begin. What has the wife of the designer of the EH ship got to do with the story? Next we get into the recovery of the ships video log, which is full on Wes Cravenesque porn/gore, which inlisted the talents of real life amputees & porn actors! Errr.....WHY!? & what was with the Latin language used for? a connection to Hell perhaps. Then the film begins to loose momentum when the rest of the crew begins to hallucinate/or see ghosts of loved ones. Some of these scenes are so long & drawn out it could almost be a snoozefest! But yet again, why are the crew seeing these hallucinations? because this is yet another big Swiss cheese plot hole which is never explained. This is ultimatly very sad because the original cut of this movie was 130 minutes making me wonder if this lost footage could have explain what is unexplained in the final cut.Overall EH is a stylish attempt at an Alienesque film & it does have its fair share of jump shocks, gore & horror, but its the story that is sadly lacking. But saying all this the overall message of EH is that experimental deep space travel will take you to Hell, which is a weird message to take onboard. Is EH actually an ""ANTI-space"" movie? Well in this respect yes it is! Because here we are 20 years into the 21st century & we have not even been back to the moon. You would think with all the tech advances we have today we should have vacations on the moon by now, flying cars, outposts on Mars, & perhaps even cracked faster than light space travel (the central story of EH) but we have not... Sadly all we have today are meglomainic billionaires socialists pushing wealth redistribution via climate change & forcing the people of our beautiful world into global govenance which they call ""progressive"".....I call it regressive, when now in 2020 the cosmic ocean is left unexplored, neglected & abandoned.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible Plot -- Bad movie disguised as a SciFi,"The first 30 minutes might get you a little bit confused. Story about a lost ship and a technology to challenge space-time fabric by fabricating its own black hole should definitely look interesting for a SciFi movie plot, however, as the story evolves you start getting that bad impression that you were deceived. Suddenly you are struck by the terrible truth: this is just a pseudo-science fiction movie with an horrible plot that looks like a bad hellraiser imitation. There is absolutely nothing connected to black holes and their event horizons -- it goes on with bizarre situations like some of the characters breathing on outer space after being exposed to a breach in the spacecraft.

"Okay movie, but owes huge debt to better film makers","Paul WS Anderson has never been shy of inviting people to compare his work (unworthily) to Ridley Scott and James Cameron's time and time again, but Event Horizon, whilst starting off with an unashamedly barefaced 'homage' to Alien's blue collar vibe, owes more to John Carpenter than anyone else. Admittedly Anderson telegraphs this from the opening expositional text, which, like Carpenter's seminal Escape from New York, ends with the year it's set in before declaring that its future setting is actually (a very meta) NOW (something Neil Marshall would repeat in his EfNY/Carpenter homage, Doomsday). The whole flick could be summed up as '2010: Odyssey 2 meets Prince of Darkness' with a little Stanley Kubrick touch added here or there. So, no points for originality then, as Anderson begins his lifelong career choice of associating himself with better and more successful directors. But, despite all this, the movie isn't the train wreck it perhaps deserved to be. Most of the actors throw themselves into their (underdeveloped) roles and, aside from some wooden dialogue and ham-fisted exposition, do a mostly decent job. The special FX are passable, again apart from some ropey effects of liquid suspended in zero gravity. There's a few decent jump scares and a foreboding atmosphere actually more subtle than you would really expect from Anderson. Make up and gore effects were decent too. I'm not a fan of Anderson, and have resisted watching Event Horizon for years, despite repeated recommendations,. But having watched it now, I can happily say I found it his most watchable flick, even though as I write this it's now 18 years old. Is it great? No. Terrible? No. Slightly above average? Yeah, that's fair. But I suppose your work will be elevated too when you stand on the shoulders of giants.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Made of Whatever Materials at Hand,"Event Horizon is a bustling makeshift handiwork made secure by impressive production design and performances from actors who aren't easily embarrassed, but it begins with panache. It has the nuanced space vessels moving grandly against the domain of stars, it has the abysmal roar of the massive generators, it has sets boasting convincing technology, and it even has those high-pitched, jabbering, hardly discernible voice-like noises that remind us of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which give you the eerie sense that tiny creatures are plotting against you. The year is 2047. A rescue mission has been sent to Neptune's proximity, where seven years earlier the titular deep space research vessel vanished. As the rescue ship Lewis and Clark nears, its transmitters read that the temperature on board the other ship is freezing. No indication of human life is recognized. But there are signs of some other sort of life all through the ship. I love movies like this. I enjoy the dated fine points. Case in point: Everybody on board the rescue ship smokes, which is improbable in 2047 on a deep space mission where, later, the carbon dioxide air scrubbers will perform a vital function. And the captain, Laurence Fishburne, wears a leather bomber jacket, bespeaking that Neiman Marcus remains booming decades from now. I liked all of that stuff, though there wasn't much import to it.What happened to the ship named Event Horizon? Scientist Sam Neill might know. He created the ship's gravity drive, which candidly resembles a minor variation on the Machine in Contact, with three metal rings gyrating around an axis. The drive supposedly conceives a black hole and then sucks the ship through it, so that it can travel astronomical reaches in a second. Neill gives the binding junior high lecture on this process, taking a piece of paper and showing you how far it is from one side to the other, and then folding it in half so that the two edges meet, describing how that occurs when space bends. The crew members nod, observing sternly. They're an exceptionally qualified space crew, on a mission where space and time are livelihood, although they seem to know less about quantum theory than most of us home entertainment couch potatoes do. It's back to Physics 101 for them. They're more like a mix of marine caricatures, as is the case with the zealous and scripted deliveries by Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson, and even buddy cop foils, as is the unfortunate case for Richard T. Jones, playing a character cursed with so many horribly retarded lines that I hold the entire cast and crew responsible for not voicing the need for another rewrite: He's even carrying on like an Eddie Murphy bit when catapulted into space at one point.So, anyway, where did the ship go for seven years, and what occurred while it was there? Why is the first team all dead? Alas, Event Horizon is not the movie to field these issues. It's all flair, pay-off and special effects. Each scene revises the fundamentals: Early in the film the Lewis and Clark nears the Event Horizon through what I think is the tempestuous gravitational field of Neptune, with endless thunder, lightning and commotion. However as soon as those effects are taken advantage of, the remainder of the movie takes place in the tranquility of space. And although we are regaled with quite pleasant shots of Neptune, the crew members never regard the planet in astonishment, or acknowledge the remarkable spectacle that would shift any Earthling's paradigm forever. They're always so preoccupied with their obligatory, often cheesy dialogue they're heedless of their environment.The open-faced muse for this entertaining enough sleepwalking exercise in genre expediency, by the director of Mortal Kombat, is an incomparably superior but far less accessible film, Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, where a space station courses a colossal planet. The planet in that film is seemingly alive, and generates delusions in the minds of the space station inhabitants, making them believe they're back on Earth with their families. Same thing goes down in Event Horizon, where the crew members sublimate family members and colleagues they long for/cherish/blame themselves for the loss of, although where Tarkovsky was integrating the submerged psyche with the view of a planet as a single organism, Event Horizon exploits the figments and illusions of memory predominantly for jolts and cries of wolf, as well as distilling the antagonistic forces into a single supernatural villain stalking the ship like another Alien film.It is declared bleakly at one point that the gravity drive is an example of humanity going too far, into reaches we should not dare. There is a charge that someone has ""broken the laws of physics,"" and from the way it's accused you'd think perpetrators will be put in jail or charged with damages. Naturally there are no ""laws"" of physics, simply conclusions about the way things appear to be. What you ""break,"" if you break anything, is no longer a law but just an outmoded view, now replaced by one that makes better sense. Soundly implanted in this movie is a mistrust of actual science. That's probably why its characters know so little about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been so much more,"""You break all the laws of physics and you seriously think there wouldn't be a price?""It is with a heavy heart that I bring you this bad news that Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Event Horizon' is strictly above average. And that's mainly because of a convoluted script that had little to no element of consistency. The characters, on the other hand, have suffered the same discrepancies because of comparable reasons.Now, Speaking of technicalities; there I have to say, it's pretty darn impressive. Don't know about the others but in my book, Practical Effects will always be my first preference, as they are much nicer and considerably better than any of the computer-generated imagery. Doesn't matter how advanced the technology gets, it stands no chance against practicality. It's the Prosthetics though, that had me sold, whoever been a part of that crew, I gotta tell, you guys have done an incredible job.If only I could use similar remarks for the remainder. I read somewhere, that the film was supposed to be 130 mins long, but due to the studio's authoritative intervention, Anderson as the Director had no choice but to cut it down to a mere 95 Mins. If you ask me, that was some terrible decision-making.Make no mistake; I do prefer crisp and precise edits, however, in these kinds of ventures, where we happen to deal with a multitude of complex (Yet fascinating) subjects like Space-time, Blackholes, Inter-Dimensional Travel etc, it is rather mandatory to give the narrative an ample amount of time to properly feed the information to us, the audience. Unfortunately for whatever reason, that hasn't been the case over here. Hence, the film ended up being way less significant than it was destined to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting albeit underrated look at sci-fi horror.,"A critical and commercial failure upon release, this black sheep of sci-fi horror films gained a cult-following and success with DVD/Video Cassette release afterwards. It is quite a solid film, incorporating a rather B-Movie idea with A-Grade production, great cinematography, and above average acting (particularly for a horror film). Character depth is not a big thing, although the characters are quite likable and full of personality whether serious or humorous. The plot involves a ship called Event Horizon that lost all communication after orbiting past Neptune to have the ship reappear several years later. The crew, unknowing of the ship's past or the mission they are about to participate in, mus investigate the ship for survivors only to find a dark secret about the ship which takes the crew's lives one by one. The horror pieces are effective and entertaining, complimented by a cool story and great visual effects/set pieces. Supposedly, the once-lost footage containing 25-30 minutes of extra background insight and horror sequences has been found and will hopefully encourage a director's cut release.

Review from a Dead Space fan,"The only reason I was interested in this movie is because my friend had mention that it was similar to one of my favorite games Dead Space. When I heard that, I had to immediately watch this movie. Oh boy ....Let me start off by saying, this movie was not as scary as Dead Space. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The movie itself wasn't even scary period. I was disappointed to find out that there really wasn't some sort of life form on the ship like the necromorphs in Dead Space. It was all psychological type stuff the members that boarded Event Horizon experienced. And hey, lets not forget to add the funny black guy .... *sigh*I am so mad at the lack of good sci-fi horror movies, especially deep space. Pandorum was trash and Splice ... I guess the sex scene made it laughable. Obviously Alien is the king, and how long can I live watching those? James Cameron needs to get back in there. I'm just going to pray and hope the Dead Space live action movie will make me poop my pants. I really want sci-fi horror to reign supreme. Save us!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Atmospheric Film Filled With Squandered Potential,"Part 'The Black Hole', part 'Sunlight', 'Event Horizon' meshes the epic sci-fi 'base under siege' by mad scientists and the forces of nature plot of both while failing to achieve the greatness of either, eschewing intelligence and depth for shallow, B-grade disposable fluff that entertains just enough for the audience not to feel too cheated and earns the studio a fast buck. Top-drawer actors and well-crafted flashy effects are used to gloss over a meaningless plot and a wasted opportunity, for 'Event Horizon' explores some intriguing concepts and has several elements of a decent film.Since I first saw it on the big screen, one thing that had always stuck in my mind about 'Event Horizon' was that eerie atmosphere. Director Paul Anderson should certainly explore the horror genre, being adept at building a climate of tension and foreboding. This accentuates the story's central premise: that the ship 'Event Horizon' itself has somehow become affected by the forces it encountered in another dimension. Anderson does a good job of actualising these indelible phenomena on the big screen, keeping the characters and the viewer on edge: we know all hell is going to break loose, but not why or how. He is helped in this goal by the tried and tested talents of an experienced visual effects team that includes department supervisor Richard Yuricich, who earlier proved himself in such greats as '2001' and 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. The result earned 'Event Horizon' the description 'weird' when it first came out and the viewers' inability to qualify what they were seeing was one of the film's greatest strengths - no one was entirely sure how real the unexplained anomalies were, which the ending capitalizes upon.Unfortunately, these efforts are severely undermined by a script that has no interest in exploring the incredible scientific concepts behind the conflict, rendering all the unanswered questions and 'Shining'-style sequences meaningless. It's rather like launching into an intelligent conversation with someone who suddenly decides things are getting too 'heavy' before retreating to the safer topic of whether or not Simon Cowell deserves a knighthood. This has the knock-on effect of ensuring that much of the characters' dialogue is as two-dimensional as their characterisation: if there's a scientist aboard, the chances of him still being sane by the closing credits are about as likely as any military characters present exploring the Kip Thorne ruminations on wormhole theory. The point is not to suggest that anyone should have lapsed into a Carl Sagan lecture on the nature of the universe - those who have sat through the works of Dan Brown will, if still awake, be all too familiar with storytellers more interested in being didactic than genuinely entertaining. Rather, it's the usual desire by the studios not to alienate the meat-heads in the audience with too much of this thing we call 'thinking'. This doubtless also explains the choice of music for the beginning and end credits, which hurriedly promises ""don't worry - there's gonna be shootin' 'n killin'"" - although Michael Kamen's incidental score is thankfully more in tune with his usual standard.Still, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are no strangers to film work held together by more money than brains, the Matrix sequels and pointless 'Under The Mountain' remake being more recent examples. Both are capable of giving so much more, with Neill as usual the best-served out of a modest banquet. Once remembered for playing the son of Satan, this is a man who can convey a great deal without ever saying a word. His Dr Weir alter ego, however, needed far more development if we were to be sympathetic with his plight. Fishburne is never allowed to explore any facial expression other than serious concern, although this might have something to do with his polar opposite in the form of Cooper, as played by Richard T. Nelson, whom I really want to believe is not simply there to be the token 'Funny Black Man', but Cooper is really convincing in the role. Other luminaries worthy of mention include Katherine Quinlan and Jason Isaacs, but only because we've seen them act elsewhere, and Sean Pertwee follows his father into sci-fi for the first time to lesser acclaim, though he is hardly provided with much of a challenge.Much of my annoyance at the lack of effort put into 'Event Horizon' stems from the fact that I am the right demographic for sci-fi/horror. It's frustrating to see a film that in some ways explores themes and story lines I enjoy, but stops short, terrified that it might actually become something truly decent. On the one hand, I could argue that later successes like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine' raised the bar for the genre, leaving half-baked efforts such as this dancing the limbo beneath it with miles of clear headway up top. Yet precursors like 'The Black Hole' and 'Alien', which, while not necessarily exploring more intelligent story lines, were constructed with greater maturity by genuine film-makers like Ridley Scott, not interested in assembling a film with the help of a marketing team and interested in proper scripting over cheap thrills. Funnily enough, those are the films people still remember today.As such, 'Event Horizon' bears up well in appearance, but falls short once you take a closer peek. It feels like a very emblematic Hollywood blockbuster, half-filled with genuinely-talented artistes, but driven by a studio anxiously matching their box-office winning formula with audience demographics. Closer inspection reveals that its high aims are in fact the shadow of a much shorter arm outstretched in front of the wall where the puppetry is being performed for short-term gain only. Do yourself a favour and dig up the classics or watch considered efforts like 'Sunlight' instead. If like me, you haven't seen 'Event Horizon' since its original release and its spooky atmosphere left you with fond memories, keep it that way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It works on the psychological level without too much gore in the final theater version.

Middling sci-fi.,"I liked Event Horizon- at least visually but it suffers from the same problems that plague many average films of this sort- a bland screenplay. Event Horizon takes us to the year 2047 and onto the deep space rescue craft Lewis & Clark as it departs from Earth orbit on a two-month journey to Neptune. The primary mission of the Lewis & Clark is to go into a low orbit around Neptune and make contact with the deep space research vessel Event Horizon, which was initially thought destroyed seven years ago. The would-be rescuers are to search for survivors and salvage anything that's reclaimable, but no one is prepared for the horror that lurks deep within the dark corridors of the dead ship. The crew of the Event Horizon may have had their innards splattered over the bulkheads, but something aboard the ship is very much alive. Event Horizon isn't particularly effective as a horror, adventure, or science fiction film but the atmosphere and set design are good. That is all I can say about it.",,Anonymous,Horror

"""This place is a tomb!""","FILM: 7.5/10.As I revisited the 1997 film Event Horizon, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, I couldn't help but reflect on Anderson's reputation as the maestro of video game movie schlock. Yet, amidst the wreckage of his filmography, there's one non-video game gem that stands tall: Event Horizon.Despite critics lumping it in with Anderson's other works, Event Horizon struck a different chord with me upon its release, and 26 years later, it still impresses. Sci-fi and horror dance together in this film, drawing inspiration from Ridley Scott's Alien. While Anderson may lack Scott's finesse, he concocts a gripping blend of scares, gore, action, and a dash of comedy within a simple yet effective sci-fi premise.The cast, led by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne, fits the bill, elevating the film above occasional cheesy dialogue. Jason Isaacs, a quiet achiever in the background, injects moments of intensity.What has always captivated me is the production design. The ship itself is a marvel - a unique fusion of technology and gothic architecture that's visually striking and perfectly befitting the eerie atmosphere.While it may not attain classic status, Event Horizon remains one hell of a good time a quarter of a century later. Anderson's thrilling blend of sci-fi and horror defies expectations, offering an experience that continues to leave its mark. It's a nostalgic journey that holds up surprisingly well and proves that, even in the chaos of Anderson's filmography, there's room for a standout gem.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 8/10.Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad,"Before going on to much worse things (ie. RESIDENT EVIL), Paul W.S. Anderson (formerly just Paul Anderson, but he changed due to confusion with P.T. Anderson, director of MAGNOLIA, the British director made this, he second venture into Hollywood. After the dreadful MORTAL KOMBAT, Mr. Anderson took on a multi-million dollar sci-fi horror movie: this.Scripted by reative unknown Philip Eisner, it's that same-old-story of a space-crew coming across an abandoned vessel, only to find that something is still there. . . Laurence Fishburne is an effective Captain Miller, backed up by a whole sack of cliches; Sean Pertwee's cocky pilot, Joely Richardson's sturn professional, Jack Noseworthy's wide-eyed rookie, and Sam Neill's mad scientist. The plot consists of Fishburne's crew teaming up with Neill to find his space-ship of the title, which went missing 4 years ago. When they enter it, all they find are hideously mutilated corpses and a lot of blood.. .plus a particulary disturbing ship's log, which would make Captain Picard turn positively green with disgust. We soon find out that the Event Horizon can open some gateway and travel through the universe, defying the laws of physics because. . .oh just see it and find out, but it's brought something from it's last travels. . .to Hell.Turning from a rather rum episode of BLAKE'S 7, into a twisted space-slasher was an innotive move from Anderson, and although it doesn't live up to his expectations ('The Shining in Space' was his promise, but it's more like SCREAM among the stars). More like THE HAUNTING (the original not the crap Jan de Bont remake) than ALIEN, this replaces the creepy old house with a creepy old space-ship and it certainly works a treat. The acting is not bad (for a scu-fi movie, anyway), whilst the special-effects and the ever-increasing gore and prosthetics are very impressive. So it's rather sad that isn't actually that scary. There are a couple jumps and frights, but nothing very substantial.This is a case of an idea being brilliant of paper, but not quite working in practice. Eisner's script is good, but there are too many plot-holes and not enough charactrisation. Despite it being buffed up by Andrew Kevin Walker (responsible for SE7EN and, er, 8MM), the horror scenes are gruesome, but none of them stay with you in the same way that the murders in SE7EN do. Although the Spanish Inquisition-style torture chambers are a nice touch.Anderson handles the action reasonbly well, much better than in RESIDENT EVIL, but it is the actual Event Horizon, a labyrinth of steel corridors and large spikey-rooms, which steals the show.EVENT HORIZON is the perfect movie for a Friday night in: pulp sci-fi with buckets (and quite literally, waves) of blood. In the first sitting it was creepy, but in repeated watching, it lacks the rewatchability of other horror movies which continue being frightening as many times as you see them (THE THING, HALLOWEEN).Paul W.S. Anderson does a far better job on this, than on RESIDENT EVIL (which he scripted himself, so perhaps there lies the problem), and is his best film to date. Mind you, that's not much of an achievement as his other movies include SHOPPING and SOLDIER (shudder).EVENT HORIZON has become something of a modern cult-clag movie, and it's fun to watch people being hacked and sliced to pieces, but like all of Anderson's films, they are fatally superficial. 3 out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Violence and gore are not substitutes for quality writing...,"Event Horizon, the title of the movie, and the title of the fictitious spaceship in the movie that is capable of bending both space and time. And a crew of military spaceship operators are hired to track down the ship after it mysteriously resurfaces in deep space after being lost for the last seven years. Where has this time bending ship been the last seven years? Such a promising and intriguing premise is brutally ruined with over the top gore and violence. What could have been a thinking person's science-fiction mystery or even 'space detective' style movie is quickly reduced do a brain dead slasher gore fest complete with enough blood and mayhem to nearly erase the solid 45 minutes of brilliant writing, directing, and acting that preceded it.Eventually it is revealed that the ship most likely jumped forward in time seven years, instantly appearing at the current time of the movie. If the writers had simply left the movie at that I would have rated this a 10. But instead the ship is somehow magically transported to hell and back...and thus begins the gratuitous and ridiculous levels of violence.Sadly the intent of the movie producers and directors was to not only have the level of gore in the released version of the movie, but an even higher level of gore that had to be toned down to achieve an R rating.This is sad, because violence and gore, while sometimes are great in films, are not worthy substitutes for quality writing and storytelling. Violence with very little plot attached can basically summarize the last 45 minutes of an otherwise perfect film. A 'less is more' approach would have better sufficed, not the full-on head-first blood orgy that happens instead.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying and bloody film that loses its way,"Event Horizon is a film that I think has been unfairly bashed, though it does have some bad moments. Basically it takes elements of films like Solaris and novels like Rendezvous with Rama and uses them in a pulpy, B-movie horror film kinda way. This isn't necessarily good, since the film ultimately cops out on its initial instincts. After a very creey first half that promises so much, the film doesn't ever really deliver. The problem with this film, as with many horror films, is that the film loses its power once the unknown terrifying presence manifests itself. Upt to that point Event Horizon is suitably powerful as a horror film. And even after it flies off the rails and starts to resolve its situation in typical fashion, it's entertaining. This gets a 7/10 from me - for horror fans this is one to check out. It's not at the level of Solaris, but it stands well on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A warning therefore, if you're the slightest bit squeemish or easily disturbed, don't even think about watching this movie, just stay clear of it.It is genuinely gory and terrifying all the way through, but there is one moment which is simply unbelievable, where they access the ship's video logs and see what happened to the crew. Now I'm not really a horror movie fan, but this was the most gruesome piece of footage I have ever seen in a movie, and the image stuck in my head for months afterwards.

I believe Laurence Fishburne may be one of the most under-appreciated actors around.

I'm not one to be scared by movies easily but this one makes it hard for me to sleep at night. Its not so much the movie itself but when your hear that transmission that Dr Wier plays back you know there's trouble ahead and when you see what happens to the crew on that ships log it makes you feel extremely uneasy. The ship plays the perfect villain here and the whole feeling of the movie is uneasy. Nothing looks pretty in this movie. And that look sells it.

"Great Climax, But Otherwise Unmemorable","I was drawn to Event Horizon largely on the basis of deleted scenes I had seen on YouTube, particularly the famous orgy of destruction sequence. Although the climax lived up to the expectations this scene created, the rest of the film was middling at best. The plot involves a rescue mission sent out after the long lost space ship Event Horizon reappears.The film's main selling point, other than its genuinely unsettling climax, is the presence of talented actors like Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, which takes the film up a notch. Indeed, the film's early scenes give it a gritty realism, as the characters genuinely act like members of the military on an unexpected mission. However, there is not enough character development for the actors to work with, except for the Captain and Weir.Furthermore, much of the imagery is clearly lifted from earlier films like Hellraiser and The Shining. Although Paul W. S. Anderson deserves credit for not turning the film into an Alien rip off, most of the film does not come across as particularly original.The climax, with its visions of hell, earns the film a lot of slack, nonetheless. Heavily influenced by Hellraiser, it still manages to pack quite a wallop and will unnerve even veteran horror fans. Had the rest of the film included the deleted footage in the same vein, it would have been a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"money goes in, but nothing comes out","Lawrence Fishburne is the head honcho aboard an interplanetary search and rescue ship, and leads his crew, with genius scientist Sam Neil in tow, to Neptune in search of a presumed-lost spaceship.  Once they get there, they find said ship, but no crew, and, oh by the way, the gates to Hell.  Huh? Did we miss something here, like CONTINUITY??  The first half of the film is okay, but really falls apart in the second half.  Nothing makes much sense; there's lots of gore but not much reason for it, and one very gratuitous scene wherein a crewmember, sensing danger (no moss on this one!) rockets to the rescue, shouting: ""Here I come, (insert a really naughty word here)!!""  Apparently, if this film is any guide, in the future, spaceships will be commanded by Americans and crewed by the British; most of these people sound as if they were yanked off the streets of Liverpool.  The second half of the film looks very much like it was inspired by ""Hellraiser"", but with a ""we've seen it before"" tedium to it. According to post-release hype, a rotating passageway in the ""Event Horizon"" ship was deliberately designed to look like the interior of a meat grinder, and in this it thoroughly succeeds, but to what end?  Not only doesn't it make the least bit of sense, it's extremely disorienting just to look at, to say nothing of actually having to walk through.  Why?  No astronaut would willingly sign on to a ship that looked like this.  The pity is that both Fishburne and Neil are better-than-average actors who have made some terrible decisions of late.

Fantastic-great psychological horror,"I first saw this in the fall of 1997 when I was still young enough to partake in LSD without feeling guilty. It terrified me and everyone I watched it with.

A magnificent effort,"This movie needs more than one vision to be fully appreciated: the basic idea is magnificent, so as it is visually stimulating, almost stunning in a creation of a Gothic spaceship. Images from the architecture of the Event Horizon are to remain fixed in your brain for years to come. The worst part is probably in the script that suggest too much, but doesn't explain almost anything in the end. This seems to be frustrating for most people (even me in the first occasion I saw the movie), but after repeated viewings you start to enjoy the sense of infinite doom, of cosmic horror in a modern Lovecraftian sort of way that permeate the story and its characters.

What it turned out to be, however, was a bad movie with bad acting, bad script, bad concept and just plain bad everything. It makes Lost In Space look like a good movie. Sam Neill should stick to movies like Jurassic Park and series like Merlin where the sheer brilliance of everyone else lets us forgive him.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
under appreciated,"I remember this film getting a critical lashing and not fairing too well at the box office, but I can see Anderson's comments in the special features being true. His vision was of a film that, not unlike ""The Shining"", that didn't fair well on it's release, he hoped that ""Event Horizon"" would steadily gain followers over the years.I really don't see why that shouldn't be the case. Although Anderson's more recent films haven't been much to shout about I think he still has a great imagination and better films will surely follow from him. I think ""Event Horizon"" should eventually become a real classic.It's a great spin on 'monster horror', the irony and ingeniousity being there are no actual monsters. Not unlike other great horror's, you don't actually see the evil character in question, only the product of that evil which in this case is Sam Neill's character.There great performances all around in particular Sam Neill and Kathleen Quinlan, it's not overly reliant on special effects, although the effects that are used are timeless, excellent makeup and pyrotechnics (apart from the dodgy early CGI engine coolant), it's excellently held together with timing and pacing which always keeps you on the edge of your seat.The work on lighting especially creates the mood for a great horror. I think it's awesome",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrendous scenery,"And I like it. I consider myself a sci-fi fan and yet I fail to see the how this, as so many others seem to do, is not a sci-fi movie. It is definitely cheaply set but still quite effectively. What I liked so much is the fact that it doesn't look like every other sci-fi movie and actually becomes quite scary. There are, of course, certain flaws and among them is the lack of explanation. All too much happens without apparent reason. Simply writing it off as subliminal fear is too easy. Why do some people keep their sanity and others not? Well, it certainly has some disgusting scenes at times and being human and all that, I can't keep from being fascinated.

"Feel like slowly drilling a hole in your head? Why not watch ""Event Horizon"" instead?","In the movie `Stargate' we were brought to the other side of the universe and what did we find? Egypt. In the movie `Contact' we were brought to the edge of the universe and what did we find? Breakfast show secular humanists. And so, in the movie `Event Horizon,' we are brought to the edge of the universe and what do we find? Leatherface from `Texas Chain Saw Massacre'.This movie was bad. Very, very bad. It was painful to watch and it's painful to remember, too. Basically, a crew entirely composed of stereotypes act poorly, until they are all horribly murdered for no apparent reason. Well, all of them except for the most annoying character, Cooper. Who earned my hate when he uttered the phrase `How'd you like something hot and black inside of you?'This movie also manages to be to have too many gory scenes for non-horror fans, but not enough gory scenes for horror fans. Thus making it undesirable by all.Did I mention it was a bad movie?Oh, and on an added note, I managed to embarrass my friends greatly by actually screaming once the credits rolled on. `Cooper didn't die!'

One of the best looking sci-fi movies I've ever seen...,"...but other than that, eh.I was in awe especially with the look inside and out of the title ship. It combined a lot of the visual elements of the movie Alien and cyberpunk. It was a big, ugly, noisy, greasy grotesque thing that could be described as a floating haunted house. Which in effect, it was.I gave it 5 stars just for the production design alone. And 1 more for everything else. The acting was even subpar... from top tier actors such as these? The line readings and reactions from many of the characters were completely inappropriate for what was happening at the time. And you could get s-faced if you had a drinking game for every time Fishburnes character said ""C'mon people"". No fault of the actors but they were written as the stupidest inhabitants of a spaceship ever.Plus anytime you cue up a Paul W. S. Andersen flick, prepare yourself for truly boring and cliched 'action' sequences. All in slow motion of course.After all this Event Horizon bashing, you'd think I hated this thing. I do not. I was more disappointed at such a missed opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why so under-rated?,"There's no doubt that Paul WS Anderson isn't the best director out there but this movie itself isn't nearly as bad as some would make it out to be... In todays world of crap-fest horror polluted with lame effects and cheap scares its good to see a truly disturbing movie come along to break the trend... The movie works because space itself is so eerie, no one can hear you scream. This means that like in most horror movies the characters are cut off from the rest of the world, but in this case we don't need a crappy excuse like ""the phones stopped working"" or whatever to do it, plain and simple, we're far out in space, natural isolation... The graphic parts of this movie, particularly the recording recovered of the previous crew left a lasting mark on me for weeks, its very twisted... Another thing that made this movie was Sam Neill, he was so creepy, a man so obsessed with his ship that he essentially becomes one with it, and the darkness it brings back. All in all this movie, in my opinion, is far better than critics make it out to be... Maybe not a classic to watch time and time again, but it deserves better than what most have given...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Damn good sci-fi horror!,"What an under-rated film. Overall the movie holds up over time. The blend of practical effects and cgi hold up decently. Obviously it is a bit dated but it doesn't scream 90's cgi and is used sparingly. There are a few story moments that feel like dated cliches, however I didn't find they detracted from the movie. This was a great sci-horror and I'm really disappointed that the studio forced Paul Anderson to cut 30 minutes out. The chaos and madness is glimpsed but never fully entered into. I guess test audiences were p*ssy's and it's too bad that we will never get the proper directors cut this movie deserves. Movie was great, the trivia is interesting, and the renaissance artwork used as inspiration is beautifully chaotic. If you like this movie give Disney's Blackhole a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't store your directors cut in a salt mine.,"After watching it is clear that an extended, gorier directors cut is exactly what Event Horizon needs to push it into the really great category. Unfortunately while this cut did exist, they stored it in a salt mine in Europe and it rotted away, meaning that the only cut available now is the 95 minute normal one. While good at times and psychological at times, it reminded me more of a very tame Hellraiser as opposed to its own individual entity.Still a strong movie and a great sci-fi/horror crossover.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is Techno Horror!,"Event Horizon is a perfect ensemble collaboration of talent, which takes the basic elements of separate genre legends such as Aliens and The Shining. Essentially it's a clash of religion and science and I suppose what might have happened had they merged Aliens with The Shining.Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) and writer Philip Eisner (The Mutant Chronicles) made their finest ever film with Event Horizon, the story of a rescue and salvage ship crew employed by Dr Weir, the first scientist to create inter-dimensional space travel, whose titular spaceship sent out a distress call before disappearing into oblivion.The ship has returned and is floating dead in space just outside of Jupiter's atmosphere, its crew has vanished. Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and his crew, board the ship only to discover the remains of the doomed Event Horizon's crew and to begin salvaging disturbing evidence that the ship - which itself begins to show signs of life - may have traveled to someplace beyond just another dimension.Firstly, I was surprised over time to learn of the writer and director's separate careers. According to IMDb, Philip Eisner hasn't worked since The Mutant Chronicles and I'm not surprised. It was awful. I only watched it because I generally like Thomas Jane's films and it seemed like a good watch just by the trailer.The only other film I really liked from Anderson meanwhile was Death Race. I wish he'd just let Resident Evil die and not come back like the retarded zombies it's all about. Bullet to the head and bye-bye, baby!What makes their first effort work here is the minimalist attitude towards the horror element and the amount of work put into the element of suspense and character building. Otherwise it's down to the clean and safely used CGI and set-pieces and overall, the actors.Lawrence Fishburne who hadn't made a great film up until then since King of New York was a great choice for Captain Miller. He assumes control with ease and just gets the job done like every plain and ordinary working man's boss does, rather than try to shine.Sam Neill as Dr Weir takes the reins of the troubled genius like a true theatre legend, showing why he has been one of the industry's consistently best actors since his re-emergence as a mature actor in psycho thriller Dead Calm. Here he really busts out the dramatic and hams it up to good effect when necessary, making him very much the main event, which I suppose he was meant to be.The backing cast also consisted of some very admirable talent including fellow Brits Joely Richardson as the cold hearted and sensible Ripley-alike second in command, Jason Isaacs as the ship's medic and psychologist and genre legend Sean Pertwee as the typically English grease monkey mechanic.The Yanks gave us legend Kathleen Quinlan as the resident med tech and Richard T. Jones and Jack Noseworthy as the salvage crew. Far from retiring to their characters' stereotypes, the actors play on it well but still develop a good rapport with each other.As I remember one of the most impressive and surprising appearances was of the techno-punk band The Prodigy, who supplied the disturbed twisted metal connoting soundtrack. This served well in the film's overall theme and the filler tracks are suspenseful and heavily suggesting of just how crazy the film gets as it progresses.Since Event Horizon there have been a number of similar themed runaway successes from mainstream and B-Movies alike but rather than giving the opinion that Event Horizon had followed on where genre creator Alien had given it the inspiration, Event has managed to create a genre of its own. If you haven't seen it and you have a budding horror and sci-fi classics DVD collection, this needs to be a part of it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I will not be scared the second time watching the movie.Third impression: Trying to get some feel from Alien2 with the tough soldiers etc. -Doesn't make it.Fourth impression: Gore. -Mundane.

Disappointing but effective,"As has been noted here, there is not much new going on in ""Event Horizon"". Still, unoriginality is not the greatest sin a movie can make. In my opinion dullness would be a greater crime. ""Event Horizon"" drew me in from the beginning and created a sense of suspense that did not dissipate despite various flaws in the script and direction. These flaws include potentially interesting characters with not enough meat on their bones, and a typical ""explosive"" Hollywood climax. I agree with a previous reviewer here regarding what this film might have been had it been allowed to unfold beyond the time constraints of a normal 90 minute movie. Perhaps then the ""Event Horizon"" could have really taken us to some place new. . .""Event Horizon"" is beautiful to look at - the sets and effects are wonderfully realized - and the cast, working within the previously mentioned restraints of the script, are solid. There is some extreme gore in the film (most of it shown in rapid, nearly subliminal, shots)but I did not find it gratuitous despite its extremity.In closing I would say that ""Event Horizon"" is a flawed but none the less effective horror film with science fiction trappings.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clive Barker meets Arthur C Clarke.,"What would happen if Arthur C Clarke started a book on faster than light travel and Clive Barker finished it off?This film has a similar feel to Aliens 3, with a mixture of gritty largely familiar (to me) British and American actors. The plot is cleverly developed and adds a twist of horror to that usual SciFi quandary - how to travel faster than light.The characterisation was intelligent and varied, my favourite being Sean ""Son of Dr Who"" Pertwee as Smith. Fishbourne was a strong, level headed captain who takes over as the focal point of the film from Dr Weir (Sam Neil) towards the end of the film.There are many overtones from other films, such as Don't Look Now as well as Hellraiser, Aliens etc. but that doesn't mean it's a film worth experiencing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Only Alien has scared me more in terms of tension.There are some cool new special effects in the film and it's refreshing to see a movie where the absence of gravity is addressed.Overall I found this film good solid entertainment with Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill holding the film together nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Shining in outer space,"This movie freaked me out of my chair many times! A friend of mine recommended this movie to me years ago. He saw it at the theater and was stunned. I remembered seeing a trailer of the film and wanting to see it badly. Fact is, the film only stayed in the cinema for about five weeks in my country. I was too late, I had to rent it on video. I can imagine that ""Event Horizon"" has a scary effect in the cinema, but watching it home alone made me probably feel more shocked then ever before. What I thought to be a mediocre ""Alien"" ripoff, turned out to be something completely different. It scared the hell out of me..For those of you who saw ""Ghost Ship"", this movie has a lot of similarities, only ""Event Horizon"" is way better. I'll start with the opening credits. Nothing really special, but the music score that comes along with it; absolutely terrifying! Great work by both Michael Kamen and Orbital, who use a sublime mixture of techno, orchestra music and all kinds of chilling sound effects. At that moment I knew I was going to be scared, which didn't take long to actually happen.The acting in this movie is quite well. My credits go to Sam Neill in particular, who plays a role in which I never saw him before. Watch and see for yourself. The story is the worst thing in this movie, although I like the concept of a spaceship that creates black holes to travel faster than light. But the whole 'rescue mission that goes awry' is done so many times before, it didn't impress me much. The same goes for the ending which is in my opinion a bit of a letdown. On the other hand, it probably had a more lasting effect on me just because I was still confused with what actually happened.For those of us who can't stand any gore, don't watch this! Although most of the gore in ""Event Horizon"" comes in flashes, there are particular scenes which do not leave much to the imagination. Shocks will be there plenty for the most of us, as everything hits you right in the face over and over again.Adding everything in this film up: special effects, music and the atmosphere are the best things here. The storyline is the worst, but is still enjoyable as long as you don't take it too serious. So what's my conclusion? If you want to be scared, do as I did and watch ""Event Horizon"" alone in the dark with loud sound.. If you enjoyed ""Ghost Ship"", go and see this movie as it is the same concept, only way better and more believable.. If you liked ""The Shining"", you might consider looking at ""Event Horizon"" as well because a good description is ""The Overlook Hotel in outer space"". It's chilling, it's shocking and it stays in your head for a very long time. Liberate tutemae ex inferis! (Safe yourself from hell!) 8/10!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A creepy and enjoyable storyline...,"Few movies blend science fiction and horror very well.  Event Horizon does a pretty good job of it.  Be warned: do not look for very much depth in the story line.It uses the man vs. supernatural theme well; the characters are still in big trouble despite all of their science and technology.The set of the ship is wonderfully Gothic.  It makes the viewer uncomfortable just looking at it.It has good visual effects.  They may be diminished by the quality of the home theatre system you watch it on.  Some of the gore in the movie is a bit disturbing, however, it does add to the evil qualities of the character.Unfortunately, the script does not do the actors justice.  I know Fishburne and Neil are capable of a lot more.  We are given a superficial background and little insight into each of the characters.  They are predictable and act irrationally which is expected in most horror movies.We are given a slight bit of comic relief but it seems terribly out of place under such grim circumstances.Do not over analyze this movie; just sit back and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The film just feels cheesier and dumber as it goes but still entertaining throughout nonetheless.

This is a very well done addition to the horror genre that's a bit underrated,"Event Horizon (1997) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a salvage mission of a lost spacecraft. Once on the spacecraft there's blood and guts on the walls and no survivors to be found. As they look to hitch the spacecraft to their ship and bring it home nothing goes right and it starts to become apparent what happened to the crew on the ship.This movie is directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil) and stars Laurence Fishburne (Deep Cover), Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo 13), Joely Richardson (The Patriot), Richard T. Jones (Phone Booth), Sean Pertwee (Equilibrium) and Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter).The sets and circumstances are set up perfectly creating a tremendous feel of isolation and no hope. Sam Neill delivers a tremendous performance from his opening narration through the final scene. The cast overall is solid and everyone delivers strong performances. The science fiction elements mixed with horror was very well done and gave the movie a space Hellraiser feel to it. The decompression chamber scene in this is fantastic and the horror elements made great use of eyes.Overall this is a very well done addition to the horror genre that's a bit underrated.

What the ship entered was a chaos dimension... not hell, although it sure seems like that to the average horror movie viewer.

Disturbingly impressive & impressively disturbing,"A movie that starts out as a run-of-the-mill sci-fi creeper in the vain of Alien, this soon proves itself to be the equal of that film in terms of building and maintaining tension. The cast works excellently together, using, in a similar manner to Alien, a mixture of US movie actors and British TV actors to provide both grit and bravado (apologies for the stereotyping). While it's immediately noticable that all Sean Pertwee ever does is swear (can you find a line where he doesn't?) most of the other characters manage to maintain the tension through their dialogue while avoiding tacky horror cliches or glossing over them with enough dark cinematography and soundtrack that the cheapness of the dialogue is lost in the overwhelming atmosphere of tension.If you're wondering why I've used the word ""tension"" so much in the above paragraph, it's because that is the whole raison d'etre of this movie. It aims to create tension and successfully does so. It is also quite genuinely disturbing at times, through the contrast of suspense techniques such as empty corridors and clattering noises, with outright gore (the guy suspended above the operating table actually made me go ""eeeurrrgh"" which no film has in quite a while). I'm suspicious that the people claiming ""this didn't scare me"" are attempting to give themselses a cinematic ego-boost.As for the bad points; the dialogue isn't wonderful throughout (phrases like ""the darkness inside me"" sound a bit comic-book). Sam Neill is exceptionally boring in everything he's ever been in, including this - please, film producers, stop casting this man!

On the whole though, the sets are good, the atmosphere is great, and it does what it sets out to do. A good, solid, horrifying, horror-film!",,Anonymous,Horror

All those: Please, give it second chance. I think, if you like Lynch's latest work, you will also find a way through this movie, far away from a simple shock feeling, or a ""Woaaah"" for the special effects. The fact, that the ""event horizon"" (not the vessel, the idea of its existence) is a border, no one got a clue or a shining, clear definition for yet, and maybe no one ever will got one, makes me discuss with my friends after watching the movie for a few hours. Sure, the actors aren't that great, and you will miss a deeper psychology as well as a great dialog. But: such kind of movie got all what it needs, and all of these things are much more present than in other sci-fi-movies 'round the '90s.

"""Solaris"" meets ""Hellraiser""","Despite a talented cast, great production design and some awesome special effect scenes (the opening shot of the space station in Earth orbit made my vertigo kick in!), this is a very disappointing film.Taken as a straightforward horror movie, it delivers some unsettling shocks to begin with but quickly moves into ""guessing who's gonna die next"" territory. Yawn. One character transforms into something resembling a ""Hellraiser"" Cenobite and the ending smacks of the ""Alien"" series of films.As a sci-fi film, it could have been so much more complex and involving, but the lazy ""All Black Holes lead to Hell"" premise slams the door on a more imaginative explanation of the original Event Horizon crew's bizarre behaviour and messy deaths. Less emphasis on gore and simple shock tactics might have swayed me more in the film's favour, but ultimately the screenplay cops out of asking questions. Instead the viewer has to strap in for a derivative ""thrill"" ride. I watched the film until the end - hoping that it would get better - but I reckon that most of the budget went on the wonderful production design and the wages for the talented cast.I'd be interested to see a Director's Cut (if Paul Anderson ever releases one) but it would have to be a lot more like ""Solaris"" or the first of the ""Hellraiser"" films for me to recommend it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The makers of this movie stocked it with some good actors but we don't find ourselves caring much for the characters they portray.  Laurence Fishurne and Sam Neill overact through the whole flick.

"Theological horror amplified, teleological breakdown","To the atheists and non-discerning movie-goers, the formula is all to familiar and progressively B-grade. To the God-fearing population, it is a resounding explosion in after-life thought, sans gore of course. The ""windows to the soul"" are subsequently ripped out signifying loss and disbelief towards science and theology. The Kantian sublime is introduced, a mixture of pleasure and pain induced by a higher power... unfortunately evil, this time.

Deserved cult classic. Excellent and effective space horror flick.,"Event Horizon is at once frustrating and effective, the frustration comes in revisiting the film and realizing that while there is much to admire, there could actually be so much more. The effectiveness comes from the lengthy build up and gradual escalation to the climax that largely lets you ignore the film's failings.Realistically there have been many films set in space over the years, more than a few have aspired to including horror elements, not many have been as well made as this.Event Horizon is a promising film - I keep waiting for the rumoured ""more violent and full on"" Director's cut - unfortunately Paul Anderson didn't build on this promise as everything he has done since has far more commercial leanings, Resident Evil and Death race included.Perhaps he has simply plateaued and it is his destiny to make films with a few good bits, but generally no depth or lasting qualities - or perhaps he likes counting the money made from crappy Resident Evil sequels? ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() The Event Horizon was a deep space exploration vessel, but it disappeared on its maiden voyage in 2040. It is now 2047 and the thing has simply reappeared. This has resulted in what they term a rescue mission, but is really a ""what the f*ck happened?"" mission.The team boss-man is Laurence Fishburne (who is still amazingly underrated) and his crew include 7 other members, 6 guys and 2 gals.After a 56 day hypersleep the crew awake very near their destination ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() Before commencing the mission proper Dr Weir (Sam Neill) explains wassup. It comes to light that he was the designer of the Event Horizon, and that it is actually a vessel capable of traveling at greater than thought possible speed due to its ability to ""bend space"" to suit its needs.My argument is if they thought faster than the speed of light travel wasn't plausible then how the hell are we expected to swallow ""bending space""? Because this isn't Star Trek, that's why, sh*t just happens to justify the sh*t that follows.Once aboard the crew search for clues that may explain what happened, both to the ship and previous crew. There are signs that something is a little ""off"" but nothing conclusive until one of the younger crew members reaches the core of the ship and things go awry. To add insult to injury the rescue vessel the ""Lewis & Clark"" is damaged and if unrepaired would run out of air within a short time. Always the way.So with the young crew member Justin catatonic the survivors come up with theories, the overriding theme being that the ship won't let them leave and is in fact evil itself. Another neat wrinkle is that the ship is perhaps opening doorways to other dimensions, and not all of them are nice. The good Doc pooh-poohs such theories immediately, even as the crew openly wonder exactly where the Event Horizon might have been for the last 7 years.Shortly afterwards they manage to access the ships' videolog, which gives some pretty gory clues as to what may have happened to the previous crew. Think a picnic on the beach, only with cannibalism, self mutilation and orgies of violence and you'll be pretty close to the mark.Sooooooo understandably everyone wants out. Now. As they prep for their escape each of them sees things and people from their past, often that only they themselves know about and whose stories they have kept hidden for many years. The ship, or something aboard, is preying on their personal fears and affecting their psyche.So we get many scenes that are actually quite tense and disturbing, even though we often don't know exactly what is the problem aside from ""why is that strange new guy/kid/woman on board all of a sudden?"" There are some good gore scenes and notable death scenes that pull no punches and make me curious as to what the full-on unreleased version contained, if exploding eyes and having sex while simultaneously appearing to eat your partner isn't enough then I am confused.You also haven't seen Sam Neill like this, his Dr Weir and the ship seem to have a bizarre and disturbing synergy, and he grows very protective of his bubba as it becomes obvious what the others have in store for it.I haven't mentioned the other crew simply because there is no need, they are there to further the story and either die horribly or cheat death. But I will say that they are effective and no-one lets the team down too much. I wanna bag Joely Richardson a little but her sister (Liam Neeson's missus) died last year so I'll cut her some slack.Event Horizon is filled with freaky imagery, effects and in the latter stages makeup. The production design is first rate with everything looking suitably space-ey even though I think this was a pretty low budget film. The finale didn't quite meet the promise of the first hour or so, but before the bang-bang ending Event Horizon enjoyed a first rate build up and deserves its place in all the underrated lists that it finds itself on, even if it is a step down from the greats.Final Rating – 8 / 10. The guys on Family Guy were right. There are scenes and images that are worthy of discussion. Even if ultimately the film never rises to greatness in any way there are some small touches that elevate this above many also-rans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

chilling,"""Event Horizon"" is a gripping and chilling sci-fi horror film that takes audiences on a terrifying journey into the depths of space and the human psyche. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, the movie skillfully combines elements of science fiction, horror, and psychological thriller, delivering an intense and disturbing experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Set in the year 2047, the story follows a rescue crew led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) as they embark on a mission to investigate the sudden reappearance of the spaceship ""Event Horizon."" The vessel had disappeared seven years prior during its maiden voyage into a top-secret experimental space-time wormhole. As they venture onboard, they quickly discover that the ship holds dark and malevolent forces, and their sanity and very lives become endangered.One of the film's strongest assets lies in its eerie atmosphere and exceptional set design. The spaceship's decaying interiors and hauntingly empty hallways effectively convey a sense of dread and claustrophobia. Combined with a haunting musical score, the visuals add to the overall sense of foreboding and tension, pulling the audience deeper into the nightmarish experience.The cast's performances are commendable, with Laurence Fishburne's portrayal of Captain Miller as a determined and steadfast leader standing out. Sam Neill delivers a riveting performance as Dr. William Weir, the ship's designer who becomes increasingly obsessed and influenced by the malevolent forces at play. The chemistry among the crew members feels authentic, allowing the audience to connect with their individual struggles and fears.The film delves into thought-provoking themes, exploring the consequences of exploring the unknown and meddling with forces beyond human comprehension. The concept of a spaceship being propelled through a hellish alternate dimension is both fascinating and terrifying, sparking contemplation on the boundaries of human curiosity and the dangers of unlocking the mysteries of the universe.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable plot with dated action,"This is a movie that is full of practical effects when needed, and hindered by the poor CGI of the time.

And while this movie is not for the ones who become dizzy at the sight of blood, it is a cult classic if i ever saw one.The plot of the movie is so spectacular in my eyes that i would wish to give it a better rating if it were not for the fact that almost all of the action, jump shots, and dialog are all very dated.I will watch this movie time and time again despite this. Because I simply love and adore this movie. And I will always be crossing my fingers for this movie to be remade in the same way that Evil Dead was.I recommend this movie to all horror enthusiasts, and to any who wish to think about a world much darker than our own.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not perfect, but an accomplished chiller","After his less-than-impressive (but appropriately cheesy) directorial debut Mortal Kombat, Paul Anderson tried his hand at making a 'serious' movie with Event Horizon, and the result is surprisingly decent.  The title refers to a top-secret deep-space experimental vessel that inexplicably went missing, only to reappear - just as inexplicably - seven years later.  So a rescue crew, led by Lawrence Fishburne, is sent to investigate, but needless to say, the get far more than they gambled for.For the first half, the film does a good job of building up a creepy atmosphere.  In particular, the idea of where the ship has been, and what it has brought back with it, overflows with arresting potential.  Unfortunately for Anderson, however, this potential is never realised, despite some impressive CGI and nifty camera work.  For the second half of the film, he just relies on excessive gore to scare his audience, and therein lies the film's main weakness:  what started off by building up genuine psychological dread just turns nasty and unpleasant - not to mention unconvincing - at the end.  And when Sam Neill's scientist starts running amok among the mayhem committing assorted atrocities, the film completely loses its plot.  The performances are merely passable, with the afforementioned Neill ending up being positively ludicrous. That said, however, Anderson does manage to conjure up some truly intense moments, and there are some inventive special effects that help make the whole thing (just about) worth sitting through.Not perfect, then, nor particularly original, but as horror hokum goes, pretty reasonable.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Childhood Trauma,"The titel ""Event Horizon"" references either the end of the known universe or the sphere around a blackhole. In other words, we don't know anything about what's behind. The concept of opening a portal to hell isn't unique, but the combination with such sci-fi-aspects (explore the unknown) makes it work pretty well. Many people criticize the acting and the visual effects in this, but I compare it to other horror movies or other animated films from that era and that actually makes it look good. I probably overrate Event Horizon by a large margin, because I watched it when I was young and it almost scared me to death. But even when I watch it today, I see a solid Sci-Fi-Horror movie with a good story, many disturbing scenes and a great deal of space adventure. In my opinion, it follows in the footseps of the best in the genre like Alien 1979 or The Thing 1982. It's a shame, that this kind of movies are pretty rare these days, since the genre has so many possibilities for a great horror story.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spine Tingling Sci-Fi Horror Shocker - but not without faults,"Sure Event Horizon has its faults, but for fans of Sci-Fi/Horror I'd recommend it. It has huge plot holes and an annoying tendency to take the viewer right to the water but just not let you drink any, if you catch my drift. Referring to another reviewer's comments, yes the Event Horizon does look very foreboding and ugly - that my friend is the idea, it helps create atmosphere. The movie does deliver plenty of shocks, especially the 'Hell Scene' which is quite disturbing in all its glory. All in all its a fun ride, just not perfect by any means but it could have been a hell of alot worse, I just wish Paul Anderson had spent a little more time explaining or trying to explain where the Event Horizon had been and what exactly had happened on board, more depth would have been very welcome.

Dumb,"What do you get when you put a bunch of marketers in a think tank, and give them the sole purpose of creating ""the next big thing...""?

It's like an X-rated ""Mission to Mars,"" but with a lot more needless gore, courtesy of the appetite of America's teenage-boy-market driven media-babysitter society.

AND, I'd bring it in on time, AND, it'd be interesting, AND it'd make a return, AND it'd bring a mainstream audience back to the threatre.To me it looks like some USC film major flunkie read the manual to the original DOOM computer game, and thought they'd could go the distance with a script based on a flimsy premise: Hell occupying another dimension.Lots of blood, f-words, and a pair of breasts, if I were Joe Bob Briggs I might recommend this crap, but as it turns out the best I can recommend is that you use the DVD as a coaster.Avoid like the plague.Better yet bang on Paramount's business doors, and demand your money back.An utter waste of time, money and effort... and that's just to watch the thing.",,Anonymous,Horror

Why Why Why Why Why did the producers of this film make a brilliant film right up till the last 25 minutes or so????????

The scene where Sam Neil is in the maintenance duct and the lights go out and the red flashing strobe comes on is perhaps one of the most frightening scenes in any movie I can recall and so, so simple. This film has all the right elements in all the right amounts for the first 60-70 minutes and then it just totally derails.

'Alien' meets 'The Shining'. So there.,"I have read more than one review which has used the above statement, and upon viewing this slick but mixed bag of frights, I can see their point.Here are just a few things that this film rips off of 'Alien' & 'The Shining': - In Alien, Ash (played by a non-American actor) is the traitor in the midst. In Event Horizon it's Weir (played by a non-American actor) - The tone is almost identical to Alien, what with a largely unseen enemy and the final race against time (and a ticking bomb) - The 'inventor's block' suffered by Weir is almost identical to and is handled in a very similar (if more clumsy) way to Jack's madness in The Shining. - There are two scenes lifted directly out of The Shining - the beatiful naked woman in the bath who turns nasty and the cascade of bloodHowever, I still found myself enjoying this film immensely and getting completely taken in by it, and the FX and art direction are great. In any case, at least it steals from two good films. There were several good set-pieces throughout (occasionally marred by Anderson's use of over familiar cliches) and some impressive effects shots (the pull back from the space station and the first visit to a zero gravity Event Horizon are perfect examples). For the first hour, the film keeps impressively spooky yet keeping it's tongue firmly in cheek.The downside of the film is the clumsy scripting. To say that the dialogue is cheesy is an insult to dairy products ('we won't need eyes where we're going' and Weir's constant repetition of 'DO YOU SEE!!!' are prime examples of some lazy scripting). The concept that the ship has gone to hell is severely underused, and is really quite a good concept. Although we are given some brief hints of the Event Horizon's journey into hell with the final, squirming log entry, it never develops into the true nightmare we so wish it to, instead opting for done to death 'eerie' corridor walks and some grisly but boring 'Hellraiser'-style make up effects. Yet the film is still entertaining, and we are least given a juicy, explosion fuelled climax., but for all it's efforts it remains flawed. At least it is this good, given the pitfalls of such an over used genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Sci-Fi Horror,Imagine a ship reappearing after years of being lost in space - you board the ship to find out what has happened to it and the crew only to find the ship without a crew and seems to have a life of it's own - it knows all about you including your deepest fears! That is what is happening with the Event Horizon - she has reappeared crewless and has the new crew facing their darkest fears.A great thrill ride of a film - it kept me on-my-toes in suspense.

What can I say it freaked me out,"I don't normally scare during a movie. Frankly I found the Exorcist for instance ludicrous. Only movie I ever saw that frightened me before now was The Haunting, the original one. I think some of the reviews of Event Horizon are a bit unfair. Yeah Yeah Yeah, the science is bad. Yeah Yeah Yeah the ending is um well cheesy. But somehow it kept me thinking and left me nervously glancing toward my windows, hoping there was nothing there in the dark. Though I must admit I have a weakness for dark metaphysical Clive Barker kinda stuff. Way Gory. Don't let your kids watch it. I thought Neill was just fine.

And yet it is one film where I can still clearly remember the intensity of sitting upright in my seat as the plot descends into the chaos of hell when the characters one by one lose their minds - and lives. The film moves at a decent pace with the drama and gory horror building into the crescendo finale. A movie has to have an ending and it's not always an easy feat for horror movies to keep everyone satisfied with them. This reviewer was. Great performances by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne really carry the hell-scary plot. It's creepy, eeky and sci-fi fans will probably really enjoy it.

I hate the fact that I love this film,"Other than ""Independence Day,"" which I loved for all the wrong reasons, (It's the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of the modern era) ""Event Horizon"" has to rank as my guiltiest filmic pleasure. Its plot is rediculous, its dialogue laughable, and I can't count the number of films it ripped off shamelessly, sometimes scene-for-scene. But I love it. There is a simple reason why; I like to be scared, and this film did it. It contains some of the most graphic and powerful horrific imagery I have ever seen; visions of Hell that are truly Hellish, rather than resembling a Far Side comic or a dominatrix's bedroom. It is based on Lovecraft, possibly the most psychological of horror writers, and, like ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" another underrated Lovecraft ripoff (sorry, homage) stars Sam Neil, perhaps best in the world at conveying slow-burning insanity.Lawrence Fishburne is wonderfully intense, and the photography is excellent. This film also ranks as one of the few times CGI has been used effectively in a film.It is absolutely awful. I know that. I don't care.I will not rate this film, because it doesn't deserve it, but I will reccomend it to anyone who likes to be scared",,Anonymous,Horror
Alien meets Solaris with a touch of Lovecraft,"Every once in a while I watch a film that has been so poorly received by critics that I am genuinely astounded as to how so many professional critics can have came to such a spectacularly different conclusion as I have. Event Horizon is very much one of those films.The plot concerns the crew of an interstellar recovery vessel led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) who are en route to salvage the eponymous ship, which has reappeared after a 7 year absence. The ship's designer (Dr. Billy Weir played by Same Neil) gives the crew a very hand-wavy explanation of how the ship uses a gravity drive which generates a black hole to enable it to traverse far greater distances than any existing technology allows - a concept that is implausible if not impossible. Unfortunately it seems as though the Event Horizon's crew died in a very bloody and violent fashion.In terms of genre, the film very much fits within the sci-fi horror niche. In particular it appears to derive a great deal of influence from Alien (to the extent that both ships resemble the Nostromo). However a number of characters experience hallucinations and this as well as the theme of humans trying to interact with something they cannot fully understand also reminded me of Solaris. And when a film contains a quote along the lines of 'You break all the laws of physics and you seriously think there wouldn't be a price?' it's hard not to think of the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft in which science, technology, and even reason, prove futile in the face of vast and uncaring universe.Despite the fast pace and frequent use of special effects characterisation is not ignored. Much of the horror is drawn from characters being presented with traumatic images from their pasts. Likewise, there are several scenes where the characters clearly show concern for and emotional attachment towards each other. However given that two of the rescue ship's crew are female, I was relieved the makers of the film didn't try to force a romance subplot. It was also a relief to see characters acting in a fashion that allowed them to show fear whilst still coping with the situation in a rational manner - as opposed to the traditional two extremes of the horror genre; hysterical idiots or fearless ubermensch. In particular, Laurence Fishburne provided a suitable commanding presence as a strong leader who clearly cared about his crew, while Joely Richardson came across as an effective second in command.While Event Horizon is never quite able to reach the greatness of Alien (which I consider best in class for sci-fi horror) it did manage to sustain my attention through a combination of suspense, horror, and mystery. There were no glaring plot holes, I couldn't name a bad actor, and the special effects all hold up to viewing in 2019. I have no idea why the critics hated this film so much, for sure there may be an element of snobbery towards genre fare, but many of the same critics have given positive reviews to other genre films such as those from the Alien or The Terminator series. While the opinions of others won't stop me enjoying a film, it is a bit of a shape to think that many people will be turned off watching Event Horizon by its poor critical reputation. So for those who are evenly remotely interested in it, I would enthusiastically urge you to seek it and judge it for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

scary nonsense,"At first glance Event Horizon seems like a very scary sci-fi tale with good special effects. After the subsequent viewing however, I notice that almost all of what comes to pass is total nonsense and pretty much just gratuitous gore. The basic precept of the gravity drive is quite interesting and could be made into an excellent creative, if given to a competent writer. Unfortunately there do not seem to be any in Hollywood at the moment, so they come up with a story that makes no sense. ""Nameless horrors beyond hell."" Yeah, right. Like what? Being sliced and diced? Steer clear. Fit only for stalk and slash fans and people who don't expect much coherence from their entertainment.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

I advise anyone who is reading this, and hasn't seen the movie: don't. You'll regret it for a very long time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Producers gotta leave movies alone more.,"There was potential for Event Horizon to be much better than it was, and it's not surprising to read it got significantly impacted by executives. They should've let Paul W. S. Anderson do what he wanted. Even if the end result hadn't been significantly better, it probably would've at the very least been a bit more interesting.It's a film that begins feeling run-of-the-mill, but some of the ideas it has and places it sort of goes to are interesting and very unsettling. There are shocking and unnerving moments, but it all feels a bit rushed and choppy.I'm guessing having more of a slow-burn feel to the story would've helped, as would being more uncompromising with showing some of the most brutal moments. It's decent, and has some strong sequences here and there, but it could've been something else; feels like it got Alien 3'd.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'd love to see a remake of this movie,"First of all, I liked the movie. But the reason why I liked the movie and disliked the movie at the same time is the themes of hell and religion. The atmosphere of the movie was very good. The cast and actors of the movie were amazing. The effects were not good, but I didn't mind much. The movie had the potential to be a very, very good movie, but the themes of hell and religion made it a space + horror + religion movie. Of course, there were logical errors in the movie, but what bothered me was the depiction of hell as in the heavenly religion. If you see hell you will do some religion act staff, you wouldn't act like Pinhead :) Anyway, I don't regret watching the movie, it wasn't boring at all, the atmosphere was very good. A few things made me give the movie 6 points, not 7 points.Remakes aren't very good in general, but I'd love to see a remake of this movie, except for the hell :)Sphere + Alien + Hellraiser + Solaris + Vatican = Event Horizon.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Suspenseful, atmospheric films that mix horror with sci-fi","""Event Horizon"" is one of those movies that pulls you in with its eerie atmosphere and keeps you hooked with its intriguing premise. It's a sci-fi horror that isn't just about space exploration but dives into darker, more psychological territory. The visuals are haunting, the tension builds steadily, and the overall design of the ship itself adds so much to the unsettling vibe. From start to finish, the movie keeps you on edge, and the pacing ensures you're never bored.What I really appreciate about ""Event Horizon"" is its ability to blend genres so seamlessly. It's a sci-fi film at its core, but the horror elements are front and center, creating an experience that feels fresh and unique. The story is easy to follow, which makes the intense moments hit even harder. You're not trying to untangle a complicated plot; you're just along for the ride, which makes it even more effective when things start to unravel.While it could have benefited from a bit more character development to really drive that emotional connection, the film still manages to leave a lasting impression. It's the kind of movie that grows on you the more you think about it. If you're into suspenseful, atmospheric films that mix horror with sci-fi, ""Event Horizon"" is definitely worth checking out. It's dark, it's intense, and it's an experience you won't forget anytime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cinema viewing only,"I would only have given this movie a score of 4 or 5 if i had initially seen it on DVD, but as i was in the front row of the cinema when i first saw it and it scared the be Jesus out of me it gets the higher score (it is very difficult to look away scared when 180 degrees of your vision is filled with this film). The cast is good and the direction is fast paced, it needs just a few more original ideas to set it apart from the rest as it is certainly a rip off/rehash of Alien, The Shining with a bit of Flatliners thrown in for good measure. But it is a well executed rip off/rehash.Could be worse - you could be watching 'Cabin fever'",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better horror films I have seen in my life,"To be honest, the Horror Genre is a hard one to pull off, sometimes is too boring, sometimes too cliche, sometimes too gory, sometimes too terrifying, its pretty hard to nail a good horror film that will be loved by most.That being said this film is definitely not perfect if you want to deeply analyze its logic and every little detail, the plot is fairly simple, the acting generally good, but what really makes this movie is the atmospheric horror. If you are willing to see beyond its few flaws and really dive into the atmosphere of the movie, there is plenty to love for horror genre fans.I wanted to see this movie after I heard it inspired Silent Hill one of the better horror video game franchises of all time, don't know if its true or not but it definitely feels like it.Being a 1997 the effects won't be as good as today's standards of course but they are quite impressive nevertheless, I believe its production design is on par with Alien with the exception of some VFX scenes.I would ignore any reviews below 6 and above 9, if you like horror, silent hill and alien more specifically, you will definitely like this, just don't fixate on the flaws like the people giving bad reviews, if you are looking for flaws you will find them on any movie and it just ruins the experience, sometimes being too smart is indeed boring, but I rather dumb myself down and meet expectations or be surprised than pointing to every flaw pretending I am some movie reviewer god that nothing gets over my head, its just not fun",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scared the #@*% out of me!,"""Event Horizon"" scared the livin'...  well you know what I mean.  The taglines say ""Infinite Space, Infinite Terror"".  It doesn't say much, and it gives you the wrong impression of what you will see in this film.  After the poster and the trailers, I wrote this one off.  Then I caught it on HBO, so decided to check it out.  I suffered from insomnia after that.  IT'S THAT SCARY!!!  It's not the ship or the characters that caught my attention.  I thought the characterization was very poor (it's hard to tell or care about who's who).  But what scared me was the movie's ""monster"".  There really isn't one.  Instead, it has a demonic spirit from hell!  Many people say that this borrowed from ""Hellraiser"", but I think this was pulled off better.  It's a bomb in characterization, but it's a masterpiece of horror. I can't remember the last time I was this scared.  I mean, it really scared me!  Plus, the problem with ""Hellraiser"" is that they show you too much of the ""Hell"" stuff.  ""Event Horizon"" blasts its hell in our faces, as quick and as fierce as a strobe-light flash.  It's mean!  And at the end of the film, instead of a resolution, we don't quite get an ending.  Nor an implication of a sequel.  We get the idea that the demon was never really defeated, that the crew was never really saved.  And with that, the intense buildup of fear that is at it's peak at the climax of the film, never really leaves us!  We can't leave the fear thrown at us after the movie is finished. ""I told you she won't let me leave, she won't let anyone leave."" I honestly believe, that when the film is finished, that notorious line is true!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Long build-up of unsettling events before you know exactly whats going on makes it even more scary.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mediocre first half, creepy second half","""Event Horizon"" is still working itself out when it starts. It doesn't iron out all the kinks until the movie is half-over. The first half tries, but fails, to be creepy. However, once it finds its rhythm, ""Event Horizon"" is VERY creepy.About 50 years into the future, a research vessel called the Event Horizon just disappears. No contact, no trace of what happened or where it went. Seven years later, it reappears, and a rescue crew is sent to investigate. Tagging along is the ship's creator, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill). Once they get there, strange things start happening...The biggest problem with ""Event Horizon"" is that the first half just isn't creepy. Paul W. S. Anderson (not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson or the guy-who-shouldn't-be-making-films Wes Anderson) tries to create tension, but at first, the ""creepy"" goings on aren't, well, creepy. There's no sense of danger, and it's surprising that the actors (specifically Kathleen Quinlan in one scene) seem as spooked as they are. Therefore, the film has to rely on atmosphere to generate tension. While I'm not saying that the ""Event Horizon"" isn't a creepy place from the get-go (it is), it's just not creepy enough.This shouldn't be construed to mean that the first hour of the film is boring. While it may not get the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up, it's always interesting. The ship is just begging to be explored, and the question of what happened to the ship (and its crew) is always one everyone's mind.Acting is stronger here than it usually is for this kind of a movie. Laurence Fishburne has a commanding presence as the rescue ship's captain. This was a thinly written character, but Fishburne makes a character out of him. Sam Neill is wasted for the first half, but he becomes a lot better when he has something to do. Joely Richardson doesn't get to do much in terms of character, but she doesn't blow it. Jason Issacs, one of my favorite actors waiting for their big break, creates a dark, but amiable person as DJ. Richard T. Jones (who provides some comic relief), Jack Noseworthy and Sean Pertwee round out the cast with solid, if unmemorable, performances.Director Paul W.S. Anderson has a lot of control over his material, but he makes some blunders as well. His sense of atmosphere needs fine tuning, but even in a movie like this, he has great control of his actors. He can't always create tension, but he always has the audience's interest. This is a solid offering from the man who would later bring us the Resident Evil movies.The special effects vary as well. Granted, this movie was made over a decade ago, but even then some of them could have been better worked out. The explosions look nice, the gore doesn't look fake, and the big effects shots (like of the whole ship) are very real and meticulously detailed. However, the little things don't fare as well. For example, the objects that fly across the room in zero gravity are obviously computer generated, and the computers look as if they were made before ""Alien"" (in production time, not the setting).I know I've been rather vague, and for that I apologize. But I'd still recommend ""Event Horizon."" It's not perfect, but it's not a very bad way to waste a good hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Conceptually very scary film...,"I saw this movie in theater when I was 12 and since then it has remained in my top three scariest films. I don't think my parents realized how frightening it was going to be when they took me to see it. The film, which takes place in 2047 (when humans have already established colonies on the moon and have started commercial mining on Mars), moves quickly and gets scary fast. Sam Neill plays a scientific engineer (Dr. Weir) assigned to guide a search-and-rescue vessel to Neptune where a ship (the Event Horizon) has suddenly resurfaced seven years after disappearing. Laurence Fishburne stars as the crew's captain (Cpt. Miller) and mediator after news of the lost vessel found creates panic. The Event Horizon (which was a research vessel destined for our nearest star) was actually part of an exploratory project designed by Weir. In the film, he creates a gateway (black hole) that allows for faster-than-light travel. However, unforeseen accidents occur and the Event Horizon ends up at a place far, far away from its intended destination. A truly terrifying film that expands on Stephen Hawkings' ideas about black holes for the WORSE...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scary as bejesus,"I saw this in the theatre when it came out a few years ago, and it remains as the ONLY movie I have EVER seen which has scared me (not counting ones I saw when I was under 10 years old).  Anyway, Event Horizon is not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, but it's pretty decent.  In all honesty, it's closer to a horror movie with a sci-fi setting rather than a pure sci-fi flick.  Nevertheless, its horror is very powerful, but not the cheap thrills you'll find in a slasher movie like Scream.  The sound and ominous music contribute greatly to its effect, so I strongly urge you watch this on a larger screen with a good sound system if possible.  That said, Event Horizon is worth watching late at night if you don't want to be able to sleep for the rest of the night.",,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated Sci-Fi Horror,"This one is not as bad as the rating here suggests. I was drawn into the atmosphere right from the beginning and immediately bonded with the characters. The increase of tension as the crew approaches and then enters the ship is very well paced. The way how hints that something very strange is going on become more frequent and less subtle kept me on the edge of the couch.As the nightmare unfolds there are some truly scary scenes to be savoured. There is a very personal component to this nightmare for every character, which adds depth and originality to many of the jump / gore scenes. This also creates interesting situations when the characters try to communicate their experiences to each other. It's all in your head, right?The whole thing becomes a little inane and over the top towards the end, but if you like this genre just the slightest bit you probably won't mind too much.There is a load of great special effects in this film (I especially liked the zero-g stuff), gorgeous set pieces and all kinds of neat little high-tech props. This combined with some Hellraiser style splatter and gore - a truly enjoyable experience!If you can get over the flaws that this film without doubt has (read other comments to find out what they are) my recommendation is: lights out, volume up and enjoy the ride!Rated 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty cool and bleak sci fi shocker,"Event Horizon is a very dark and well acted science fiction/horror hybrid from director Paul WS Anderson. The plot is complex and principally involves our cast going into space to investigate and find the vessel Event Horizon. I would say this is more for sci fi fans than horror fans, but there is more than enough tension, suspense and grisly images to please horror fans. A lot of this stuff is psychological and the special f/x are outstanding. Early on in the film, much is lost due to an overemphasis on technical jargon(which sci fi fans I am sure love), but later on the film picks up and goes full throttle into dark and horrific territory. There are nods to Hellraiser and The Shining as well as the Alien series. Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neil are both excellent in this. Event Horizon is in many ways a flawed film but it is an interesting watch and much recommended for fans of dark science fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't be so harsh,"This film doesn't deserve to be pilloried in any way.

It is truly sickening in places, and there's a great oppressive feeling of suspense and wonder the first time you watch it. The visuals are impressive, well they are when I watch it on digital TV, the concept is interesting, and there are some great moments, like the visions that the cast members get flashed with. And it is very well acted in places, especially by Fishburne and Niell, the two primary characters.The only criticism I have is for the ending, which seems to just sort of tail off, and doesn't befit the film.

I was NOT disappointed.A lot of people so far have either: a) Made bad reviews about the film usually unjustified. or b) Spent the whole review slagging others off and not actually reviewing the film.Anyway, onto the film. The acting both from Fishburne and Neill is second to none and is without a doubt one of the best performances I have ever seen either of them deliver. Secondly, the plot, although not much, has originality. The film is more psychadelic than physical horror but it really can get you thinking.For horror fans this is a MUST. one of THE best films of the 1990's and I would recommend that everybody should check it out at some stage in their lives.

"""F*** this ship!""","A spaceship called Event Horizon returns after disappearing years before. A rescue ship investigates and finds evil. Evil, I tell you! A good sci-fi horror flick that has improved with age. I like it more now than I did when it was first released. It's a movie that borrows so liberally from everything from The Black Hole and Alien to Hellraiser that it leaves itself open to charges of theft. It also uses a formula that has been done to death -- the motley crew of a ship (space or sea -- doesn't matter) encountering some dangerous creature or force. That formula was never better than in Alien, although its roots go at least as far back as the 1950s sci-fi boom. So with the film's creative bankruptcy, why do I still rate it as high as I do? Basically because it does its job very well. It's an entertaining movie with few artistic pretenses. The cast is good for this kind of movie where there's usually at least one person hamming it up so badly they bring the whole movie down with them. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are the standouts but the entire cast is solid. The special effects and sets are not too shabby. It's one of director Paul W.S.

Most astronauts want to be sent to Mars, which now could be called the Party Planet. Instead, Captain Miller - Laurence Fishburne - and his crew receive orders to go to Neptune. Seven years ago, the ship Event Horizon went to Neptune but soon all contact was lost. The assumption was the crew met hazardous conditions and died. Now, a signal is transmitting they may be alive. Preposterous! Going along with the rescue ship is Dr. Weir - Sam Neill - who is disliked at once. He designed the EV and says it was made to fold space and travel through blackholes. He is eager to see what's happening. Once near the planet, the ship is damaged and the whole crew must enter EV to survive. What will they find ? I liked this movie's premise. A ship thought lost may have actually travelled far, far away and returned. But, I didn't like the resolution at all. A slight twist at the end was appreciated. Also, the film has a fine cast and special effects. On the down side, it's too violent. If you are a fan of sci Fi , you might try it. Perhaps you will like it better than this reviewer.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Solid But Not Completely Successful Fusion of Sci Fi and Horror,"5 September 2010. Sphere (1998) with Samuel L. Jackson came out a year later using the same underlying premise in an underwater environment scenario who has a presence in ways resembling Lawrence Fishburne in Event Horizon though more grounded in this movie as well as a subsequent version in Supernova (2000). But perhaps the closest psychological connection to this movie comes in the form of Galaxy of Terror (1981).For 2047, the technology (notebooks and computerization) appears to be more 2020, even though it has a futuristic but contemporary feel 13 years later after its release as well as the incorporation oddly enough of weirdly archaic looking mechanical devices with steam and grinding metal from the Iron Age.Incorporated into this movie are bits of Alien (1979) doors and door sounds and smatterings of Alien (1979) chasing and running down corridors, and even an Alien (1979) mysterious signal or message parallel and is even suggestive of the older First Spaceship on Venus (1960) or Planet of the Vampires (1965). Vague visual color similarities to The Cell (2000) and some design inside the core's mechanism to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as later scene depicting being trapped outside in the vacuum of space. The visuals in this movie particularly the first third are fascinating as well as beginning to show signs of aging with the not quit lucid and authentic integration of floating objects in a vacuum, however, the effort and the overall impact are impressive and likely strikingly new when the movie came out 13 years ago and really broke new ground since 2010 came out seven years earlier (1984). Some of the scenes have not been replicated even to this day, even with the availability of the technology - like the interior of a deep frozen weightless vessel.The explosion airlock scene is a particularly crucial scene where the screenplay and director is able to retain a believable, comprehensible consistency, a scene is actually seems to barely steer away from stereotypical overly dramatic standard of sensational horrific gore like like that observed in Outland (1981), though the final climatic scenes do have a compelling sense of suspense and drama.Additionally, Sam Neill's crucial importance in the movie can't quite bring up either by the script or perhaps his acting to truly provide the depth necessary to truly display the credibility of the horrific transformation from the science fiction genre and their a few editing issues especially when Laurence Fishburne suddenly finds himself alone in a corridor with a haunting voice reverberating around him, and even the sudden discovery of the disposition of Lt. Stark played by Joely Richardson occurs without much explanation. One of the later destruction scenes also seems to be so overly destructive, to the point of portraying itself as a lazy, convenient script device. By the end of the movie, even the bio-detector devices used earlier in the movie seem to have been forgotten as the descent into an exclusively horror movie genre takes over unlike their use in the more intense sci fi emotive scenes from both Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986).While the descent from science fiction into horror might be considered a twisted corruption of science fiction, it might also be a fascinating fusion of the two in terms of how the interaction between the alien unknown of science fiction is manifested in the human mind and perception and behavior. And where good and evil is observed, it may be the human moral underpinnings of our anthropomorphic attempts to explain what we do not understand or conceive, but what is and it is our darkest fears of what we do not fathom that result in panic and paranoia and what might be delusional creations of our own inner psychic but are just as real in an alternative presentation. Yet even with this explanation in the end, even though its seems to skirt successfully for prolong time, Event Horizon (1997) doesn't quite seem to avoid the overly simplified blood and gore horror fixation during the latter third of the movie which takes some of the action-thrills from Alien (1979) but in a psychological monster as opposed to physical monster way as depicted in The Omen (1976), The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) and particularly The Hellraiser (1987) come to mind. Sphere (1998) even with its much more tame and for some ""boring"" scenario seems to able to more effectively capture the alien-horror-sci-fi fusion or Sam Neill's struggles that were more sedately and cerebrally captured in the remake of Solaris (1972) by George Clooney.On the whole, this movie experience is interesting, sometimes scary, with a twist or two, and presents the American satisfaction of a sci fi action thriller, incorporating a strong horror element, and retains the American sci fi ending scene. Nevertheless, Event Horizon can't kind manage to present a superb fusion of these genres in a new classic form, but it can be commended for its attempt. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It´s the Shining in space,"It's the year 2047 and the ""Event Horizon,"" a ship designed to bend the space time continuum, has been found after being lost for seven years. A rescue ship, the ""Lewis & Clark,"" helmed by Captain Joe Miller(Laurence Fishburne) and his elite crew and the lost ship's designer (Sam Neill). Their mission: find and salvage the state-of-the-art spacecraft. What they find is state-of-the-art interstellar terror. What they must salvage are their own lives, because someone or something is ready to ensnare them in a new dimension of unimaginable fear. This is a scary psychological thriller and one of the few Sci-Fi movies in the last 10 years to actually almost live up to its hopes. For those of you who think that ""Scream"" and other recent horror films are frightening, take my word for it, go see this movie and see what scary really is. Masterfully balancing sci-fi, horror and action, ""Event Horizon"" is a superbly made film that feels just like a thrilling amusement park ride. With as many jump scenes as a roller coaster has hills, this film elicits the same visceral response.The film also boasts a great cast with Neill delivering a fine, increasingly deranged role and Fishburne making up for his last action role in the ""OK"" film Fled here, he strongly commands the screen and proves to be a superb action figure. Although some plot elements are never fully explored such as what's behind the ""evil"" control, and what the deeper back stories are for the characters personal visions/encounters the mystery of these elements only adds to the film's overall uneasy atmosphere. While this is an extremely thrilling, scary film, it's also extremely bloody and hard to watch at some times but that only makes it a better horror film and the best scifi/horror mix for about ten to fifteen years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ignorant, medieval mentality hiding behind big, modern special effects","This movie is basically an $80 Million dollar statement that says: ""Science = Evil"" and ""Wherever we haven't looked yet, Satan must live.""If I'm not mistaken, some New York City residents were frightened by the original subway construction because they thought demons were down there, under ground.  Needless to say, that claim was false.  And now we are treated to the Quantum Physics version of the same thing in this piece of junk.But the film's message of identifying positively with medieval notions of ignorance, fear and evil wasn't the only bad part.  There were incredibly derivative plot elements.  There was a ridiculous overuse of cheesy horror film tactics.  There were illogical action elements that seemed to be thrown in to keep the audience from falling asleep, such as the entry into Neptune's atmosphere, that just seemed to become a non-factor when the director got tired of worrying about them.  And there was horrendous dialogue that ignored all of the wonderment around these people trapsing through the solar system and looking directly at these distant planets. Finally, the film just disintegrated into gross-out tactics, throwing bloody people meat into your face.I think the tagline is ""Infinite space...Infinite horror.""  The only things infinitely horrifying are this movie's stupidity and its incredible waste of money on special effects.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Gruesome, eerie science-fiction gorefest boast striking visuals, but shallow writing","From director Paul W. S. Anderson comes an eerie science-fiction horror thrillers that takes audiences on a ride through it's dark, tasty visuals, but sadly without an alluring screenplay to underpin the stunning aspect. Upon watching this film, it certainly wasn't too difficult to appreciate the efforts Anderson displays on screen; but I could not help but notice the high amount of elements borrowed from many superior science-fiction thrillers like James Cameron's 'Aliens' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It's clear that Anderson is showering in inspiration and knows how to have fun with the genre, but the film as a whole doesn't always work, at least not too well in the narrative department. While it showers the screen with enough blood and gore to make the sensitive crowd squirm and occasional nightmare-inducing to the mix, Anderson attempts on generating a thoroughly frightening experience come with only half-hearted results. Set in the futuristic 2047 in the depths of outer space, the film centers on a crew of astronauts: Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Stark (played by Joely Richardson), Cooper (played by Richard Jones), D.J (played by Jason Isaacs), Justin (played by Jack Noseworthy), Smith (played by Sean Pertwee), and Medical Technician Peters (played by Kathleen Quinlan) on an investigation for a lost spaceship known as Event Horizon. Assisted by the creator of Event Horizon, the crew embark on an exploration to the missing spaceship, only to encounter a terrifying force that picks off the crew one by one.Compared to other science-fiction features, this one is nowhere near as memorable or inventive as it sets out to be, nor does it embrace the proper caliber to sustain a truly visceral experience. Luckily, director Paul W. S. Anderson packs just enough thrills and striking visuals to make up a somewhat exciting experience, but the suspense and horror does fall flat at times; especially during the first half. Capturing a claustrophobic atmosphere and nightmarish imagery ranging from grossly deformed human figures with gauged-out eyes, to dismembered mutant bodies, to creepy blood-covered paranormal entities; there is no denying how absurd and horrifying this movie can get as it journeys through plenty of creepy imagery that is bound to make the weak stomach squirm. And the dazzling production design of the spaceship interior and the corridors which borrow heavily from 'Alien' are quite nice to look at, especially with the decent cinematography to expand upon the view. It's too bad however, that the storyline falls short of substance, ending the plot with major questions unanswered (dealing with plot points I rather not spoil) and characters sorely underdeveloped. The crew is trapped in a ship that has been to Hell. As interesting as it is, the film never makes a solid attempt to explain what is going on. Though Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill give an okay, if flawed performances as the lead characters, neither of them manage to stand out too far above the rest of the cast who's characters are left in two-dimensional entities. This is not the stay that none of the characters aren't likable, but sadly none of them are uninteresting in a way that you keep rooting for their survival. And it definitely does not help that the writers pin the characters with inconsistently laughable dialogue.Event Horizon may not the proper narrative heft to support it's flawed storyline, but offers just enough thrills and excitement to make up for the blemishes in it's script. It is not a film that reaches the level of a visceral horror experience, nor does it even come close to. By the end however, it makes for a pulse-pounding thrill ride brought together by the efforts of Paul W. S. Anderson.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing...,"Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Event Horizon' is a cult film. It was an extra-ordinary experience. Have you ever heard a Genre as 'Science Fiction Horror'?

Great mix of Sci-Fi & Scary,"This movie was dark and scary as ""heck"" while not being just plain gory (while I will state that there are definitely several scenes which are quite graphic, I think they didn't go over the top) The reason it's among my personal favorites is the way they managed to scare you. The scenes that make you jump aren't cheap scare tactics, (ok SOME are) but most play into the storyline and enhance the overall darkness of the film. They managed to give the film a nice sci-fi or futuristic look without being cheesy, and while highly unlikely, the concept and technology behind the film I personally find to be plausible which also puts it higher up on my list. The plot was explained well and flowed nicely from beginning to end. The movie was able to wrap up the story while also leaving the ""classic"" scary movie close of ""could there be more""? Definitely best with a decent surround sound system and a darkened room! A+ in my book!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I must have watched a different movie from 90 percent of the reviewers,"Event Horizon was on my watchlist for a very long time. The reason i didn't have the time for it was because I wanted to be ready for it. The reviews about the film were soo positive. People were saying that this was ""the scariest and most effective horror movie EVER!!"" , ""the most disturbing film ever"", people said they were thinking about the movie looong after it was over, that it changed their life (yes, it is THAT ridiculous). And I continue ""creepiest sci-fi horror ever"" (screw you ALIEN), ""better than ALIEN and THE THING"".I mean, c'mon guys. I know about the subjective part about the movies and that everybody has an opinion, but i'm talking about a 90 percent of the reviews. I'm here to tell you that none of that is true.The film is super cheesy, there were scares that are straight from 80s slasher horror movies (with the close up of faces, screaming when something scary happens). The film was full of jump scares, the acting, apart from Sam Neill was bad, the music was like from a Disney adventure movie, the characters (again, except from Sam Neill' character) were very boring and lifeless. Nothing was THAT scary, nothing was THAT gory, nothing was THAT thrilling or interesting. Don't even get me started on the final 10 mins of the movied, which were the most ridiculous of all the ridiculousness already happening. I thought I was the stupid one, and I didn't understand the movie, but when I read the analysis of the story - noo, I didn't miss a thing. So what in the world was that thing with the ""scariest horror movie ever"". I mean, are you joking?? I hate when i trust reviews on this site, they are rarely misleading, but this time is an exception. The film was not that good.

Surprisingly Awesome,"There have been movies, that I can admit are better than Event Horizon that I have given 8 or 9 stars to. But for some reason, I just like this movie more than many of those. The story isn't as strong, for one thing; at times it seems a little (okay, I digress, a lot) contrived. None of this matters, however, because this is just such an awesome film.So the story itself centers around a spaceship that disappeared, and his since reappeared out by Neptune. This ship is the Event Horizon. A rescue vessel, the Lewis Clark is sent out to recover the ship, but it becomes apparent fairly quickly that something isn't right.From this point on, the movie becomes a sci-fi gore-fest, but a good one, with a great story to back it up. The blood isn't constant, either. Event Horizon isn't made to be a slasher film in space.The cast is phenomenal. I personally love Lawerence Fishbourne and Sam Neill. Neill especially is great as he slowly falls into insanity.Event Horizon is a magnificently crafted sci-fi horror film, the best I have ever seen, along with Alien. Sure, there may be some small plot holes, but I haven't been this absorbed in a movie since Avatar. There's people who rip on Event Horizon for miscellaneous flaws. I'm not saying it isn't flawed. However, as I said before, there are movies with less problems that weren't as enjoyable as an experience. EH grabs your attention and absolutely refuses to let go for the next hour and a half. It's hard to believe it was made the same director who single-handedly ruined two sci-fi franchises at once. At least he made one excellent one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A truly scary space horror,"Paul W.S. Anderson has been known for maiming some projects, namely Alien Vs. Predator. His Resident Evil films are a rocky road for fans of the game (I think they're fun, don't judge) and he has a few solid genre efforts in the underrated Soldier with Kurt Russell, and Death Race. Any missteps in his lineup can be forgiven, however, on account of Event Horizon, a terrifying journey into outer space, and perhaps further. It plays like Dead Space, Doom and Hellraiser all rolled into one palm sweating nightmare. When a massive, state of the art deep space extraction ship goes missing in the far regions, a rescue vessel called the 'Lewis & Clark' is dispatched investigate and bring the crew home. Captained by Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and presided over by the original ship's designer, Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). They locate the ship, and board her. From there, they discover that while it has been floating out there, it has visited another dimension, a dimension consisting of the last possible type of energy you want to run into. It preys on them one by one, allowing for some grotesque, shivery death scenes. There's a sequence where they check the ship's video log to find out what happened to the original crew. What they discover there will give you a cold jolt of sickening terror, and is the most well orchestrated scare moment of the film, and possibly the decade. The rest of the crew are played by reliably solid actors, including Joely Richardson, Jack Noseworthy, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs, a standout as J.D., the paranoid Irishman. Sam Neil is eerily calm as Weir, and Fishburne remains stoic as the Captain. Horror movies set in space don't often show, up, and are even less frequently effective, but this one shatters the mould to bring us raw, seething fear in a place where there is no escape, no rescue, and no hiding from the malevolent dark energies working against them.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Intense sci-fi horror,"Event Horizon 1997), directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, is a sci-fi horror film that merges space exploration with psychological terror. Set in 2047, it follows a rescue crew investigating the reappearance of the starship Event Horizon, which vanished seven years earlier. The ship's experimental gravity drive opened a portal to a malevolent dimension, leading to the crew's descent into madness.The film excels in building suspense, slowly revealing the ship's horrific past and the alternate dimension it encountered. Themes of fear, isolation, and the unknown are expertly woven into the narrative, creating a gripping and eerie experience.Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sam Neill as Dr. William Weir lead a strong cast. Fishburne's portrayal of a determined leader and Neill's descent into madness are standout performances.

I recommend you buy the score because its a dang good one! The film has some gore but it doesn't go very far. The story is good and the directing by Paul W.S. Anderson is very good. If you like the cast mentioned above and want to see an excellent horror science fiction film then I strongly recommend that you see or even buy Event Horizon today!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't age well,"I remember watching this a decade ago around the age of 10 and was sufficiently frightened, but revisiting this film 10 years later and I spent most of the film checking the time waiting for it to be over.

One of the Best Space Horror Films,"Besides Alien I can't think of a better horror movie set in space. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it when I was a teenager and it scared the bejeezus out of my buddies and I. Re-watching it ~25 years later, and it still holds up pretty well. It's not as scary as I remember, but I don't think I've been scared of a movie since my early 20's.I like the way the plot progresses, and it keeps a good pace. The characters don't have much depth, but the story is more about a ship becoming progressively more evil and why it is happening, so taking the time to give more character backstory would have probably dragged the film. The effects are pretty good for 1997, and since it was released before making everything as dark as possible became standard practice for horror/sci-fi, you can actually see what's happening. The sound design was good. If this movie were released in the 2020's we'd hear nonstop about all the societal barriers it's breaking, but I didn't even notice the casting until halfway through because the STORY is intriguing. The acting was pretty good across the board as well.Event Horizon is a must-see for any sci-fi horror enthusiast.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sloppy piece of crap,"One dimensional, very poor writing. The characters do stupid things that they'd already been warned about earlier in the movie.

This is my favorite sci fi horror movie of all time.,This is a great movie with excellent story line. This movie makes you think about what is out there in space and gives it a dark and evil twist to space exploration. The movie was entertaining and gripping at all times. It was scary and frightening.The acting was descent except that of Lawrence fishburn. He was very stiff in this movie and conveyed little to no emotion for a protagonist. Lots of blood and gore and some scene were very disturbing but that's what made it so great.I give it a perfect 10 and i wish there's a sequel for this movie. It's action packed and not for the faint of heart.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Your Average Space Movie,"I saw this movie in the theater with my friend and girlfriend, at the time, when this movie came out. We were all excited because we thought we were going to see a cool space movie. We all liked space movies. Well it is a space movie, but it also something else. This movie scared, and creeped us out! It is good. It really is and I feel it is not given enough credit. You know when you are watching a movie and it starts to feel suspenseful? Then on the edge of your seat? Then the Oh My Gosh feelings? This is it. A very good space movie but with a huge twist. When we left the theater and went to Dennys to eat, we couldn't stop talking about it. I remember that night going to bed, I had a few nightmares regarding this movie. So yes it did make a lasting impression on me. If you like space, check. If you wanna jump here and there, check. If you wanna feel suspense and fear, check. A good movie. It deserves my 9 star rating. It does. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
just not that good,"Having heard some good things I approached this with some degree of enthusiasm, but I was left spectacularly unimpressed. The film does have a few good points ie. some nice visual flourishes and design, particularly the whole gravity core thingy. However, there was just so much that was plain bad. The characters and dialogue were hammy as hell and had me constantly cringing. The whole 'where did the Event Horizon go' idea was intriguing but woefuly unexplored, not I don't think because the writer wanted an air of enigma and mystery, but rather because they clearly could not be bothered to come up with anything beyond a vague premise to attach some special effects to. Lastly, the whole thing was shockingly deriviative (Solaris, Hellraiser, Galaxy Of Terror etc etc).

There is minimum story, no character development, no surprises, and the ""science"" in this supposed science-fiction story would embarrass a 5th grader.The special effects are very weak... it looks like the producers got some new CGI software and had to try it out. Why are there random tools and objects tumbling around the ship? After 7 years, wouldn't they have lodged somewhere, or come to a stop due to inertia? And why don't the reflections and lighting match the background?Let's not even get into the plot holes. Was anybody responsible for story continuity? For example, they moved all the air scrubbers to the rescue ship, which was then blown up. Oh wait, somebody forgot they needed the air scrubbers to get back home.And what's with a ""gate"" withing the Event Horizon?

confused rehash of Solaris ideas,"Event Horizon is a horror exploitation of the concepts presented in Solaris. It takes horror cues from Alien and Don't Look Now and mashes them with Solaris and 2001 to make an ultimately unsatisfying film.It takes off from some real physics concepts (e.g. folding space) which were also already used in Dune and then amps up the gore. Many aspects of the story don't get fully developed and are left hanging.The set is elaborate and the computer effects extensive. It shows that much more time, money and effort were put into the stage craft than the story and character. Never a good ratio for movie making. It makes you wonder what the original script might have looked like.A rather derivative, disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Sci-fi Horror film since 'Alien'.,"Since it's release in 1997, this film has not been given the credit it deserves. It has a great mix of science fiction, horror, and suspense. The director Paul W.S Anderson has since gone on to direct 'Soldier' and Alien VS Predator. But I Believe this is his finest work to date. The film creates an eerie, and terrifying feel with the help of incredible set designs, precision lighting and unique cinematography. The film also boasts a stellar cast which includes, Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, and Richard T. Jones who is brilliant as the extremely witty 'Cooper', he has some hilarious one liners and brings a little comedy to a genre where you would not usually see it, and probably would not want to, but somehow this film makes it work. It works because the mood of the film is still at the front of your mind and there is always an horrific and terrifying scene waiting around the corner. On the downside, I believe that the story could have been developed a little more. Perhaps with a more detailed explanation of what happened to the spaceship of the title. However, the fact that the story is very original was good enough for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Prometheus,"I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie than Event Horizon.  While the early graphics were good, the script was bloody awful.  It's essentially the story of Prometheus, retold yet again.  Prometheus, you recall, stole the secret of fire from the gods and was punished by being chained to a rock and having his liver eternally pecked out by eagles.""Bloody"" is the best one-word description.  There's lots and lots of blood, in fact - gallons of it.  Disembowelments that make Prometheus's torment look like a Sunday picnic.  And why?  Because the scientist broke the laws of physics.I'm not surprised to find Sam Neill in this turkey, but I'm disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn's considerable skills were wasted on it.Most everyone dies horribly, of course, but you can save yourself.

makes no sense,"""Event Horizon"" is the sort of movie that could have come out very neat. Granted, there have been a number of movies about a mission in outer space finding something unusual, but they still could have done something interesting with it.Well, guess what? They tried to do something interesting with it, and the movie ended up making little sense. For starters, the whole part about bending space was clearly ripped off from Madeline L'Engle's novel ""A Wrinkle in Time"". But even beyond that, there was so much that they could have done that they didn't do.All in all, we can affirm that although the director has a name similar to the director of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", it's clearly a different person. And it goes without saying that Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill and Kathleen Quinlan have all done much better than this. Jason Isaacs would later do better as Lucius Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy and Entertaining,"A movie with mixed feeling for the premise, but still great to watch. Many argue that ""Event Horizon"" is one of the scariest sci-fi movies ever made, while others say it's just a rip off of other great space movies. It's always a gamble when the plot has been done before, but ""Even Horizon"" stands out as an original of it's kind, which could be either good or bad. I did find ""Event Horizon"" to be quite a thrill. The idea that no one can hear you in space is haunting, and that the rescue crew is millions of miles away form civilization. The special effects were done well and are even up to today's standards. Both Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne give good performances, as well as the rest of the cast. The crew is a tough, marine style bunch, but their morale quickly dies as they soon fall apart upon landing on the Event Horizon.When the rescue crew finally boards the Event Horizon, they learn that the crew that once inhabited the ship is gone, but a strange presence returned with the ship after it's long disappearance. Creepy sound effects and haunting echoes may be enough to scare most viewers, as this movie achieves it's goal as being a good horror film. The plot however, remains flimsy. There are plenty of holes in the script, and several questions are unanswered regarding some the events that occur. And many other things go completely unexplained.""Event Horizon"" earned a reputation as an extremely gory film. There are several disturbing scenes, such as a spike impaling accompanied by more blood than I have ever seen in a movie before. There are also some cool fire effects to add to the intensity. An interesting point is the way the alien like creatures toy with the human rescue team. They cause them to hallucinate and visit their worst and most frightening memories of their past, that cause them to break down on the brink of insanity. And you get to see it all as the crew imagines it. Often images of dead loved ones appear out of nowhere and it scares the hell out of some of the crew members. Frightening, but also entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!!!,"The subject of bad movies came up and this was the first one that lept to mind (tho the scars left from the trauma of seeing the movie had caused me to have difficulty remembering the title). Thanks to IMDb's search engine, I was able to figure out what it was.OK, I've used a lot of hyperbole, but seriously, this really is the only movie that I have ever seen that I left the theater not only wanting a refund, but wanting the time back as well. I'm NOT kidding.Plot holes an exceedingly bad pilot could drive a starship through. Inexplicably stupid behavior of the characters. Bad, BAD _BAD_ ""science"".At this late date, about a decade after the fact, my only clear memory of the movie was how desperately I wanted to not have seen the movie after leaving the theater.

Underrated Sci-Fi Horror Flick,"Turn the lights off, turn the speakers up, and sit back and prepare to be frightened.  This is the first movie in long time that actually managed to freak me out (and others I know as well), so at least the horror genre isn't totally dead...With that being said, I think one of the best parts of the movie is the original premise, where a secret faster-than-light ship that travels through black holes to reach vast distances in a short amount of time disappears on route to the nearest star... and comes back, albeit sans crew.  This may appear to be a copy of old stories about ghost ships and the Flying Dutchman and such, but in terms of science fiction it breathes new life.The thriller aspects do ""borrow"" from some established sci-fi/horror movies, but it works in this case, and director Anderson does a good job of keeping the suspense going.All in all, I believe this film is rated worse than it deserves.

More close to 'Doom' than its own movie adaptation,"People who were disappointed about the movie adaptation of the computer game 'Doom 3', should take a look at 'Event Horizon'. It has exactly what was left out of the 'Doom' movie, being the core concept of the game's story. For the rest it's completely different, but the atmosphere is there, and of course the scares.For people who have no idea what 'Doom' is or don't care about it, 'Event Horizon' is just a good sci-fi horror movie. It borrows from many other movies to end up with an original and quite successful result. In fact, the parts where classics like Alien(s), The Shining and even '2001' can be recognized, are so obvious that they should rather be considered homages than rip-offs. As usual, some people complain about the ""science"" in this movie, but if you've read the plot outline it should be pretty obvious that the goal of the makers was not to show us a documentary on physics.To enjoy this movie optimally, watch it in a dark room with either a good surround system or headphones. The soundtrack does a perfect job of setting the mood without being distracting. Visual effects are quite good for their time, and still look good today.

Moronics From Outer Space,"What good is a horror/sci-fi hybrid which isn't scary and doesn't seem to have even the most basic understanding of science and the rules and limitations of the physical world? Event Horizon suggests it isn't any good at all. In fairness, I have friends who consider this to be the scariest film they have ever seen, but then they did see it in their early teens.The film borrows liberally from 2001 and 2010, The Haunting, The Shining, The Amityville Horror, The Lawnmower Man and probably about a hundred other films that begin with ""the"", but most notably it seems to be in debt at all times to the Alien series. The unoriginality wouldn't matter were this an effective or entertaining film, but the script is banal and muddled and the direction is uninspired; Anderson draws on horror clichés like constant lightning flashes... in space! Anderson's films generally have a glossy yet dull look and feel, and this one is no exception; a considerable amount of work obviously went into the production design of this film, yet in the film the sets rarely look as impressive as they could and should do.In short the film is a dull, borderline incomprehensible mess. It does showcase a good lead performance from Sam Neill, and an amusing supporting one from Richard T. Jones, but neither really makes the film worth seeing. Check out Levithan instead if you want an enjoyable B-movie variation on the Alien theme.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifyingly addictive,"Event Horizon is a movie that despite you being terrified of, you just can't drag yourself away from the screen. It's unfairly knocked in many quarters, claiming it's overtly violent. I disagree - the violence is all central to the plot, which is enjoyable (in a ""give you nightmares"" kind of way) and engulfing.The thing that I found so effective about it (other than the plot) is  how extremely easy it is to empathise with the crew of the ship - the characters are such that most people watching will identify with at least one of them (""mama bear"", ""papa bear"" and ""baby bear"" nicknames for some of the crew make you feel like these people really have worked together from before). When you start empathising with characters in a horror movie, it starts getting under your skin... and because of this, Event Horizon is highly effective.There are definitely overtones from aliens, but you'll get much more of a scare from this... unlike in Aliens, the enemy of this movie cannot be shot, and whilst terrorising the crew, they can't live without it. This nightmarish symbiosis dogs the crew as they slowly begin to understand what's going on with the strange occurrences within ship and what happened to the previous crew. The more the movie progresses, the faster the frights come... and some of them are very, very effective, whether overtly (where it gets disgusting) or only in your head (where you're truly terrified).If you're into sci-fi/horror, move over Aliens, this is the definitive movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Can Paul Anderson direct?,"Having seen Event Horizon it must rank as a major disappointment. With the interesting cast and the spooky storyline my hopes were high only to be let down by a Director out of his depth. Perhaps I'm being too critical of Paul Anderson but all his films have left me feeling empty and cheated e.g. take your pick from Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon and soldier. The main problem with Event Horizon is its melting pot of ideas. It seems the film doesn't know whether it wants to be Alien, Hellraiser or the Exorcist. Eventually it just ends up being an expensive mix of stolen ideas and themes all used to illeffect.At times the film was creepy and did have the odd jump out of your seat moment, not to forget the feeling of gloom and dread present throughout the whole film. But the film was way too short and the script laughable. Given the sheer scale of the Event Horizon ship why does it take the crew 10 min to check it out and why does the audience only get to see 4 different rooms? The only answer I can come up with was budget limitations. As for the ending well what was the point of watching the film? Perhaps Anderson should try to direct more films without special effects. Maybe then he will be able to actually construct a film, not just a string of special effects moulded together with bland dialogue.......4",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hellraiser,"This is really stupid sci-fi movie with some kind of religious reference. It's not very clear what this film is all about, and I think the creators are very confused by themselves. Maby they meant to create some dark, claustrophobic and apocalyptic movie, maybe they tried to say something about human nature, limits of science and psychological perception, or maybe about the collision of religion and technology. All of those you can find here, but you cannot find that thing, which distinct a real masterpiece from just some bad movie with good intentions.My guess, whoever made this flop, they just took all the components from other sci-fi movies and combined them into one big mess. The result is scrappy, incoherent, immature, ridiculous, boring and not even frightening piece of crap.I think teenagers may find that movie tense and interesting, but people who can appreciate really good sci-fi, my suggestion is to skip this one.Anyway, using this opportunity, I would like to recommend John Carpenter's early movies, like ""Dark Star"" and ""The Thing"".",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cracking sci-fi horror,"I saw this at the cinema when it came out, my ex wanted to leave part way through as it scared the poop out of her! This is a cracking sci-fi horror from the 90's and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
THIS FILM ROCKS!,"I love Event Horizon! I can honestly say it's one of my favorite films. I know a lot of people whine that it rips-off other movies, but there are actually very few original stories out there. Hell, even Shakespeare used earlier material.The spacecraft designs are truly stunning, and the acting was GREAT! I can't WAIT for the upcoming rerelease on DVD with all of the restored footage!",,Anonymous,Horror
"There's ""Alien"" then there's this","I don't think I've ever experienced a sci-fi horror that's on the same visual level as alien. This is an absolute masterpiece in its own right. The story immerses you, the visuals horrify you and the story sends your mind into the deepest fathoms. It's nightmare fuel but done correctly! If only it found a better audience at the time of release. It needs more recognition. This film is the reason I love horror movies, I put it in the VHS player when I was about 5 thinking it was a ""action"" movie or something, how wrong I was hahaha. Yet when I was older, it dawned on me that I've experienced one of the best movies ever made in the science fiction genre. Please watch this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Intelligent, scary, versatile","I was blown away how solid the film was. This movie looks still great. Art direction, directing and the imagery are top notch. The casting is spot on. Every actor seems to be just right for the role.The story has deep levels and leaves you think multiple times which is true and which is not. The atmosphere builds up through the movie. The movie scary and gory. Unlike many movies the gore is justified to underline the horrors of the dark.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is the biggest BS movie I have seen,"Forget everything you know about science and logic. In fact forget that you have common sense at all. The movie makers shamelessly tell you a tale that's so far off from the realms of possibly that you wonder if they ignored the fact that the watchers could have brains. 
On the upside, if you want to take revenge from someone or if you're simply one of those people who derive pleasure from others' suffering ( which the makers of the movie certainly are), go ahead and recommend this movie to someone. But if you are a person with sound mental health, then stay clear of this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
doesn't live up to it's potential,"A strong cast and good visual effects are sadly drowned out by a bit of an unlikely plot, where the writers have, somewhat suicidally, combined sci-fi with supernatural. The film starts off very well and there are echoes of many other films, Alien and Hellraiser certainly spring to mind, however the plot seems to get confused between sci-fi and supernatural and the result is not convincing as a plot. Which is a shame because the acting and visuals are certainly impressive and the film builds up suspense very well but these cannot cover a shabby plot and a seemingly non-evident story line as the crew try to discover what is going on, leaving a film that is literally a bloody mess. Certainly one for the gore fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
It just can´t get better!,"I can´t understand the bad comments on this one? It was the most scariest movie I ever seen in my entire life!The effects are great, it really feels like the action takes place at Neptune. The actors are good too. Laurence Fishburne at his best!So if you haven´t seen it, then do so! If you already have, then see it again! This is a masterpiece! 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The goriest horror movie I can think of,"If you're looking for a horror movie full of gore and excitement, this is it. Not for the squeamish or easily scared. I personally loved it so much, I made a website about it. There aren't many errors, and for those of you who've listed Justin not dying immediately when he leaves the ship as one, sorry, people can survive in a vacuum for short periods of time. Freeze frame can bring the horror of the quick flashes to new heights.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Empty-headed garbage,"This is a brutal, gory, soulless movie whose best ideas are shamelessly ripped off from or shared by other films. If you are impressed by the idea of the ship having a will of its own, or reaching into the minds of its crew in order to torment them, then go see the far superior Sphere, or for that matter, go see the '50s classic Forbidden Planet. In fact there's plenty of it in Stanley Kubrick's 2001. The point is, there is absolutely nothing original here.There are some good actors (Laurence Fishburne is a case in point) whose talents are absolutely wasted on this hackneyed script. About the only thing positive in this film are the special effects, and they are the sole basis for the two points in my numerical rating. But they don't come close to saving this movie. I really feel sorry for viewers and critics who are impressed by this film. It either speaks to how impoverished their experience with earlier/other science fiction films is, or how compelled they are by visual effects alone without needing anything deeper for enjoyment. If all you need for entertainment is a lot of cursing and a few bodies liquifying or blowing up real good, then you've come to the right place.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad...,"Many people seem to really dislike this movie.  I have now watched it several times and think it's really a pretty good film, for several reasons.  First, the special effects were excellent (no one argues here). Secondly, the actors (gender neutral term here, folks) were excellent (Fishburne, Neil, and Quinlan are all big names).  Next, this film went beyond many sci-fi flicks in that there was not the simplicity of a nice ugly creature to shoot at.  Next, it was rich in symbolism (e.g. the ship being in the shape of a giant crucifix).  In addition, the sound-track combined the modern sounds of 'Orbital' with symphonic sounds which is a nice mix.  Also, parts of the film, though very graphic at parts, made very great impressions by what they did NOT show you (letting you use your brain and imagination, which many newer films don't).  Finally, the ending was not a standard horror ending, but one that took a little intestinal fortitude (aka. Guts) to use (I won't say more about why I liked the end as it would spoil it).  In conclusion, give this film a fair chance when you go to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing,This is one of those movies that you wish you could unsee. 2 stars for the good sets but definitely don't watch if you are already depressed. You have been warned.,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
I am warning you,"This movie was alright, but I am not writing to talk about it. I am writing to warn you about, a piece in the movie that will make you sick. I can handle alot of gore. But when they get to see the ships log in this movie (you'll know it when you see it) I had to look away, what you see is not gore, just extreme bloodshed, like something you would see if you actually were in hell, it might be appropriate but still god damn awful. A warning for the weak in the stomach.",,Anonymous,Horror
Brutal & Brisk,"God this was a surprise if a film, I expected nothing and reviews wise this has gotten poor reception, however I was pleasantly blown away. The setting is claustrophobic, the cast are all excellent and the plot works excellently. It's a fast romp of complete non-stop action and brutal horror that's not only blood curdling but compelling also, utterly surprising and high quality I couldn't recommend enough",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such an AWESOME movie...,"Such an AWESOME movie!!! I can't believe this movie gets so much hate.In a time when Paul WS Anderson made awesome movies. This is by far one of his best works. The cast and crew did a phenomenal job in bringing that gut wrenching horror, and its ominous tone.Love the story. Pretty much straight forward. Nothing complex. It has a working crew ship that are out to secure and bring back Event Horizon; a ship that has been lost for years. What they don't know is Event Horizon brought something malevolent that is out to them doom all to hell. It is a simple movie, but it is the outcome and horror elements that make this movie a fun ride. I'm pretty sure that plenty of people won't admire this movie because of its context and all the gruesome elements. Maybe that's the reason it gets so much hate. But if y'all are looking forward to this movie then by all means go for it because I highly enjoyed it. Sam Neill is a badass as well Laurence Fishburne.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
my notes,It was very close to a 6/10 but a few stupid things to finish off the movie swayed me towards a 5/10. enjoyable experience for the most part. good tone and creepiness. i just wish it was able to finish stronger and do without some of the old movie cliches (1 viewing),5.0,Anonymous,Horror

it has one goal. to scare you.. and it does...,"OK.. whatever you have heard of this movie, forget it and keep an open mind. It is most definetly not a waste of time or space in the movie archives of Hollywood.The basic plot (its revealed after 15minutes so it can be said without destroying the movie) is that a hightech ship disappears.. a rescueship is sent out to save the survivors... easy? nope :)When you see this movie you not just see the fear and horror on the screen. You feal it, hear it and wish it would all be over. Until a saw this movie I never got scared from whatching movies.. never. not scream, i know what you did last summer, dracula or any other bloodfeast movie that use cheap-ass gore/blood and crappy music to build tention. When i saw this movie.. alone.. at night... in my basement.. it scared the living **** out of me..Now I know why people scream.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
one of the few science-fiction-horror movies with a really strong atmosphere,"Although I don´t like any other of Paul W. S. Anderson´s movies, ""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite sci-fi flicks of the 90s. The threatening atmosphere is built up in an intelligent way and the sequences when the rescue crew is exploring the corridors of the deserted space ship make your nerves break. Even the ship itself is scary at first glance. The menacing atmosphere is mainly created on the fact that the rescuers can´t see an ""enemy"" or any reason for the disappearance of the ship (at least for a long time). -The unknown itself is the enemy and here ""Event Horizon"" shows some parallels to ""Alien"" (although Alien is far better). The score is wonderful and majestic and it underlines the horror of being trapped in space. Also the idea of the story is not bad. Acting was o.k. to me. Overall I recommend it to people who are into the ""Alien"" -trilogy (!) and who like sci-fi movies that don´t need any superficial action-stuff. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Event Horizon - Not Really Sci-Fi - Actually Bad Horror,"The three stars out of ten I gave this film is strictly for the special effects people who did an excellent job with the film. Unfortunately, everyone else (other than set design) did not do such a good job.The film fails as a story because it is poorly written, disassociated from real science and mathematics, and a waste of some of the good acting talent available for this film. This is the worst thing Wes Anderson ever did. He excels at the horror genre, and makes good money from gore and violence (which, unfortunately, a large segment of the American movie-going public seems to prefer, rather than using their brains to watch a film).The plot appears to be an idea written on the john in less than twenty minutes during a lunch break.I won't embarrass the lead actors of this film, like Fishburne and Neill by analyzing their performances. Cartoon characters do not require analysis. The movie is pretty much just a comic book translated from panel art to the big screen. It had the feel of Vault of Horror mixed with Tales of the Crypt from EC comics. Unfortunately, it was not as good as most of those stories.The universe is full of enough natural horror and terror; trying to make it scarier with amateurish attempts like this is a futile exercise in bad taste.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The scariest movie of the 90s,"This movie is awesome. The first time I saw it on the big screen in a cineplex it really took me away from this place into the darkest, most threatening corner of the universe : the ""Event Horizon"". As I consider myself as a fan of Laurence Fisburne, this movie was a must, but it also offers lots more than ""just"" Laurence back on the screen.What is really remarkable about this film is that it plays in the future somewhere in space at the outer limits of our solar system and yet it is scarier than any other horror-movie of the 90s set in our time and on earth. Paul Anderson has a fantastic skill of showing the deepest nightmares of both religious (the ""hell""-stuff) and scientific (the results of the ability to influence time and space; artificial worm-holes) issues. I have seen this film for some 13 times now and it is still as scary as during the midnight-premiere. Thumbs Up !",,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse.""","Developing a cult following for its terrific set design, gruesome sadomasochist iconography and otherworldly Lovecraftian themes, this $60 million cosmic horror shoots for the stars as 'The Shining in space', but slips into a worse dimension with a frustrating sci-fi spin on Clive Barker's Hellraiser. Plagued by many demons during a troubled production, such as its rushed editing schedule, unfinished CGI and poor sound mix, the film falls apart with gory sequences that feel torn to shreds and stitched back together, not too dissimilar from Sam Neill's hokey turn after a strong set-up in the first act. Aspects like the techno-gothic aesthetic and spooky atmosphere contribute to a sense of foreboding and dread, but sadly never pay off, thanks in no part to a mediocre Philip Eisner script and ill-advised studio meddling. Despite horrifying visuals and a host of game character actors, in particular the tonally jarring but hilarious Richard T. Jones, Paul W.S. Anderson misses the mark for a dull 96 minutes that doesn't point to a longer, better cut lost to time and space. Shame he passed on helming X-Men for this.3/10 pens through folded paper.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent ""haunted house in space"" movie.","I disagree totally with the negative review of this movie above. I have seen the film many times, 3 times at the flicks, and lots more on video.

The blood, the gore, the screams, the half-seen horror of the previous crew & Dr. Weir's dreams. And Clair's black eyes.

Awful,"This film was simply lousy. It began tolerably, reminded me a lot of Alien which I really like but got  worse and worse as it proceeded. Dialog was cliched and silly and the plot unbelievable. There was far also too much gore that didn't serve any purpose. It was a huge disappointment as I had seen the trailer (Or was it a teaser? Don't remember) and it actually seemed interesting and intelligent.  Little did I know that it was to turn into a sorry excuse for a horror film. Hell? Oh please.
