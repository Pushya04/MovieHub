A lot of fun,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Very good film has those Spielberg edges!,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400!Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Witty con man.,"From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Top-notch, brilliantly crafted entertainment, rich with fascinating details, memorable incidents and engaging performances","What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams's delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his ""manipulation,"" i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I've seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy's selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I'm especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.Spielberg's movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible. This is top-notch entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Hard to believe its true,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A film well worth catching,"'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Caught me,"One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"".Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or ""concurs"" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Knock knock, it's a great movie.","Frank Abagnale Junior becomes an accomplished fraudster at a very young age, passing himself off as a pilot, and cashing banker's cheques galore. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty makes it his mission to track him down.Another Spielberg masterpiece, I know there are lots of them, but there is something wonderfully unique about this movie, maybe it's the acting, maybe it's the extraordinary production values, or maybe it's just the outrageous, almost hard to imagine possible story.It's an incredible game of cat and mouse, we learn what motivates Frank, how he ends up where he is, and just how smart he was, even from a young age he was able to dupe anyone and everyone.Terrific production values and music, they got the detail of the period spot on, it looks amazing, and that Aston Martin!I'm so glad we got to see a snippet of James Bond, as at times it really did feel Bond inspired.The acting is phenomenal, DiCaprio and Hanks are awesome from beginning to end.

Amazing movie!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10.I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well - give the man an Oscar already! I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.There were many famous actors and actresses in smaller rolls, which I liked. Perhaps some of them weren't so famous back in 2002 (I'm a bit too lazy to do the research at the moment) but seeing for example Ellen Pompeo and Jennifer Garner made me even more interested in the movie. Sometimes, movies with too many movie stars falls flat, for some reason. But this one certainly did not!I'll definitely watch Catch Me If You Can more than once, more than twice!

Genuinely Entertaining but Overly Embellished...,"Great performances from some truly great actors with an almost unbelievable story - and therein lies the one criticism if you wanted to raise one. Because, in order to catch you, which Steven Spielberg does, and finds doing it a good deal easier than the task ascribed before Carl Hanratty, he has to evolve and embellish this story with some not insignificant leaps of faith. Fine if its a conjured tale of fiction but ever so slightly, for me, detrimental to the experience as a whole, as its not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Worth catching,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.Flowing with the energy you would expect from a Spielberg project alongside Oscar nominated scorer John Williams you would expect a ferocious appetite of crime shindigs and sharp tantalising scenarios across America and for the most part we see a relaxing and remarkable story that is hard and equally remarkable to believe really happened.Leo Di Caprio, in his first paring with Spielberg, stars as central character Frank, giving the conman an elusive personality whilst aiming to be naïve of the difficulties at home between his parents. Encoding uses of his father's charm and wit may seem corny but the resemblance between Di Caprio and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken is mirror like, giving the film a formidable consistency.Tom Hanks, in more of a supporting role, has his moments as the stubborn and driven FBI agent determined to catch Frank. Hanks uses the character's intelligence to his advantage to make his acts seem fruitless whilst all the while maintaining a key objective. Hanks even slides in some delicious deadpan expressions, the knock knock joke in the car for one arguably one of Hanks best ever comedy moments, which is quite something given the American's CV.The plot is the main drawback of the film's potential. Whilst the story itself is based on true events, there feels a lack of consistent believability, which is purely down to the messy structure placed upon it. Starting on a game show, it jumps back to Frank's youth, then to prison then forward to school years, then his fleeing, then forward to present and so forth and because of these Kangaroo style jumps there feels a reluctance to let us into the moment of the character and situation. We are just getting used to Frank being a pilot when the film shunts us to present day dealings and it is a real pain as if this film was portrayed in chronological order we would have had a flawless foundation for an endless chase without knowing the outcome.Williams' score is brilliant, especially the title sequence and Oscar nominated was a truly deserved. The title sequence matches the feel of the music so poignantly we are instantly engaged and ready for the off.The film collaborates usage of career mastery and unanswered questions to the eventual finale, that is worth catching and as mentioned, had this film gone from past to present with no flash back/forwards it would have been perfect. As it is, this is a charming often funny crime drama that is an enjoyable ride of a true story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
In Speilberg's world...,"Welcome to Steven Speilberg's world, a parallel universe where nuance, subtlety and personal interpretation are non-existent.  In this world FBI agents are stumbling lead-footed stooges, wearing identical MIB suits and porkpie hats, who enter a suspected check-forger's apartment with handguns drawn, shouting ""CLEAR!"" as they stumble about from room to room.  In this world a love scene must be accompanied by items on a bedside room service cart being knocked off one-by-one.  A conversation between two secret agents must be shot in silhouette against an ominous blue background.  A police station should be as glossily lit as a top European fashion emporium.  The precocious hero must be able to escape an airplane lavatory in mere seconds, without tools, by removing 4 tiny screws.  The love interest must be blonde, the in-laws stern, the failed father edgy, brittle and possibly nuts (Christopher Walken will do).  And most of all the hero's dubious achievements must be shown to have benefited society in the long term and any of his character flaws attributed to youth, naivety and bad upbringing. After all, this is a movie and we can't have a fundamentally flawed hero or a morally ambiguous ending.  Even if the said ""hero"" bilked countless innocent people out 4 million dollars.It would be nice if just once Spielberg could depict a story or a sequence of events as they might realistically occur rather than having to plaster everything with his trademark gloss and worn-out directorial flourishes.  It would be nice if you could come out of one of his movies with an opinion rather than an answer.5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant, especially DiCaprio","On Leonardo DiCaprio's 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn't realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on 'Growing Pains'--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn't see much to like about ""Titanic"" except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, 'Romeo and Juliet' was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his 'Aviator' performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"", or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in ""Smokey and the Bandit"". The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from 'To Tell the Truth' was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn't feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscar-caliber.

There are scenes that are truly playful, lively and to my surprise, comedic. DiCaprio executes his perky and charming character flawlessly; he handles the vibrant persona with ease.Do I even need to talk about Tom Hanks, I mean, we all know he's a remarkable actor.Amy Adams has a small but very spirited role.I came into this movie because of the actors and came out immensely delighted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Going Places,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, ""Catch Me If You Can"" zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a ""To Tell The Truth"" clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think.""You know why the Yankees always win?"" asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). ""It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes."" Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.Does ""Catch Me If You Can"" go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give ""Catch Me If You Can"" a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Slick and enjoyable story telling,"When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home.  He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.Based on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.The presentation is good.  Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.The cast is good even if they aren't all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Catch Me If You Can really hits the ground running with a dynamic faux-retro animated title sequence followed by an introduction to the father's con-man ways. Christopher Walken does well in his own awkward way, but it's Leonardo Dicaprio who really exudes the boyish charisma needed to bamboozle everyone. His improvised schemes combined with his immaturity lead to an endless series of ever-escalating moments where he twists his plans on the fly to escape the FBI, surprising the audience constantly. Lesson learned: It's amazing what he can get away with just by wearing the right kind of uniform and keeping his head high.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Good popcorn movie,"An all-around good movie worth seeing.  The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved.  He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Think ""Pretender"" (the television series) but based on real events.  The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].

They are so fake. Same goes for the anyone who sees Abagnale as a pilot - who ever behaved (or does behave) that way when they saw an airline pilot in uniform?

"Captivating DiCaprio, engaging story","CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) **** Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Frank John Hughes, Brian Howe, John Finn, Jennifer Garner.  DiCaprio gives a grandly charming performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. a teenager who adopted the professional guises of airplane pilot, physician and lawyer to front his check kiting schematic modus operandi during the 1960s and eventually making the FBI's most wanted list by bilking millions until his capture and imprisonment.  Based on Abagnale's best-selling memoir and adapted with lean storytelling by Jeff Nathanson, the film never lets up in the giddy cat-and-mouse/Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote relationship between fugitive DiCaprio and amalgamated FBI square Hanks (replete with thick as clam chowder Boston accent, dorky specs and porkpie hat) one step behind his two-steps ahead prey and a unique dynamic of a father/son esthetic.

"""A Deep Dive into Deception""","Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can is a thrilling ride through the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young con man with an uncanny ability to impersonate others. The film masterfully intertwines the cat-and-mouse chase between Frank and FBI agent Carl Hanratty with a poignant exploration of identity and belonging.Frank Abagnale Jr., brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a complex character driven by a desire for family and acceptance. His father's financial troubles and his parents' subsequent divorce trigger his escape into a world of deception. From a teenage runaway to a successful pilot, doctor, and lawyer, Frank's ability to forge documents and assume new identities is astonishing.Tom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Carl Hanratty, the dedicated FBI agent tasked with catching Abagnale. Despite the obvious differences between the two, a strange camaraderie develops as their paths continuously intersect. Hanratty's pursuit of Abagnale becomes a personal obsession, fueled by a mix of professional duty and a genuine interest in the young con man.The film is filled with iconic scenes that showcase Frank's audacity. His first flight as a pilot, his romantic entanglement with a nurse, and his elaborate schemes to defraud banks are both thrilling and audacious. However, beneath the glamorous façade, the film explores the loneliness and emptiness that accompany Frank's lifestyle.The film's production design is impeccable, transporting viewers to the glamorous world of the 1960s. The costumes, set pieces, and cinematography are all top-notch, immersing the audience in the era. John Williams' score adds another layer of sophistication to the film, perfectly complementing the on-screen action.Beyond its thrilling plot, Catch Me If You Can delves into deeper themes of identity and belonging. Abagnale's relentless pursuit of different identities can be seen as a desperate attempt to find a place in the world. The film offers a poignant exploration of the complexities of human nature and the consequences of our actions.A turning point occurs when Frank's father, played by Christopher Walken, dies. This event profoundly affects Frank, forcing him to confront the consequences of his actions. The film's climax is a tense standoff between Frank and Hanratty, ultimately leading to Frank's arrest.Surprisingly, the film doesn't end with a prison sentence. Instead, it takes a more optimistic turn. Frank becomes an invaluable asset to the FBI, using his expertise to help them catch other con artists. The final scene, set years later, shows Frank and Hanratty sharing a meal, their complex relationship transformed into a mutual respect.Catch Me If You Can is more than just a crime thriller. It's a character study that explores themes of identity, family, and redemption. The film's ending suggests that even the most unlikely individuals can find a place in the world, albeit through unconventional means.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Like Father, Like son","This is a very good dramatic film. Frank W. Abignale is a successful con man. Sometimes he uses his skills by design; sometimes he uses it to get away from threats to his identity. This is a young man who is so traumatized by his parents' divorce, but because his father knew how to con people, he learned to do what his father did. He is not a mere con man, but a young guy with incredible skills. He passes himself off as a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, and on and on. Leonardo DeCaprio plays Abignale and Tom Hanks is the rather humorless FBI agent who makes Frank his number one project. The interaction is interesting because the two begin to like each other. Abignale actually starts to find a father figure in Hanks' character. This is based on a real character, the object of an autobiography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Going Places,"When I first watched this, I was not too fond of it as I remember. I did not like it as much as I did now with the rewatch or second viewing one might say. I would not have said that I didn't like it from a technical point of view, but I think I was in a ""don't like Di Caprio"" phase. Which is something unfair - especially to the movies he has made. Don't know his personality, but that wasn't the reason I wasn't fond of him - it was just the usual reaction to someone being hailed as the end all and the best and so forth.Which I reckon you can still disagree, but he is a great actor. His private escapades aside, it is about his acting and nothing else. Well in this case it is about a real life character and story ... and what a funny and great one it is too.

Entertains and amuses the audience.,"Directed by Steven Spielberg, who achieves with this film another success for his already long list of cinematic successes, this film is based very slightly on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a well-known American con man who, in his youth, stood out for the skill with which he forged checks, to the point of working today as a security consultant in this sector. The film follows the origins and life of the main character, as well as the original and daring way in which he escapes justice until he is invariably caught.In addition to being an extremely fun movie to watch, with a game of cat and mouse full of comedic moments and some familiar melodrama to add some dramatic density to the main character, it has two extraordinary actors at an excellent time in their careers: Leonardo Di Caprio is charismatic, talented, and still young enough to give life to a teenage character; Tom Hanks appears more restrained and in a role of maturity but charged with charisma and personality Both actors are good and complement each other, sharing the protagonism and creating a good and pleasant collaboration to feel. The film also features Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in secondary roles. Walken stands out particularly, with an appealing character and dialogues loaded with impact and meaning.I didn't feel that the film stood out for the more technical aspects. Its value is based on the performance of the actors, the story told and the way it entertains and entertains us. However, it is a film directed by Spielberg and that usually means quality: in fact, the film has excellent cinematography and was very well shot. The color, the light, all the camera work and editing were done with excellence and attention to detail. Because it is a film set in the Sixties, it also has a series of details that transport us to that time (used cars, scenarios and furniture that are emerging, the presence of some iconic brands and emblems of the time, namely in what concerns commercial aviation, clothes and costumes, fashion and hairstyles), which exude credibility, verisimilitude and historical rigor. I believe that I must also highlight the ingenious and fun way in which the initial credits were conceived, being an element that, right from the beginning, announces the tone and ambience of the film we are going to see. Last but not least, the good soundtrack, signed by John Williams.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Pretty Interesting Look At An Impersonator,"This is kind of an odd story, another one of those based-on-a-true life tales. This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending. The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio (as ""Frank Abagnale"") taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls. This guy was no hero, believe me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Stay Awake If You Can,"Perversely, this movie would actually have to be better for me to dislike it. As it is, it's just too boring to care about. Good cast and crew, likeable production values, no complaints there - but there's also no story, no believability, no suspense, no interest, no ANYTHING.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a one note performance in which he looks cute (whoa - THERE'S an Oscar caliber stretch, huh?) but tells us nothing about the character. Tom Hanks apparently decided to give nothing to this performance except some extra time at an all-you-can eat buffet. He's a slightly chubby cop obsessed with catching Leo for no particular reason; he doesn't even dislike Leo, nor is anyone else in the FBI apparently even interested in catching this ""master criminal.""But worst of all, Leo's character impersonates a doctor, a pilot, and a criminal attorney...and yet we don't see him get caught in a tight scrape even once. As this is a real life story, surely the real Frank Abagnale had many hilarious or suspensful ""near misses"" - so why have they all been cut from this film? Leonardo postures in costumes; Hanks follows at a walking pace (with virtually no police procedural techniques shown); no one particularly cares if Leo's character is ever caught or not. (Worse still, in the opening five minutes of the film, you ALREADY KNOW whether or not he got caught, and who (if anyone) caught him). Peg this one at ""zero"" on the old suspense meter.This seemed like a not particularly well-done TV movie, done for not a particularly prestigious network. A definite disappointment for all involved (even John Williams' score is lame).  I'd say to wait for this one to hit the 99¢ rental rack...and then ""Catch It If You Must.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare.,"Catch Me If You Can is the screen adaptation of the autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), renowned as one of America's youngest and most successful con men. The story tells how Frank Jr. steals over four million dollars by forging checks while impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, all before his nineteenth birthday. The film also stars Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI special agent assigned to track down Frank Jr. By telling this cat-and-mouse story from both the perspective of the cat and the mouse, director Steven Spielberg shows that hard work and honesty are more rewarding in the long run than any get rich quick scheme.The theme of Catch Me If You Can is best illustrated in scenes involving Frank Abagnale Jr. and Frank Sr., played by Christopher Walken (nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). In one scene Frank Jr. treats his father to dinner in a fancy restaurant, where he tries to make a gift to his father of a brand new Cadillac. Although Frank Jr. has been forging checks and only posing as an airline pilot, he lies to his father and tells him that he has become a co-pilot for Pan-American airlines. By lying to his father, Frank Jr. shows that he understands the values his father has tried to teach him, even if his actions don't reflect those same values. Although he has stolen everything he has, Frank Jr. knows that he can only gain his father's approval by posing as someone who is hard working and respectable.In a later scene Frank Jr. meets with his father to announce that he's getting married. When Frank Sr. reveals that he knows that his son is wanted by the FBI, Frank Jr. begs his father to make him stop. Frank Jr. storms out of the bar when his father encourages him to continue running from the law. Frank Jr.'s reaction shows that he regrets his choice of a life of crime and wants to stop running.By showing Frank Jr. as regretful and ready to stop committing crimes, the audience is allowed to develop some small amount of sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic character. This ploy has been used by writers of the heist and con-man genres for years, for example 2001's The Score, and 2003's Matchstick Men.Spielberg uses many film elements to illustrate the theme in Catch Me If You Can. For example, When Frank Sr. is accepting an award honoring his hard work, he is filmed from a low angle. In contrast Frank Jr. is filmed from a high angle in the same scene. The combined effect of these two angles is to place Frank Sr. on a pedestal in his son's eyes.Catch Me If You Can is a twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a smooth-talking con man who stays several steps ahead of the plodding FBI agent who pursues him. But by the end of the film we see the tortoise's deliberate effort pay off as he finally catches up to the exhausted hare.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The ensemble cast in a Spielberg movie which happens to be a biography would be nothing less than good, true to keeping the name high, Catch me If u can is a terrific watch for those who love biographies and for those who enjoy quality movies.Leonardo Caprio And Tom hanks teaming up with Spielberg was more than enough for me to watch it way back like a decade ago. And never feel tired watching it even today, for its all handsomely shown, those life pictures of a con man from real life. Frank Abagnale JR would be your real life hero instantly, cant think of another person portraying Frank than Caprio, hes just handsome and his behavioral acting would have helped a lot in it. The music was tricky with a mystical feel adding tempo to the chase and tricky parts in the movie.When a hearty biography is directed by Steven Spielberg cant complain about a flaw anywhere, but to be fair, it wasn't that engrossing as a Schindlers List - i know its stupid to even compare- and would be able to give only a 8 though i thoroughly enjoyed it",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

No narrative execution value.,"The production does its part to make the film engaging. The script certainly benefits from this.Although the soundtrack is weak, the production overall is very good and creates an eloquent sense of anticipation for the film's unfolding.But the plot is weak - there is no value in the execution of the premise.I don't understand the context of the scams at all; the scams don't have the role of surprising the viewer with the genius of the protagonist; there is no good message and drama to make the escalation worthwhile only.So it can get tiresome, or at least demotivating. In terms of the chase there is also nothing to rate above average. There is fan-service here and there, but in the end:The film has no valuable narrative purpose, does not seek to specialize in any of the areas that could make the script more consumable and interesting.Good direction, good dialogue delivery, and good acting is what the film managed to deliver to me.Finally, it can leave an unpleasant feeling by making you feel disbelieving about several things that are happening, only slightly comforting because it is based on someone's real life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A Great Film,"Catch Me if You Can is a fast-past adventure, but a major departure from Spielberg's usual films involving dinosaurs and aliens. Spielberg shows in this film that he is more than capable of creating an entertaining film without the use of expensive special effects. The film is a biographical true crime film depicting the life of conman and counterfeiter, Frank Abagnale. As a teenager, Abagnale began a crime spree that would result in him cashing over $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and take on the false identities of a pilot, pediatrician, lawyer and college professor. In the film, Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins his crime spree after his parent's divorce. When he is faced with deciding which parent will retain custody he decides to run away. Throughout the film, Abagnale uses various identities including that of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer to facilitate his check cashing schemes. It's clear that Abagnale hopes that with enough money he can somehow reunite his separated parents. Throughout the narrative, Abagnale is hounded by FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows a begrudging respect for the young con artist. The development of their relationship is very believable and adds a lot of depth to the overall narrative of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio masterfully takes on the challenging role of Abagnale simultaneously illustrating to the audience Abagnale's genius (albeit misguided) and his naivety regarding his family. Christopher Walken provides great acting as Abagnale's father while Tom Hanks provides his usual great acting acumen portraying an FBI agent who becomes a father figure to the troubled Frank Abagnale. If there is one aspect of where the film fails is its failure to truly analyze the real Frank Abagnale's motives. The motivations of Abagnale are romanticized throughout the film as a young boy who naively believe he can bring his parents back together. The real Abagnale wasn't so innocent and was far more motivated by women and using his ill-gotten wealth to meet beautiful young women all over the world. This weakness is rather small and takes away none of the entertainment value that the film has to offer. This film is incredibly well acted and is a rare true crime film that deviates from the expected blood and gore of the drama usual of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.,"When his parents announce they are going to divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) runs away from home and embarks on a career as a conman. Originally only armed with some blank cheques, Frank cons his way into being airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and into a couple of million dollars. But hot on his trail is dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).Frank Abagnale Jr. a real guy, who did these real things. Sure there's some liberties taken with the adaptation from Abagnale Jr's own book, but regardless it's a fascinating story that transfers very well to the screen. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is perhaps a touch overlong as he slots in an on going father/son relationship that didn't happen, a classic broken home theme close to his heart of course. But this is no popcorn fodder piece. It's a black comedy that's tender at times but also also rather moving, even as the humour starts to kick in, we get plenty of reminders that Frank is running not just from the law, but also his unhappy past. There's no shirking from some of the darker aspects in the tale too. Infidelity, abortion and parental pressure all show their faces, never mind the troubling point of airline security eh!.Clocking in as it does at over two hours, the plot and its little thematics required the highest calibre of acting talent to keep the audience interested. Here's Spielberg's trump card. A fine ensemble gather and reward the bearded one with some of their best work. Certainly DiCaprio hasn't been this good since Titanic, while Hanks continues to live up to the Jimmy Stewart of his generation tag with another, yet different, everyman performance. As for Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Senior, well, get the hankies ready for you will have to have been cut from granite to not let Walken pull your emotional strings. Good support comes from Martin Sheen & Amy Adams, while Jennifer Garner pops in for a sultry and sensual little cameo.A great story is given exceptional treatment by some of Hollywood's biggest hitters.

How meaningful the relation between parents to their children,"Everyone see movie and try to find out a part of stories that match their own, I mean personal life.

An entertaining film,"This movie is about the making and doings of an incredible con-man. The movie should NOT be seen as a biography of the real con-man (assuming that his co-authored autobiography is for real), since the interesting psychological background is made up and some of the incidents are fictitious. The movie uses a couple of framing devices to get started: the hunter goes to a French jail to get the hunted and take him back to the United States; the hunted is introduced on ""What's My Line"" ( a popular mid-century U.S. t.v. show). Then there is a flash-back to the hunted's childhood, and we watch his development into a con-man.The pacing and characterizations are well done, and the viewer is kept pleasantly off-balance by both situations and switching empathy for the hunter and the hunted.The period items (like the ""What's My Line"" bit, clothing, cars, ways of talking) do more than just ring true: they draw viewers back into that time and place.Although the film is primarily entertainment, the story it tells gives one pause more than once. What does it mean that a teen-ager could pass himself off as a professional in various fields? Was he really driven to do what he did, or was he simply a rogue?

Hey, it even has Steven Spielberg directing with a huge budget!The story as it was told in the publicity for the movie left me filled with anticipation because I could not understand how a teenager could do what Frank Abagnale is reported to have done, and after watching ""Catch Me If You Can"" I still don't know how he could have done what he is supposed to have done.Obviously this is a big problem, and the problem exists because Spielberg does not understand how Abagnale could have done these otherworldly things.Spielberg took the lazy way out; he decided that because the events are supposed to be ""true"" (hey the FBI says they are!) he as director was under no obligation to convince us.Wrong!If you want to see a great ""con"" flick see the film masterpiece known as ""The Sting"". That was not ""based on a true story"" and thus George Roy Hill understood that for the film to work he had to make us believe that Redford and Newman could pull off such a caper and he succeeded so well that under repeated viewings we have no doubt that these two could both devise such a plot, find the ""talent"" to do the job and lead them successfully to the end.In ""Catch Me If You Can"" Tom Hanks playing the FBI agent who tracks Abagnale around the country and in Europe (though he apparently went to South America as well and Spielberg or not South America never seems to fit into the budget) asks Abagnale to the very end how he passed the Bar exam to be an attorney in Louisiana.We never get a believable answer. After 2 hours and 22 minutes we don't know how a teenager could work as a doctor in a hospital (and in a supervisory capacity over other doctors no less!) or become a prosecutor (!) in Louisiana.What you will get though is all the ""big budget Spielberg"" that you could expect along with all the other Spielbergisms that you are familiar with. That's the problem with ""Catch Me If You Can"", it's a story that needed the recently departed George Roy Hill, but instead was bought by the director of ""The Color Purple"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Spielberg Gets Back to the Basics.,"Steven Spielberg got up from a short slump (""A.I.--Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Minority Report"", which were both minor disappointments) with this enjoyable little film that is a lot darker and more dramatic than it appears on the surface. Teenager Leonardo DiCaprio is going through a crossroads in life as his parents (Oscar-nominee Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) are about to divorce. Baye wants a divorce to marry James Brolin (who DiCaprio does not care for at all) and it seems that the youth must decide himself who he wishes to live with. DiCaprio instead decides to run off and quickly gets an idea to be a con-artist. Thus he has a long run throughout the majority of the 1960s as he cons his way towards $2.5 million over 26 countries. He poses as a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer as the years pass by. He falls in love with the naive Amy Adams, has a run-in with her hard father (Martin Sheen) and continues to elude the pesky agent on his tail (another brilliant turn for Tom Hanks). Through it all, DiCaprio continues to keep tabs on Walken (who dramatically changes economically and personally as the film progresses) and grows to respect and like Hanks and the challenge he poses. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another film about the strong bond between fathers and sons, much like the superior ""Road to Perdition"". Spielberg's solid direction and an interesting screenplay just adds to the performances of DiCaprio and Hanks. However, it is Walken who steals every scene and adds the heart the film desperately needed. Although his screen-time is not overwhelming, he dominates when in action (not an easy thing to do over the two superstars). Overall I did like the film very much, but the tone and pacing is imperfect. Still a very successful venture in the end. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
This movie is a keeper....,"Catch me if you can is the story of a true fake, and is cleverly told through the fine acting performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. There is a great supporting cast too especially Frank Abagnale Senior played by Christopher Walken who is hilarious when he lies, and who's character along with Dicaprio's I generally sympathized for despite always trying to scam the authorities. I thought the chemistry between Leonardo's character (Frank Abagnale Jr) and Carl Handraty played by Tom Hanks was great to watch. The story is a bit hard to believe but if anyone can get away with passing as a Lawyer, Doctor, Secret Service Agent and Pilot its Leonardo, and if anyone can make a knock knock joke funny its Tom hanks. This movie is a keeper.... 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Very Entertaining!,"Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film. Even though there is not much action, the whole dilemma of the con artists is good enough. The plot is about a con artist named Frank Abagnale Jr and the way he tried to avoid authorities including Carl played by Tom Hanks. The acting in this film is very good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece!,"'Catch Me If You Can' is a Cinematic Masterstroke. A Stunning Film, that doesn't lose your attention for even a minute. Steven Spielberg delivers one of his finest films in 'Catch Me If You Can'! And The Performances, are WOW!'Catch Me If You Can' is based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor.Bringing the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr. on celluloid is not an easy job. Abagnale, Jr. in his prime was a man who had a vision many didn't. He had the talent & skill many aren't blessed with. His notorious yet adventurous journey, luckily, unfolds, brilliantly in here. Even cinematically, Abagnale, Jr.'s Life turns out to be one hell of a roller-coaster ride!Steven Spielberg's Direction, is Marvelous. He handles this journey with amazing ease & excitement. He creates a puzzle, which he solves eventually, and he solves it strikingly. Jeff Nathanson's Adapted Screenplay is amazingly entertaining. Cinematography by Janusz Kamiński, is stupendous. Editing is sharp. Music by John Williams, is excellent. Art & Costume Design, are worth a mention.Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio gives a mesmerizing performance as Abagnale, Jr. The Actor embodies the Genius & Carries the film on his shoulders. Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent who pursues Frank for most of the film, is extra-ordinary, like always. Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., is quite astonishing. Martin Sheen is first-rate, while Amy Adams proves her caliber yet again. Nathalie Baye is effective. James Brolin does his bit well. Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo & Elizabeth Banks are noticeable in cameos.On the whole, 'Catch Me If You Can' is A Masterpiece! This is what Cinema is all about!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
An absolute blast,"I love sitting down to watch a movie, not expecting much, and then being pleasantly surprised by what a great movie it was. That is just the case with Stephen Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most successful and intelligent con men of all time. When Frank is sixteen his father runs into problems with the IRA and loses his entire fortune, which also prompts his wife to leave him. From then on Frank vows to earn back his father's savings. He does so through a slightly (i.e. extremely) illegal manner. Check fraud. Frank travels the world taking on different personas, faking work as a pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc. But once the money he is illegally earning starts to build up, red flags go up for the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty, played so well by Tom Hanks, sets out on an obsessive quest to chase down and capture Frank.The film is clever, quick, and an absolute blast.The nice thing about Catch Me If You Can is that it doesn't take itself too terribly seriously. It is more of a lighthearted film with a serious undertone. This film is actually really funny at times before it grows into a more serious story of character development and winding plot progression. But from start to finish it manages to retain a feeling of witty intelligence that stays smart and intelligible, but also entertaining and fun. The film never gets unbearably boring, even when it slows down for more serious plot points. It is 140 minutes long so certain things are a bit drawn out and I can't say that every scene has a major purpose, but it's always fun and always entertaining.I have a certain asphyxiation with con and heist films, so Catch Me If You Can is sort of a dream come true for me. It is every single thing about great and clever cons wrapped into one film. Watching Frank Abagnale work is like magic. The situations he talks his way out of and the ways he manages to get around certain things is uncanny. The film is based on a true story so I'm not sure what about his cons is true and what is exaggerated, but it all makes for great entertainment. There's something so inherently fascinating about the way he manipulates people through ingeniously subtle psychology and the way it works seamlessly, most of the time at least.The film also succeeds by adding a new layer to a typical con film. It makes its incredibly clever and devious protagonist human. A lot of films portray the con man as a flawless machine that works everything out so perfectly and executes every minute detail without a single issue, so much so that they are more of a gimmick than an actual character. The character of Frank Abagnale is truly human, complete with all of his inner turmoil and realistic flaws. Throughout the film he grows more and more troubled as the law gets closer and closer to him. We see a very human transformation that is as touching as it is fascinating. By the end of the film we love this character not because he is a clever genius, but because he is human.If I had any tiffs with the film they would be that it runs a little long and some of the logic doesn't always add up. But it's nothing to make me dislike this film in any way. It was a blast to watch and a joy to reflect on. Strong performances helm the film while a great atmosphere and wonderfully intelligent character development make its roots run deeply sincere. This film is one of the most human con man stories I have ever seen and for that it deserves a hefty amount of credit. This is a fantastic film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch Me If You Can is a classic cat-and-mouse chase that feels refreshingly whimsical.,"Spielberg is damn versatile. He is able to craft some of cinema's hard hitting dramas (Schindler's List), biggest blockbusters (Jurassic Park) and child-friendly tales (E.T.). This film is rather overlooked in his filmography, which surprises me considering the talent on screen. Part biopic and dramatisation of Frank Abagnale Jr's youth where he was able to utilise the power of deception to successfully disguise himself as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor in order to check in cheques. The youngest counterfeiting fraudster in America at the time. The greatest compliment I can give the story, is that it doesn't take itself seriously. This could've been a melodramatic crime thriller, but instead Spielberg twists the style and turns it into an exciting watchable chase that consistently put a smile on my face. Would it have been more poignant and resonating if it was powerful? Perhaps, but the film successfully entertains and sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended). There was only one actor who could pull off the suave deceptive con artist, and that's Leonardo DiCaprio. An absorbing performance that gave him an opportunity to be slightly cheeky yet maintain a sense of class which I'm sure paved the way for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. I loved the use of psychology and how the human mind can be convinced through simple sleight of hand gestures. A story of how living in a lie can often feel better than residing in reality. Utilising false identities to reinvigorate one's self and change their way of living, albeit being extremely illegal. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent tasked with hunting down Frank Jr with what is one of his lighter performances. A young Amy Adams was also likeable. Spielberg is a chameleon. He can take any genre and create an excellent film without the need of over-stylisation. His techniques just blend in. Also, the opening credits scene was hypnotising, adored the animation. An irresistible light hearted tale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

it did make money over its time... entertaining,"...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush.Catch..is inspired by the story of Frank W. Abignale Jr., who as a teen became a con-man, impersonating an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc, and was finally caught in France. DiCaprio plays Frank, and tries to play him as a suave, if occasionally panicked, teen, and while there have been worse performances this year, it is very clear that the better work for him is in Gangs, not here- he's often too straightforward with his emotions and only hints to that he's someone outside of a conniver. Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job, with a keen accent and demeanor, and Christopher Walken, who plays Abignale Sr., turns in the best performance of the film, and shows more depth than his son in the few scenes he has.Overall, there are some moments of fun that shine through, like when Frank Jr. does his first con as a school teacher at 16, or when he fools Hanks at the Miami airport, yet it can be seen in many scenes that more challenging material was manipulated by Spielberg and company. Still, it should appeal to the mass market of movie-goers.....this is a re-edit some four years later. On repeat viewings, the film works better. DiCaprio actually works as more effective with his character, and even Hanks becomes more interesting than just 'decent'. B+",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"An Impressive Cast and a Well Thought Out Story,","Catch Me If You Can is an amazing movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg, who puts so much detail, thought and scope in to every scene. No moment feels lazy, no location feels ""chosen at random"", everything is beautifully put together with great energy and dedication. This story seemed like a very complicated one to put together in to a movie that is easy for a modern day audience to understand, and the entire cast and crew managed to do so in a way that made it look effortless.There are moments where things get a little dull. There are long periods where everything is very fast paced, and there is absolutely no problem with that however, it will then suddenly stop to add humanity to its characters and develop them further, but it is underwhelming to a degree that the audience feels cheated after how much action we had been given prior. It had pacing issues at times.The performances are flawless, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the mischievous, charming Frank Abagnale Jr. and Tom Hanks brings in great characterisation, as well as a beautiful screen presence, as Carl Hanratty. What makes this movie so enjoyable it that it has two stories in which two of Hollywoods greatest actors are the main characters, and it's impossible to get bored when we are jumping back and forth from a Hanks movie to a DiCaprio vehicle.A well developed, intriguing story. Well acted and developed, Catch Me If You Can is a largely entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film.The true story of how Frank Abagnale Jr. forged millions of dollars worth of checks as he faked his name and pretends to be a pilot, doctor and other occupations across the state.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Amusing and entertaining,"When we were children, we used to imagine who we want to become: astronauts, firefighters, top-models, whoever. Apparently some people live their lives as if they are still playing in the courtyard; they easily change their occupations, looks, even characters. Catch Me If You Can is about such a man.This is a true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor. He admires his father and from him he learns how to manipulate people and systems. Of course, he attracted attention of the police forces, and in particular of Carl Hanratty, man in charge of falsifications in the US. The pursuit that ensues is the main focus of the movie.The plot is based on the autobiographical book by Frank Abagnale Jr. himself, where he describes his adventures, and despite the huge potential that the book had to offer to the movie makers in terms of the characters, relationships etc, the movie turned out to be nice extra rather than the stand alone piece of art.The movie lacks personality. Charisma of real Frank Abagnale Jr. did not allow Steven Spielberg to put anything personal in the movie. It is simply re-telling of the book; the director or the screenplay writers don't have their own opinions on the matters going on, they simply take the back seat and show us what happened to the main character. This approach made the movie automatically inferior to the book – the audience still needs guidance; good movie is always a dialogue, not a monologue, not a dry ascertaining of facts. It is still amusing and interesting to watch, but poor Frank and Carl look like animals in the zoo rather than humans with human feelings and emotions. It starts to feel artificial game of cat and mouse.The famous director failed to inhale life in the characters. Little surprise that the star cast didn't manage to do it either. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks clearly do their best. DiCaprio convincingly plays immature kid with little understanding of consequences of his actions. Hanks convincingly plays workaholic cop. But the lack of conflict, lack of deep interactions means that the characters don't evolve, and in the end of the movie we see the same two chaps that we saw in the beginning. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams – they all play their parts perfectly, creating exactly the characters they were asked to create. Shame they still look unnatural. And in the end, all the action around the master of reincarnations simply leads to the thought that maybe exciting, fulfilling life doesn't need to be full of action and pursuits and God-knows-what. Maybe what people actually need to live truly interesting lives is the presence of other people, who would guide, teach and just talk meaningful talks. Who needs all the checks and all the millions if there is nobody around to tell you where to spend it?The story of the man who never stopped being a small child is worth watching only for the sake of this idea.VERDICT: Good illustration to the book, amusing and interesting, even though it fails as the movie.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The ending is dragged out ridiculously, and gives little satisfaction.The real problem i found was that Di Caprio is on-screen almost all the time, yet he spends so much time pretending to be someone else, we never get to know his character and therefore i found it impossible to feel any emotion to his situation.After 1 hour, the film wears thin, after another hour, i was barely awake.

Catch Me...,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!!

"Unlike it's main character, this film is exactly what it wants to be!","There are a lot of classics i have been wanting to see but haven't got the chance. I have had a lot recommended to me, whilst i watch a hell of a lot of movies i haven't seen them all. I recently got my hands on a copy of Catch Me if You Can and had high hopes. Afterall, i've heard nothing but praise for the movie and the two main stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are two of my all-time favourite actors, how could i not love this?! So i watched it.. and i love this film! It had me hooked in from beginning to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It was a fun movie as well as one that just keeps you wanting to know more and guessing how it will end for the characters.. especially Leonardo Dicaprio's Frank Abangale Jr.The plot follows Frank who leaves home at 16 after his parents divorce and poses as a pilot.. then a doctor.. then a lawyer.. all before he turns 21. I tell you, this guy has lived. Hot on his tail is an equally brilliant Tom Hanks as FBI detective Carl Hanratty who figures out Abangale's tricks through a series of fake cheques he is cashing out. This leads to an entertaining cat and mouse type movie full of twists and turns. The two actors play off of each other perfectly and are two completely different characters. What i like about Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal of Abengale is that he is an incredibly smart guy and he is so good at showing this without completely overplaying himself. Christopher Walken also does great as Abengale's father and adds some moral backbone to the twists and turns and we get a young Amy Adams who is also great as Abengale's love interestEverybody in this film does great.. in fact.. even a Jennifer Garner cameo was awesome!In the end, from the fitting music in the soundtrack to the animated opening sequence to the climax of the film everything was almost perfect and i will be watching this film a lot more times in my life because i had a great time and it really showcases why these 2 actors are 2 of the best working today.

When real life becomes fantasy...,"Director Steven Spielberg returns to what he does best with this take on the true story of Frank Abegnale Jr, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was convicted for dozens of cases of check fraud and assuming false identities before the age of 25. And a true story it may be, but all of Abegnale's daring deeds and frantic escapes are oversimplified in this telling - everything he does seems too easy and natural for him. Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as.But for a fantasy escape, there is some real drama infused into the story, especially with the strange yet fascinating relationship between Abegnale Jr. and Sr, and Frank Jr. realizing that he can't just settle down to marry his girlfriend Brenda (Amy Adams) who knows him under a different identity, since he is being constantly hunted by the authorities. And near the end, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gradually warms to his query Abegnale, despite all the trials and frustrations he has been put through - an unexpected and much appreciated reversal of character.DiCaprio does a good portrayal of Abegnale Jr. as he starts out confident and full of energy, while slowly descending into virtual paranoia, always looking over his shoulder and devising new ways to once again prevent capture. Tom Hanks also gives a strong performance as Carl Hanratty, the driven officer determined to catch Abegnale Jr. and bring him to justice. Yet they are both in danger of being overshadowed by notorious scene stealer Christopher Walken, in an Academy Award nominated performance, playing Abegnale Sr. the idol of his criminal son. Walken is truly affecting as he slowly comes to terms that he isn't as invincible as he thought, as his wife leaves him and everything he possesses is steadily taken by the government as he continually neglects to pay taxes. But his frequent self-confidence boosting sayings (""Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly drowned, but the second kept struggling and churned the cream into butter. Right now, I am that second mouse"") give his son (and perhaps himself as well) the impression that he's on top of his situation.It's an excellent package, with John Williams' excellent 50's style score beautifully complementing Spielberg's work. It may be lighter and less realistic than it could have been, but Catch me if you Can is without a doubt, a lot of fun to watch, which is all it really needed to be.-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Immaculate But Insubstantial,"I think I'd seen this before - but to be honest I have little to no memory of it. This fits with my impression of it the second time around (if, indeed, there was a first time around). It's no surprise that it's technically immaculate - the editing especially impressed me, and of course, the performances are superb throughout. Entertaining and even fun as it is, it all adds up to something insubstantial and lightweight - and that's probably down to the writing. We never really get to the root of why Abagnale does all that he's portrayed as doing, and the breezy tone risks making light of serious crimes - crimes, which as far as the film is concerned, seem to be victimless (which of course they aren't). To that end, it reminded me of a film with the same star - The Wolf Of Wall Street ... entertaining but as light as a feather. Bridge Of Spies I recall felt similar (though I do need to revisit that also ... and that would definitely be a revisit). Spielberg can produce better straight-out entertainment (that doesn't feel so thin), and he can also make 'serious films about weighty themes that keep the viewer gripped. This falls frustratingly between the two.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Very entertaining, and quite clever at the same time","I was really surprised when I saw this. I wasn't expecting it so be so good. First of all the story is really interesting and really entertaining at the same time- something very rarely seen these days. Secondly, the performances are excellent, Leonardo DiCaprio in this sort of role where he actually acts instead of just looking pretty (Titanic springs to mind) is really a joy to watch. Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying. Lastly, I just want to say the music was brilliant- I'm really a big fan of John Williams. So, when it all comes together this really is a joy to watch, it's emotional, emotional, funny, witty, and very clever. An refreshingly not too long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece,This is what you get when two great actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks play together in a movie under Steven Spielberg's direction,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Just do the math,DiCaprio + Spielberg = Sheer brilliance.Catch Me If You Can is another awesome flick by the legendary Steven Spielberg. And DiCaprio's top notch performance as the brilliant con master combined with Tom Hanks' amazing performance as the committed FBI agent illuminated the already shiny film. The film from beginning to end is filled with suspense and tense chase scenes. And the fact that it was set in the sixties gave it an archaic and classical touch. I admire and respect DiCaprio even more now. His tremendous acting skills are advancing with each passing film and we expect to see more from him.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A complete laughter and entertainment dose !!,"This movie is a remarkable work by Spielberg. It is based on the true life story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. who himself plays a minor role in the movie as a French policeman. This only adds to the fascination and awe while watching the movie. The movie depicts how Frank disguises first as an Airline Pilot, then a doctor and later as a lawyer without any professional training in any of these fields. He was able to con a huge sum of money from various government authorities all around the world through his fake degrees, qualifications, payroll cheques etc. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Frank in the film was terrific and Tom Hanks' role as an FBI agent only adds to it. Frank's character in the film makes it seem absolutely believable that a man like him can lie, deceive and con almost everyone he meets. The most interesting part is to watch Frank disguise as a school teacher in high school so effortlessly . It is also amusing to watch him get away from the Airport so easily with eight of his selected stewardesses despite the presence of over a hundred officers at the Airport.Overall, it is an exciting movie to watch that kept me engrossed throughout the movie. However, I feel that the movie very quickly digresses from the serious topics such as separation of the family, divorce, bankruptcy and their impact on the character of Frank although these were the real driving factors due to which he resorted to such a deceitful lifestyle. Also, the fact that Frank ends up well off in life even after he was caught, sort of glorifies his lifestyle. It is always a very pleasant change from the usual serious films to watch a bit of escapism and complete unrestricted freedom without instigating an inward desire to lead such a lifestyle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Great Work by LeonardoDiCaprio,"The movie is yet another great one by DiCaprio.The title of the movie itself temped me to watch it at first.Its a great blend of con tricks that keeps you attracted throughout the movies.Though its a little old movie for now but its appreciably entertaining.The most beautiful part of the movie is that its based on a true story.The slight emotional blends in between that guide the storyline of the movie was real success.Personally,I am a lover of Drama,Thriller,or Action but this ,though completely different Genre,that I stated above was equally entertaining.Overall,I would call for this movie as a must watch in lifetime.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A movie worth catching and watching,"This movie is based on real story . Since this is a Hollywood movie probably some things were changed , but that doesn't really matter . What is important is this movie entertains . It's long , 2 hours and few minutes , yet it's never boring . It's set during the 60's and 70's and the humor in ""Catch me if you can"" reminds me humor from movies from that time. My favorite joke is the ""knock, knock"" joke from Hanks.The opening credits sequence is brilliant. It's one of the best opening sequences ever. DiCaprio fits in his role well with his boyish look .Tom Hanks is nice as the grumpy FBI agent. Christopher Walken steals the show with his performance as the charming , always optimistic father of our hero. He deserved Oscar nomination. It was also good to see Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. Jennifer Garner appearance was rather pointless.The tricks that DiCaprio uses look believable . I can only complain that he acts a little bit stupid during the second half of the movie , but maybe that's how it was in the real life ? Anyway the movie provides good fun . There is some depth here . Both DiCaprio and Hanks are lonely people who have nothing more than their jobs . Spielberg also tries to explain why Frank Abagnale Jr. started his criminal career . His explanation sounds logical – he was running away because he couldn't deal with his parents marriage problems (He was 16 years old then).""Catch me if you can"" is a well made fluff entertainment.

A Flash of Lightning from Leonardo DiCaprio,"""Flash"" comic book reader Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) is devastated when he learns loving parents Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye (as Frank and Paula Abagnale) are divorcing. Unable to choose whom he'd rather to live with, Mr. DiCaprio decides to run away, like DC Comics' ""The Flash"". A natural impersonator, DiCaprio assumes a secret identity, and develops amazing check-forging skills. This attracts the attention of FBI agent Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty), who is determined to put DiCaprio behind bars. Incredibly, DiCaprio gets jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. But, Mr. Hanks is hot on his trail""Catch Me If You Can"" finds Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks team in the middle of an incredible string of well-produced films. When seen in context, their success secret may be offering the public a variety of entertainment, alternating the familiar with the unexpected. ""Catch Me If You Can"" isn't rollicking, inspirational, or filled with special effects; it's just wildly appealing. Spielberg regulars: cameraman Janusz Kaminski, musician John Williams, editor Michael Kahn, etc are ""state of the art"" in film-making. The cast performs exceptionally. Most valuable player Williams is especially noteworthy, helping an incredible opening ""credits"" sequence start the film.In hindsight, this may be considered one of DiCaprio's very best performances. Certainly, it's one of the only times when casting a 10-years-too-old actor in a part makes perfect sense, as you'll see upon viewing this film. DiCaprio fits the role like a glove, handling his character's charming to disillusioned development with precision. The character is extremely likable. Spielberg sets the perfect mood by opening the film with a ""To Tell the Truth"" game show appearance, and flashback. We know approximately how the film will end; but, like a ""Flash"" comic book story, we enjoy the adventure, and feel the danger.Obviously, they were going for a ""PG-13"" audience; and, the sex scenes aren't offensive. The one following DiCaprio's viewing of the James Bond film ""Goldfinger"" is particularly well done. It involves his encounter with a high-class prostitute. By returning to DiCaprio viewing the film, back in the theater, the entire sequence could be artfully turned into a fantasy. This would support the very idealized way DiCaprio views relationships; they should be like comic book couple, like Barry and Iris Allen. Our hero fantasizes he's ""James Bond"", but he's really very ""old-fashioned"". He can't accept his parents' break-up; and, has idealized, failed relationships with women.There is some thoughtfulness as ""Catch Me If You Can"" explores the relationships DiCaprio's ""Frank"" has with his parents and Mr. Hanks. The film would be stronger if the protagonist's innocent idealism and ideology were more developed. A key moment, for ""Frank"", is when he discovers his parents are not the perfect couple he (and we viewers) have been accustomed to seeing. Later, after a period of promiscuity, our hero has his failed relationship. He learns couples are not like idealized; but, this thread of the film lacks a proper conclusion; a scene with mother Baye, or the introduction of a new romantic interest, would help.******** Catch Me If You Can (12/16/02) Steven Spielberg ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Wears out its welcome,"Despite the fact it featured one of Hollywood's leading hambones, I actually enjoyed Catch Me If You Can for the first hour or so. But as it dragged into its 3rd - or was it 4th - hour I started to get bored, then fidgety, then resentful. Was this supposed to be a mini-series on cheque fraud?There are a couple of other problems. Leo is unusually engaging, but leftyst mouthpiece Tom Hanks is so serious it unbalances the tone of the movie. And then, as if unable to help himself, Leo has a crying and puking scene. Is it in his contract?Ultimately, what should have been a light-hearted, 90-minute romp turned into a night-long grind. I felt relief when it was finally over. I was mildly grateful Spielbergo didn't tack on one of his saccharine codas where ''present-day"" Frank and Karl sit around a table at a coffee shop in rubber-face makeup and fondly recall their days as adversaries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
NOT based on a true story NOTHING about the man is what we're told,"When I first saw this movie I was quite captivated by it. It's well made, well acted, and all the elements for a solid production are there and the story was very compelling. BUT the only reason it works is because you believe this fantastic tale is true.Once I discovered that the whole thing is entirely a fabrication, that it's all just a fairy tale with almost ZERO basis in fact I felt personally betrayed. Maybe it's because I've been conned once too often in my life, but I was furious when I found out the extent of Mr. Abagnale's deceit.He never impersonated a doctor, or a professor, or ever passed the bar exam, or acted as an attorney or any of the other fantastic feats that he claims. He was just a low-grade punk who kited checks and ripped off his friends and family and anyone who he befriended. He was arrested 6 or 7 times and often got off lightly due to the efforts of good-hearted folks who were trying to help him. His most effective con was the one he pulled over on everyone about what a lovable, brilliant, clever conman that he never was.So the movie just loses all it's lustre when you realize that you're part of the conjob yourself. In the unlikely event of me meeting Mr. Abagnale at some time, I'm likely to give him an horrific dopeslap for taking me in.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"entertaining, if minor, Spielberg","From childhood on, we are taught that honesty is a virtue and dishonesty a vice.  We have that message pounded into our heads and branded into our psyches by parents and teachers, by law enforcers and lawmakers, by clergymen and civic leaders.  Yet, at the same time, society as a whole, especially in our entertainment, has always had a certain soft spot for the scoundrel and the rogue, a kind of running love affair with the con man, the shyster, the rascal who can pull the wool over everyone's eyes and get away with it.  It is this paradox of human nature that Steven Spielberg celebrates in `Catch Me if You Can,' the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., the huckster supreme who, at the incredible age of 17, left home and family, and managed to pass himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and to swindle the banks out of millions of dollars in bad checks into the bargain.If the film didn't say that it was based on a true story, no one would ever believe it, so absurd and unlikely is its premise.  The story certainly proves that old adage that fact is indeed stranger than fiction.  In many ways, `Catch Me if You Can' is essentially a lighthearted, comic version of `Les Miserables' (or `The Fugitive' if you prefer), with Tom Hanks as the Javert-like Carl Hanratty, a by-the-book FBI agent who becomes personally obsessed with bagging this one particular lawbreaker, who somehow manages to deftly evade his every attempt at capture.  For Hanratty, apprehending Frank becomes the quest that gives his life meaning and purpose, the focal point of his existence.  Hanks does a splendid job capturing the deadpan seriousness of this single-minded but constantly put-upon individual, never allowing him to become a mere buffoon or caricature as he might have become in less capable hands.  Leonardo Di Caprio does a first rate job turning Frank into a world-class charmer.  We understand how so many people could allow themselves to be duped by his charismatic personality.  And it is nice to see Christopher Walken NOT playing a creepy villain for a change, but rather a father who loves his son but who simply can't find it within himself to be either a successful person in his own right or a moral role model for his boy to follow.Spielberg does a fine job pointing up the parallels between Frank and Carl, the lawbreaker and the law enforcer.  Despite the fact that they are antipodes apart on the legal spectrum, both are living lives of loneliness and emptiness, and they develop a strange sort of camaraderie on that basis. For one thing Frank learns is that, although he may be able to dupe people into believing all sorts of untruths about him and live high in the process, there is no substitution for the real things in life like love, marriage and family that money cannot buy.`Catch Me if You Can,' though it is a very entertaining film, ultimately feels a trifle incomplete, as if it were lacking just that touch of depth that would make it truly outstanding.  It's fun on the surface, but it never seems to dig much beneath that surface.  Perhaps, it is in the nature of the story itself that the trouble lies.  Once we catch on to the novelty of the plot, the story doesn't really seem to have anywhere to go except to keep showing us the same thing over and over again.  For all the bravura performances, the characters never quite show us what makes them tick.  This is particularly true of Frank, whose motives remain obscure throughout most of the film.  Oh well.  `Catch Me if You Can' is intended primarily as a lark, I imagine, and on that level it is generally successful.This latest film certainly does not rank up there in the Spielberg pantheon. It is, in fact, a minor work by a major filmmaker, who is merely marking time, perhaps, till his next true masterwork.  It's Spielberg in a relaxed, kick back, sunny mood, not as great as when he is really pumping away hard, but good enough for the time being.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Fun Movie with Great Cast,"You can't really go wrong with a film from Steven Spielberg. I can't really think of a bad film the man has ever made, so you know to expect quality when you watch his movies; this 2002 Christmas release is no different. Inspired by a true story, the film follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the greatest con artists the United States has ever seen. Abagnale had posed as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer before he turned 21, cashing more than $2 million in fraudulent checks.Jeff Nathanson based the screenplay on the book of the same name, written by Abagnale himself. The story covers so much and moves so fast, yet it never loses the audience or stumbles over itself. In the capable hands of Spielberg, the movie drives on at a good pace and keeps the audience interested throughout. In the end, it's the character of Abagnale that makes the movie so entertaining. At the time, I hadn't cared a whole lot for Leonardo DiCaprio in the past but this movie changed that a bit. DiCaprio was a fan of Abagnale's book before the film ever came about, so his passion for the material shines through his performance. He also had great chemistry with Tom Hanks, who plays the FBI agent on his trail. We also get a strong supporting performance from Christopher Walken as Frank's father; despite his minimal screen time, it was enough to make an impression (and win some awards).Knowing Spielberg spares no expense, you can also expect great production design. With the film set in the 1960's, it made for some colorful scenery. The movie does run a bit long (a little over two hours) but it isn't painful. It's a fun movie and Spielberg doesn't let you down; all I can do is recommend you check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Watch it, if you can stand it.","'Catch Me If You Can' is inspired by the memoirs of Frank Abagnale Jnr so it is suprising that Spielberg shows no interest in Franks' character or the amazing feats/cons he accomplished. Instead of a movie about a remarkable young man we have one about motivation for criminal actions stemming from a broken home and a dishonest father and the particularly unremarkable FBI agent trying to catch him.There is little description of how he charmed his way through cons as most of the movie is spent giving a completely false impression of his father(and hence him)or showing the plodding Hanratty one step behind him again.The characters are simplistic, one dimensional and worse dull.  In one scene as Hanratty is reporting to his boss his assistant agents loitering at the back of the office are licking ice-creams, they're dopey and outsmarted by Abagnale, WE GET IT ALREADY!I would like to be able to say I was disillusioned having read Abagnales' book before watching the movie, but I can't.

Crime doesn't pay!  Unless of course you're really good at it...,"People have always delighted in the exploits of those individuals that flout convention (and the occasional law) often living vicariously through them. How else can one explain the fascination with gentleman skyjacker DB Cooper, who, in 1971, jumped out of an airplane with a $200 000 ransom and vanished. No one  with the exception of law enforcement  wanted him to get caught. But next to Frank Abagnale Jr. Cooper looks like a piker - half a decade earlier, Abaganalemade off with a far greater sum with nothing more than chutzpah, fast-talking and a great smile.  So what if he got caught?Frank Abagnale Jr.  learned early on that looks could be deceiving:  his parents' fairy tale romance didn't include a `happily ever after' ending and although Frank Sr claimed to know the secret to success, it continued to elude him.  Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others).  Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List - quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school drop out.Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr's dalliances with the law as a teen con man, `Catch Me If You Can' is both adventure and comedy with a touch of cynicism (the whole collapse-of-the-nuclear-family angle).  The film has a bouncy, spirited soundtrack that supports and enhances the lightweight subject matter.  This, along with wonderful set and costume design help to faithfully establish that sixties feel. Subtle scoring, fluid editing and tight camerawork ensure that the pacing is consistent and flows smoothly. This attention to detail is carried on by the cast.This is the other Leonardo DiCaprio Christmas movie  the one with a modest budget, that wasn't years overdue, and didn't have everyone's tongue wagging about late night parties and blow-ups on the set.   After solid work in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' and `The Basketball Diaries', DiCaprio became the flavor of the moment with `Titanic' (one of the most overrated movies of all time) and his credibility went into decline with roles in `The Beach' and the abysmal  `Man in the Iron Mask').   I braced myself for the worst and was therefore pleasantly surprised with his performance in this film: DiCaprio carries the role of Frank Jr. with aplomb, infusing Frank with the perfect balance of charisma, ballsy impertinence, humor and when necessary, gravity (without resorting to the broody scowling we've seen before).  His colleagues are no slouches either.His role as the spectacled ubergeek in `Blast From the Past' notwithstanding, Christopher Walken's characters are best known for their villainous tendencies. As Frank Sr., Walken is decidedly under whelming, a pitiable dim shadow of a man who labours under delusions that salvation is just around the corner.  Walken ensures that his character doesn't cross the line into useless pathetic, rather he exists as a cautionary tale to blind optimism.  Equally understated, and yet simultaneously outstanding, is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, Frank Jr's dogged FBI foil.  Carl  a composite of several of the individuals who tracked Abagnale  is a quiet, determined loner who carries a few too many pounds and revels in the chase. Hanks brings the same quintessential every-man quality to the role that he is famous for, without looking like his character is a rehash from some other film.This is one of those rare films that has virtually no swearing, violence or nudity (there are a few suggestive scenes) and yet doesn't moralize or try to drown the viewer in saccharine.  In addition, it is fun, engaging, and well acted.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

DiCaprio turns in his finest performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape & The Basketball Diaries. Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note.

Unseen Cruelty,"Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story. There is something middle class and suburban about his films. The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns is essentially middle-class whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled. He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot. I think that is a neat trick. I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress. Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con. The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle. His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life. DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a ""Paper Hanger,"" living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash. Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast. He can only be caught if he wants to be caught. I digress again. Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work. Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark.

Most of situations are credible, this could haven happen more or less this way.The secondary carachters like di caprio's mother and fathers are not much developed but that give chance to faster pace and doesn't really harm the viewer involment with the main character. We can kind of understand what pushed the situation to start and develop this way.There is also no glorification of crimes or criminal, Tom Hanks also doesn't represent a model saint cops leading a crusade against check forgers.All in one, the story of two opposite personalities, with somehow similar wound and weaknesses, a ""smart"" crime movie, shown in a fast pace story telling and realistic environment made me arrive at the end to think ""is that already finished"", which doesn't happens often in my case.Would recommend it without hesitations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

He is so charismatic in every role and this one is no different. Not much else to say, it's Leonardo DiCaprio!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

How a genius character like frank can really exist in the real world!,"If you want to laugh and have goosebumps at the same time, just watch the movie. I had to pause from time to time just to finish laughing. Some dialogues and scenes will genuinely make you laugh. Unlike most comedy movies where they put vulgar jokes to make it funny.

Mischievous movie,"I am a very mischievous person and I like to watch movies like that. Leonardo DeCaprio's character fools everyone. It's not all fun and games though, it has a really good plot with his family and the detective following him around. DeCaprio's character sort of reminded me of Johnny Depp's character on Pirates of the Caribbean. That is only because they both fool everyone to get what they want and it's funny to watch. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean I would recommend this movie. Tom Hanks did another excellent job as the detective. They pulled together a great cast. I was really able to get sucked into this movie. That's how I judged that this is a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Fantastic 100% perfection through the whole movie with fantastic acting to top it off!,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. The movie was so versatile and could be watched by many types of audiences. I really enjoyed the plot of this movie and although I wish the ending would have continued, I truly enjoyed all of the movie. There was not a part that dragged on for too long, the entirety of the movie was spaced out perfectly and the acting of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks was splendid. They both have acted perfectly in many films, but so far, this is my favorite.The movie simply is about a 16 year old boy (DiCaprio) who when finding out his parents are getting a divorce panics and runs away from home. Trying to survive on his own, he takes on the role of many professional jobs, and forges himself paychecks along the way. He has a detective (Hanks) hot on his trail, but always a second too late.The fact that this movie is based on a true story really shows how fantastically smart and cunning some people truly are.The movie plays on many of your emotions, and is a movie you can watch over and over, and still marvel at.A fantastic movie that I would recommend to anyone and everyone.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
I still like it,"This film isn't totally true to the book, but as we now know, the book is not totally true either!I suppose it's hard to be too upset at a con man lying. That's what they do. Compulsively. For profit.The film (and the book) don't really explore the motives behind the lies. Like why didn't the bright young man study and train to be a pilot? Because he had no respect for Pilots, or anybody. Everyone was his plaything.His tale is one of style, not substance. So I didn't mind the playful way Spielberg portrayed him.It's still a fine movie. I even read the book again recently and still enjoyed that too. But would the book have been published if it was submitted as a novel?Chuck Barris, James Frey and others have confessed to lying in their books. It's time Abagnale did the same. But there's the rub, who would believe a con artist?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Lots of old pros telling an amazing story - yet plays like a TV movie!,"A young man with a sharp brain and the face of someone much older takes the fast track to riches by way of wholesale cheque fraud.I know of only one or two scripts that have been going the rounds longer before being actually made. Caligula - the troubled Roman epic - is probably the one you have heard of.You can see why the original book (which shares the movie title) was hot-to-trot. The studio execs must have viewed it as a sure-fire winner that no one could really go wrong with. The only problem being the lack of talent waiting to take on this fish-in-a-barrel project. Maybe some projects are a little too obvious - Cleopatra anyone?Spielberg didn't really want to direct this one and through politics to complicated to go in to here had to switch from producer to director. His heart is not in it - so he just goes for the plod-plod-plod movie-by-numbers approach. Sad to see him not really extending his wonderful cineast brain.I read up heavily on the true life case of Frank Abigale Jnr and even read the press library interviews that he made after seeing the film. His escape from a plane showed that he was a true life James Bond! I always say: Knowledge is power!While the script was true in all its main facts it exaggerates the state of the French prison - that while tough it was not as tough as this. Although it was no holiday camp either. It also skims over how he got to practise law - the reason given here is a classic of stating selective truths.(He flunked the exam several times and was allowed to view his mistakes. There may have been bribery involved as well.)Tom Hanks and DiCaprio play off each other well, but they don't really have a lot to do with each other. The phone calls are a fabrication. They are really working in their own little bubble that only collide every now and then.What is the moral here? That if you say your name is Joe Blow and you are an airline pilot people believe you. That if you put as much effort in to crime as you do in to a real job it can pay better? Life has moved on since those days. CCTV, computers, the Internet, you wouldn't last five minutes doing all this today.The saddest thing is that despite his wealth Frank never looks happy. Not here anyway.Money doesn't make you happy seems the closing moral - but a look around the set of this film would quickly show that to be a lie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"God Save us from the ""Spielberg"" touch","I lasted about ten minutes in this ""gem"" before running from the theatre in disgust.  I'm so sick of movies that tell you every moment how you should ""feel"".  Spielberg doesn't trust his audience to make their own decisions about what they are watching.  Each and every single second is so manufactured that it is impossible to react in any other way than in the micromanaged specific predigested fashion in which Mr. Spielberg wants us to.  Perhaps his movies are meant to be watched with the sound off.  They are like panels of a cartoon.  The visuals are clear and they certainly tell a story in a clear and distinct way, but there's no room to breathe, no air on the screen.  It's like being at a Natural History museum looking at stuffed cavemen hunting a sabre tooth tiger.  Sure is pretty.  But nobody's breathing up there.Since I only saw ten minutes (which is enough for me if a movie is as terrible as this one.  The film could've turned into ""citizen Kane"" the moment I left and it wouldn't matter, the damage had been done) I can only comment on what I saw, so here goes:The title sequence:I hated those faux-sixties cartoon drawings.  Like everything in Spielberg's post-""Close Encounters"" body of work, it doesn't quite make it.  It was a cute idea, but instead of getting an artist who would really do a good job stealing from the Saul Bass school of design, he got somebody who fumbled the job, making it seem more like the cheapo animation in one of those 70's health movies like ""I am Joe's Stomach"" or something.  Even worse is John Williams score, but the less said about him the better.The ""To Tell the Truth"" opening was one of the laziest first draft attempts at expopsition I'd seen since the Ndugu letters of ""About Schmidt"". Doesn't anybody know who to write dialogue anymore?  Plus, the transition from the gameshow to the rainy sequence in France was both clumsy and non sensical. Once again, Speilberg gets a case of the nauseating ""cutes"".  Gee, French people are funny, they can't pronounce this character's name.  Gee, does everybody in the audience get that THIS is the guy that Leonardo De Caprio was talking about in the previous frame?  That fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks?  By this point I had one foot aimed towards the exit.Then we get another ""cutesy poo"" Spielberg moment when the fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks has to open an umbrella inside because there's a leak. Sacre Bleu!  That's Hi-larious!Then we get another in a long list of what I like to call the ""Pinnochio meets Faces of Death"" moments that Spielberg seems so fond of.  Where broad bad comedy meets the harrowing and gut-wrenching.  Like in Amistad where first we get Matthew McCaughnahay doing his best High School Acting version of ""Mr Toad's Wild Ride"" and then we get African American slaves chained together and thrown into the sea.  This is where Leo's consumptive hacking (which is better suited to ""Midnight Express"" than this lightweight ersatz caper/chase flick) is juxtaposed with the worst accent I think I've ever heard in a movie (even worse than Leo's irish? accent in the Gangs of New York).  The fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks is nattering on under that umbrella, the faceless French guys are chimpering in inaudible francois and Leo is hacking up like John Hurt in Aliens.  What's wrong with this picture?  Why is Speilberd so determined to gross us out?  (See ""Minority Report"" with its hacking of snot and rancid-food-eating scene for his most recent offense)Then we get Leo's attempted escape which of course is accompanied by the entire prison population shrieking and urging him on like the Forum crowd in ""Ben Hur"".When Christopher Walken arrives, he managed to use his own quirky acting rhythms to throw a pleasant monkey wrench into Spielberg's well oiled McMovie.  But by the time Leo was watching his parents dancing the wine stain into the white rug, and then when Walken told Leo not to hit the curb while parking (guess what he does anyway!?  Screams of knee-jerk laughter from the multi-plex crowd)I had seen enough.  I want to have my own feelings, Mr. Speilberg, thank you.  I have only to refer to ""Far From Heaven"" as an example of how to let an audience think.  Even though the movie had an arch tone and over-the-top dialogue at times and looked like a techinicolor fantasy, it never told you how to feel.  It allowed you to make your own decisions.  But I'm afraid Mr. Spielberg has morphed past the point where he'll have anything meaningful to say to someone past an eighth grade education.Yuck.  Ten minutes was tooooooo much.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"An intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly engaging odyssey","Forget morality. Most people want to see somebody beat the system -- no matter how he does it -- a winner! That why the movie-going world loves a con artist, especially if he's a young Adonis with a soft heart and a winning smile who exudes charm and cool sophistication. This sympathetically told true story shows how one teenager, skillfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, did it with daring bravado.The unlikely villain in this story is a kid who's traumatized by catching his mother cavorting with another man, which is soon followed by divorce. Unable to choose which parent should be his guardian, he runs away and applies both natural gifts and lessons learned from the playful deviousness of his skeptical father (who's just experienced financial ruin) to become America's most notable impostor, wangling serial employment as a cop, pilot, doctor, and lawyer. The skill acquired from learning how to forge a fake identity and bogus credentials give him the ability to forge checks -- filling suitcases with millions of dollars and a James Bond sort of life to go with it.This film has many interesting contrasts. Pitting the plodding, joyless purposefulness of a rigidly moral FBI agent (Tom Hank's character) against the capricious cunning of a light hearted con gives a nice edge to this story. And the superb roles played by the best of the best character actors, Sheen Sr. and Christopher Walken (the father), add meaning and levity.Steven Spielberg and his star-studded cast lived up to their billing with this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Definitely caught my eye.,"When I first saw the trailers for this film I didn't think it looked like anything spectacular.  Although, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, so I wasn't going to miss this collaboration.  I must say that I was definitely pleasantly surprised, the film was much more than I imagined and really quite fun.The story is just incredible, and what really blows my mind is that it's based on a true story.  There also a great deal more to the story than the obvious, it's not just about a kid that breaks the law and eventually gets caught, there are a number of subplots that make the story infinitely more interesting.  Not only is the story and subplots great, the but the characters, the portrayal of the characters and the chemistry between them are just perfect.Of course the great Steven Spielberg always puts on a great show, but this was particularly good.  I think the best way to put it is that Spielberg really nailed the feel of this film right on the nose, and was very consistent in his style.  I know there's been a few of his films that had certain scenes or lines that I felt were out of place or oddly placed, but this film didn't have anything like that, everything worked perfectly.  Then there's the always great, Tom Hanks!  A truly gifted actor, he ALWAYS puts on a good show and doesn't let you down here.  Leonardo DiCaprio was an excellent choice for the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and really nailed the role.  He has the ability to look older or younger than he really is when needed, not an ability every actor has.  Other cast members that should be noted are Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Nathalie Baye, and Jennifer Garner, all pulling off great performances.This is definitely a Spielberg film not to be missed.  Do yourself a favor and make sure that you see this film.  Even if you are like me and don't think that it looks terribly appealing, give it a shot, you may be surprised.  There is virtually nothing I didn't like about this film, which is a somewhat rare thing for me to say.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.

The movie leaves its taste on your filmy buds..,"Catch Me If You CanListening the name of the movie at first, it didn't interest me much. But I had a damn keen interest in it. Tom Hanks +Leonardo DiCaprio and you get a direction from Steven Spielberg as a topping. What better a serving can you ask for.First things first. Creativity of the movie takes you from the very first moment, when credits are shown. I mean thats what I love about Hollywood. They take their jobs so possessively. Even something as minor(in comparison to the hell lot of other things a movie includes) as starting credits are designed so creatively, so attractively, that you rarely see such stuff in the East. Then, talking about screenplay it was none the less just fabulous . You know movies of such kind..they make you feel right between those characters. You never feel you aren't a part of that movie. Such is the beauty of all the hard work, that even though watching it at mid night with college the next day,you don't feel to pause it for a moment. The guts of Frank William Abagnale are what took me by awe. His confidence he puts into whatever he says or does. Bravo to the thought improvisation in the script. And what brilliant execution.What next hit hard was the relation between Carl(Tom Hanks) and Frank (Leo).When you are an ace thief the most faithful and trustworthy relation you can and you have is with the agent chasing you.It is true and is strong. Both of you stay committed to each other yet against each other.Also, this one really shows that you are what you believe at that moment.! Nothing else.The end again had its complete touch and the few facts shown at the end about Mr. Frank added even more to what the movie had successfully portrayed. Loved it totally. And glad watched it.. ;)Tom Hanks as always is lovable and even though you give him lesser screen space, he makes his presence felt so serenely. Leo . Well, watching his movies till yet and now this one, I'll just say he is one of those actors who are of a different league and always keep evolving themselves. Always Always fascinate you.! You just feel happy about yourself for watching them doing what they do best.!Glorious movie.Must watch!!Steven Spielberg has done yet another simply amazing work directing this one.!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch this one if you can,"I really enjoyed this movie. Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to ""Talk to the Animals"" in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Charming,"This was the movie that personally convinced me that DiCaprio had a future as an actor beyond Titanic. People used dismiss him as that kid from Titanic, I did as well, but he has grown to become one of Hollywood's top actors and I personally saw this coming while watching this film.Catch Me If You Can is also one of those films that I'd recommend if someone had no idea who Steven Spielberg was and wanted to give one of his movies a try. Because in many ways it has a lot of his characteristics in it. It's seemingly light-hearted, has an A-list cast, has a great score and the story is pure entertainment, yet the movie also takes it time, here and there, to address slightly darker themes - in this case the reason why Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) grew up to become such a trickster.The movie rides heavily on the charisma and acting abilities of its two main stars, DiCaprio and Hanks, and in this case there's really nothing wrong with it. The story is decent enough to support these two and it's a valid choice to have your movie focus on the characters, especially if they're interesting enough, like they are in here. That's the essence of a heist movie, which this movie really is, even though it's not about a single con.And that's this movie. Its focus on entertainment keeps it from being a solid nine or ten star film, but only just. As it is, it's a fun little romp that you're sad to see come to an end. Heavily recommended to fans of heist genre, and for those that like charismatic performances and fun little twists.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch Me If You Can,"Steven Spielberg has taken the story of con man Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) and turned into a 1960s style caper.Frank started off as a teenager trying to pass off forged cheques. Then figured out that dressing up as a Pan Am airline pilot would give him the gravitas to carry out his cons. It also meant that he could attract girls who liked a man in a uniform.Before long the cool as ice Frank pretended to be a doctor in an emergency room and later a lawyer.However hot on his trail was FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) who was on to Frank but had no idea that his prey was still a kid.Catch Me If You Can is slickly made. Spielberg has really gone for a stylish 1960s setting. He has a great performance from DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as his morally dubious father who seemed to tacitly approve of Frank jr's conduct.When I first watched this movie I did not like it as much. It was skillfully made but it was empty. I also thought Hanks was the weak link, he was trying too hard to make something of a character who was a non entity outside of his doggedness.Spielberg tried to push a father/son link between Frank and Carl and it did not work especially as Frank's father was more interesting.Second time around, I appreciated the upbeat frothiness. I still wished Spielberg could keep it light but it gets bogged down at the end with a stodgy ending.It also does not help that the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr, has now been exposed as heavily embellished. The con man made up his life story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
No kind of everyman,"The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
I love it,"One of the great movies. Great actors. The best thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story. It is about a kid who is good at making fake checks and earning millions of dollars by pretending to work in different jobs. The first job was that he pretended to be a sub teacher at age 17. Then his father lost his business and the family had lost their house and became broke. When that happened the parents got divorced and the kid wasn't happy about it. So he ran away and depend on himself. He became so professional at making fake checks. He once pretended to be a co-pilot at Pan American World Airways. Then he pretended to be a doctor and a lawyer. While making fake checks the FBI started to notice that the kid had stolen millions of dollars and FBI started looking for the kid. That is why the name of the movie is Catch Me If You Can.

"Catch Me If You Can (2002) - I Think The Title Just Says it All! Way to Go for Making Obvious Titles, Spielberg!","Based on the biographical true story and novel of con Frank Abagnale, Jr., this comedy-drama, directed by the amazing Steven Spielberg, is a look in the process of cons, criminals, and money scams. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career, as Frank Abagnale, Jr., who successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars, way before his 19th birthday. He was able to accomplish this crime by posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and a prosecutor. Since his primary crime was check fraud, Tom Hanks and the rest of the FBI are trying catch this maniac. This is truly one of Spielberg's best films, and I think I already knew that I would love it. Steven Spielberg delivers a fine directing job in this movie, and he truly knocked the ball out of the park once again. As for the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the entire movie as Frank Abagnale, Jr., and he should have received a Best Actor nomination. Tom Hanks is just awesome in this movie, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who tries to catch Abagnale and throw him into custody. Amy Adams is pleasant in this film as DiCaprio's nurse girlfriend, and Christopher Walken brings his classic ""nice guy"" attitude in an Oscar-nominated performance as Abagnale's father. Once again, this is another classic Spielberg collaboration, and it has never looked better. John Williams makes a classic original score, Janusz Kaminski creates fine cinematography, Michael Kahn delivers unique film editing, and Jeff Nathanson has created such a brilliant well-written script that really recreates the life of this regular criminal. This movie is filled with surprising drama, some funny laughs, and some brilliant touching moments that only the greatness of Spielberg can provide.

It's an interesting, light-hearted look at the true story of an extremely clever con artist, and full of great performances. Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments.And of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr., as he is in all of his roles. He really lets us see the humanity of the character and why he was the way he was, as well as does a great job in a more comedic role, different from the dark ones he usually tends to take on. He's the perfect mixture of suave, boyish and troubled that this character needs to be believable, and he pulls it off amazingly.In brief, this movie is something really different and incredibly interesting.

"Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best","Steven Spielberg frequently adds the father-son element into his films, but rarely is it as strong as it is in this movie. It never stops being flashy and fun as Abagnale embezzles and defrauds his way around the country, but Spielberg wedges that family angle in there and suddenly the film changes. It becomes about a boy in denial of his parents breaking apart and he thinks that by getting all this money he can push them back together. For all of his fake titles and wealth, he's just a sad kid trying to make his father proud of him.DiCaprio's performance is essential to that focus. He's a perfectly glitzy casting choice to play someone who weaves his way through the world on his charms, but his emotional distress at the shattering of his world is much more important. Of a hefty supporting cast, Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr, an infinite sadness appearing in his piercing eyes as he observes his renegade son during their many meetings. Amy Adams is a delight as the bracey, ugly duckling Brenda, and Martin Sheen adds considerable heft to the film as her father. Tom Hanks goes toe to toe with DiCaprio all throughout and makes for some of the best moments.All of the con scenes are superbly written, directed and shot, with lingering shots on DiCaprio's unblinking charm and clever movements disguising things to be hidden. The first meeting between Hanks and DiCaprio is a classic scene in its own right. The dialogue is so clipped and so well-written that it seems perfectly reasonable not to, say, open a wallet or trust a man's word. The scene in which DiCaprio escapes through a police blockade is superb, with the camera focusing on all the minute clues and then ending with that plane takeoff.

CRAP ME IF YOU CAN,"Leonardo Dicaprio unfortunately marred and tainted his career for life by choosing to do titanic. If I had the chance to make multi-millions and be an international sex star I probably would sell out too. His performance in this along with the rest of his films is superb. Unfortanetly Tom Hanks does exactly what he always does, act poorly. He always plays tom hanks playing someone else, he's not playing the FBI agent, he's playing tom hanks as the FBI agent. Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though.

This movie was witty and hilarious at times, and with sharp writing and non-stop action, it really delivers this story, which is inspired by one in real life, well.The story is about Frank Abagnale Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a very intelligent 16-year-old who runs away from home and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and succeeds in the meantime to steal millions of dollars using payroll checks. All this is, of course, not without consequences, and he soon has an FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, on his tail. And even though the two characters are rivals, you see throughout the movie a growing relationship between the two during the scenes they share together.The director of this movie, Steven Spielberg, is known for his epic Hollywood films, but this one feels a bit different and is a lot more lightweight, but still very interesting and at times powerful. There are scenes where Frank and his father, played by Christopher Walken, get pretty tense while they have conversations. The father-son relationship really made this movie a lot more interesting for me.All the actors did really great jobs here, DiCaprio was perfect for the role, Walken delivered a moving performance, and Tom Hanks was unsurprisingly terrific. Amy Adams, who I haven't mentioned was in this, was also great. As I said, all the actors were just great, and there's not much more to add to that.All in all, a solid, entertaining movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal as a very clever but emotionally weak guy, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the agent and provides an excellent complement to Leo's character. Christopher Walken is really impressive in the role of Frank's father and gives a high quality performance.

"Lots of star power, but a bogus story","An entertaining film, elevated by Hanks and DiCaprio, as well as the score from John Williams. It has too much of a glossy Hollywood feel to it though, and it was far too loose with the facts.

This is great as a fictional movie {Not a true story},This movie is not a true story.Frank Abagnale is a evil man who hated everyone around him and He stole from his father first. He had no relationsip at all with his dad nor did he attend his father's funeralI just don't understand why movies are able to promote these movies as true. The worst fake movie was Hoosiers. None of the Hoosiers movie is true.It is extremely deceptive to have Christopher Walken character in this movie as his father.

Very Entertaining,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With 'Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One Of The Best Biographical Films,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is one of Steven Spielberg's gorgeously crafted real life adaptations, along side with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". The only major difference between ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the other two is that this is obviously the only one with humorist moments, but not because of intended comedy, which is none, but due to one of Leonardo Di Caprio's most interesting and charming characters, Frank William Abagnale, all combined with the hilarious moments.This movie also features Christopher Walken in almost his best acting performance, as Frank Abagnale. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Walken touches us only by saying a few words, and so, he is simply magnificent. Furthermore, we have Tom Hanks, which fits perfectly in his role. A no-sense-of-humor federal agent, devoted and implicated in finishing his task? Hanks is definitely the best choice.To conclude, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another entertaining, effortlessly watchable Steven Spielberg film, that catches us in a lot of positive ways.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Excellent Movie!,"Catch Me If You Can is a very fine take on a true story. It brings together three of Hollywood's biggest names  Di Caprio, Hanks and Spielberg  in a collaboration that is certainly no pretender.Frank Abagnale Jr. and Stan Redding, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage boy growing up in 1960s New York who ran away from home following his parent's divorce and made a living out of slyly and meticulously impersonating a doctor, a co-pilot for Pan Am airlines, and a lawyer. Hot on his trail but seemingly always one step behind is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows to admire and respect Frank's clear brilliance despite having only met him once. Told in elongated flashbacks as Frank is being escorted by Hanratty to an American prison, Frank had cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks around the world and in all fifty states by the time he was caught at the age of 19.As if Spielberg hasn't shown himself to be the foremost American cinematic storyteller yet, Catch Me If You Can solidifies his position. This is the kind of film that reminds you of the absolute enjoyment of watching a great story in the hands of a great director and cast working with a love for the cinema that radiates from off the screen. But let's get one thing straight: Spielberg doesn't automatically make great movies because he's a great director; he's a great director because he has the ability to make great movies. Catch Me If You Can is one of them.Overall: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

How to get a job with the FBI,"""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the story of Frank Abagnale, con man. With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way, you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, and into some serious money. Reasonably entertaining and well crafted, this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously. It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama. Nonetheless, worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming.

Cat & mouse situations maintain interest to the end,"I was fascinated by the very original introductory credits and some of the best graphics in years. It grabbed my immediate interest and augured well for what was to follow.The film itself is based on a series of serious criminal offences perpetrated by a young man called Frank Abagnale.  The eventual outcome of his years of crime is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievable were it not for the fact that the events actually happened.The dramatic theme is handled with a very light touch...even with a sense of comedy at times.  Leonardo Di Caprio excels as the anti-hero giving us quite an arresting performance.  His role suggests that if you wish to impersonate someone the donning of a uniform ensures you are half way there.It is interesting that Tom Hanks was happy to play a supporting role. Despite his capable interpretation of the CIA agent, it is Leonardo's part as the lying,cheating, fraudulent impostor that will be remembered.To some extent some of the situations are repetitive and the film may be a trifle long, but I have to admit that there is a surge of interest in the end with an unpredictable aftermath of his life of crime.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Glossy, but not always classy","OK comedy/drama telling the story of young con man DiCaprio, chased by Hanks' FBI man.The opening credits and score set the tone for this retro looking film. Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts.However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time.The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately.

good one!,"The Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks pair are known for making one of the most entertaining movies on Earth. Their movies are generally long in duration, very narrative, simple and most importantly very entertaining. Some of the great examples of their movies are: Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal and now Catch Me If You Can. Steven Spielberg's unpredictable story idea together with Tom Hanks raw talent make an Oscar worthy combination.I had always wanted to watch this flick ever since I read about it back in 2002. I never came across any of it's television broadcast. So finally out of frustration I bought the DVD. Catch Me If You Can is about a character called Frank Abagnale Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who starts cheating on people and in the course of time becomes the biggest conman of USA. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an FBI detective who is determined to put an end to Abagnale's activities. After being duped by Abagnale at a hotel, Carl gets an idea about the perfection of Abagnale in duping people.Every actor in this movie is flawless. I was really impressed by Leonardo's performance first as a troubled young student and later as a full blown conman. Tom Hanks together with Christopher Walken adds spice to the movie. Tom's presence in any movie sets the mood of the audience. Martin Sheen is good too but his screen time is very less. Amy Adams was very natural in her acting.

Making A Dishonest Living,"Once again, director Steven Spielberg pulls another one of his patented surprises with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, a juicy crime caper film set in the 1960s and based on the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who ran away from home and went on a three-year spree of check forgery amounting to over $4 million.  Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Abagnale, who managed to impersonate a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and pretty much every other legitimate line of work to make himself rich before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught up with him.As played by the always-reliable Tom Hanks, Hanratty is a dedicated and cunning foil for DiCaprio's con-man Abagnale.  The two men find themselves locked into a deliciously suspenseful game of cat and mouse that frequently resembles Hitchcock's great caper films of the 50s.  The main titles sequence is priceless in its own right (if one didn't know better, one would swear this film had actually been made in the early 1960s), and John Williams concots a jazzy score redolent of Henry Mancini's classic 60s film scores.

Sit Through Me If You Can!,"Catch Me If You Can: Once again Steven Spielberg manages to take an interesting story and turn it into a deeply boring movie.  Based on the autobiography of a confidence man who turned check kiting into a bona fide art form, this movie not only doesn't elevate the material, it leaves you longing for a return to the ""To Tell The Truth"" tv clip that opens the movie, because at least that format contains a smidgen of suspense.As for the cast, Christopher Walken, in a supporting role as the protagonist's father, succeeds, as usual, in engaging us briefly, but even his inspired hoofing can't bust through the 2 hour 20 minute wall of stunningly empty visuals and bland dialogue.  Tom Hanks, playing the FBI agent that pursues our hero/antihero, spices up his usual cranky bureaucrat character with an interesting accent!  Merci, Herr Hanks!  Leonardo DiCaprio...well...was this guy ever good?  Seriously, what was he good in? And don't say ""Gilbert Grape"", 'cause nine years is a long time to coast on a heartwarming portrayal of a hydrocephalic.  Not that it hasn't be tried many, many times in Hollywood.Spielberg's direction is snappy and devoid of life.  His characters get let off the hook all too easily.  I couldn't tell if the protagonist's romance was shallow and unconvincing because he's a con man, or because, well, it's a Steven Spielberg movie.  And the script is surprisingly bad, adorned as it is with every predictable device, and relying as it does on a series of emotional ""gotchas"" that bounce off with no discernable impact.  Not at all what you would expect from a writer whose credits include Speed 2 AND Rush Hour 2.  I hope Frank Abagnale got a lot of money in return for seeing his life turned into earnest, awful pablum.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Incredibly watchable and enjoyable, but it really glorifies criminal behavior.","""Catch Me If You Can"" is a very slickly made and entertaining film. It's about a young guy who had a history of impersonating various careers...like Tony Curtis in ""The Great Imposter"". If you watch it, you are almost guaranteed to like it as everything about the production is top notch. However, I should add one important thing. The main character is a criminal...a very bad man who hurt a lot of people....though the film makes him look pretty cool and clever. I've dealt with a man just like Frank from the film....and they aren't cool but selfish and vicious. They are sociopaths who have no conscience and leave a LONG trail of injured people due to their behaviors. So, by all means watch the film but understand that there are a lot of imposters like this but there is no way they ever could have done what they did without hurting a lot of people....a lot....especially when they pretend to be doctors, dentists, psychologists, preachers and more.Overall, an exceptionally directed and acted film, but one that might leave you with the impression that such individuals are not as harmful as they actually are. I would actually love to see a film like this that actually focuses much more on the hard the imposters have done instead of glorifying their misdeeds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Catch Me If You Can: 8/10,"Catch Me If You Can starts off with a boom with a very suave opening credits sequence, where sample people are chasing/being chased and using the credits to hide. Very clever, like the rest of the movie. Then we go to Marseille, France, where Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is talking to Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and he is released from prison. We are then taken six years earlier, to 1963.Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a grifter of sorts, but nothing major. He's being investigated for tax fraud. And when Frank's mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) is caught cheating, Frank leaves home and first tries out theft in his father's petty ways. Soon he gets way over his head and becomes infamous for writing checks, and soon he's stolen over $4 million. But Hanratty and the FBI is close onto Frank, but always one step behind.I have got to hand it to Steven Spielberg-taking a concept that people like I haven't heard of (gotta read the book!) and manipulating it into a multi-layered story of cat-and-mouse. Of course, it could have been better if there had been more sub-plots. It's mainly Frank having fun and Hanratty chasing him. Also, Hanratty's person needed more depth, but I'll talk about that later.Catch Me If You Can has a good deal of humor for a movie billed as a drama. Its opening credit sequence and Frank's schemes took most of the humor. During his first day at a new school, at a French class, there's no teacher, so why not act as one? That was his first step to stardom, so to speak. I love how he made the checks at PanAm (I'll keep it a surprise). The first half was better than the second half, because it was funnier and more involved. The first half had information about the family and his jobs as a PanAm pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Of course, he hasn't had any training, and it's always worth a laugh to see him struggle. The second half took itself too seriously, and had the now-famous Spielberg fake ending, but at least it wasn't as severe as AI or Minority Report.Depth of the characters, you ask? The movie focused most of the time on Frank, Jr., of course, but we do know some about Frank, Sr. His mother was very underdeveloped and could have been utilized better. Hanratty, we don't really know much about, so it's hard to get deep into his character (but you did get to like Frank). We do learn about his past at the end, but that's kind of unnecessary, isn't it?Leo, I'm not sure if he deserved a Golden Globe nomination, but he was very good. I enjoyed his `dapper dan' attitude, which is what the whole movie was like. It didn't find itself serious (until the end), so it allowed some sort of suave cockiness, which added to the fun and the authentic feel of the 60s (not that I would know, of course). Hanks, with his usual Southern accent, seemed fine (nothing like The Green Mile, though). All of the supporting characters knew their parts (and the one-liners didn't overact or anything!). Jennifer Garner, as a prostitute, is waster and not really needed, mainly just to get to the overlong 140 minute runtime.It's really fun and unpredictable (except the ending); you don't know how Frank is going to conjure up his next scheme. Sure, it tried to get sappy at the end, but it made you feel good, and that's what great movies are all about.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A crime to have not seen this movie,"This is one of my greatest of all time movie favourites for many reasons. There are some movies that would be good even if you had a number of different actors playing those roles, the story is good enough. But what a treat with Catch me if you can in not only such a compelling TRUE story! But you also get the dream combo of Leo and Tom. These two are such high quality actors that fit takes thisbmovie to the next level. The story has such a strong hook that it's hard not to be invested.

However have they done that?
Along side the story and the acting is the music. Right from the opening animation credits you are thrust into this epic soundtrack that is upbeat, interesting and full of suspense.This whole movie is full of suspense. It can be tense and you know that Leo will end up getting caught. It also have a very intriguing finish with a complete character turn around, showing some redemption.It's great to see that the movie stacks up with the real story, other than the toilet scene.

light hearted romp,Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a con man with a colorful career and father issues. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who doggedly hound Frank.Director Steven Spielberg has instilled a sense of play in this true story. He could have made this a more intense thriller. But it ends up being a light hearted romp. I'm not deducting points for that. It's a choice Spielberg made for this movie.Leo has all the fun. He is that guy. He is the suave playboy who can get all the girls base solely on his charm. This was probably happening even before he made a name for himself. Leo is Frank Abagnale Jr.Tom Hanks is a little different. I am unconvinced that he is that guy. Tom is more light hearted and it adds to that prevailing sense.

Catch this film if you can.,"I'd never heard of Frank Abagnale Jr before ""Catch Me If You Can"" came out, but what a guy! Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio's cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the '60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn't Steven Spielberg's best movie by any stretch, but it's sure a neat one. There is one scene that's probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin.

Entertaining? Yes! Believable? Nah,"At first Catch Me If You Can reels the viewer in with its sharp script and phenomenal performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken. However, as the story progresses, as a viewer, I went from thinking ""Ha, how clever! That's so smart how he got away with that!"" to ""Uh, yeah no, I have serious doubts that would work. Yeah there's no way"". The real story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Is interesting enough, they did not need to embellish the story this much. Steven Spielberg is an excellent director, and it really shows here. In a lesser directors hands, this movie would have spiraled out of control under the weight of its own absurdity. And that's unfortunately what Catch Me If You Can devolves into. Absurdity.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
It's fantastic... do you concur?,"Catch Me If You Can is an elegant, breezy movie with a fun tone that I've seen many times. In fact, I just got done watching it tonight! And it's as great as people say it is.Based on the semi-autobiographical book of the same name by the infamous conman Frank William Abagnale Jr., Catch Me If You Can is a retelling of how Frank (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) successfully pulled off a series of scams worth about $4 million by posing as a Pan Am copilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor, and depositing forged checks all around the world... all before his 19th birthday. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) makes it his top mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him. While I haven't actually read the book, and can't show a bias, in fact, the truth of Frank's story has been disputed. However, the real Frank has approved of the movie as 80% accurate, something I'm pleased to know. Truth be told, my mom actually met the real Frank around this time last year.The acting is fabulous. Leonardo DiCaprio is especially good as Frank. He does a really good job of accurately portraying his craftiness, wit and slick charm. Tom Hanks is about as comically serious as he can get as Carl. Christopher Walken gives a very poignant, against-type performance as Frank's dad, Frank Sr.The writing is tremendous. The movie has really good worldbuilding, a fun, bouncy tone, and good comedic timing. I especially loved the scene of Frank posing as a substitute teacher just to humiliate a bullying classmate of his at his new school, and the scene of him pulling his first duty as a lawyer by riffing off a courtroom scene from the Perry Mason episode The Case of the Jealous Journalist. It's where the movie starts to take a darker turn two thirds of the way through that I begin to lose interest. If there's any real flaw that this movie has, it's the pacing. A couple times, the movie seems like it's going to end, but it can't because Frank keeps running away, until you're kind of just waiting for Carl to catch him.The opening credits are really neat. By displaying little animated characters playing out the movie, what with a cop chasing a figure who changes outfits constantly, they set the stage for the entire movie without giving away or replacing anything important.And of course, the music. As always, the score is by John Williams, who always delivers a masterful score when he's working with Steven Spielberg. This movie's no exception! In fact, his score for this movie is unusual. For this movie, he deviated from his signature bombastic, thrilling orchestral approach, in favor of supplying this movie with a fittingly sly, jazzy Henry Mancini-esque score.All in all, Catch Me If You Can is one of the finer movies Steven Spielberg has directed. I recommend it to anyone who likes comedy-crime movies!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Well made, but romanticizing an evil, psychopathic criminal in this way is sick!","I'd always thought these ""pretender"" guys were in it for the thrill, the romance, the acting out of diverse roles, etc. That they loved the challenge, and that kind of thing. Didn't Tony Curtis play someone like that 30-40 years ago, also based on a true story? Anyway--- I was a bit surprised to find out that the Leo DiCaprio character was a criminal--- a thief, a forger, a rip-off artist merely in it for the cash. As he was portrayed in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" he seemed psychopathic, cruel and fundamentally evil.This movie is unquestionably well-made. DiCaprio has displayed admirable maturity and power as an actor--- he no longer looks like a girl. he actually resembles a young Johnny Depp (and that's a good thing). Tom Hanks is also typically great. The 60s period setting is all good. But what I saw on the screen was a lot of innocent people having their lives ruined, in both big and some small ways: The would-be stewardesses who were humiliat ed, the fiance was unnecessarily hurt, her father was abused--- and why? What did those people do that made it OK for the movie audience to laugh out loud at their pain? The people who lost the $4 million dollars ($15 million in today's money), the various folks whose jobs were threatened, etc. How many families lost their income? How many elderly people suddenly could not retire as planned, but had to crawl off, unwanted, to some corner to die?Part of this movie wants us to somehow cheer for the Abagnale guy, to somehow ""see through his flaws"" and yet love him anyway. Bulls***! Based on what the movie showed, he was a horrible, evil little vampire. Hurting, destroying, crapping all over decent folks. His victims weren't even guilty of that old cliche rationale movie con-men have so often used, that they were trying to gain unfair advantage themselves--- no, the victims had done nothing wrong. They were not ""up to anything."" They were merely trusting others, and being loving.For this reason, this otherwise very good Speilberg effort was a bit disgusting. Movies over the years such as ""Fitzwilly,"" ""The Sting,"" ""The Flim-Flam Man,"" and ""Paper Moon"" all romanticize and celebrate evil, because they all make light of thieves and seducers. But think about the people they hurt, the people they destroy--- somehow the victims are always forgotten in that Disneyesque focus on the cute little heroes. I'm sorry Steven, but the subject matter of this movie has gone too far. If you want to make a movie about Charles Manson the monster--- fine. I won't watch it, but at least the movie would be honest. To have made this movie about ""Frank Abagnale The Cute Misunderstood Thief Who Is Really A Romantic Hero"" is sick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Art of the Chase: Catch Me If You Can's Stylish Cat-and-Mouse Tale,"Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can is a masterclass in storytelling, combining charm, wit, and tension into an exhilarating cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film follows the extraordinary exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young con artist whose audacity knows no bounds. With its stellar performances and slick direction, this film earns an enthusiastic 9/10.Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Frank, effortlessly balancing charisma and vulnerability in his portrayal of a teenager navigating a life of deception. Opposite him, Tom Hanks delivers a grounded and nuanced performance as Carl Hanratty, the determined FBI agent on Frank's trail. The dynamic between these two characters is the heart of the film, evolving from adversarial to something unexpectedly poignant.Spielberg's direction is as sharp as ever, blending the glamour of Frank's high-flying schemes with the emotional depth of his personal struggles. The 1960s period setting is brought to life with meticulous attention to detail, from the vibrant costumes to the jazzy score by John Williams, which perfectly captures the film's playful yet sophisticated tone.What makes Catch Me If You Can stand out is its seamless blend of excitement and emotion. While the thrilling cons and close calls keep you on the edge of your seat, the film never loses sight of its underlying themes of identity and belonging. Frank's journey is as much about escaping as it is about finding his place in a world that constantly eludes him.Stylish, smart, and surprisingly heartfelt, Catch Me If You Can is a cinematic delight that entertains while leaving you with much to reflect on. It's a reminder that even in a story of deception, the search for connection and redemption is unmistakably human.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

You care about Frank even though you really shouldn't because he's a criminal. But they made it so you really did care about him and it's what made the film. I'm utterly speechless.

Classy Con Caper,"Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 film which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. It tells the story of a young con man (DiCaprio) and the FBI agent chasing him (Hanks). Directed by Steven Spielberg this film was apparently based on a true story, and really is a joy to watch. Filled with humour, drama and pathos this film really hits the mark. DiCaprio is superb here, really lighting up the screen maximising his star charisma. He is ably supported by Tom Hanks and evenly matched by one of the most underrated performers in cinema history in Christopher Walken. Every time Walken and DiCaprio share a scene the screen really lights up both being at the top of there game. Particular highlights for me in the film were the Christmas Eve scenes and you can really feel DiCaprio's loneliness at his shallow life shine through, all the while just wanting the love of a proper family, a void all the money in the world couldn't fill. The film is well shot and moves along at a brisk pace, never really feeling like its 2 hour 15 minute length. The score by Jon Williams is serviceable but nothing special. A slight negative is that the film feels like it goes on slightly too long but that is in all honesty nit picking. In summary Catch Me If You Can is a fantastically enjoyable film and deserves to be held in greater esteem than it currently is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Spielberg Fails,"Steven Spielberg normally does a pretty good job with adapting books to movies, but this time he is way off! He has taken a fantastic story that could have been, in my opinion, shot directly from the book, and turned it into Fluff. While Leo DiCaprio does a fair job in a now bland part and Tom Hanks saves the film with his performance, people that have read the book will be sorely disappointed. The surprising thing is, Mr. Spielberg is usually so careful about getting things right, I have a hard time understanding how he got this one so wrong. The film takes way too long to get going, and when it does it's so slow it's hard to watch. Even if I wasn't a big fan of the book, this movie would be bad.Maybe he should call it Catch me in ""1941""",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Enjoyable movie but not much else,"As the title above stated this movie is enjoyable but not much else.It really feels like some of the scenes are added on for more padding and to make the movie longer which is rather odd considering it probably would've been better without the excess fat.Performances are very good with a star studded cast as expected from these names, both DiCaprio and Hanks deliver fantastic performances in their respective roles which make their characters be a lot of believable.Despite the padding the movie itself kind of feels flat, especially when you put the whole background story for Frank and he's still rather empty as a character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The casting is also on point, DiCaprio fit really well in this charming, energic character. I like how they reference The Flash in this film.

Attention Got Away,"This movie had so much going for it - big name actors, period sets and locations, respectable budget etc. But for me didn't really come together. I also wonder why watch a movie about a faker? This movie glorifies the cheat at the expense of the honest people of that era, which I find rather sad. Who wouldn't want to go back to that time compared to now, at least for a visit? The action was also rather tepid. I'm not sure the casting was right either. The movie could have been a lot better maybe if the actors were in to it a little more. A decade earlier, this would have been a perfect movie for Val Kilmer and Tommy Lee Jones with stepped up action sequences and pace. Leo's pleading personality also seemed a little too much for me compared to the smoother style of the real life version, who whose common working class looks allowed him to slip through the cracks of the system easier. Also, Tom Hanks as the Fed was all covered up with hat and coat most of the time, making it hard to develop his character. The musical score was also boring. That said, Steven Spielberg doesn't make bad movies, this one sort of labored on in an autobiographical way and was not as engaging as others he's done and lacked something I can't put my finger on. At the end of the day, the movie failed to plie the viewer and for that reason in my opinion is over-rated on this site. Also recommend watching original first for comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Spielberg's Dreadful Remake of The Great Impostor.,"How many dreadful movies can this Spielberg guy generate before the public catches on that he's a flash-in-the-pan non talent who got lucky with Jaws and Raiders, crash-diving every time thereafter. Sure, some were taken-in by Saving Private Ryan, actually taking it as a patriotic movie when, in fact, it thoroughly trashed our World War II veterans. Perhaps the day has arrived, as this and other Spielberg films (Terminal, Lady Killers) did poor box office.Herein Spielberg takes a hand at retelling the story previously filmed well by Universal in ""The Great Impostor"" starring Tony Curtis. The original film was definitely offbeat, but lighthearted. Impossible to believe, except they said it was all true. The newer version has a nasty tone to it, and fails to engage the audience. I like Leonardo De Caprio a lot, but thought he struck out in this one. Tom Hanks used to be an exceptional actor, but now seems content to be an extended body part to his one and only master.This is really half a review, as I couldn't get beyond 60 minutes of the dreary mess.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Extraordinary!,"This film is a ""Based on a true story"" flick that follows Frank Abagnale Jr (aka Frank Taylor aka Frank Connors etc.) through an adventure that can only be described as 'Make believe' meets 'Hide-and-Seek' mixed with 'Monopoly'. Frank runs away from home at 17 when his parents divorce and reinvents himself - as a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and so on, living in grand style by defrauding banks of millions of dollars, passing fake checks, all the while playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an FBI agent whose mission it is to track him down and collar him.The movie is definitely a tad on the long side, but it keeps pace - you don't get bored, and the plot/editing is unique...you don't have to worry about guessing the ending 30 minutes before it actually happens. I am not usually a DiCaprio fan, but he renders a very real, believable performance. Tom Hanks, however, needed a little more work with a dialogue coach...his 'accent' was so poorly done, I really couldn't tell where he was supposed to be from!

Romp with an Impostor,"Steven Spielberg's account of the truly fascinating story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an impostor and con artist who waltzed from one side of the country to the other in the 1960s, ripping off just about everyone along the way.The film's period look is a lot of fun, and though the film gets a little sluggish at times -- not a complaint I can usually level at a Spielberg film -- it remains pretty entertaining. My biggest complaint might seem like a nit-picky one, but regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski handles the film's cinematography all wrong. Kaminski takes the same approach to lighting his films no matter what the subject: washed out color, backlit interiors. This works for gritty stuff like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List,"" but doesn't for something like this film. But whatever....Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail and Christopher Walken gives a heartbreaking, Academy-Award nominated performance as Abagnale's washed up dad.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Catch Me If You Can ( 2002 ) - Jaisef's Review,"Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can is a thrilling mix of charm, wit, and emotional depth. Leonardo DiCaprio dazzles as Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenage con artist who bluffs his way into high society, and Tom Hanks delivers a grounded, heartfelt performance as FBI agent Carl Hanratty. Based on a true story, the film takes you on an exhilarating journey through the life of a boy yearning for love and stability, who finds his escape in deception.Frank's story begins with an abnormal childhood. His father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), is a small-time conman whose IRS troubles force the family into a smaller apartment. When Frank witnesses his mother having an affair with a family friend and later endures his parents' divorce, he runs away, unable to cope with the emotional turmoil.Frank's genius for deception soon emerges. Armed with a magnetic personality, quick thinking, and some forged documents, he starts impersonating professionals.The Pilot:
Frank's most iconic con is posing as a Pan Am pilot. Wearing a stolen uniform, he cashes fake checks, stays in luxurious hotels, and flies for free around the world. These scenes are thrilling, with Spielberg highlighting Frank's charm as he confidently strolls through airports, leaving everyone awestruck.The Doctor:
Frank later pretends to be a doctor, ""Dr. Frank Conners,"" supervising interns in a Georgia hospital. The tension is palpable as he bluffs his way through medical emergencies, relying on his wits to avoid exposure.The Lawyer:
In another daring move, Frank claims to be a Harvard-educated lawyer and passes the Louisiana State Bar exam. Whether he actually studied or found another way remains one of the film's great mysteries.The Rich Playboy:
One particularly entertaining scene involves Frank pretending to be a wealthy businessman to win over an escort (played by Jennifer Garner). He dazzles her with his charm and negotiates her fee in advance, paying her with a forged check that she only realizes is fake after he's long gone. The scene is both hilarious and a testament to Frank's audacity and cunning.Amid all these cons, Frank's heart remains focused on his broken family. In a deeply emotional scene, he gifts his father a Cadillac DeVille and pleads with him to reunite with his mother. The lack of background music in this moment emphasizes the raw, unfiltered emotions. DiCaprio's performance here is heartbreakingly vulnerable, showing a young man desperate for his father's love and approval.Another heart-wrenching moment in Catch Me If You Can occurs after Frank escapes from prison in France. He goes to his mother's house, seeking comfort and perhaps a glimmer of the family he once knew. Instead, he is confronted with a painful reality: through the window, he sees his mother married to another man and holding a young child, her new family. This moment shatters Frank. The small girl, playing in the living room, represents the life Frank has been excluded from. His mother has moved on completely, leaving no room for the son who still yearned to mend their fractured bond.This scene is a powerful reminder of the emotional void that drives Frank's actions. The sight of his mother's happiness, without him or his father, highlights his unspoken grief and loss. It's a silent but devastating realization that the family he longed for is irretrievably gone. Spielberg's masterful direction ensures the moment lingers, allowing the audience to feel Frank's despair and deep sense of abandonment.The Chase and Carl's Role as a Father Figure.FBI agent Carl Hanratty is introduced as the determined investigator hunting Frank. Their cat-and-mouse chase spans years and continents, with Carl slowly beginning to understand Frank's motivations.The turning point in their relationship comes when Carl arrests Frank in France. Despite the arrest, their dynamic shifts from adversarial to almost familial. Carl sees through Frank's façade and becomes the father figure he desperately needs. In one touching scene, Carl visits Frank in prison on Christmas Eve, showing genuine care and compassion.Carl's decision to recruit Frank into the FBI's fraud division is not just professional-it's personal. He believes in Frank's potential for redemption, and their eventual friendship feels earned and deeply satisfying.Themes and Performances
Catch Me If You Can is more than a thrilling tale of cons; it's a story about love, loss, and the search for belonging. Frank's actions may be criminal, but his motivations-rooted in a longing for family-make him a deeply sympathetic character.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a career-defining performance, capturing Frank's charm, intelligence, and vulnerability. Tom Hanks, as Carl, provides the perfect counterbalance, portraying unwavering moral strength and quiet empathy. Jennifer Garner's cameo as the escort adds a layer of humor and highlights Frank's resourcefulness.Spielberg's direction is masterful, balancing the excitement of Frank's cons with the emotional weight of his personal struggles. John Williams' score enhances every moment, seamlessly transitioning from playful to poignant.The Ending and Redemption.The ending is as heartwarming as it is satisfying. After serving his prison sentence, Frank finds redemption by using his skills to help the FBI fight fraud. The friendship between Frank and Carl endures, and Frank eventually builds a stable life with a family of his own.Jaisef's Final Thoughts
Catch Me If You Can is a near-perfect film that blends suspense, humor, and heartfelt emotion. Frank's cons are dazzling, but it's his vulnerability and humanity that make the story unforgettable. Spielberg, DiCaprio, and Hanks create a cinematic experience that is both entertaining and deeply moving.Jaisef's Verdict :Frank's story is a testament to resilience and the human capacity for redemption. A true classic that must not be missed!Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Blessed Return to Normalcy,"A good story.  Not nearly as pretentious, overblown or intellectually devoid as, say, everything Spielberg has directed since 1994.It still has its flaws, and I'm wondering if ol' Spielberg chose to focus on the father-son relationship a little more than other important aspects of Abagnale's life... or if he's just showing his lack of ability to direct actors.  I know, I know, that's blasphemy... but the parents in ""A.I."" and the modern-day old people scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"" were just SO bad, I have to wonder if he picked Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen for ""CMIYC"" because a) They wanted to work with him badly, or b) They wouldn't require the direction of someone less experienced or less accomplished. Sound fishy?  Explain the parents in ""A.I.""  Switched loyalties like some people switch channels........As for ""Catch Me,"" it's a cute, breezy film, with very few flaws.  The most glaring:a) Jennifer Garner's one scene makes absolutely no sense, it's a non-sequitur.  If she'd turned out to be an undercover agent, that would have been something.  Instead, she just shows up, pulls money from her bra, and is gone again.  I felt violated, like I just watched a plug for her television show in the middle of an otherwise fun movie.  She obviously wasn't a prostitute because Frank says he recognizes her... I never did understand the fascination with this actress (assuming any actually exists).b) Brenda Strong, and her father, played by Martin Sheen.  Once they exit the film, they are never mentioned again.  They're set up to be fairly important in Frank's life, and I'm left wondering what became of them / Frank's relationship with them.  This isn't a plot hole, so much as a huge gaping annoyance.  Perhaps Spielberg is getting senile; no, it's not the screenwriter's fault, the director should be able to look at the script and go, ""Hey, Jeff, what happens to characters X, Y and Z?""Beyond that: cute, breezy and worth seeing at least twice, so you can put it all together and admire some of the DP's camerawork (which alternates between the fancy and the mundane).  Kudos to Nathanson/Spielberg for giving it a fourth and fifth act, and giving us that much more about Abagnale's life.Flawed, but only a few film geeks will notice.  It gets an A from me, your opinion may vary.  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One Of The Year's Best!!!,"Catch Me If You Can [PG-13] Running Time, 2 hours: 20 minutes Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio Tom Hanks Christopher WalkenDirected by Steven SpielbergWell Leonardo Dicaprio has returned to the big-screen these past few weeks with two great movies, by two great directors. The previous film that was released to star Dicaprio was Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese. This week, we have a very different kind of movie from the man I like to refer to as `the great one,' called Catch Me If You Can.  `The great one,' being Steven Spielberg, my favorite director who's made some of the finest motion pictures in history. In my opinion, the release of a Steven Spielberg film is an event. He's created some of the most memorable and beautiful scenes in movie history. For example, who could forget the touching goodbye of E.T., or the horrifying invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can is no exception to the greatness of Steven Spielberg's direction. This isn't one of his best movies, but it is one of the best films of 2002. What's more, who could resist a movie that also stars Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. 	The story was inspired by the real events of Frank Abagnale, who as a young man eluded the authorities of millions of dollars in check fraud. Dicaprio plays Abagnale, and he certainly pulls off a stellar performance that will leave you laughing and saying, `my God, how does he get away with all this!' Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who tracks Abagnale across the world. Among the identities that Abagnale assumed while forging checks was that of an airline pilot for Pan Am, a doctor, and a lawyer. It all leads to Abagnale one day working for the FBI in the check fraud division, and helps bring many criminals to justice. 	This film is really witty and will certainly leave it's audience pleased. Many people agree that the film is fun to watch, as well. It's especially great to see Leo portray the young Frank Abagnale, as Frank becomes obsessed with modeling himself after James Bond. Even going as far as to buy an Aston Martin with the money that he's received from the forged checks. This film is definitely worth seeing and is certainly one of best movies of the year. Quite possibly, in my top five picks of the year. And actually, I liked this more than Spielberg's other film released this past summer, Minority Report that starred Tom Cruise. Great work by John Williams on scoring another fine soundtrack to another great Spielberg film. Williams uses some jazzy ensembles in the score to represent the time and feeling of the film, although the main title theme of Catch Me If You Can is hardly one of a large sweeping theme. Nonetheless, there's little if anything to complain about here. The film works on all levels and I highly recommend seeing it. I was waiting to acknowledge what the best movie of the year was until I saw Catch Me If You Can. Well, I don't think that Catch Me If You Can is the best movie of the year, although one of the best films of 2002. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Will Spielberg ever make a good movie again,"If this movie had ended straight after the superb opening titles then perhaps I would think more highly of it. Well, initially, it's fairly average, with a fair dash of schmaltz, but nothing too terrible... but it goes on for so long. Chase movies shouldn't last 140 minutes. CMIYC continues Spielberg's inexplicable trend of dragging the ending on forever. Surprisingly, the one good thing about the movie is Tom Hanks, playing an up-tight obssessive FBI agent.

Am I The Only One Who Read The Book First?,"Frank Abnigale Jr. appeared on the TV show PEOPLE ARE TALKING in the early 90's I believe. My mother and I were in awe of this man's true story and bought and read his book.  I kept waiting for a movie to be made, but it never happened.....until now.This is a GOOD MOVIE, but 2 hours is just not long enough to tell all the juicy details of this man's story.  This movie is entertaining, but lacks the depth of the whole story. But heck, it's just a movie.I, for one, wouldn't have minded seeing this movie play longer, but I am sure the studios didn't want to release a 3 hour movie.  A two part mini-series might still give the story justice.  Frank Abnigale Jr. did so much more than what was put into this movie. It was still fun though.Left out, were quite a bit of the details about how he LEARNED fraudulent technique.  I wonder if Spielberg thought the audience would be bored by such detail, but in fact, I would have been riveted. The movie feels like it's in a hurry (hardy har har) and is afraid of boring its audience.Too fluffy for oscar buzz with the exception of Christopher Walken.

Disconnected,"The movie feels extremely disjoint. Three (counting the Xmas calls) years of Frank being tracked down compressed in less than two hours do not make for very exciting story telling. It is merely a case of Frank jumping from one role into another. His ability to act these roles proficiently is only tested once in each situation. However, a year in each of these roles would necessitate the construction of a more elaborate personality for Frank than what is depicted in the movie.Some scenes seem to have been put into the movie without reason. For example, the whole set of scenes starting from the 'james bond of the skies' comment to the scene at room 3113 serve no purpose. Frank at another role. What does it tells other than that Frank likes role playing?Overall it is somewhat enjoyable... but Frank's character is not interesting enough, despite its many transformations.

Enjoyable caper,"'Catch Me If You Can' is a beautifully crafted caper from Spielberg. Featuring terrific performances from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken the film exudes quality from start to finish. The depicted time period is captured and expressed to perfection: the sets, cars and clothes are a joy to behold at times and you find yourself genuinely lost in Frank Abagnale JR.'s world of deception. The lighting is wonderful, all sunlight streaming through windows and half closed curtains, giving the film a timeless, fairytale look, perhaps serving as a metaphor for the make believe world of young Frank as he impersonates both a doctor and an airline pilot whilst conning America's banks out of millions of dollars through bogus cheques, all before his 18th birthday. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and the reasons behind Frank's descent into a life of crime are carefully illustrated and conscientiously referred to throughout the movie. I highly recommend 'Catch Me If You Can' as it is refreshing, well made and absorbing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Busy but successful,"At the beginning of Catch Me if you Can. I felt that there was too much going on for this film to be successful. I felt that there were too many time switches back and forth and that maybe Spielberg had ruined a perfectly good movie trying to make it a Spielberg movie. However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a ""cooler"" actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be ""cool"" so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater.

"Good Fun; DiCaprio's Best Since ""Titanic""","This movie earns a good rating if only for bringing to light the unbelievable and yet true story of Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a young scam artist who bilked banks out of millions and who, having been captured and come clean, eventually put his talents to work in the other direction. If you can get through what I thought was an agonizingly boring animated sequence that runs during the opening credits (which seemed to go on forever) you'll enjoy this.The movie is about Abagnale's criminal days, and takes the viewer on a roller coaster of situations which Abagnale manages to lie, swindle and cheat his way through, all the time being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks); thus the title of the movie. It's a fun story (particularly, I thought, his very first ""scam"" - as a student at a new school, he manages to convince people that he's a substitute French teacher and actually ""works"" in that capacity for 10 days until he's discovered!)In my opinion, this is DiCaprio's best performance since ""Titanic."" I haven't been impressed with his work since, but here he really managed to become the character of Abagnale (much as he did with Dawson in ""Titanic"") rather than simply looking as though he were acting a part. He was clearly the star of the movie. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, quite surprisingly disappointed me a bit, and I would rarely say that about such a talented actor. Perhaps it was the part of Hanratty, but Hanks just didn't stand out to me. It seemed as though a hundred actors could have played the role without anything (except the name Tom Hanks) being lost. So, my normal expectations of the two stars were reversed here, which made the movie all the more interesting.It's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Later on, Abagnale would give up his life of crime and become a lecturer and author.As drama, the movie works.

Based on a true story!? This happened in real life! I just had to find out what in the world was he doing being able to do all that!? Quite an interesting story.
It's about Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo Dicaprio) a young man who was able to con people being a doctor, a legal prosecutor and a pilot. And now the FBI , specifically Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is trying to catch him.
This was just incredible and shocking. Purely intelligent to be able to pull off something like this. What he did with those toy airplanes from Pan AM, that was genius, I was really impressed. How can someone have the guts to do all this and not be afraid of being caught just blows my mind.
Even though Frank was busy making money and impersonating different professions , he was lonely, missing his mom and dad very much wishing he had the old life he had with them. He was hoping all the money he was making can take him back to the way they were but it didn't. And he very much looked up to his father (Christopher Walken) they insinuated he had a part in making him the way he was. I wasn't very happy with his mom and her actions. A woman who looks for opportunities only.

A film about the consequences of divorce,"There are two reasons which made me unable to enjoy this original and amusing story from A to Z. One is Leonardo DiCaprio, who, unfortunately, has the leading part in this film. He plays an 17-year-old boy who looks ten years older than he is, all right but he absolutely failed to convince me that he is really only 17. Sometimes he tries to play particularly `childish' in order to emphasize his real age but everything else  marrying, cheating, etc.  he does like Leonardo would do it, not like a minor whose parents got divorced (no matter how super-intelligent this minor may be).The other problem is that this is a Steven Spielberg film. I was looking forward to see it because I thought maybe Spielberg has, for a change, chosen to tell a good-humoured story about a good-humoured sly fox in a good-humoured way. And I guess, any other director would have done so. But Spielberg would never get away from his crucial but corny theme: family. And he would make a family film out of every subject put in his hands. And this, in my opinion, harms the film very much. A movie based upon a true story can never be really true. So Spielberg had the chance to decide to skip famiy sentimentalities. But he didn't.If you want to see a good film on family, watch The Royal Tenenbaums or the Danish documentary Family. If you want to see Catch Me If You Can, do so. It is really entertaining, brilliantly filmed and well acted by the whole cast with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio.

An entertaining film,"Just a short piece about ""Catch Me..""  (no spoilers here).  I think Leonardo C  was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be  8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok.   The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore.  The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments.  There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office.  I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil.

Good entertainment but should have been better...,"There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience. Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his ""nice"" score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's high security--or is it??",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great job by Spielberg both technically and story-telling wise,"The movie opens up very very uniquely.

Also the cinematography at times indulges the audience with great moving shots. The acting work in overall is a great work. Having the cast comprise of an ensemble is a good thing to balance DiCaprio's acting in the scenes and also grab attention for them.

So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off.

Tom Hanks is amazing, he nails the unrelenting determination to catch DiCaprio and his experience contrasts DiCaprio's youthful energy.Steven Spielberg's direction is full of his trademark warmth whilst utilising Janusz Kaminski's dynamic cinematography to create striking framing and impressive camerawork that's deliberately understated.

Not too exciting,"A kid with special talent for cheating and swindling takes it as a way of life after the shock he feels with his parents' divorce.

The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie.

Overrated Rough-Cut of a Movie,"I saw this movie at the german premiere in berlin. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio appeared and the little girls outside went nuts. All Spielberg had to say about the movie before the screening was ""Nobody dies in this movie."" Hmmm. Anyway, the movie was quite boring. If you have seen the trailer (which was good), you have seen enough. It is always very suspicious when the most interesting part of a story is, that it is based on a true story. The movie gives everything away in the first five minutes and has nothing to add in the following two hours. Camerawork, production value, design, acting - all very high standard, but the movie lacks a heart. Maybe that's because Spielberg was originally producer of this flick and had to jump in to direct it at the last second. It had some nice parts, I smiled sometimes and the characters are sympathetic. But it has big dragging holes in between and it's repetetive. All in all it looks like a rough cut and maybe it would have been better, if they took out another twenty five minutes. Well... maybe not. I gave it a six (out of ten).",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of Spielberg weakest works.,"Here came the time when I finally watched this movie, many times there was this picture in the recommendations, but never once I did not want to watch it because of the plot. Many people praise this movie, I don't know why, from the very first minutes the movie starts to bore, stuffy scenes, no spectacle, in the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" there is not a single scene that would hook me, the movie is filmed on a real motive, maybe it is close to the real story, but it does not make it better, wasted time, definitely the worst movie of Steven Spielberg. The only thing is that the actors play perfectly their role, for this I put 5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

You have to catch this one,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a captivating portrayal of the extraordinary life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a masterful con artist whose escapades are as thrilling as they are unbelievable. Leonardo DiCaprio brings Abagnale's charisma and cunning to life with remarkable finesse, effortlessly embodying the charming yet troubled young man who blurs the lines between truth and fiction.The film delves deep into Abagnale's psyche, exploring the complexities of his character beyond mere criminality. His turbulent upbringing, marked by the trauma of his parents' divorce, adds layers of depth to his motivations, revealing a vulnerability that underlies his audacious schemes. Through DiCaprio's nuanced performance, viewers are drawn into Abagnale's world, empathizing with his struggles even as he eludes capture time and again.Tom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Carl Hanratty, the determined FBI agent who becomes obsessed with apprehending Abagnale. Their cat-and-mouse game unfolds with riveting intensity, punctuated by moments of unexpected camaraderie and mutual respect. Hanks imbues Hanratty with a blend of stern determination and reluctant admiration, creating a dynamic interplay between the two characters that elevates the film beyond a simple crime drama.Director Steven Spielberg masterfully balances suspense and humor, infusing the narrative with a sense of urgency while never losing sight of its lighter moments. The screenplay, based on Abagnale's own memoir, offers a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a prodigious con artist, blending real-life events with cinematic flair to create a captivating story that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish.Visually stunning and impeccably crafted, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a triumph of storytelling that transcends its genre. With its stellar performances, gripping plot, and emotional depth, it's a film that resonates long after the credits roll. Whether you're a fan of true crime dramas or simply appreciate a well-told tale, this movie is sure to delight and captivate audiences of all kinds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A very interesting and entertaining film...,"This is an interesting story, watching a con artist evolve, how he starts off with the small stuff(in an early scene, he pretends that he's a substitute teacher, to get back at another student)to stealing enormous amounts of money(several million dollars).

"Nyah, Nyah, you can't catch me","Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter. They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises.In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view. And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter, but enough to establish the relationship there. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together.And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale, FBI agent Tom Hanks. Remember this was the Sixties and J. Edgar Hoover was running the agency. Hanks is great as the uptight, buttondown agent in the Hoover mold. One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process. He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission.DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright, he develops into a master check forger. He masquerades as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog. Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat.Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale. Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you. Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest, Karl Malden. The reason is simple, Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick. And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents.I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film. We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. It's a great film about another amazing adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Fun in sadness,"Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing! He handle the delicate feeling of the many Franks and the carelessness of parents so very well and accurately. A tragic rather than a comedy. A triumph deserves recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of the best movies ever!,"I saw this movie twice in the theater, which is saying a lot, because I hardly ever even go to the theater to begin with. To say that Stephen Spielberg is a genius is an understatement, when it comes to films like this. Every single moment in the movie is captured with sheer brilliance and fantastic execution. He knows exactly how to make the audience feel with each and every different aspect that is delivered to us in each and every scene.Leonardo DiCaprio is of course famous for Titanic, and other films since then, but I would have to say that this is his best role to date, since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". Although he is a character actor, and a good one at that, this role for him was perfect, because he not only was given the chance to be a ""character"" but also the lead in the film. He is able to carry a whole movie on his shoulders with such ease it is so enjoyable to watch.Tom Hanks was certainly not one to forget in this film, either, though. His character, Handratty, was unforgettable as well. Hanks is able to make you hate him, feel sorry for him, and laugh at him all at once in 'Catch Me'. His accent is very well rehearsed, and there are times you forget that it is Tom Hanks, and not the real character he is playing.This movie will leave you cheering for the wrong team, and holding your breath at times. It is hard not to like this film, and I give it a full 10 for it's magic, beauty and true-to life story that it so gracefully delivers to us. A good watch and great film in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Truth and fiction collide,When I initially watched this movie I was unaware that it was based on a true story which I find hard to digest! I am unsure how much of this movie is true and how much is fiction however what I can not get my head around is if the jobs this guy managed to fake/con himself into only makes the whole thing even more bizzare as to how was security so poor that it took such a long time to work out he was not an employee and how cheques could be cashed with no employee number etc Don't even start me on him working as a doctor?

Although, I was not overly impressed by the way he was initially portrayed as something of a buffoon, only to turn into this sensitive, caring kind of guy. What put me off watching the film originally was the trailer showing Leo surrounded by all the beautiful air stewardesses - this didn't give any clue as to the actual style of the film - how he arranged that was masterful.

Innovative,"It is incredible to think that this film is based on a true story, and that a high school student was able to deceive so many people. What an ingenious and innovative kid - for the wrong reasons of course. I am unsure of the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the actual events, but Frank Jr. does seem to be quite mature for his age - at least his persona does. Adding to that, I feel like the romantic encounters (save for Brenda) was probably the influence of Hollywood, or dramatized at the least.Leonardo DiCaprio perfectly encompasses the emotions of an emotionally troubled teen to the T. He portrays his character's naivety well, depicting both Frank's fake confidence and emotional turmoil. Supporting actors and actresses did a good job too. Walken as Frank's father and Hanks as Hanratty both support a kind of father figure to Frank though one is encouraging him not to stop and the other is trying to catch him.The editing is well done with two different timelines juxtaposed against each other. At first it is a little confusing and hard to discern which time period is being shown, but it gets better as the film goes on. What I do not get is the very first scene of the film which shows a kind of game show. Not only is it a weird way to introduce the film it does not fit into the story at all. The film doesn't end with the game show, and it is not mentioned or seen again for the rest of the movie.The designs of the set and the costumes are nicely done and adds to the atmosphere of the film. Also, I liked how there are quite a few cameos with well known actresses (although probably not so well known back then).Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch Me If You Can - One Of Speilburg's Best,"Catch Me If You Can is an absolutely fun film from the theme song to the adventures of Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abignale. The actors and characters are outstanding! Based on a true story of a con artist who couldn't handle the divorce of his parents, Leonardo DiCaprio breathes life again to the young Frank. Tom Hanks provide hilarity and a sternness to the plot as he and Leonardo provide perfect chemistry on the screen. Everything is perfectly set in it's time of the 1960s. From the airports to the clothes, the 60s are brought to life again. Steven Speilburg did a wonderful job, as well as the people who did props, clothes, and other items, bringing this picture to life.

He can play the businessman, the caring son, the loving fiancé, the player, and the pitiful homeless kid that just wants a family. I have seen this movie 3 times and each time I cried. I guess that my favorite thing about this movie is that you never really know what is going to happen next. You think you understand what is going to happen but you don't. I absolutely love this movie its got a little bit of everything in it. It has all of the things that you could ever ask for in a good movie, famous actors, romance, a little comedy, the cocky young hot guy that you end up feeling sorry for, and a great plot.

One of the Best Dramas with Humor,"29 December 2002. This is one of the best dramas I have seen that incorporates humor. While audiences have been offered horror genres that have humor and comedies that have dramatic elements, Catch Me If You Can is one of the few dramas I have come across that includes a wry sense of humor that isn't tacky or add-ons. Christopher Walken delivers a great performance and a real award-winning performance. The editing and the placement of scenes in flashback fashion is timely. This really is a feel good movie with substance, with real drama. This is entertainment at its finest.

Hallelujah! Spielberg's back!,"In the crafty hands of Spielberg, a novel long having been considered as unintriguing, becomes an excellent piece of work. The autobiographical novel, written by Frank Abergnale, tells of a counterfeit-savvy teenager's three-year stint at eluding the FBI by posing as a pilot, doctor, and teacher in the 60s.Abagnale's story, first published in 1980 was shopped around for weeks to studios before being picked up. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you'll have trouble thinking of it as unexciting. However, looking at it from a different angle, is a form of crime such as passing bad checks is nothing visually compelling and it doesn't lend itself well to base a whole movie about?To this I credit Spielberg, who once again creates an exciting and fun movie, that families can get excited about seeing come holiday season. Spielberg, essentially, takes the stories and infuses it with a couple of familiar elements: a lost youth struggling with the abandonment of a father figure (or in this case, his actual father), as well as a cat-and-mouse chase. The former is something which we can relate to more than we consciously realize and the latter is something which adds suspense and fun to the story. The alienated youth theme has popped everywhere in Spielberg's movies, from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to AI and everywhere in between. At the same time, I wouldn't call Spielberg's work, unoriginal or recycled, since he mixes these motifs in different combinations with other dramatic elements and the story itself is quite fresh.Quality seeps out of every element in the film, from its score and sets to its dialogue and acting. I never thought I'd ever hear myself say this years ago, but Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a great performance, shedding aside his `Who needs acting when I'm a sex-symbol' attitude of old, and immersing himself in the role with all the vulnerability, despair, and aptitude it entails. Tom Hanks, of course, matches up to DeCaprio, line by line, as Hanratty, the FBI investigator who chases him for three years. The relationship of mutual respect between the two, and eventual lifelong friendship, is truly heartwarming. In Hanks' interpretation of the part, there is not just mutual respect but frustration bordering on obsession, as he borrows a page from the inspector in Les Miserables. Christopher Walken also has a big role as the father, with whom DiCaprio's character is very close.The film is not only a joy in itself but a positive sign in this new century that the work of a skilled storyteller such as Steven Speilberg can still hold up after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Leonardo is Superb,"Fully realizing the acting opportunity he was given, Leonardo acts his tail off in this true story of a real crook.

Today he'd be on talk shows bragging about his conquests and would seem right in time.  Back then people were more decent and trusting and he was able to exploit that.Steven gives the movie a lot of style.  It all looks and feels correct to the period but you are not assaulted w/this.Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner are terrific too.

Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching. Catch Me If You Can, to not seem too rigid or sound mundane, splices the story from when Abagnale's already captured, to the how and why, the very beginning, up until Abagnale's inevitable capture.

As serious as a drama and as funny as a comedy,"According to me, biopics about little-known people are more interesting, because they're more surprising. Just before renting ""Catch Me If You Can"", I've never heard anything about Frank Abagnale Jr. Now, I know a lot of things...Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man (in fact, not 20 years old yet) who discovered that he had a real talent of forging other people and to make money from it. And the story itself is not a forge, because it really happened. All of the elements presented in the movie are not necessarily true, but the majority is. The trueness of the story is simply incredible and hard to believe.Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a fairly splendid performance here. While he was in his late 20's during the filming, DiCaprio perfectly appears as a late teenage boy.The other main character is FBI agent and fake checks specialist Carl Henratty, played by the incredible Tom Hanks. Henratty is the cat of the cat-and-mouse game and he personally runs after Abagnale on this wild ride in order to bring the kid to the justice. But the job isn't easy.The main example is the famous hotel showdown. At this moment, Henratty only heard the Abagnale name and he doesn't have any sight of Abagnale's face. So, he meets Abagnale, but the young man acts like if he was an agent as well and Henratty falls into the trap. This situation is the funniest one in the entire movie.Also highlighted must be Christopher Walken's performance as Abagnale's father.There is no single mood into this movie. Sometimes, it is very dramatic and there are very special scenes.

Great Film,"I am not a huge Spielberg fan but I think he has made some of his best work to date in the last couple of films he has made.   Minority Report was surprisingly very good and Catch Me If You Can was just excellent.Touching upon a story like Frank Abergnale's is very daring as he had never done anything like this before.   He knows about War, UFO's and Sharks but this is more of a story than special effects which Spielberg usually don's on.Frank Abergnale is a young man in a broken family.   His Father Frank Abergnale Sr played wonderfully by Christopher Walken is somebody who has never been able to grab something and keep hold of it.  He is bankrupt and can't do anything without the finance people picking up on it first and he feels he has disappointed his son in showing him how it is done.  Frank Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio is fed up of family life as all his parents ever do is argue.   Frank decides to leave home and live his life in a way that we all want to.   He is clever, good looking, charming and very much a con man in every way by interoperating a Air Line Pilot, a Lawyer and a Doctor.   After a while of partying and enjoying a life which is really a fake it doesn't take long for the FBI to be on his trail led by Carl Han ratty played hilariously by Tom Hanks.  That is when the film really starts into a cat and mouse chase between the two leads.  As well as being very dramatic and intense we also explore the emotional turmoil from frank's Jr sheltered life as on the way through all his scamming he really has no one around to love.   This is what I admire in Spielberg's directing.  He knows how to get a cracking performance out of somebody but he also has a lot of characterization which I think is rare in some of his films but you also see it in Schindler's List and ET but you see it more here.One of Spielberg's best.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

It's blandly straightforward filmmaking, hurt mostly by a screenplay from writers Frank W. Abagnale and Stan Redding (working from Jeff Nathanson's book) that needs us to fill in the blanks. Leonardo DiCaprio is rather one-note-benign in the lead, though Tom Hanks is far superior as the head fed on the case. Also on hand: Jennifer Garner, making the most of a superfluous model/prostitute role, and Christopher Walken, who is unable to create a convincing character out of the protagonist's father. The '60s period design is careful but disappointing, and the overlong film takes a good 40mns to kick into gear. Two Oscar nominations in what must have been a slow year: Walken as Best Supporting Actor and John Williams for Original Score. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
This Person Is My Hero....,"I have read the book, and find the movie delightfully entertaining. I love the fact this was based on a true story, and that Frank Abagnale Jr. was able to successfully beat our corrupt system at its' own game.However, the movie omitted a lot of events the book detailed. Such as Abagnale being asked to fly the airliner briefly, while the pilot went to the lavatory. Good thing Frank knew better to switch on the autopilot, while he was away. And being asked to deliver a newborn baby, while posing as a doctor. He was very fortunate an experienced nurse was nearby, that day. Despite Spielberg's aversion to sexual matters- the book clearly places Abagnale's exploits with women nearing 50 encounters. I admire anybody who can live this way, and not catch anything.Frank W. Abagnale, as a real-life pretender of sorts- illustrates what every young man's secret fantasy world craves; the ready ability to change and adapt to your surroundings. I applaud Abagnale's clever ability to ""socially engineer"" himself so convincingly, at such a young age. Frank's message to me was clear; dress like how you wanted to be treated. I envy the fact he got away with this kind of crime in a day where it was easily perpetrated, and hard to detect. Those days are long gone.

Making millions by changing the last name,"""Catch me if you can"" is a fun movie directed by Spielberg in which, to say it badly, Tom Hanks has to capture DiCaprio, who plays (at the beginning of the film) a 16 years old kid that steals a lot of money by changing his identity. And this particularity gives birth to a lot of funny moments that makes the ride enjoyable. The movie by itself is simple without complex storylines or profound meanings, but it's fine this way because the movie does its job: entertain. The only complaint I have is that ""Catch me if you can"" is a bit too long, there are some heavy parts, but these instances are limited and so this isn't a big problem.

"Interesting, entertaining... but a little bit too long.","Leonardo is excellent as Frank Jr and so are Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. The plot is great for a true story in the sense that you don't always know what is going to happen next, there are some surprises. It was one of the first time that a beautiful lady played by a famous actress wasn't in the action of the movie. In fact, there is none. Yes, there are many ladies, but they have little screen time and they aren't famous. So, it was a fresh aspect here for a Leonardo movie that I liked. The plot is entertaining because you're asking yourself when he'll get caught. (if you know that he gets caught) The way he fools everyone is also very funny to watch.The dates were a little bit confusing but it wasn't very important. Sometimes, some scenes are boring and you want to get to the action. At the end, you hope that it end because it's a long movie, but it's worth it.It is not the best movie that I've seen. Live some people pointed out, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, it wasn't dramatic enough to be a drama. It was something unusual that could have been god, but I think that Spielberg didn't spend too much time on this movie.

Pure Entertainment!,"Hanks and DiCaprio are right on form in what must be Steven Spielberg's most enjoyable and entertaining movie since Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade in 1989.After a slow first 30 minutes, the film kicks into high gear as we follow the cat and mouse game between DiCaprio and Hanks.  Excellent 60s set pieces, costume design and an excellent, sometimes moody 60s soundtrack make what is already a brilliantly told story even better!This is the kind of film that perfects the reason why we go to the cinema - to escape from ordinary life.

The True Story of A Real Fake.,"Inspired from a true story, Catch Me If You Can is the biopic of Frank Abagnale Jr., a mastermind conman who succeeded in forging millions of dollars worth of checks while disguised as an airline pilot, doctor & lawyer, all before turning 19 years of age, and apart from capturing the methods employed by this young & brilliant con artist to get his job done also covers his stint with the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who eventually hunts him down.Although Steven Spielberg is yet to give a true cinematic masterpiece in the 21st century, Catch Me If You Can comes pretty close with nothing much to complain in any of the filmmaking departments and is one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. The direction is dynamic, the script is lively, pacing is relentless with no dragging moment & music by John Williams suits the Spielberg's story just the way it always has in the past.Amongst the performances, Tom Hanks is seriously good as the FBI agent who is trying to track down our conman but is also fond of him. Christopher Walken chips in with another good work as Frank Abagnale Sr. & Amy Adams as Brenda Strong has an innocent presence too. But the one who impresses the most is Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenaged con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr., and delivers an energetic, confident & versatile performance.On an overall scale, Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted work of quality entertainment that is smartly directed, smoothly paced, ingeniously performed, firmly edited & nicely scored but benefits most from DiCaprio's show-stealing performance under the assured direction of Spielberg, and is as charming as its lead character in spite of all its flaws.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A Simple, Financially Escapist Fantasy That's Lighter Fare Than Most Spielberg Efforts","Lean, flirty material that lacks the emotional punch I've come to expect from Spielberg's direction. Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A very entertaining movie....,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies,  the extravagance  and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Except Christopher Walken, who is Superb.At second viewing, three years later, I remembered only pieces, and was bored to death. The settings are urban boring and the action is heterogeneous but unimpressive. I think Spielberg rooted to make the story of the con man too sweet, to make him infantile and reachable phsycologically. I didn't like that approach being the character in real life a lot more interesting, obscure and harder. Tom Hanks character Hanratty tries to be smart at all times, guessing and boring, tires with his pseudo-hero role.All of the movie tries to make what would be an interesting, edgy film into a bedtime story, sweetened by all filmical elements (actings, directing, lights, script).

Spielberg in top form,"In the 1960s a young man named Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) forged his way into a lifestyle that included designer clothing, girls and flying. His story is a fascinating study of how naïve the world was then and how easy it was for an intelligent man to convince people that he was genuine. Have times really changed?  Steven Spielberg is still channelling Stanley Kubrick and he delivers a dark comedy, which moves at a frenetic pace underscored by a jazzy soundtrack.  On the surface, this film looks fluffy and brainless but take a look at the way the director uses things we take for granted.  There are numerous references to Christmas in this film and forget the jolly holiday  Christmas is presented as a dark and lonely time when bad things happen and loneliness digs its claws in. FBI Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) works on Christmas Eve and receives a call from a guilty Abagnale, a small Christmas tree one of the only sources of light in the room.  Abagnale's discovery in France is at Christmas time while carollers sing pious songs.  Abagnale is arrested outside his mother's new home; never getting to enjoy the Christmas treats inside. The world is presented according to Kubrick who believed that the world was a thoroughly unlikeable place and people cruel and self obsessed.  This is one of the major themes in this film.  Frank's father (an excellent Christopher Walken) is hounded by the IRS and abandoned by his French wife Paula (Nathalie Baye) and remains a broken shell of a man, still clinging to the sham that is the American Dream, never realising his full potential.  His son runs away from all this pain, and running is an important motif in the film, and seeks solace through money.  An ironic film reference to Forrest Gump (1994 ) involves a banknote floating in front of Tom Hanks reinforcing thematically that this race is for money, not fulfilment or spiritual comfort.  Hanratty is just as obsessed as Abagnale and that the two should end up together is one of the film's strongest metaphors.Spielberg does not show us the whole story.  He cuts and jumps and never gives us the full picture  what is left out is just as intriguing as what is shown.  There is resonance in the gaps and silences in the film and the symbols further enhance the ride.  Lots of this film takes place in temporary accommodation such as hotels and rented apartments.  Hotels being the symbol for transience and impermanence, the rooms are filled with trolleys of half eaten food, consumed alone, and the family home is broken up by debt early on in the film.  Everyone in the film is eager for something greener  the young girls duped into becoming stewardesses, the naïve Brenda (Amy Adams) who is manipulated by parents and lovers alike and Hanratty himself, who is searching obsessively for his Holy Grail in the form of Abagnale.  Hanratty never tries to understand Abagnale and even mispronounces his name.  He is a loner who has no time for people only results.The score by John Williams (unlike his usual stuff) enhances the film and there are some very clever credits, which reinforce the feel of the era. There are sloppy errors in the production design, which are annoying, but the look of the film is one of its biggest assets.  Spielberg uses period camera angles and editing and the photography is a delight.  Janusz Kaminski knows his way around a camera and uses it to tell a story, to characterise and to make subtle points.  An example is when Frank Jr meets a young woman in a hotel corridor.  The camera focuses on the shoes of each character. Shoes in themselves being sexual symbols gives the scene much more resonance that if it were conventionally filmed.Spielberg has certainly grown up as a director.  AI (2001) was a great film. That the general public didn't get its cynical take on humankind says a lot about how audiences see movies and how they are manipulated to accept the trite and the banal.  Minority Report (2002) was a dark, brooding satisfying film and Catch Me If You Can while not as cerebral as the previous two, still does not fail to entertain and to please.

Enjoyable but not a memorable classic,"Catch Me if You Can' is inspired by the real life story of conman Frank Abagnale Junior who ran away from home at the age of sixteen following his parents' divorce.

As he travels around the globe cashing fraudulent cheques, Frank is pursued by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) hence, the taunt in the film's title.What makes this film an interesting and fun one is that the main character actually exists in real life and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is a charismatic one.  Although I found some parts of Catch Me if you Can' enjoyable, I did find it a bit slow and the story-telling flawed.  Although one can conclude that Frank was a genius to have deceived as many people as he did, the film is lacking in explanation of how Frank managed to succeed in the range of positions he came to work in, eg how did he become a doctor and barrister without going to either medical or law school?As a fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I was looking forward to this release and compared to his last two films A.I' and Minority Report', this film is much lighter in tone.

Ultimately, why should we be surprised that a man claiming to be one of history's famous con men may have conned an audience looking for an interesting story?Instead of watching Catch Me If You Can as the Hollywood glamorization of a convicted felon's tale, which itself may be a highly exaggerated or fabricated version of what actually happened, watch the movie as a movie with a clever plot that at times seems implausible. It follows Tom Hanks as an FBI agent chasing con man Frank Abagnale across time and geography. This film is likely the least I've enjoyed Tom Hanks in a role. His character seems stilted and forced.The movie plays out the cat-andamouse game, slowly. There are funny moments throughout, but they are not frequent enough to overcome the film's length. By the end, I felt bored and ready for the credits.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
It caught me!,"Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. ""This Boy's Life"" and ""Basketball Diaries"" come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those ""how could you not like this?"" kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, ""Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?""Here's basically a slimy little kid named Frank Abagnale fooling everyone, essentially stealing millions of dollars, pretending to be some really high-level occupations (pilot, doctor, lawyer, teacher) and what happens? The viewer actually finds himself rooting for him. That's a combination of Steven Spielberg's directorial expertise and Leo's fine work with the script.At least the Oscar folks remembered Christopher Walken by nominating him for best-supporting actor, though Chris Cooper got the statue for ""Adaptation."" Too bad. As usual, Walken takes over the screen every time he's featured, and the performance as DiCaprio's dad was Oscar-worthy. Tom Hanks was good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, though it sounded as if he received New England accent lessons from Kevin Costner in ""13 Days."" In other words, ""ugh!""Terrific film. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. It was the best I saw in 2002.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Love it,"This film is not to deify the criminal behavior of the real character Frank, but to convey a criminal back to the theme of shore redemption.

Excellent Film!,This is no doubt one of the best movies of 2002. It is funny and entertaining yet heart-wrenching. Top grade performances from DiCaprio and Hanks made it CMIYC a wonderfully exciting journey through the life of Frank Abagnale. Hats off to the screenplay writers who adapted the book to film!

"Spielberg does comedy, and succeeds!","I've recently got a ""A"" in one of my college classes titled, ""Spielberg/Lucas."" In that class the instructor lecture on the style of visual, characters, and plot for a Spielberg film. We made ""connections"" with all of Spielberg's films, what did JAWS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and SCHINDLER'S LIST all have in common? With Spielberg's latest film, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is this the same Spielberg that is famous around the world?CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very different Spielberg film. It's a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it. Critics and fans have been criticize Spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was 1941. Now, Spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film. Where 1941 had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs, CATCH ME is more from personality and wit. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Frank is known to be the most successful con-artist and check forger in U.S. history. Abagnale posed as a Pan-Am air pilot, doctor, and proscutor, when he didn't even complete high school. Abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about $4 million dollars with bogus checks. Despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball, Frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for. It took federal agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) to identify Frank's mistakes, which led Carl on a cross country pursuit for Frank. While Carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about Frank and his whereabouts, Frank keeps changing his name, occupation, and girlfriend. The only two people that remain close to Frank's life is Carl Hanratty, and Frank's father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken). The film shows that one of the reasons why Frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request, and the closing of his family owned stationary store (where Frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery). When I heard about CATCH ME being the new Spielberg film, I bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real Frank Abagnale. I highly enjoyed the book with the way Abagnale explains on what he did, how he did it, and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film. After watching the movie, I was slightly disappointed in the film. There were some parts in Abagnale's book that I was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie, including a part in the book where Abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man. Sadly to my disappointment, it wasn't featured in the film. I then read a interview on why Spielberg was so attached to direct CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and when you watch the movie, it's obviously shown on the screen. Spielberg loved the father/son relationship between Frank Sr. and Jr. In fact, the relationship was partially mention in the book, in the film, it's carried thoughout the film. While the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery. Also, since the book was written in first person, the character of Carl Hanratty was mention here in there, where Hanratty is the second most seen character in the film, right behind Frank. But other than that, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I've always been devoted to Mr. Spielberg, and this is a very different film for him. It is historical, takes place in the past, but it's the first time where most of the film is being told from one character's narrative. Spielberg does a great job with telling the story, he even adds a nice touch of the mid 60's film style and mood with the opening credits being animated, very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 60's comedies. Then John Williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings. Most people groan and moan when they hear the name Leonardo DiCaprio, ""oh no! Not that guy!"" I do agree DiCaprio does get overexposure, but he is a good actor. Look at WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and THIS BOYS LIFE, he did a excellent job in both films. I think most people just think of DiCaprio in TITANIC which wasn't his fault as much as it was James Cameron's. DiCaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that DiCaprio did understand the personality and that Frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling. Christoper Walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t.v. shows have made fun of in the past, and delivers a very good performance. Just watch the scene when he talks to Frank Jr. about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man. But Tom Hanks is the pro, and he proves it again in this film. Hanks portrayal of Hanratty with the Boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the Hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since Tommy Lee Jones Sam Gerrad in THE FUGITIVE. Hanks did a brilliant job with Michael Sullivan in ROAD TO PERDITION, and he does it again with Carl Hanratty in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I can not judge if CATCH ME IF YOU CAN should get any Oscar nominations (I haven't seen GANGS OF NEW YORK, ADAPTATION, and CHICAGO yet). But from what I've seen, CATCH ME is great, but it's not better than TWO TOWERS, MINORITY REPORT, SOLARIS, ROAD TO PERDITION, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, and PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. If there should be any nominations, then Hanks should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Hanratty.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable film, it's a big risk of a film for Spielberg to return to comedy. But this film proves that Spielberg can now do any genre, including comedy, and pull it off. Great job Mr. Spielberg! ***** (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Falsely categorized,"One thing that strikers me at IMDB is that the films there always carry so many genre titles. Catch me if you can is one of them. Virtually every category that was ever invented is listed, despite the fact that this is clearly what we (in Dutch) would call a speelfilm' or a spielfilm' in German. I do not know if there is a translation for it in genre' terms, but it roughly means motion picture'. You see this is just the story of a young fraud with not too much adventure, thrills or drama in it although featuring a lot of crime.I think that after this film, there will be a time of quiet surrounding Steven Spielberg, because it is the way he's done it previously. Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993) and Schindler's List (1993), then taking a 4 year break from making movies; Amistad (1997), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), then taking a 3 year break and now AI (2001), Minority Report (2002) and Catch me if you Can (2002) making a ??? year break I presume. Why do I make this list you wonder well, I do it to make a point. The point is, that I think that Spielberg will take a bit of a break now and that I think he needs one, because the last films he has made weren't really good. I mean you obviously cannot keep making Schindler's List's or Jurassic Park's but there is something missing lately in Spielberg's work. I miss that feeling that I'm watching the films of someone who never stopped being a small child and I miss the feeling. I mean let's face it, in AI Spielberg tried to insert that dreamy side of himself, but it failed because the Spielberg ending did not fit the Kubrick story, then there came Minority Report which proved that Spielberg is not the best in making thrilling crime movies and now there is Catch me if you Can a film that has a pretty nice story, but also a film that is neither good nor bad. It is entertainment, in it's most normal form and nothing one would assume to have been made by Spielberg. It's not as if I'm not happy with the choices that he makes, but I feel that he could bring more feeling into his film. One could have felt more involved, the film could have been more dramatic and more moving. What happened Mr.Williams' great scores (I know he got an Oscar nomination, but I cannot remember one bit of film, where the music stuck out). This film is just not Spielberg's territory and it shows, for it is not as outstanding and memorable as his other work. Spielberg's territories clearly are adventure (JP, Indiana), Drama (Color Purple, Amistad, Schindler's List) and Family films (Hook, E.T.) and maybe he could even pull off dark film like AI if he didn't try to convert it in a fairy tale at the end.7 out of 10post scriptum reminder to self: post more comments on unusual, emotionally gripping and / or meaningful films (Amélie, The Royal Tenenbaums, Donnie Darko, Finding Forrester) than on successful mainstream Hollywood entertainment",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Amusing joy ride of a film,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is easily Spielberg's best film since ""Saving Private Ryan"", and his best comedy ever.  The film is a funny, exciting, adventurous journey into the world of conman extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr.  If you don't know who he is now, you will after seeing this movie.Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much going into this.  Spielberg's films have become so premeditated recently, with just the right angle, just the right piece of music and just the right look of awe on the actors' faces, that his films haven't been truly enjoyable for some time.  He's like a novelist who, despite great diction and flawless punctuation, has lost his touch when it comes to story and character.  With ""Catch Me If You Can"", Spielberg has finally loosened up and let the story take center stage.  It's an understated but mesmerizing success.  I even forgot that I was watching a Steven Spielberg film, which is a sign of how good it is.Christopher Walken, who did a Q&A after the screening, said that this movie was filmed very quickly.

"light, breezy, fun & inconsequential","""Catch Me if You Can"" is as light and carefree as the period it evokes. Right from the opening title sequence, accompanied by yet another great John Williams score, we are transported to the early sixties - a decade of bright colors, breezy tunes and gentile living - the Camelot of pre-assassination-of-Kennedy America.Steven Spielberg's flashier side is well hidden here, although his style comes through in his inventive use of close ups and cross cutting to give a sense of time and place, evoke the period through the use of small details rather than large settings.His work with the actors and the small character touches is evident. Leonardo DiCaprio fares best under Spielberg's guidance, Tom Hanks, not as well, but still strong.His use of a New England accent seemed to impede some of his line readings.The story is fun, with just enough depth to keep it from blowing away. Ultimately though, the material may be too light for Spielberg, often feeling *too* much like 5 or 6 episodes of a 60's TV sitcom, like ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"" or ""Gomer Pyle"" Hank's use of a four-letter expletive not-withstanding.CMIYC is a fun time at the movies and will make you laugh and maybe get misty eyed, but it lacks the emotional pull of Spielburg's weightier films.

Brilliant acts in a somewhat jaded perspective of Spielberg.,"In these days of breath-taking special effects, dazzling sounds and tension-filled interpretation of violent thrill, it's quite hard for a director like Spielberg to check the interest to make uses of them in his movie while he has a number of award-winning films filled with all of them under his belt. But it evidently appeared, after watching the film, that he really wanted to do something new. Something that deliberately will not be considered as a typical Spielberg film.But he has not quite succeeded to fulfill those wishes. Though he has not used anything special of modern technology, apart from excellent camera work, another typical Spielberg perspective is now exposed which he could not remove from this film too. Well, upto this time that was playfully hidden by the tension his movie used to have. But now, the ""cat and mouse"" theory, in which the mouse is always the public winner (look at the examples, Jon Anderton, Ian Malcolm et al, the arachnophobics, the family in Poultergeist etc) is at its over-used bluntness while now, the 'cat' has come into the standard of FBI agents.But above all these, it must be said that Spielberg is quite lucky to have so much brilliant actors at their best in this film. Be it DiCaprio, who is all convincing as young and handsome Frank Abagnale Jr. or Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. Both, especially Hanks, got it all right in every places in the movie. And we must not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. His performance is also quite realistic and fluent. So it turns out to be the acting which prompts us to see the movie over and over again, this time not by Spielberg, though smelling something new in the future air.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Much better than I thought it would be,"I had passed by ""Catch Me If You Can"" a number of times at the video rental place before finally grabbing it this weekend.

I stand humbled and corrected.I have a new appreciation for DiCaprio as an actor now, although his performance isn't Oscar-worthy, it is pretty damn good.  Tom Hanks is OK, although I still can't quite figure out (a) what that accent is he's using (Boston?) and (b) where is he stationed?  That seemed the biggest continuity problem to me.  At first he seems like he's in New York or Washington, then maybe Atlanta, who knows?  Minor point, however.Spielberg does a great job telling this story and making you actually care about the characters; my only beef is that I think he could have explored Carl's family situation a little more.  I can see why he didn't, however, and, frankly, it doesn't distract from the movie too much.

Mixed bag,"There are a few good reasons to see this film:1) the Saul Bass-inspired opening title sequence is sheer heaven and when it's complimented by John Williams's cat-and-mouse, Bernard Herrmann-like score (his best in years) the result is 3 minutes of a movie lover's dream!2) Christopher Walken's gaunt-eyed, haunting performance as Frank's father is his best in years and will hopefully be rewarded by some critics and the Academy!3) Amy Adams brings her energy and enthusiasm to the screen right when we need her to:  the film begins to sag in the middle but picks itself up a notch when her braces flash themselves at the screen and her charmingly awkward candy striper begins to fall for Frank.4) the story itself -a young man's broken home gives way to his inner grifter who switches identities at lightning speed while being pursued by a sympathetic F.B.I. agent-is fascinating and strangely inspirational.However, it has been directed by Steven Spielberg when it needs someone like a young Scorsese or Robert Altman or Peter Bogdonovich or Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, Paul Thomas Anderson, or even David Lynch!  Any one of those filmmakers would give the story an extra layer and  made it memorable instead of what it is: a moderate piece of entertainment.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  Spielberg's timing and rhythyms are a just a snap off and the film drags instead of zips.  It's stale Old School when it should be fresh-cool and jazzy.  (Watch for the scene when Frank has a pool party and notice the background action -it's probably the stiffest staging of a house party since Reefer Madness.)Leo's a good actor who doesn't deserve the wishy-washy criticism being heaped on him: his performance as Frank is just fine and he remains one of our most compelling actors.  Hanks, however, is Hollywood royalty even though he's never been anything more than funny, reliable, and sometimes solid; his performance -and Boston accent- are uneven and it makes you think that Dan Ackroyd must have been unavailable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Catch Me If You Can - one of the greatest films ever.,"I saw this film a few days after it was put in theatres and it was inspiring.All the parts were excited and some parts were hilarious.In my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the greatest film ever to be able to mix drama, comedy, chasing, love, and action successfully.I love this film, it ranks #2 on my all-time favorites list. I highly recommend it.I just bought the autobiography and Frank Abagnale and will read it soon. I want to buy the movie book, full with screenplay, stills, everything, but it is $32.95 and will save up for that.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
catch me if you can,"Release date: 25 December 2002 Lenght: 141 minutes Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken & Martin Sheen Director: Steven Spielberg Producer: Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes Distributor: Dreamworks SKG Music: John Williams Screenplay writer: Jeff Nathanson, Stan Redding & Frank Abagnale'Catch me if you can' is a crime drama film based on a true story. The movie is about the life of Frank Abagnale who had a very complicated life. There is a lot of action in this movie and it's really not boring. The movie was a success and also the real Frank Abagnale really liked the movie .The movie is about a young man (Frank Abagnale) who is good at pretending to be someone else. One day his parents decide to divorce and Frank need to choose with which parent he wants to live. Frank doesn't want to make that decision and runs away. He doesn't have a lot of money so he starts to forge checks. He is very good in forging stuff so he forged his pilot certificate and became a co-pilot. The FBI discovers all the forged checks and they start to look for him without knowing who he really is and what he looks like. Carl Hanratty is an FBI fraud bank agent and he really wants to catch Frank, but catching Frank is not as easy as he thought. Meanwhile it gets a little risky for Frank to be a pilot so he decide to change jobs and he becomes a doctor. Frank is not afraid of the FBI and keeps forging checks and papers, but can he keep doing that?The leadactor in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has played a role in many movies like 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'The great gatsby'  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Frank Abagnale in the movie and I think he is the perfect actor for that. The other leadactor is Tom Hanks. He has the role of the FBI-agent. Also Tom Hanks plays his role perfect, I think DiCaprio and Hanks are the perfect combination to make a movie together.'Catch me if you can' is the perfect movie for people who like a little bit action, the movie is easy to understand and besides it is based on a true story! The storyline is really good and the actors are perfect for this movie, I would recommend this movie to everybody that I know!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Why did I wait so long?,"Steven Spielberg has an astonishing record as both a director and a producer and, since he burst on the scene with ""Duel"" in 1971, I have seen most of his work, but somehow I managed to miss the 2002 ""Catch Me If You Can"" which he both directed and produced and only caught up with it 12 years later following a recommendation. I suppose I saw it as one of Spielberg's smaller and lighter works, but it does have a great cast and a cracking story and, at its heart, it has Spielberg's recurrent sympathy for the confused child (""Empire Of The Sun"") often from a broken home (""E.T.""). Most surprising of all is that essentially this is a true story about how the teenage Frank Abagnale Jr managed to adopt a series of professional personas in order to hustle his way into people's respect and even affection while cashing more than $2.5 million in fraudulent cheques all around the United States and in a couple of dozen other countries.Leonardo di Caprio - who has played a number of real-life people in his career (""The Aviator"", ""J Edgar"", ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"") - is excellent as Frank, bringing both charm and cunning to the role. The breathless narrative of the movie was reflected in the shooting schedule (it was filmed in just 52 days), but Jeff Nathanson's screenplay gives the story an emotional thread by repeatedly focusing on the relationship between Frank and the FBI lawman leading the chase Carl Hanratty who is played by Tom Hanks as both the mirror-image to Frank in style and motivation and increasingly a father figure to the teenager who has lost his real father.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Mid,"""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) is a captivating biographical crime film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a notorious con artist who successfully posed as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer, all before his 19th birthday. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Abagnale, while Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who pursues him relentlessly.The film's fast-paced narrative, stylish direction, and charismatic performances make it a thrilling and entertaining watch. DiCaprio effortlessly embodies the charm and cunning of Abagnale, while Hanks brings depth and humanity to the role of Hanratty. Their on-screen chemistry adds layers of tension and humor to their cat-and-mouse game across the globe.Spielberg's direction seamlessly blends elements of comedy, drama, and suspense, creating a film that is as emotionally engaging as it is visually captivating. The 1960s setting is brought to life with vibrant cinematography and a nostalgic soundtrack that immerses viewers in the era.""Catch Me If You Can"" is not only a thrilling crime caper but also a poignant exploration of identity, family, and the pursuit of dreams. It reminds audiences of the power of resilience and redemption, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.Overall, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a masterfully crafted film that combines suspense, humor, and heart to tell the extraordinary true story of one man's journey from deception to redemption. It remains a timeless classic in Spielberg's illustrious filmography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A must-see,"I liked almost everything of this movie. Acting is superb (Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken: do I need to say more?), Spielberg's direction is flawless, music is interesting and adds the right amount of tension.The story tells of (real-world) con artist Frank Abagnale, of his complicate family and the reasons pushing him into a criminal life while still very young. The movie is brilliant, at times entertaining in showing how our reality is partly made of paperwork and false perceptions. At other times, I found it intense and emotional in representing the struggle of Frank's father to emerge from his low social condition out into the ""little club"" of those ""who have everything"". Overall the movie is very balanced and I would not have minded watching some 30 minutes more of it.My advice: absolutely watch it, even multiple times to spot some more visual details.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.,"Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved.I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets.The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichéd thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Superb film making,"This picture was recently released to DVD and I must say that the transfer is excellent. The film loses nothing in the translation to the small screen because its main strengths are its superior direction and acting. Leo DiCaprio not only appears in nearly every scene, but he carries this film with amazing, amusing and seemingly effortless panache. He portrays Frank Abignale, a 17 year old youth who, in 1963, managed to flit across the country impersonating, variously, A Pan Am pilot, a Pediatrician, and a lawyer. He also succeeded in passing over 1 million dollars in forged checks, all the while eluding the F.B.I. man dedicating to catching him, a man named Carl Hanratty, played by the ever amazing Tom Hanks. It's a rare pleasure to watch these two top notch actors play off of each other, aided by a nuanced, witty, and intelligent script. Not to be forgotten (except by the Academy)is the fine supporting performances from Christopher Walken as Frank Abignale Sr.,Amy Adams, and the luscious, amazing cameo by Jennifer Garner as the high priced hooker who gets beaten at her own game in one of the funniest scenes that I've seen in a long time. Mixing this all together in one fine dessert is the direction of Steven Spielberg. The style of this picture marks a total departure for him, allowing him to pace this film like no other. It's an excursion that I'm glad he took. Kudos also to D.P Janus Kaminsky and a totally mesmerising jazz influenced score from John Williams.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
not bad,"This is quite an entertaining and interesting movie and also not the typical movie you would expect from Steven Spielberg. It is also much better than Spielberg´s couple of last movies. It has very nice and relaxing pace and gives you kind of a chill out feeling as you watch it. Sixties are portrayed very stylishly and the soundtrack is really good. Christopher Walken is great as usual. He defenitly gives the most memorable performance of this movie. Hanks is okay, nothing special. Di Caprio? Well, I think there are other actors who could have been better but he gets the job done. At least he is not annoying. Not a movie you would remember too much about after 6 months but it has some great jokes and an interesting story.

What took me so long?,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Captivating from beginning to end, Frank Abagnale, Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) amazes the audience with how flawlessly he can fake his way out of a tight jam. Just when you think 'they've got him this time', he manages to extract himself from the perilous dilemma ~ his cunning even astounding him sometimes!The only reason I gave this flick 9 stars instead of 10 was for a couple of minor issues I had with it. I thought the voice Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) used for this role was unnecessarily muddled with an indiscernible accent. His own voice would have sufficed just fine for the part and didn't need to be changed to enhance the role. As well, the 'interesting' relationship between Frank, Jr.'s mother and father at the beginning of the film was completely unnecessary and didn't add anything to make the movie more interesting. However, I can see why Christopher Walken (Frank Abagnale, Sr.) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor ~ for the incredible influence he had as the con-artist dad grooming the con-artist son, but not for the awkward scenes he had with his wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye). Perhaps that entire scenario was created for artistic effect...I just found it a boring waste of time.However, that was the ONLY boring thing about 'Catch Me if You Can'!

"Funny portait of a con artist (Leonardo di Caprio), who is being pursued by detective Tom Hanks. Will Di Caprio pull of the perfect con and stay free from persecution?","The bad: this movie does last about an half hour too long to be really captivating till the very end. Because when all the con tricks have been played out, the magic of this upbeat con story has somewhat faded. At 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie overstretches it's attention span.The good: cheery, upbeat story about a boy who wants to be succesful and figures out a conning way to do so, when he knows that the honest way to achieve succes is out of his league, because of poverty problems. By simply impersonating pilots, doctors and lawyers this boy succeeds in achieving the succes he always dreamt of. It is a very alluring story about tricking your way into succes and the constant chase between Di Caprio and Tom Hanks makes for a suspenseful game of cat and mouse.
Really enjoyable watch for young and old, with a romantic interlude with the very young Amy Adams.Biographical end note: director Steven Spielberg parents got divorced, when he was a kid. Many of the themes in Spielberg's films are about single parents and this movie is no exception. It is striking to see that this movies plot is also about a boy, who sees his parents struggle with financial problems and end up in a divorce. The boy copies his father's behaviour to solve his financial difficulties, by trying to con his way out of debt, in order to bring home the bacon. The father fails at his con jobs, whereas the son, played by Leonardo di Caprio, succeeds in conning his way into succes... Quite charming.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of the best performances by DiCaprio.....,"Actually there is not very much in the movie to be spoiled. What the movie is about is expressed in the beginning. Based on the true story, it covers the the life of con man and how FBI Agent hunts him down. The con man is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who impersonates a pilot and few other personalities while FBI Agent is played by great actor Tom Hanks.Movie has all the elements that makes it a must watch. Even this more than 2 hr long movie, it is too much fun. It is very different from all the Steven Spielberg films that you will see. It has a distinct type of humor in the scenes of the movie, kind-of situation based.As far as acting performance is concerned, all the viewers will be amazed. DiCaprio's performance is so good that you will want for his character in the to succeed. Tom Hanks as always gives a stunner. He is a kind of actor who plays different characters every time giving the audience a variety.To sum up why you should see this film:1.If you are fan of DiCaprio or Tom Hanks there is no reason why you should not see the film. 2.If you are tired of watching movies based on serious subjects, then this will offer you something different as well as pleasant. 3.It is a "" Steven Spielberg "" film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Entertaining, if not very deep.","This is a lighter film from Spielberg, which makes for a nice change. Unfortunately, it's also a bit disconnected. It's lacking an emotional center and comes off a bit cold, although it does have a certain charm. It also has a tendency to downplay the seriousness of the crimes committed, while it glorifies the ingenuity of the criminal.The actors are fine, if a bit cold. DiCaprio (not a favorite of mine) is good as the smooth talking con man, although he isn't quite as convincing when he tries to slip into the cover roles that the character assumes. He's doesn't look like he could pass for an older figure, as the real Frank Abignale did.Tom Hanks is his usual self, some good scenes, some mediocre. He can be a good actor, but he seems to take himself too seriously in his dramatic roles. I thought his performances were much better in his comedies.Christopher Walken is great, as usual, as the influence and motivating factor in Frank Abignale's life. He lives his life as a lie and provides the blueprint for is son to do the same.The period detail and music are good, without hitting you over the head, as in Down With Love. Some attitudes don't ring true, but that is a minor quibble. The pace is leisurely, if a bit too much so when the ""chase is on."" Thankfully, Spielberg is not of the ""epileptic editing"" generation of filmmakers.Ultimately, this is an entertaining, if lightweight film. It's a nice caper story that tries for sympathy, but never quite gets it. Like most capers, it treats serious crime with a laissez faires attitude, but is lacking the subtle charm of a classic caper film. It never decides if it is a comedy or a drama and doesn't seamlessly blend the two. Still, it provides enough entertainment to sustain interest. Worth a rental or a matinée viewing, but not destined for any top 10 lists.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Resourceful Con Artist versus a Tenacious FBI Agent,"After his father ""Frank Abagnale"" (Christopher Walken) is penalized by the Internal Revenue Service and his family is forced to move from a large house to a apartment things change for the worse for a 16-year-old boy named ""Frank Abagnale Jr."" (Leonardo DiCaprio). For starters, the financial strain on his parents is beginning to show and to make matters worse is the fact that his mother ""Paula Abagnale"" (Nathalie Baye) has begun to have an affair with an old friend of the family. So when they announce their divorce he decides to run away with the hope of somehow making enough money to bring them back together. To do that he resorts to forging checks and impersonating people in various professions which include pretending to be an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. Eventually, however, the FBI gets involved with one specific agent by the name of ""Carl Hanratty"" (Tom Hanks) being particularly tenacious in his efforts to arrest him and have him imprisoned. Yet as hard as Carl works, Frank Jr. Seems to always be one step ahead. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that even though this film was based on a true story there were several embellishments to make it more entertaining to the viewers. A typical Hollywood practice. Even so, I thought that both Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken put in fine performances and combined with an exciting plot made this an enjoyable film all things considered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Fun crime movie,"One of the classics of crime films. Following Frank as he cons the USA and many other countries. Bouncing checks and impersonating a teacher, pilot, doctor and lawyer. This movie is one I come back to again and again and I'm annoyed that it's no longer on Netflix. Going through this film everything that happens you can't even believe that it's the story of a true person. Tom Hanks is cast amazingly as an FBI agent who has been through a rough life and has thrown his life into his work and catching Frank. Dicaprio is also cast pretty well as a suave but unexperienced kid run-away turned into a criminal con-man. My one problem with the casting is that Frank is supposed to be 15-21. Granted the fact that Dicaprio looks older helps with the believability of the movie, but it's still something you notice from time to time. Overall this is a great con movie and I would recomend it if you want a slick movie with come surprisingly good comedy throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Good humor and true,"Based on his autobiography (which he wrote with Stan Redding), it charts Abagnale's exploits as a teenager who made millions of dollars through cheque fraud, travelled extensively at no cost to himself and assumed a number of fake identities with such success that he quickly achieved a glamorous lifestyle, great personal wealth and the attentions of numerous young women. Inevitably, his activities also attracted the attention of the FBI and led to him getting involved in a protracted cat-and-mouse game with one of their agents.Frank enjoys a perfectly happy upbringing in New Rochelle, New York until his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), starts to experience problems with the IRS over some unpaid tax and can't raise a loan to cover the shortfall. As a result, Frank Sr. Loses his retail business, his car and his home and has to move his family into a small apartment. Soon after, Frank's French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) has an affair with one of Frank Sr's fellow Rotarians and this leads to the collapse of their marriage and the painful divorce that follows. Frank is devastated by the loss of his happy family life and runs away from home.Frank looks older than his age and in his new circumstances, soon discovers that he has a natural ability to perpetrate cons by masquerading as an airline pilot and forging various documents and cheques. The wealth and respect that he gains through his activities give him a great deal of confidence and so, when FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) catches up with him at a hotel and confronts him at gunpoint, Frank simply claims to be a Secret Service Agent who'd also been pursuing the elusive Mr Abagnale Jr. And walks away from the premises before Hanratty realises that he's been duped.Frank goes on to pose as a doctor at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia where he meets and falls in love with a sweet young nurse called Brenda (Amy Adams) who wears braces on her teeth and is worried about losing her job. When he meets Brenda's parents, he claims that he's also a qualified lawyer, like her father Roger (Martin Sheen) who's a district attorney and then gets taken on as Roger's assistant. Numerous surprising developments follow before Frank is eventually given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in a most unexpected way.Frank Abagnale Jr. Is a fascinating character and Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely shines in this role as it fully exploits his ability to be charismatic and funny whilst also subtly hinting at the vulnerability and sadness that remain with Frank as a result of his parents' divorce. The surprising relationship that he develops with the rather dull and humourless Hanratty is also an enjoyable feature of the story and becomes quite credible because of the grudging admiration that the FBI man has for Frank and the common ground that they share (both having lost their highly valued family lives). In a movie full of top class performances, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams all make a tremendous impression.The 1960s-type opening credits do a great job of establishing the period within which the action takes place and also signal the playful, upbeat style of presentation that contributes so strongly to all the fun that follows.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Why? Can anyone tell me why?,"Why is it that Leo always gets these roles that cast him as a suave, debonair ladies man from books such as the Beach and now Catch Me if You Can?I actually read this book fifteen years ago as a fifth grade autobiography project. What I do remember is that Frank Abagnale stressed that he was able to accomplish his feats because he looked ten years older than he actually was. Yet you have the reverse with Leo. Can anyone tell me why?It is almost as if Steven Spielberg recognized the moral vacuum of this film and looked to Leo as some sort of insurance.I did find one chuckle. I was ten years old when Frank Abagnale managed to capture my attention by his bamboozling, and now Leo seems to have stepped squarely into Frank's shoes.

Wonderful!,"I am so surprised!!  I just got back from seeing Catch Me, and I wasn't expecting much from it.  I think this one has Oscar written all over it for Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and maybe even Steven Spielberg.The storytelling and layout of the film was outstanding.  To start with an easily recognizable game show (To Tell the Truth), and to take the movie as many places it did shows that Spielberg has not lost his touch.  He needed to direct a winner after so many draws, and he did with this one.  In the words of Frank Abagnale himself: ""You know why the Yankees always win the World Series?  It's because of the pinstripes.""  The pinstripes really wowwed me!Oh, and I LOVED the soundtrack.  This is one to bring home and listen to over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

This movie has the one of the best Leonardo Dicaprio performances ever. Probably the best thing about this masterpiece is the relationship between Frank and Carl.

A disgustingly moralistic story from a rather fun book,"This is a disgustingly moralistic story. And what makes things more unpleasant is that the book was pleasant.The book was about the fun the guy had. He never stole. In a way he can be the emblem of any left leaning government: stealing from the rich to make the life better for those poorer than the rich. He is not violent. He is not a clownish serial killer turned forger. Yet the character in the movie does just that: leaving trails and taunting the smart cop.And the cop was not in the original story. The cop is pasted. And it turns out the cop is the actual character of the story. He is nice. Not only he does not beat the hardened criminal, but he spends his time trying to free him and give him a job and we can assume the path to a regular life. The cop is moral and just. He does not spend government money unless it is to safeguard the rights of a criminal. He spends his free time away from his family to work. He is almost a saint.And the adventure? There is no adventure. Only a fatherly law enforcer that rehabilitates a criminal. What about the European trip?

Don't read if the truth offends you,"This movie was OK. It wasn't spectacular and was on the overlong side. That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the ""cat and mouse"" idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say ""Big"" (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort ""Duel"" (1971). For Walken and Di Caprio fans- you don't want to hear what I recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

My only complaint is the casting of someone who is 6 feet tall as opposed to the character that is based on who looked like to be 5'8,"(2002) Catch Me If You Can
DRAMA/ ADVENTUREA story about a real life con artist whose a wiz on dodging getting caught and forging checks etc... Not bad as a film but felt Leo is too wrong for the role who shouldn't be taller than the average person if he were supposed to be the one to run away from the FBI lead by Tom Hanks! By looking at the real Frank Abagnale Jr, Leo is too tall for the role but because of his high star status was able to solidify the role despite being totally wrong for it! All the extras had to be just as tall so Leo can conveniently get away from the FBI! Good, but not great because of the unconvincing chase sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
How director/actors ruin a beautiful script,"I heard a lot about this film.I saw it today and thought it was a brilliant script and how the big name director and star actors ruined a beautiful script.This film was about brilliant characters of Frank and his father which should have been played in a unique way not just plain ,the way Martin Sheen and Leonardo played them.Tom Hanks looked like a stupid who could not capture a victim who is right in front of him like four times.Can you imagine that FBI would act like that and let the guy run around like that??? Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters. It was not a comedy as I read the script and Spielberg could not get the script and just made it a plain movie .Give this film to British directors and actors and see what a wonderful classic film they will make out of it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Slick, Feel Good Movie","I normally don't like Leonardo in films after that disgrace known as Titanic was released (even though it didn't really have anything to do with him), however I'm glad that did not sway me from watching this movie.Possible SPOILERS: maybe, not sure yet.I like to keep it simple. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a slick counterfeiter/conman with Tom Hanks from the FBI always hot on his heels. Based on a true story. Frank had a troubled family life and after a surprising separation of his parents after his Mom has problems keeping her legs together. Frank loses it and decides to run away, only to return to visit his father, Christopher Walken, from time to time. I especially enjoyed Walken in this film. His relationship with his son, Leo, in the movie was rather realistic and reminded me of mine with my father. Walken fans will enjoy seeing him in this film, even though he doesn't play his normal evil self. I also enjoyed Hanks and Leo's relationship in the movie as it resembled a father son relationship. Frank cares for Carl(Hanks), and Carl cares about Frank, even though it is his job to catch him and throw him in prison. And you can't help but to admire how Frank always outsmarts Carl throughout the film.Being a Spielberg film, one can expect the typical happy ending. And although I normally don't buy into such fluff, it worked for me in this film. It has a few quirky moments, but overall it was a good effort and I would enjoy watching it again. If you like any of the cast in any of their other films, I recommend this movie. Overall, I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Fantastic true-story, lousy movie","This fascinating story & fantastic cast are wasted in this sloppy self-indulgent slice of ""Shpielberg."" A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Thought-provocative funny movie,"What I would like to concentrate on is the idea of the movie.There arise many issues to think over, for example, family, friends, sense and value of life, money, smartness and others. That is really thought-provocative and make us change our mind on many essential things, maybe even to change yourself, to change your attitude to people surrounding you, to events, to deeds.While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant. The main characters are perfect at playing, they are alive in their roles and amplua and are pleasant to watch at.
Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies. This is not just a plain image that we face, this is a real story and the director realized it in full strength.There are impressive, touching and terrific scenes. In spite of the fact that there are much action in this movie, there are many scenes that touch the spectators and make think. The dialogues are elaborated and beautiful and smart-sounded. I like the style of clothes the characters wear, it's fashionable and tasty-designed. The decorations and all stages are perfectly-elaborated.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great.

Catch it!,"It is the 1960's when Frank Abagnale Jr runs away from his crumbling family and begins the life of a fraudster, inpersonating a pilot, doctor and lawyer, and cashing millons in bad cheques all around the world. All before he had even turned eighteen.So begins a game of cat and mouse where the teenage Frank tries to stay one step ahead of the bumbling FBI Agent Carl Handratty who is trying to track him down. The escape scenes are a lot of fun, the father /son moments between Frank and his father are filled with heartwarming drama. But it is the relationship between Frank and Carl that is special. Right from the opening scene you know Frank is going to prison but you wonder how Carl will eventually catch him. And what a scene when it comes!Walken is great as Frank Snr.Hanks's Handratty is far from his best work, but that certainly does not mean he's bad. He's just not in Forest Gump mode.DiCaprio steals the show after being eclipsed by Day Lewis in GONY. He is outstanding in the role of the supremely confident fraudster Frank on one hand, as well as the vunerable kid who justs wants his family back together. It's a shame that he will probably miss out on an Oscar nomination , because he hasn't been this good since What's eating Gilbert Grape? Definately worth the ten year wait.9/10 - Great film - Based on the true story of the life of Frank Abagnale Jr, Catch me if you can is a treasure of a movie. The action moves at a pace, without seeming to move at all, and you are drawn in a moment from laughter to sadness and back again just as quickly.

"Very fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying!","I watched this movie on DVD last night--what a pleasant surprise!  Well, I can't imagine any movie with Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks/Leo DiCaprio as lead actors to be anything less than good, but not having seen the trailer to the movie nor read reviews of it I wasn't sure what kind of a film to expect.  Knowing that this movie is based on real life events of Frank Abagnale Jr. makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, while I cannot stop myself from wondering how on earth he was able to pull it all off--as pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  I'm sure he must have run into some difficulties at times with his pretense, yet he must have been able to react quickly and avert near-disasters until the time he's finally caught.  I really liked his character as DiCaprio portrayed him, despite the fact that the essence of what he did was wrong.  Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job--I ended up liking his character as well even though he started off being rather dislikeable.  Christopher Walken also wins high points for his portrayal as the senior Abagnale, bringing a certain dignity and believability to his character that wins our empathy in spite of his shady dealings and troubles with the IRS.  In short, I ended up liking just about everything in this movie.  It was a very well-presented story and a well-acted drama, with humour sprinkled in just the right amounts and at the right places, in my opinion.  The pace is just fast enough to keep me entertained and thinking at all times, without loosing me in any overly convoluted subplots.

Life on the run from the FBI,"From 1964-1969, a teen from New York (Leonardo DiCaprio) turns to confidence scams to survive, including posing as a Pan Am copilot, a doctor and a lawyer while raking in huge amounts of money via check fraud. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent intent on nabbing the con artist.""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) was inspired by Frank Abagnale Jr's tales about his life. It comes in the tradition of films like ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Great Impostor,"" albeit with the more modern tone of ""The Fugitive"" (1993), minus the great action sequences of that film.You can watch the real-life Abagnale in his appearance on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show in 1978 on Youtube; he shared several of the stories that made it into the movie. Whether or not they're true is another story (he was a conman, after all), but they make for an entertaining movie set in the '60s.The script was based on Abagnale's autobiography, which is more of a biography since he sat down with Stan Redding for a few interviews. Then Redding wrote the actual book, tweaking it for the purposes of entertainment. Abagnale said about 80% of it was accurate. As for the movie, he said some things are off, like the fact that he didn't keep in touch with his dad after running away, not to mention he had two siblings and his mother never remarried. Also, the plane escape took place through the kitchen galley, not the toilet in the rest room. Lastly, the character of Hanratty (Hanks) is a composite of several FBI agents who pursued him.Amy Adams appears in a secondary role; she was 26 during shooting, but looked like a teenager. Jennifer Garner, Elizabeth Banks and Ellen Pompeo have smaller roles.It runs 2 hours, 21 minutes, and was shot in several locations, including Burbank, Downey, New York City (and nearby Orange, New Jersey), LA International Airport, Ontario International Airport, Quebec City and Montreal.GRADE: B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

He was the only one who understood Frank's child's heart. He had a distress for Frank that he hadn't even thought of. He understood that the warmth of family love that Frank had longed for and family reunion. We saw that Frank was watching the once happy family in the mother's hometown. He was drunk in the fiancee's house and wanted the warmth of this family. On the day when his father's bad news came, he stood outside the window looking at his mother's happy new family The warmth in the house was beyond his reach. The child's gaze and tears that he couldn't help, finally exposed a fragile and insecure heart. Fortunately, he still has Carl by his side. The two turned from enemy to friend, and even father and son, letting the circumstance of the obscure plot turn around, casting a ray of sunlight into the darkness.Frank's body has our shadow: young and ignorant. The future is still so long, how much joy there is in the world, how can there be time to consider the consequences? Therefore, we squander our youth to the fullest and avoid all possible consequences and punishments. And carl, the guy who is always pressing behind us, making us always worry, is like a responsibility, an obligation. Of course we cannot escape forever, but when we were young, who did n't think we were different and were favored by God? Until one day, we grew up a bit and started to look back, but found that the things we had cherished so much had long been lost. This way we went too hurriedly, Taicang Huang, too much to grab into our arms, so that when it slipped from our arms, there was no consciousness. At that moment, we were Frank who heard the news of his father's death on the plane. There was no remorse, no amount of pain to restore the established facts.Finally, without exception, we were caught by carl, packed up the gains and losses of the past, and faced possible consequences and punishment. From that day on, we stayed and stayed with Carl, and we called that day ""growing up.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Stunning film worth a 2nd visit,"Very well made and well constructed film with great lead performances by LDiCaprio, THanks and CWalken which don't steal the show.

"Neither true thriller nor credible comedy, but boasts an entertaining story","Steven Spielberg's latest film is the true story of the prodigious teenage con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo Di Caprio) who manages during the late 1960's to forge over two million dollars in checks throughout several different countries while posing as an airline pilot, a pediatrician, an attorney, and a college professor.  All the while, he is being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), whose dedication to catching Abagnale borders on obsessive.While the main focus of the film is on Abagnale's genius for defrauding the government, deceiving just about anyone with whom he comes into contact, and the ensuing cat and mouse game with the FBI, it also allows us a glimpse into the underlying roots of his deception.  His father Frank Abagnale Sr., portrayed with great depth and sincerity by Christopher Walken, has a penchant for deceit himself but when his business and marriage fall apart it ignites his son's strong yearning to restore the life and family they once had and ultimately his ambitious yet perilous journey into high stakes fraud.There are times when the plot seems repetitious and predictable, and therefore robs this film of becoming a first rate thrill ride.  But strong performances, a fascinating storyline with both comical and sad undertones, and a fulfilling ending make Catch Me If You Can worth the trip to the cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Entertaining cat and mouse antics,"With just $25 dollars to his name, Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) does the seemingly impossible and manages to pose as a doctor, lawyer and a pilot all with no formal training all the while whilst defrauding banks across the USA out of millions of dollars. However, hot on his heels is moody FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) who doggedly pursues Abagnale in order to bring him to justice...Based on Frank Abagnale Jr's own book, Spielberg delivers Catch Me If You Can with a mostly light-hearted playful feel (which given the source material was arguably the best way to pitch it). Di Caprio does a wonderful job in bringing Abagnale Jr to life (he's charming and charismatic but with a sympathetic edge - he's trying to help his family which never renders him unlikeable at any point). Hanks has a trickier job in his role as a rather dry FBI Agent, but at times this is used to good effect when his attempts at being funny hit a brick wall. Amy Adams is the real surprise here as the dim-witted love interest to Abagnale and even a cynic like me felt some sympathy towards her later in the film.As I've already mentioned, the light-hearted and playful tone is the film's biggest asset and this is what ensures that the film remains entertaining and enjoyable. Abagnale's elaborate ploys and Houdini like escapology are certainly imaginative and for me the film rarely misses a beat (despite its generous 120+ minute running time).Given the fact that the real Frank Abagnale co-wrote the script and Spielberg directed the film I did wonder if the film may have been slightly embellished in the name of entertainment i.e were the FBI really that incompetent and did Abagnale really manage to impersonate pilots, doctors and lawyers with such ease? To be honest when the film ended, I didn't really care and the aforementioned points are more observations than criticisms.At the end of the day the film was fun and to me that was what ultimately mattered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch Me Not,"You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway).""Minority Report"" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC ""care"" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.A word of advice: don't watch ""The Grifters""  (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of ""The Sting.""Hell, don't even see the underrated ""Harry in Your Pocket"" or even ""The Flim-Flam Man"" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report.""And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in ""Thirteen Days"" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's ""Road to Perdition"" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think ""Pink Panther"" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's ""Ocean's Eleven"" sans the cool.Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly ""what's she doing here?"" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).Though ""based on actual events,"" several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, ""The Great Impostor"" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.Catch it not.But *do* rent ""The Grifters.""Or ""Ocean's Eleven""... even the original.

The only thing he can do is run away from it. He imitates a school reporter, a pilot, a doctor, and then a lawyer which eventually gets himself caught with the biggest detectives of the United States.

disappointing execution and little concern for characters,"First, the good news. Christopher Walken fans will appreciate the one gem of his movie -- his supporting performance. After that, there isn't much to hold this movie together.Leonardo DiCaprio is mis-cast as someone who thrived on their anonymity -- while he happens to be one of the most over-exposed actors in Hollywood. Tom Hanks, along with his role in Road to Perdition, adds little dynamic to a key character -- seemingly taking a parallel to Dan Aykroyd's film career: a once-notable star playing forgettable roles, getting chubby from too much food and sitting on the laurels of former glory.There are a few moments of interesting character situations, but none of the characters made me care about them (besides Walken). Characters are discarded so frequently in the chase for DiCaprio that the movie seems as shiftless as his character's life. While this conveys the nature of his on-the-run existence, it leads to a film with more of a laundry list of brief encounters rather than any richer storytelling.There's an attempt to create a surrogate father-son relationship between DiCaprio and Hanks, but it is handled superficially and merely suggested. There's probably more they could have done to bring out an interesting dynamic between these two key characters. More also could have been done to bring out the dynamic of the real father's influence on the son.The movie employs the classic switch between past and future scenes, but there's no mystery in them other than the mundane details of how they will inevitably connect -- as the audience presumes from the start. A few clever escapes here and there, but they are hardly captivating, let alone memorable.To its credit, making a story about a fugitive guilty of fraudulent checks is hardly Hollywood sexy these days. But the entire experience left me expecting more from this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Leo and Hanks are remarkable,"MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: 12 and upMy * rating: 8.5When I first learned about the making of this film, I nearly fainted. Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in one movie together? That combo didn't click too well with me, but I decided to see it in the opening week, anyway.Boy was I wrong... The film was remarkable, and everything about it was realistic and exiting, which is just the thing you'd expect from a Speilberg picture. This is one film that I would enjoy seeing time and time again, and it's creators should rejoice.

Following his fathers footsteps, he become a con artist. He uses his checks as a way to spend money that he doesn't have. At the same time, he uses his skills to become a doctor, a pilot and a lawyer. Carl Hanratty (Hanks) is an FBI agent who trys to catch him. the real shocker is in the end...This story is superbly told by all actors, especially the two leading actors, DiCaprio in particular. DiCaprio is not the 'Titanic' spoiled teenager that he was in most of his films. He is now a 19 year old adult, something I have been wondering about now for some time, even though he was born in 1974.An excellent film.

The movie easily captures the frizzy fun of movies of a forgotten by gone era, and gives a hype vibe to all the scenes it has.

Good film,"""The true story of a real fake"".

A Riveting Cat-and-Mouse Chase,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a thrilling rollercoaster of a film that seamlessly blends crime, drama, and humor. Directed by Steven Spielberg and anchored by standout performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, this true story of a young con artist is a captivating journey from start to finish.DiCaprio shines as Frank Abagnale Jr., a master of deception who successfully eludes the authorities by assuming various identities and forging checks. His charisma and quick thinking make him an incredibly engaging character, leaving the audience torn between rooting for him and the FBI agent hot on his trail.Tom Hanks, as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, provides the perfect foil to DiCaprio's character. The dynamic between the two leads is the heart of the film, delivering moments of tension, camaraderie, and unexpected humor. Hanks brings a gravitas to the role, portraying Hanratty as a determined and sympathetic character whose pursuit becomes more than just a job.Spielberg's direction is impeccable, balancing the fast-paced nature of the story with moments of reflection and introspection. The film captures the essence of the 1960s with its stylish cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the era.One of the film's strengths is its ability to navigate between lighthearted comedy and intense drama effortlessly. The humor derived from Frank's audacious cons provides a welcome break from the tension, making ""Catch Me If You Can"" a thoroughly enjoyable and well-rounded experience.The supporting cast, including Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, adds depth to the narrative, contributing to the emotional core of the story. Walken, in particular, delivers a poignant performance as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding layers to the protagonist's character.""Catch Me If You Can"" is more than just a cat-and-mouse game; it's a character-driven exploration of identity, family, and the consequences of choices. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat, thanks to its compelling narrative, strong performances, and Spielberg's expert storytelling.In conclusion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a cinematic gem that stands the test of time.

An entertaining movie with more depht that seems in the first view,"First of all,i think Spielberg is a great director of adventure movies.That's the best gift of many of his movies.This movie seems a simple entertaining flick but it show us how ET's director has grown.His obssesion with the family is here and also his best cualities as cinema autor(broken families,lonely child,sense of adventure.....).The movie is not great but is very good.I think this is one of the best biopics in recent american cinema,full of joy and ,surprise,drama.This film is also a magnificent portrait of the 60's ,the period of the Frank's swindle.The story of the young fake becomes in a great biography in Spielberg hands.Leonardo DiCaprio at last can be the great actor that always he was.His performance here is the most adecuate in every sense of the word.He's moving,charming,and plenty of life.This is his best performance since Gilbert Grape.Tom Hanks is good,although the show belongs to DiCaprio.

I've given up.,"hi, My names Pip Hodgkinson and before I go any further I'd justlike to say Speilberg is one of the most fantastic directors in thisday and age, but this film is the last straw.Why oh why can't he end a movie? With AI I was a little upset, buton a second viewing I was satisfied with the glossy ending. WithMinority Report I was in a world of my own until he went off on hisBrian De Palmer tour of filmmaking! And on a second viewing Iwas just as upset that he managed what could have been thefinest film last year look very ordinary with the last 20minutes. SoCatch Me If You Can was his chance of redemption, prove that hehas a little more variety in his abilities as a filmmaker thanconstantly not being to end a film (god knows what would havehappened if he'd directed the Ice Storm!) so image my distresswhen I'm loving the movie, pleased with the plot,pace andperformances then bang. Theres an ending, but no Steven doesn'twant to leave us with any distaste in our mouths so he takes us offon a 15minute buddy movie style ending, oh at first they wereagainst each other then now! the work with each other! Wow didntsee that one coming. If Minority Reports ending reminded me ofMission Impossible then Catch Me if you can was Dragnet.  Thenhe manages to do the most lazy straight to tv trick in the history ofcinema. Oh yeah you got it, he uses the rolling text to make surewe understand that it IS an happy ending.So while I celebrated both Minority Report and AI as good films thatcould have been great. Catch Me If You Can is not its a disgrace, ithad all the makings of being ten times better than both the beforementioned films and one of the best films of the year but hemanages to make the film ordinary with its ending.  So why shouldwe praise this movie?Speilberg is the greatist movie maker for the openings to his films,take Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones (all three) and nowCatch Me If You Can and you can see a genius at work.

The surprises are unexpected, but logical - not outlandish.Years ago I might have felt that the depiction of the FBI agents was exaggerated, but after the current years' revelations of their activities, I find everything not only apparently accurate but almost understated at times.

A Treat from Spielberg,"The plot is so preposterous it has to be true. A young man, a teenager actually, drops out of high school and, not satisfied with low-end jobs, variously impersonates an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer. All his impersonations work, and he uses his personas in various forgery schemes that net him millions of dollars that fuel his high-flying international life-style. The young man, Frank Abagnail, is played with breezy confidence by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is wonderfully believable and his portrayal of the young con man is one of his best roles.But it's not all entirely fun and games.  The relationship between Frank and his parents, especially his dearly beloved but down-on-his luck father (Christopher Walken) is sad and multi-layered. The third important personal dimension is between Frank and the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who pursues him.Set in the early 60s, Spielberg nails the period perfectly from the opening credits through the clothing styles, modes of entertainment and transportation, and even personal accoutrements. It's perfection.  After a string of darker pictures it's heartening to see Spielberg take on this project. It's paid off very well for his fans and the movie going public.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Excessive,"There appear to be two Steven Speilbergs in Cinema: Speilberg the filmaker, responsible for such films as Schindler's list and Speilberg the entertainer, responsible for films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Sometimes, he manages to balance out both with films such as Jaws as the result. I usually enjoy his more balanced out films, they really entertain while catching your deep thoughts. However, sometimes there's a sign of a clash between the two. In 2001's A.I. Speilberg seemed to want to have a Kubrick film yet at the same time dazzle the audience with vibrant chase sequences and harrowing visual effects. The clash usually ends up in somewhat of a mess, not neccessarly bad but not really that good either. That being said, I'll move onto the review. Catch Me if You Can is definitely a clash of Speilberg. He wants to provide the viewer with a quick and stlyish movie about one of the moust astounding criminals in the world yet also provide them with a deep, rich character study. Unfortunately, the script seems to go more with the quick aspect, providing flashy dialouge such as in Frank's Father, Christopher Walk's character. What ends up happening is a rather solid film, but it could have been a bit more. Leornado Dicaprio shines as the intelligent yet somewhat misguided Frank. He conveys his emotional moments and his excited moments effortlessly, really making the viewer think he's 17. Tom Hanks provides solid work here, but he seems to be a bit over- the- top with his character. Christopher Walken offers valuable support here, perhaps showing the route of the motivations for Frank's crime spree. With a good enough cast, this movie clicks instantly and follows through... almost till the end. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the movie trips on it's own legs and becomes quite repeating. It ends up just being one con job aftr another, trying to inspire excitment in the viewer then get emotions out of them by showing Frank's internal dilemna. The script is solid enough and Speilberg's directing a bit unfocused but still all right. That being said, it's not that Catch Me If You Can is neccessarily a bad movie, quite the contrary really. It's an interesting $9 spent, a sort of ride yet an emotional experience. Speilberg clashes indeed, but the rest of the movie sticks together well enough. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride","Fun. That's the best way to describe this story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), if that is his name.

This goes on for years, as he is able to stay just ahead of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Christopher Walken also turns in a good performance as Frank Abagnale Sr. All of the supporting cast performed also performed well. No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride.*** (Out of 4)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Pure entertainment,"It might require too much suspension of disbelief for a true story, but it's an entertaining cat and mouse comedy nevertheless. Spielberg had to squeeze in family matters at all costs, but for once avoids getting too heavy-handed with easy sentimentalism. 140 minutes seem like a bit too long for a lighthearted comedy, but the lead's charisma, as well as the variety in moods and atmospheres, made it unexpectedly entertaining throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities,"Catch Me If You Can is a highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities. Director Steven Spielberg gorgeously delivers a film set in the 60s following the exploits of Frank William Abagnale Jr. as a con man, effortlessly played by Leonardo DiCaprio.The film tackles themes of family, parenthood and loss. Frank Jr. starts with a happy family that quickly fractures when financial struggles and extra-marital affairs led to his parent's divorce played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank Sr. and Paula Abagnale, respectively. Their divorce precipitated his descent to financial crimes. Hot on the trail is Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, an FBI bank fraud agent. Carried by a great cast and brisk editing, Catch Me If You Can never slows and the audience is completely immersed in the journey and thrill of Frank Jr.'s exploits. Every shot looks beautiful with the impressive cinematography from recurring Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski. Composer Michael Khan provides a score that reflects the tone of the film.Ultimately, Catch Me If You Can fails to reach its true potential because the character growth of Frank Jr. has little weight. Through the course of the film, moments are sprinkled to reveal Frank Jr.'s motivations but this is not fully explored. The script comes short in realizing that Frank Jr.'s broken family is the reason for his actions. The emotional weight of the film gets lost in the chase aspect. However, the film remains a marvel to appreciate considering all its qualities.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Loved it and I still do,"Catch me if you can was a critical and financial success almost right at it's release and it aged just as well. I find it rare to find such a good, catchy and entertaining crime comedy-drama film nowadays, there's something about those early 2000's movies that just feels right.Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies, and a lot of them support de same idea of a light and comical feeling for a heavier subject. That is exactly what can be seen when watching Catch me if you can: the story of the main character Frank Abagnale, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, isn't exactly a ""happy-go-lucky"" one but watching it makes you smile and scoff at almost every turn. Crime and bank fraud is nothing to laugh about, as clearly shown by Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks, but the scenes showing the main character breeze through banking security so cleverly are made in way that makes it almost look like an art project.The cinematography and writing of the movie would not have been so well executed if it weren't for the actors. Frank Abagnale is a 17-year-old adolescent when his life falls apart, he turns to conning to survive. As he realizes his talents for it, his cons grow constantly at which point officer Carl Hanratty starts tracking Frank for bank fraud. Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Frank can clearly show the character's cleverness and his instability and insecurity that appears along the film. Tom Hanks is also a perfect actor for the character of Carl Hanratty, a person who is set on his goals and isn't shy in his approach to catching Frank, but still soft at heart and even clumsy at times.All in all Catch me if you can brings you along the ups and downs of the characters played by amazing actors, gives comedic relief and for some softer hearts maybe a tear or two, while keeping a steady and catchy plot and eventually a satisfying ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Entertaining, enjoyable farce.","Steven Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can' tells the remarkable story of real life con man Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., and his various criminal exploits - including forging cheques and posing as a doctor, lawyer and airline pilot.How much is true - considering the film is based on a book full of claims by the con man himself - is open to question, but probably doesn't matter greatly since the film can be enjoyed as fact or pure fiction as you prefer. Taken as fiction, it's still an entertaining watch.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank, Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty (the fbi agent out to track him down) and a number of well known stars play supporting roles. The film is set in 1960s America, and the period props and costumes are a treat.The film cracks on at a decent pace throughout and is easy to follow. It does flip from 'present day' to the past a few times, which to my mind wasn't necessary - a linear telling of the storyline would have been just fine - perhaps even preferable from a suspense perspective. I also wonder if the women Frank manipulates would all have been quite so fawning!The back story to young Frank helps to explain why he chose his criminal past, but aside from that the film aims for traditional well-made entertainment rather than anything too left field or heavy. A tad hard to believe in places, but a decent light weight watch all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
More like a character study than a biographical drama,"""Sometimes, it's easier living the lie""The world see a seventeen-year-old con man responsible for millions of dollars in forgery, but I see a seventeen-year-old desperate, lonely young boy behind all masqueraded identities who just wanted his perfect little family back, who just wanted his mom & dad to be happy and back together once again.The movie feels more like a detailed, explicit character study of a runaway juvenile than a biographical dramatisation of Frank Abagnale Jr. And his con artistry to me, and I'm saying this in a positive way.Not Spielberg's finest work, but it splendidly demonstrates how to compose a character with complete conviction and authority and have it play out exactly as you intended.

Why this movie is not in IMDb Top 250?,"This films belongs to Di Caprio. The portrait of Frank Abagnale Jr. by Caprio is amazing and interesting. The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one. Then it shows how Frank becomes a criminal by forging checks after the divorce of his parents. Frank poses as a co-pilot and forges payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over 2.8 million dollars. He also impersonate as a doctor and an assistant prosecutor.Tom Hanks plays a humorless FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, who begins to track down Frank. Then begins the cat and mouse game. The scene in which Frank calls Carl for the first time is really interesting. Frank tells him that he is sorry that Carl could not catch him in their first meet, to which Carl replies that Frank has called him because there is no one else whom he can call. The film confirms Di Caprio as a fine actor.Catch me if you can is another jewel in Spielberg's crown.I fail to understand why this movie is not in the list of Top 250 IMDb films. Don't miss this movie. Its a masterpiece with top notch acting and direction. I would go with 8.0/10 for 'Catch me if you Can'. Go Catch it at the earliest if you still haven't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
My Favorite Steven Spielberg Movie!,"I got this at a garage sale, and I am so glad that I did! While the beginning may seem slow at first, this incredible true story of a minor who frauds over millions of dollars while gaining 3 careers is sure to enthrall you.I myself was enthralled with it my first time and spent MONTHS telling about it to nearly all who crossed my path. I saw it with a friend and he loved it too.Recently, at tech school, I brought it to show my class and they ALL thought it was the bomb! A classmate even asked me the next day if he could borrow it to show it to one of HIS friends.The disadvantage to showing it in class was that they kept yapping their lips: ""Oh, is this going to happen?' ""How did he escape that plane bathroom?"" blah blah blah-and they would know if THEY WATCHED THE DANG MOVIE AND SHUT THEIR TRAPS!So shut yours and witness this modern masterpiece, and let it play out-and do not miss it! Catch this movie if you can! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
I was absorbed,"My first and only criterion for enjoying a film is whether I'm absorbed. To the point where I don't think about time and think like the characters and consider them real.  A fairly simple yet powerful measure.This film abosorbed me.  A fascinating plot, very good acting, and even though we know the ending, suspense.  It helps not to know before exactly what fields the fake entered, just to add a little more.  A plain, good ole entertaining movie in the best spirit of Hollywood.  I suppose uppity types won't be impressed, since it lacks the weirdness so many critics seem to crave in ""critically acclaimed"" movies.Bottom line: was the ticket worth it, was the time well spent?  A resounding yes.  Highly entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Catch me if you can,This movie keeps you going over and over and over again it is so intense watching two best actors beat each other out on the screen for being amazing actor's especially Leonardo DiCaprio w his amazing role of catch me if you can. Keeps you in your seat eating popcorn and enjoying time w your family. Tom hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio two best role's in this great movie. One of my favorite actor's has to be Leonardo DiCaprio he is such an inspiration in this movie. Knowing that he knows how to act in this role and be a true actor. Tom hanks as well being the best as well known actor in the Movie Industry. Especially for Leonardo DiCaprio winning Academy Award for Best Actor 2016 · The Revenant. I am sure he did a well job for acting in this series of movies and he will do it again w the amazing work he has done w the other movie's. Goodluck To The cast and the crew for the rest of your full year and life in acting.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Enjoyable but too long.,Catch me if you can is an enjoyable film that has a certain something that you cant put your finger on.Perhaps it is the DeCaprio charm or maybe it is the Tom Hanks factor that makes this very watchable but dont be fooled into thinking this is as good as everbody says because it does have one very poor floor.The problem with Catch Me If You Can is that it is one of those film that starts at the end then goes back to the begining and keeps switching to the end again and this really spoils the movie. We dont want to know what happens at the start we want to find out at the end!Only films like Momento can pull this off and this is no Momento. The acting is good and i would say the best display is from Christopher Walken and we should see more from this highly underrated actor. All in all not a bad film but it could have had 20 minutes shaved off of it. 7 out of 10.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A good movie... despite the advertising,"When I saw the advertising for this title, I thought I was in for a joyous romp as Tom Hanks chased Leo all over the board.  Instead, this was a fairly serious movie.  It was way more dramatic than advertised, but still a nice movie.  Not a laugh-fess by any stretch, but a pretty nice movie.P.S. - Walken rules... yet again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Good but little stretched,"The movie is about a con man, based on his real life incidents. Leo plays the lead role of thief and Tom Hanks an FBI agent who's running after him.

A nice story...,"Unfathomable in today's world... rampant unsecured check cashing, forged diplomas that aren't checked, a hapless FBI outwitted by a 17 year old... maybe the most amazing thing is that it's based on a true story!Leonardo DeCaprio and Tom Hanks are great, as expected, and so was Christopher Walken. Yet even though it runs 2:21, the story is thin in places. There's only one real ""scare"" where Frank was forced to action in one of the careers he was faking, an emergency room event that obviously rattles him. I expected more, I guess. Maybe some sort of in-flight semi-crisis for the bogus pilot?It's a nice story... a cat and mouse chase that turns into a different sort of bond between pursued and pursuer. I think I hoped for more drama than there was, but that's on me. It was good, not perfect, but worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Leonardo DiCaprio Show,DiCaprio's Performance is incredible. Spielberg does a great job utilizing his range. Tom Hanks and Walken provide solid performances also that keep the film riveting.

"bubblegum fluff, in self-important Spielberg dressing","Imagine ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" retold as a 1950's beach-blanket flick (hot sports cars, bikini babes, parents unaware of their out-of-control, freewheeling children) and you have ""Catch Me if You Can,"" another Spielberg flick that's in love with its own imagined sense of importance.  Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A story of how gullible people can be.,"When I first saw this film it scared me. This movie although funny and engrossing tends to remind me of just how much we assume things in our daily lives.I found myself going to the doctor a few days later and thinking to myself ""what if one of those nurses came out without that white coat on. I mean is the fact they have the coat on that makes you think they're a nurse or the fact they came from behind that door. What I loved about this film and in fact the whole thing was this kid actually did all these things for so long just because people took for granted he was who he says he was.I have talked to some people who work at hospitals who tell me they wear the white coat not because they are required to but because people give them less problems when they do. I talked to several nurses who told me when they don't have their whites on patients have actually screamed and harassed them out of their rooms cause they though they weren't real nurses and were there to kill them. Cops too, I spoke to several cops who said that when they are off duty people don't stop for them even when they flash their badges. One told me he has actually had several people get off cause they told the jury the badge looked fake, and he didn't look like a real cop. Also several people who have worked at banks tell me they have seen the real guy before as he did several educational films for various banks about how to spot bad checks. Apparently he really was that original when he was young, and after he was caught banks changed security procedures for good.  Not many criminal can say their actions changed a industry, much less now work for the industry as experts.These days people a allot more jaded then when these events took place and people have a more inquisitive nature. But as 9/11 showed us things are still not perfect if really better at all.My favorite scene in this film is when he becomes the head of the department at the hospital. The two doctors look scared and all he does it what he saw on TV. I think he was watching General Hospital or something, but I am not sure.I like the acting in this film especially Walken, Hanks character was really drool but from what I heard in interviews, that was the way the guy really is. Leo does well in this as usual. The film is well paced and believable. People can argue about all the things in this movie that are wrong. To me though this movie is about a kid who wants to help his father so he can get back with his mother and they can be a family again. Once he realizes he has gone to far, he keeps going and does what he can to go on with his life. He had one h*ll of a ride though and he knew it. It is a good story that is well told and well acted. When I go to see a film that's what I'm looking for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""I'm your deadhead. - The James Bond of the sky.""","Steven Spielberg didn't need to make this movie. Come 2002, he had nothing else to prove. By then he had made Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report. And yet, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN surpasses all of those in my opinion. And I'd argue that it's the last truly great film he's made. This is first class Spielberg, showing him having a blast just making a film about normal individuals. He turns the fascinating but also inconsequential true story of Frank Abagnale Jr and makes it as enthralling, cinematic and deeply sad as his high concept or important historical pictures. The pacing feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest, with opening credits that'd make Saul Bass proud. Every technical decision, performance and piece of writing here is on point. It's just the most fun you can have with his filmography, reminding you that real life can be as memorable, if not more so, than the Cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Catch it. You Know You Can.,"I am in no way a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I don't like DiCaprio. His performances on Titanic and Romeo + Juliet were less than satisfactory. I saw this movie for three reasons: Hanks, Walken, Spielberg.DiCaprio surprised me. His acting was actually quite believable. Even though he's a 30-year-old playing a high school student, He seemed to fit the part. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken did not surprise me. I knew they could act before I saw this movie.The presentation lost this movie 2 points. It was presented as a comedy. Maybe I should have known that ""Comedy"" and ""True Story"" is a very unlikely combination. It had its funny moments, but Catch Me If You Can was actually pretty serious.Anyway, Spielberg gives us another movie worth seeing.

Dragnet meets The Fugitive,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Spielberg delivers a very entertaining romp through the life of Frank Abagnale,jr.  I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times.  Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation.  Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm.  However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in ""Gangs of New York"".  Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken.  Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in ""The Deer Hunter"".  I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit.  Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner.  Mostly this is an entertaining film that the masses will enjoy and there is nothing wrong with that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Mildly entertaining,"Everybody did an OK job here, but I guess the movie was less than the sum of its parts. The film just fails to engage. I expected more from Spielberg. The plot had Abagnale doing some really dumb things, he would have never been caught otherwise. I suppose these things were supposed to be poignant, but were just really dumb. One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere. And why did Christopher Walken get an Oscar nomination for this? He is a fine actor, but I didn't think that this role was really worthy. Overall. this is mildly entertaining, but all involved can do better. Grade: C-",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Main character inspires no empathy & no condemnation,This film tells the story of a thief and con man between the ages of 15 and 21. It doesn't stick closely to the real story of his life but takes many liberties with the narrative. It makes him an only child instead of showing his three siblings and changes the timeline so that he does his first major theft and confidence tricks at the age of 16.It is told in a value-neutral way so that you can't admire him for his schemes nor condemn him for his wrongdoing either. You don't care enough about the character to admire or condemn him. He is simply a 'phenomenon'.The actor Lenny D is adequate in the role. He never puts a foot wrong but doesn't stand out either.,4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Good acting, Great movie","This was a wonderful movie, although some of the more adult scenes could be limited and the end was rather predictable.  I saw it with some friends, who also enjoyed it quite a bit.  Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job, boosting his image after such titles as The Beach...  Tom Hanks was great as well. I can't wait to see it again once it is released on VHS or DVD.  Somewhat long, but it feels like 3 smaller movies all rolled into one large package. Younger people may not understand most of what is going on, but the story is good nonetheless.  Bits of humor are added to make it even more crowd-appealing.  Overall, it was a very good movie, a good reenactment of the true story (at least from what I've heard), and it deserves some recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
