"Script, Cast, Performances, Chemistry = A Great Romantic Comedy","Producers Judd Apatow and Shauna Robertson gave Jason Segel the chance of a lifetime to write and star in a film that ended up packed with comedic acting talent. The supporting ensemble cast and four leads (Segel, Bell, Kunis and Brand) perform Segel's script with synergistic perfection, generating a chemistry that is contagious to the audience.Fate sometimes produces great opportunities...
The part of Aldous Snow was written by Segal based on his friend, actor Charlie Hunnam. Charlie was cast in the role, but he quit at the first table read, paving the way for Russell Brand's big break (which he did not waste, making the character an iconic role-of-a-lifetime for the actor/comedian).Each of the four lead actors shines in the spotlight - Kunis and Bell both look stunning and connect well with the parts and audience. Segel and Brand pull off their numerous laugh-out-loud funny scenes with subtle perfection. All four seem born to play the parts.My favorite Apatow film, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' combines a great script with perfect casting, across the board great acting performances, and uniquely effective direction by Nicholas Stoller. The result is a deserved 8+ IMDb Rating, as this film is one of the very best romantic comedies of the 2010's.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and sweet without seeming too formulaic,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall - A slacker composer Peter (Jason Segel from ""Knocked Up"") has a breakdown after his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell of ""Heroes""), the star of a hit TV show, dumps him for a British pop star. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.This was a funny movie! It's a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional ""Scrubs"" style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.This was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that's a strike against him.Segel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There's no animosity between the two men. It's nice to have a comedy where we don't have to demonize anyone.It's a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Same Apatow clan, slightly different take.","This film was shown at my university tonight and Stoller was there for a Q&A after the screening. The film was the typical Apatow romp that we have seen as of late (Superbad, Knocked up, etc.). There was the usual crude and creative humor as well inappropriate sexuality to make another great Apatow team production. People should not come in with the expectation that this is another romantic comedy reincarnation of ""Knocked Up"". This is more of a typical and organic romantic comedy. The heavy emotional weight and issues in ""Knocked up"" are not present in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A miraculous movie!,"I normally do not go out for sappy, romantic roller coaster romantic fare; and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (FSM) pretty much falls under the romantic ""date flick"" rubric.And I can't, for the life of me, quite figure out why I liked this so much. I guess the filmmakers succeed in making the welter of comic bits, scenes, and images come across like genuine romantic sweet chaos. How they succeeded is beyond my comprehension.And maybe that's the point. Some films are good, some are bad, and some are sort of like miracles. Their power is inexplicable; and that's how FSM felt to me.It was boffo, a bit over-the-top, a tad muddled, a mix of character study, revelation, and farce. And, as things unfolded, by dint of pacing and sheer comic/character acting power, I came to really care about the characters; and I loved it! I glowed through most of FSM.Here's a way of looking at it: FSM was sort of like Shakespearean romantic farce. Maybe that explains why I liked it; because my mind already has a little engine for processing this kind of narrative stuff, built up from past experiences watching Shakespeare In The Park!It also comes down to artistic sincerity. Most romance flicks are a little insulting because they're not sincere. There was something, in the end, believable and therefore redeeming about the characters and their silly little Hawaiian comedy of errors and feints.And that's a miracle, in my book! This is not an ordinary date flick.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A romantic comedy that is actually funny? Wow, I didn't think those existed any more","Forgetting Sarah Marshall, definitely the biggest movie that everyone was looking forward to seeing this year. Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies: 40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life, I have to say he's got talent, the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable, they are real and people you could relate too! For example, Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for, yeah, he's a little bit of a moron, but you know what? You could understand why people liked him, he was pretty cool, even the girlfriend, Sarah, yeah, she was a jerk, but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.Sarah Marshall: hot actress, beautiful, and a fun person, just broke up with her musician boyfriend, Peter. He's just heartbroken and needs to get away for a while, so he goes to Hawaii, but guess what? Sarah is there with her new rock star boyfriend, Aldous Snow, and things are not seeming to go his way. But when he meets Rachel Jenson, the nice and really pretty hotel clerk, they go out and he ends up realizing that maybe this break up wasn't such a big deal after all.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a funny movie, I guarantee you are going to laugh. I do have one complaint, the male nudity, now it's not that I'm a prude at all, just this was more uncomfortable than funny with Jason exposing all his assets. I don't know, just that type of humor isn't funny with me, male or female, just depending on the joke, but this was more awkward. But I do think this is a fun movie, it has a great story and really makes you laugh and just have a good time with these characters, it's a good recommendation from me.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprise Solid Comedy,"I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on ""the list"" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like ""Superbad"", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Superbad"", or ""Knocked Up"".For starters, there was a definite presence of the ""TV actors on the big screen"" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of ""That 70s Show"" didn't follow her to ""Forgetting""'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that ""Forgetting"" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than ""American Psycho 2"" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on ""CSI"") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious ""American Psycho 2""); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with ""Superbad""). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt ""Knocked Up""). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write ""Fun with Dick and Jane"".All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Moderately amusing, decent romcom","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' was very popular when it was first released, and seems to remain a popular choice with TV networks. Until recently, I avoided it at all costs, thinking it would be exactly the sort of movie I hate.After finally watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. Even with the odious and totally unfunny Russell Brand, it was adequately funny, an unexpected change for a romcom. There was plenty I didn't like though. There's a lot of crude humour in the film, and some of it just isn't funny. This film is the movie equivalent of a joke book. Some parts are amusing, others not so much.Overall, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' provides a few good laughs, but is rather hit and miss with its humour. A moderately amusing, but overrated comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Apatow's Crew Sets the Comedy Bar for Hollywood,"I'm going to be honest, walking into the advanced screening tonight I was expecting an overly chick flicky somewhat dull comedy. What I got instead was a pretty hilarious movie with just the right amount of romance and a whole lot of vulgar comedy also. I can honestly say this is the funniest movie of 2008 so far. The entire Judd Apatow crew has overall had about 4 or five great comedies in the last 3 years, putting them up with all the other great comedy film makers since 2005. This movie makes me feel like I can now trust any movie they make most the time. When this movie hits theatres in April, GO SEE IT.

A Nice and entertaining Rom-Com!!,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a romantic comedy film directed by Nicholas Stoller. The film stars Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Russell Brand.After his break-up with Sarah, Peter Bretter decides to go for a Hawaiian on a vacation where he is shocked to see that Sarah has checked in at the same resort as his.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the typical type of love stories with a predictable plot, a predictable execution and predictable climax but you'll still love to watch this film and the film also entertains.The best part of the film is probably it's cast and superb dialogues who makes this otherwise a predictable film a fun film to watch. The film has it's own funny, sad and romantic moments with a pinch of humor at regular intervals.As far as acting is concerned all the characters were impressive in the film and did a fantastic job be it Segel, Bell, Kunis, Brand or Jonah Hill. Paul Rudd looked little disconnected.Screenplay of the film is good and climax is equally good. If you like Rom-Coms then you'll surely love this film. A must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
You Won't Soon Forget It!,"I know, I went for the obvious.I was lucky enough to see an early screening of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a few days ago and I am more than happy to start spreading some buzz for this film. It was consistently funny and highly quotable with a strong cast and well developed characters. I have been continually impressed with the multi-talented young actors under Judd Apatow's wing and Jason Segel--who, I'll admit has been one of my favorites since ""Freaks and Geeks""--does not disappoint.There are many familiar faces here from other Apatow projects, but for good reason. Paul Rudd, whom I love equally in comedy and drama (true fans must view ""The Shape of Things"" but be prepared to be uncomfortable), Bill Hadar, and Jonah Hill hit just the right notes in their supporting roles. There's Russell Brand--whom I was unfamiliar with but apparently evokes strong feelings one way or the other across the pond--is hysterical and delivered some of my favorite lines. Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis are sympathetic straight women to the goofy men around them. It was particularly nice to Mila Kunis outside of the 70's Show/Family Guy worlds. And, last, but certainly not least, there's 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer playing an equally lovable and funny newlywed version of Kenneth.Though I did feel that the film ran a little long, it never once dragged. There were also a few shots that I am sure will not be available until the unrated DVD hits stores because though they are truly hilarious, they are essentially the only thing keeping the film from a PG-13 rating.Finally, I will say, that those who liked Knocked Up, Superbad, and 40 Year-Old Virgin, will certainly enjoy this movie. I, personally, would rank it above the other three and will enjoy debating my friends about that come April.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not a disaster, not a masterpiece","I have thus far been nearly immune to the talents of Judd Apatow and his merry band of funmeisters. I have never seen ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"" or ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"". No doubt one day I will. I have seen ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy"" on TV and found them... well... OK, I suppose. Not really my cup of tea, but nothing awful enough to make me want to change the channel.I went to see ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" last Monday. So, why exactly did I bother to see it, when everything in the press has pointed out that it is exactly the same as every other Judd Apatow produced movie?Frankly, nowt else on at the cinema that I could be bothered with. (Indy? ""Sex And The City""? Thank you, but No.)""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" again, is OK. Really it is. OK is good and better than not OK. Not a disaster, not a masterpiece, but OK and alright, and it does the job it sets out to do. Funny in parts, grossly rude in others. Some nice performances from Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and the UK's very own Russell Brand. Interesting to read that Russell Brand is generally considered to have stolen every scene in which he appears, when Brits will tell you that what he is doing is a watered down version of the standard shtick he has been using on British TV and radio since his UK breakthrough a couple of years back. Still, if it works, why not?""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" has done the expected business in the UK and the States and is a competent piece of comedy. Could be a lot worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
You won't want to be Forgetting this comedy,"Prior to the release of The 40 Year Old Virgin, it is likely that few people knew the name Judd Apatow. Now, just three years later, that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality, with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now, the Apatow steamroller moves forward with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and once again it has mined comedy gold, with lots of laughs, but also, as with many of the previous film's from Apatow's company, a nice streak of sweet romance to go along with the laughs.Fogetting Sarah Marshall focuses on Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), a Hollywood composer who's girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), is the star of a CSI-style police procedural series. Jason is a bit of a layabout (who also isn't afraid to walk around his apartment naked), and Sarah has decided she has had enough of him, so she is breaks up with Peter, leaving him in a seemingly unending pool of despair.To try to take his mind of Sarah, he takes an impromptu vacation to Hawaii, but quickly discovers, to his horror, that Sarah is also at the same hotel as him, with her new boyfriend, recently on the wagon British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). However, while doing his best to avoid Sarah, Peter finds himself falling for a hotel staff member, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis).As with such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy that isn't afraid to mine the more vulgar for comedy, nor does it shy away from some rather frank nudity, including plenty of footage of star Segel (who is also the screenwriter). The upside is that, unlike many other sophomoric comedies these days, the raunchier material actually produces laughs. Much of the film's best humor comes from Brand's performance as off the wall Snow. The character has lots of great scenes and lines, capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido.Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't just provide lots of laughs, it also features an involving and touching romance between Peter and Rachel. Both Segel and Kunis have a nice chemistry between them that fuels an involving romance. As the film progresses, we can't help but root for the characters to find themselves together in the end.In addition to the previously mentioned Brand, the cast of Forgetting Sarah Marshall gives us both great laughs and characters we can be involved with. Segel proves to be relatively low on insecurity as he puts himself almost completely on display (literally). His Peter is an character whose rather unassuming nature wins you over. Kristen Bell makes the films titular character at times apparently self-involved, but also someone who has a soft spot for her ex-boyfriend. Kunis' Rachel is a character that is both no-nonsense and full of sweetness.In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves to be another winner from ""Team Apatow"", and belongs right next to the previous hits from his creative team. If you are looking for both laughs and a dash of romance, look no further than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Bad,"Well, I didn't like it as much as everyone else here, but the movie was pretty good. It's refreshing to see an American film using the comedic value of the ridiculousness of male nudity. Naked woman? Beautiful. Naked man? Hilarious. Why? I don't know. That's just how it is.The film takes a cute look at American film script staples like betrayal, infidelity, male drama queens, brotherly love, celebrity worship, stupid TV shows, phony, pseudo-spiritual rock stars and vapid actresses, but is detached, ironic and hip enough to make it all work well. Worth the money.I have to add...Mila Kunis is beautiful. It's hard to tell on ""That 70s Show,"" but in this movie, her eyes and personality shine in a most hypnotic way.B+.

A pleasant surprise,"A relatively minor Apatow clan release, released in April without the sort of promotion and attention ""Knocked Up"", ""Superbad"", ""Pineapple Express"", etc. received, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a pleasant surprise, a consistently entertaining romantic comedy with several scenes of effective and realistic character-oriented drama.The film was written by star Jason Segel, who based much of the film on his relationship and breakup with ""Freaks and Geeks"" co-star Linda Cardellini. For a debut screenplay Segel's work is surprisingly strong as he clearly understands where and how to inject just enough dramatic realism into this comedy script. As with most comedies there are naturally several jokes which fall flat, but most of the humor is sharp and effective. Segel even managed to write a good part for annoying nitwit Russell Brand, granted the character is an... annoying nitwit, but a well-written one. Segel's screenplay succeeds mostly as a result of him being able to develop a cast of entertaining and interesting characters whose conversations feel genuine and are never boring.Director Nicholas Stoller handles the film very well, using the Hawaiian locations to optimal effect and keeping the film moving at a fast pace. The cast is incredible, Mila Kunis in particular is a revelation and anyone used to her from ""That 70's Show"" will be shocked but extremely taken by the depth and range of her performance. Kristen Bell is also much better than expected, and Segel is essentially playing himself yet again. He's good at playing himself.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" isn't perfect and several scenes just plain fall flat, but the end result is still an effective and involving romantic comedy/drama that marks a promising writing debut for Jason Segel.7.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Schlubby meets louche,"The Judd Apatow comedy machine has ground out another one. It's middling, not as sharp and on target as 41 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, or Superbad, but not as tiresome and lame as Dewey Cox and Drillbit Taylor. Again, the--for Apatow--seminal TV series ""Freaks and Geeks"" gets mined. (First-time director Stoller has co-authored some things with Apatow.) ""Freaks"" alumnus Jason Segel wrote and stars as TV composer Peter Bretter, dumped by girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter does the ""music"" (mostly just ominous sounds) for a sleazy crime series featuring Sarah. She's taken up with decadent (but clean and sober) English rock star Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, an outrageous Brit comic whose real life junkie confessions are a hoot. Brand takes us away from Apatow's limited world of fat Jewish boys trying to get laid with hot chicks. His Aldous Snow is a sleazy sex god and recovery guru and when he's on screen, things take a welcome new turn toward wit and absurdity.But that comes briefly, and later. We begin in Hollywood, where Sarah comes to see the couch potato Peter, who refuses to put on clothes to hear her breaking up speech. Despondent, Peter follows advice from his brother Brian (Bill Hader of Knocked Up and Superbad) and goes to Hawaii, where his waiter is Apatow warhorse Jonah Hill and his reefer-addled surf instructor is ""Friends"" and Apatow alum Paul Rudd. Who should be at Peter's hotel but Sarah and Aldous? With the questionable linchpin of this lame ""surprise,"" comedy, heartbreak, and resolution ensue.There are no jaw-breaking laughs. In fact the only things that kept me watching were the appeal of Segel--he's a giant, slightly overweight puppy dog--and the louche Brit pungently evoked by Russell Brand. As for the Hawaiian setting, Oahu may have been a fun place to shoot. The Apatow crew probably wanted out of Hollywood. But the Pacific is too soggy and pretty an environment for repartee. For a change, instead of female nakedness (oh, just a few bare breasts), Segel is frontally nude, repeatedly, but just for a split second each time.Apatow's posse is at home with male adolescence and early--or frozen--schlub-hood. But not with much else; the Apatow-sponsored features haven't managed to match the depth and breadth of their mother lode, ""Freaks and Gesks."" In the TV series, Segel got dumped by none other than Lindsey (Linda Cardellini), the lead character. None of the film comedies have come up with a female as smart, sensible, interesting, and central as Lindsay. Sarah is a pathetic sliver of humanity by comparison. Lindsey went out with Segel's ""Freaks"" persona Nick out of pity, and when he got too intense, she pulled away. His suffering was convincing, a little disturbing even. Her choice was wise. This sequence was less formulaic than Sarah Marshall. Nick, Segel's character in ""Freaks"" is rather arresting.Peter grows out of Nick but loses rather than gains depth in the updating. The exotic setting obviously doesn't compensate. Segel already had musical ambitions as Nick, who realizes he's no rock star. Peter hates his sellout TV composing and is working on a Dracula puppet opera--an odd curio performed in excerpt toward the end. As before, Segel's appealing as a would-be artist and a basically decent but weak fellow with his heart on his sleeve, but Nick had more emotional conviction than Peter.Sarah Marshall spends most of its time on well-trodden territory with hits predictable surprises, obtrusive local color, romance opportunities, and obligatory attempts at reconciliation. It does have laughs, but while Peter's new girlfriend Rachel (Mila Kunis) like him is basically a decent person, she mostly comes off as little more than a pretty face, and their relationship is never more than the stuff of sitcoms. In the end it seems that Segel's character lacks the complexity--or the energy--to sustain a whole movie, and he and Sarah are equally forgettable. _________________",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun Movie!,"I'm not a big fan of Judd Apatow and his recent crop of movies.That said, I got to see ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" April 11 at a preview screening with some friends, and I was impressed. It's a joke movie, but it has a story that pulls you along, and the jokes are outrageously funny. I nearly died laughing. It doesn't try to push the envelope of ""How immature and disgusting can we be?"", which was what I have come to expect from these sorts of movies. It's just funny actors doing a great job of telling a good story that most adults will relate to in some way.

"Not what I expected, but it has its moments","Maybe I just get too demanding when it comes to Judd Apatow productions, but ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is well, forgettable. It's not any worse than the average romantic comedy, but it's not much better either. Ten minutes in you know how the movie will end, which is bothersome because you expect Apatow's team to reinvent this genre at least a tiny bit. But nope, they just follow the same old tired formula everyone else uses. The comedy is pretty decent, but not perfect either. Jason Segel is fantastic in the lead and does great with the material he's got, but the supposedly hilarious secondary characters never really take off. Russell Brand is only funny for the first two scenes, then you've seen it. Jonah Hill is better, but there you have the opposite problem: he's underused. This movie just can't give you a break. The full frontal male nudity is also sort of a desperate attempt to be edgy, a really uninspired attempt to distinguish itself. I didn't hate ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", but it's no well, anything else Apatow has produced.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
And you thought *you* were sensitive...,"An amusing and sometimes awkward breakup film, this pic was written by and stars a long-time Apatow cohort, Jason Segel. The pic centers on lost, hypersensitive slacker Peter, who after being broken up with by his TV star girlfriend copes with its end poorly, eventually escaping to Hawaii where he subsequently books himself into a hotel that she is coincidentally staying at.Immediate warning to those sensitive to full frontal male nudity: it is present and more than once. That out of the way, the pic was pretty affable, containing more than a handful of good laughs as well as more than a lot of generally comically captured sex scenes. Many of the secondary characters also play enjoyably silly roles. And there is a funny musical component to the pic that also includes an amusing rendition of puppet-related works.I suppose I do have to level a little criticism for the theme being a little slight, but there still is something to be said for healing of personal wounds and learning to ""move on"". Those that have seen other Apatow relationship pics will probably see a number of similarities (slacker dude learns to grow up, gross out comedy, etc), even though Apatow didn't write or direct this piece. The film is also a bit on the long side, like many comedies that come from the Apatow crew and you do notice it. Some judicious trimming and relegating of some scenes (including numerous flashbacks) to DVD extras would've been helpful.Finally, I wish that more character could be drawn from both Sarah Marshall and Peter's newfound love interest, hotel employee Rachel as they played fairly two-dimensional, but I'm glad that Sarah didn't end up a one-note character as well. I didn't love the conclusion of the breakup story arc because I felt that it was a bit of a cop-out, but it didn't ruin the film. Lastly, Peter was written a little on the edge of believability in terms of being oversensitive, so you really have to buy his character, otherwise the film will break on you.Essentially, this is a congenial, enjoyable, but rude/crude film with a share of laughs and more Jason Segel than you probably ever wanted to see. Recommended for those who like some story with their laughs and can handle the vulgar, sexual, and nude content. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing wrong with being a solid film,"While nowhere near a Richard Curtis Romcom, it is definitely in the next bracket. It is help massively by a strong cast who all pour their heart and soul into it.

A hilarious Rom-com that feels refreshing that's also filled with lovable characters and great performances,"The whole story feels so refreshing and the characters are so beautifully written that you can't help but fall in love with them. There's these two big guys in the movie that are side characters but they ended up being my favorite with their distinct funny and lovable personalities. They're almost like Disney movie characters but for adults. You also can't help but fall in love with the setting as well since it takes place on Hawaii. The chemistry between actors is unmatched. It's like they're all on the same wavelength and can riff off each other with no problem. Everyone understands the assignment, even the side actors and extras, and it shows in their performances. It's kinda hard to describe the feeling you get from watching this movie, but I guess some words that help describe it are: feel-good, cozy, hilarious, sincere. Mila Kunis looks more beautiful than ever in this movie, it's like she's a goddess or something - she's glowing. If you haven't fallen in love with Mila Kunis yet, you definitely will in this movie. Kristen Bell gives a wonderful performance as well playing the sort of villain in the movie. She taps into her more sentimental dramatic side, without also neglecting her funny side, and it balances the rest of the comedy in the movie so well. Russell Brand is hilarious as the cool yet self-absorbed lothario singer. Jason Segel, who also wrote the movie, plays the heartbroken yet funny main character who ends up finding hope and moving on with the help of Mila's character.It's a well written rom-com movie that feels very refreshing with all of it's wonderful characters and hilarious moments.

The beginning is Full Frontal...Funny,"Jason Segel plays Peter a somewhat lazy musician who specializes in scoring tv shows. He's dating actress Sarah Marshall played by Kirsten Bell. Right in the beginning of the movie, she dumps him causing Peter to drop his towel and to show all of his goodies. I almost pee'd on myself from laughing so hard.Peter is heartbroken so he heads to Hawaii to get away but guess who is there? That's right Sarah Marshall and she's there with the guy she cheated on him with, rock star Aldous Snow (Russel Brand). Mila Kunis plays a front desk clerk that feels bad for Peter, gets him a great suite and tries to help get him out of his funk.

Watchable relaxed comedy with unnecessary nudity,"Overall its a relaxed, cool movie with subtle comedy. Is a good depiction of what not to do when a girl dumps you. I had few laughs here and there and overall its a nice chilled movie to play on the background when you are spending time with your friends or partner with some popcorn on your lap.The only thing I didn't like was unnecessary nudity. There are movie scenes where nudity is important. It changes the tone of the whole scene and makes it memorable. The scene won't be perfect if the actors were not naked.On the other end there are scenes were audience can say the director read the script and made notes """" add nude here"" and ""here"" and ""here"" for no apparent reasons. Personally, that's what I felt about those scenes.Overall, if you wanna watch it alone, its a good one time watch and you can save it in your collection to pop it back up if you are having a party and want the TV on.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe One or Two Laughs,"To be honest, I didn't think Forgetting Sarah Marshall was much better or worse than The Heartbreak Kid. I think I laughed during the pediatrician scene and one other part that I can't remember. The characters are just a collection of stereotypes...and they are not even up-to-date stereotypes! Surfers that have smoked themselves into a stupor are way eighties, dudes. I think Paul Rudd, whom I like, knew his character was just another variation of Spicoli and phones it in a little.A weepy Emo rocker or even an angry white rapper would've been more contemporary than a sex-obsessed British rock star. You would have to go back decades to find a musical artist that even remotely resembles him. They even miss chances to poke fun at real-life personalities. Sarah Marshall could have been one of those boozy ingénues that flash their privates as they get out of limos.Supporting characters are unnecessarily inserted into the story and eventually forgotten, but they don't even provide an excuse for a clever joke. There is a Christian couple on their honeymoon that are completely pointless and they lead to some of the worst gags in the movie. All you are left with is something that is going to potentially insult a large group of people and you didn't even get a single laugh out of it. Jonah Hill and his infatuation with the rock star goes nowhere and is not particularly funny. The other characters have become all-too-familiar in a romantic comedy. The too-good-to-be-true romantic interest. The henpecked husband and friend of the hero. Et cetera.There was a stand-up comedian on the talk show circuit a few years back who would make a joke about how people will get tattoos of symbols in foreign languages that have no meaning, like the Japanese kanji for ""water."" They shoehorn the joke into the film by having it spoken by an airhead who is suddenly translating tattoos in other languages. Maybe Carlos Mencia contributed to the movie?When Judd Apatow produced a good comedy show, ""Freaks & Geeks,"" it was largely ignored by the public and was quickly canceled after one season. When he started appealing to the lowest common denominator, the same people were suddenly his biggest fans and praised him. You start to see why ""That 70's Show"" lasted 8 seasons and why ""Two and a Half Men"" is entering its sixth. Meanwhile, ""Arrested Development"" barely makes it to 3.Almost every opportunity and set-up the movie has to do something clever, they take the easy and predictable route. I was actually surprised by how many of the jokes were just plain cheesy. The only thing you can say in defense of such a shallow movie is that it is comparatively better than Disaster Movie or Good Luck Chuck, but that should not impress anyone. You would almost have to be trying to make a worse comedy than those. It is like when people orgasm because gas prices fall a little, but they are still paying more than they should. People are becoming conditioned to bad comedy.And, yes, there is a token ethnic guy.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Puppets,"This has jokes that often work. It has a genuine pathos that is surprisingly rare and is now the trademark of Apatow productions.It has Hawaii and two women, one pretty the other a beauty. It has a deftly comic foil in the ""other boyfriend."" It has some frontal male nudity that probably should be commended simply because its avoidance is ridiculous. Here, in fact, we have it twice and though it is meant to punch up those scenes, I found that it actually was dramatically integrated.But because I am a narrative folding nut, I'll point out the three inner performance folds. The girlfriend is a TeeVee star on a show for which our hero writes music. Her inner role reflects on her outer one.The other boyfriend is a British rock star, whose onstage persona is mirrored in his character in the film. And the thing ends with the hero's play within the play. In this case it is an extremely clever musical comedy derived from Dracula and performed by a mix of puppets, humans in costume and the participating puppetmasters. It is really quite wonderful by itself and after the story ends, it is clear how the whole project grew out of it. The integration of the idea of a love that ""smothers"" is brilliant.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good Character Writing,"Peter (Jason Segel) composes music for a television series. Sarah (Kristen Bell) stars on that show. They have been a couple for more than five years.

In an effort to get away from everything that reminds him or her, he goes to Hawaii for a vacation---where he finds her also vacationing.Jason Segel wrote this adult comedy. He's a very talented guy. This script is not groundbreaking, but it presents interesting characters in amusing situations. Kristen Bell is stunning in this film, making it easy to understand Peter's obsession with her. The script gives her plenty of scenes to chew on. Russell Brand plays the part of the guy you would least like to see your ex with.

Absolutely hilarious,"The movie is absolutely hilarious. I loved it. It met and exceeded by (very high) expectations. Jason Segall proved he can hold down a leading role and an extremely funny script. Part of the reason this movie is so funny are the ""funny 'cause it's true"" aspects of Peter's method of dealing with his breakup. Although the honeymooner's plot was a little unnecessary, everything else was great. All the characters were really funny and the dialogue and situations were hilarious. Definitely worth paying for to see in the theaters and watching it with everyone else around you busting out laughing as well is a worthy experience too.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An amiable romantic comedy.,"Writer / star Jason Segel here gives himself a plum part as Peter Bretter, a composer who wastes his time doing music for a cheesy TV series. He was dating the female star of the series, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), but she has dumped him in favour of a tragically hip rock star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). In order to try to get over the breakup, he takes a vacation to Hawaii - only to realize that Sarah & Aldous will be staying at the same hotel. The balance of Segels' story has him becoming attracted to the friendly hotel desk clerk (Mila Kunis), while doing his best to move on with his life.The characters become more endearing as the story plays out, in what is typical but engaging fare for the Judd Apatow company. It has its fair share of raunchy gags (Segel, a braver man than I, actually opens and closes the film with some full frontal nudity) and silly moments. But, for the most part, it actually takes the tale fairly seriously, making its characters flawed and recognizably human, but still appealing, and not total cartoon caricatures. It seems to be built on a somewhat formulaic foundation, but at least it keeps its viewers watching and attentive.Granted, a big part of the appeal is some gorgeous on-location shooting in Hawaii, which adds an exotic enticement to the proceedings. Along the way, there are some hilarious digs at 'C.S.I.' and David Caruso, and some priceless musical moments - ""Dracula's Lament"", ""We've Got to Do Something"", etc. And the gags continue during the closing credits, as one more shot is fired - this time, at 'Ghost Whisperer'.Segel acquits himself nicely in the lead, but then so do many of the cast members. Bell and Kunis also look absolutely ravishing, needless to say. Brand is a hoot as the self-absorbed Snow. Co-stars include Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Liz Cackowski, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Da'Vone McDonald. The cameos in the TV-shows-within-the-film are a hoot. What's nice is that so many people here get a chance in the spotlight, with Segel and director Nicholas Stoller giving them some effective comic moments.In general, this is not a genre that this viewer actively seeks out, but he heard some good word of mouth on this one, and he was glad that he gave it a try.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly funny,"To be completely honest, I went into this movie expecting to thoroughly trash it as soon as I walked out. I thought it was destined to be another cheesy rom-com with a predictable ending and terrible acting. I was wrong. Little did I know, this was another Judd Apatow produced comedy, and almost everything he's touched over the past three years has turned into pure gold, including ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"". ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is no exception.Jason Segal of ""How I Met your Mother"" fame, stars as a lovable but lazy music composer for a CSI-esque television drama. After his famous girlfriend (Kristen Bell) dumps him, he decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to deal with it. Little does he know, that his ex-girlfriend is travelling to the same resort as him – with her new overly-flamboyant musician boyfriend in tow (Russell Brand.) Mila Kunis (""That 70's Show"") plays a receptionist at the resort, and proves she can actually play a likable role. Kunis has great chemistry with Segal, and their budding relationship is surprisingly one of the highlights of the movie.The script, which was also written by Segal, is consistently funny throughout, and really hones in on the hilarious one liners and awkward situational humor that seem to be the strength of most Apatow movies. Segal has definitely elevated himself into a solid comic lead. You can't help but feel bad for the guy as things gradually go from bad to worse for him. That said, Russell Brand, who plays eccentric musician Aldous Snow, steals every scene he's in. He plays a character in which the viewer is supposed to dislike, but it's virtually impossible. Everything he does, from his words, to his facial expressions, to his ridiculous body language, is hilarious.Now I may only be high on this movie because I had exceptionally low expectations going in, but it's definitely a solid comedy from start to finish. With the exception of having to see Segal's junk at least six or seven times, it was a gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining romcom marred by incongruent porn-ish elements,"RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Nicholas Stoller, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a romcom starring Jason Segel as Peter, a genial musician from Los Angeles who composes music for a popular detective show, which stars his hottie girlfriend, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). After she breaks up with him he vacations at a resort in Hawaii where, unexpectedly, his ex & her rock star beau (Russell Brand) also happen to be staying. Mila Kunis plays a concierge at the resort who takes interest in Peter.This is a compelling, amusing romantic comedy with Segel likable as the protagonist and Bell winsome and charismatic as his ex. Brand is great as a Jim Morrison-like rock god who doesn't drink; the way he performs on stage is laugh-out-loud funny (poking fun at rock stars). The resort locations are a highlight and the story is sprinkled with several notable guest stars (Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Da'Vone McDonald, Jonah Hill, etc.).Unfortunately, there are several NC-17 (aka porn-ish) scenes that I wasn't expecting since the version I watched was supposedly rated 'R.' I'm talking about several scenes of simulated sex, including one involving fellatio, as well as full-frontal male nudity right out of the gate (Seriously?). I basically ignored these scenes or rolled with them and laughed. I'm sharing this info for those who don't care to see a movie mixed with nigh-porn elements.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, as well as studio work done at Universal City, CA.

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the best comedy of the year so far, and maybe the best movie, period.","I just went to an advance screening of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and it is just as funny as 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. Jason Segel has crafted a screenplay that could have easily disintegrated into an over-the-top, unbelievable, and lowbrow comedy. Instead, all of its characters are believable and, more importantly, we really care about them and their feelings.If you cant tell from the other Apatow & Crew movies, these guys can act with the best of them. If there has ever been a time for the Academy Awards to start acknowledging comedies as just as good as Dramas, it is now, in the time of Apatow. Yes the comedy is as filthy as ever, but the acting is just as good as almost any drama out there. I would even say that comedy is harder than Drama in that it is incredibly hard to craft characters that you feel for and believe while still being funny. Apatow and his friends are the kings of it. It was evident in ""Freaks and Geeks"" and it has only gotten better now.Jason Segel is great and you feel for his character immensely. Kristen Bell plays her part as the heartbreaker ex-girlfriend pitch perfectly. At times her character, without giving too much away, is semi-tragic. Mila Kunis completely makes us forget about her days as the dumb hottie on ""That 70's Show"" and makes us fall in love with her character along with Peter. Russell Brand has the toughest job playing the ridiculous parody of a British rocker. At times he is a bit over-the-top but he gets some of the biggest laughs in the movie while retaining a bit of believability.The supporting characters are just as good as they have been in every other Apatow movie. Bill Hader, while I liked him more in Superbad, gets some big laughs as the brother who wants Peter to get over Sarah. Jonah Hill gets some huge laughs as the hotel employee who has a man crush on the British rocker. Paul Rudd is one of the best comic minds of our time and he is as funny as ever as Chuck/Kunu the hotel's surf instructor.The writing and directing are both top-notch as well.If there is anything bad I can say about it, is that some of the editing jumps around suddenly and sometimes some scenes seem a bit out of place. Also there is a scene where a boom gets in the shot. There are a few continuity issues (towels on shoulders disappearing and drinks in and out of peoples hands) but those are to be expected.Do not miss this movie it is the best movie so far this year!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Forgetting this movie!,"I gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. What a waste of time... The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that also is pretty passé. I couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Uninspired, Unoriginal and Unrelatable","I saw this because I became a Jason Segel fan after watching every episode Freaks and Geeks but this movie was utter garbage. The comedy value, the most important aspect of a film like this, was awful as I chuckled only twice at the dork on his honeymoon that looked like Tom Cruise who was just so pathetic, I laughed at his attempts of humor out of sympathy. Otherwise, the lame jokes, one liners, the occasional inappropriate swearing (which can be funny if done right) and overall script was either done before or just stupid.Speaking of done before, this has to be one of the most cliché and predictable story lines of all time except this was one of the worst. I really liked the Heartbreak Kid, my Super Ex Girlfriend and The Break Up because they were somewhat fresh approaches to an all too familiar theme (yes, I know The Heartbreak Kid is a remake) while Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a dull variation of each of these movies. I wanted to walk out about an hour and 10 minutes into it but I wanted to see if it had a surprise and redeemable ending causing all the fuss. Well, to make a long story short, it turned out exactly the way anyone could have expected despite there being a hint that it might go in a different direction.Finally, I don't think it's fair or important to really judge the acting performances in this movie because the film I watched before this was The Assassination of Richard Nixon in which the acting was top notch while this peaked at about par for an episode of That 70s show. But what really did bother me was how implausible this whole situation would have been if Peter was an everyman instead of a fairly talented musician with a bit of celebrity status. Segel's personality was not very charming nor could he be physically attractive to beautiful women like Sarah or Rachel unless he had that going for him - and I thought the romance between Scotty and Judy in Vertigo was far fetched because of their huge age difference which now seems reasonable compared. This also had a lot to do with the inadequate development and poor script but put Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn or Luke Wilson in Segel's place and it would be a lot more convincing even playing a relatable regular guy as they did in their movies. I don't know, maybe that was the intention here but I didn't like it.So those are my three biggest complaints of this truly overrated and just plain bad movie I really wanted to like, so take it for what it's worth. Judging by the amount of laughter, I know many more people at the theater enjoyed it more than I did but I'd be surprised if anybody would say it was that great judging by the long pauses between the few collective laughs. In conclusion, I don't recommend even wasting your time watching the DVD if you have any taste.",,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic movie,"OK, what could be worse than being dumped by your incredibly beautiful girlfriend? How about being totally nude while you are being dumped by your (fully clothed) beautiful girlfriend? (Congrats to Jason Segel for having the guts to do so much frontal nudity. The ""dump"" scene just wouldn't have had the same effect without it!)I don't want to give anything away but, believe me, our hero's predicament doesn't improve at all afterwards either. My wife's comment was best, I think. She said, ""I don't know whether to fall on the floor laughing or cry for that poor guy."" The film manages to make you feel sorry for the guy while laughing your head off at the same time. The film certainly doesn't shy away from adult humor but it is used intelligently -- the film is not just dirty for the sake of being dirty.This is one film my wife and I will be buying immediately when it hits DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll equalize youForgetting Sarah Marshall,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall had all the potential to fall into one of two camps: unbridled raunchy fun a la 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad or sentimentality masked as comedy like Knocked Up. I had all the fear that it would hit the latter taking the sensitive guy with the broken heart too far into romance territory, letting the laughs fall by the wayside once the conclusion comes along. Thankfully, though, while the train took some turns down that path, writer/star Jason Segel knew what he was doing and threw in a curveball joke to right the ship at each instance. Rather than attempt to be two kinds of films at once, I believe this was a true hybrid of the two sides of the Apatow machine. You will not be free from laughter for long stretches here as the balance between big laughs and sappy melodrama is always tempered by subtle jabs, fantastic one-liners, and a crew of really likable actors having fun.This film also shows society a lesson on human anatomy. It is quite interesting how different reactions nudity can elicit depending on the sex of the person exposed. If the audience sees breasts on screen they get quiet as they are watching what is probably a love scene. However, once you get male genitalia in frame, everyoneand I mean everyonecannot stop themselves from laughing. Let's just say there are a lot of laughs of this fashion, so if that may detract you from seeing the film, be warned, but really it is only used to add one more layer of absurdity to seemingly tired situations and in my opinion works brilliantly. One has to respect this clan of artists under Apatow's wing for pushing boundaries and being willing to go for the joke without a second thought. It's one thing to be sexual and explicit just to say you are, it's another to use it in order to enhance the plot and the scene, sticking to your vision and not straying unnecessarily.What really becomes apparent is how these guys have found a way to understand today's comedy and their ability to turn a common, simple plot structure into something fresh and entertaining. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get away only to find that his safe haven is also where she is with her new boyfriend (wow haven't seen that before), guy falls for new girl while old girl realizes how stupid she was, and the end is the end (not to spoil anything directly, but I'm sure you can figure it out). It is all in the details and the gaps between the lines where the true genius manifests itself. Segel has joined Apatow and Seth Rogen in their ability to make a laugh-a-minute riot with a complete story and not simply a string of gags loosely jumbled together. Don't get me wrong, there are many gags and I'm sure many moments that were thought of previously and added to the script where they fit, but that is the thing, they all fit like a glove. It can't be easy to weave together a Dracula rock opera, complete with huge payoff at the end; a pig roast, (""Don't make me do thisI'm sorry!""); a sexually inexperienced newly wed couple; the wonderful features on new Mac computers; and the secret to good surfing technique, (""No, too much movement, do nothingnow stand""), but Segel deftly does the job.As for the players, I will admit to knowing little to nothing about all the principals. Segel is great in this role, but that should be no surprise since he wrote the part for himself based on real-life experiences, (if it's true that the breakup scene while naked actually happened to him, kudos for letting a situation like that be permanently etched onto celluloid). As for the women, both Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis do well attempting to break free from their TV show pasts. I'm not a big fan of Bell at all, but she is perfect in this role as the somewhat bitchy celebrity unaware of how vain she is. Maybe my somewhat undeserved hostility towards her made it feel that much more real. As for Kunis, I was completely surprised by how likable she was. Even when she snaps at one point into a curse-laced tirade, she is still the cutest thing in the world. Also, her chemistry with Segel is completely believablethe attraction through minds and sensibilities as the two are kindred souls finding exactly what they need from each other. The real surprise, though, is Brit Russell Brand. This guy owns each of his scenes with a self-effacing role of utter rockstar stupidity, played absolutely straight. He portrays the cool guy swagger to perfection and mixes in the awkward doltish sensibilities most stereotype his kind with. Segel's interaction with him on the ocean is the best example of how out there this guy is, yet when it comes to music he really does know what he is doing (regardless of his laughable songs).It is not going to be a comedy classic like Virgin, but it also won't be thrown aside as a failed attempt to give a rom-com broad comedic appeal like Knocked Up is with me. Instead it walks the line with a few missteps crossing other both ways. Each time it goes astray, in either direction, it finds it's footing quickly to right the scale. With the help of cameos from Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, and Davon McDonald, one can't languish in the sentimentality for too long because those crazy characters won't let you. Forgetting Sarah Marshall delivers on the Apatow name and shows that Jason Segel shouldn't be relegated to only standing in Seth Rogen's shadow; he may be able to cast his own soon enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Kristen Bell was born on July 18th, 1980","This film was one of those early comedies of the 21st century, that helped to contribute to what the style of a good, modern day comedy in film, looks like. What comedy is like in films today doesn't represent the smart edge, that comedy had for 50 years previously. What is missing today is the smart comedy, expressing strategically placed shots at politics, cultural inadequacies, light hearted human frailties or just being silly. This could be done with physical comedy or well crafted jokes, that a comedian would write. It seems like the comedies of today just rely on cheap sexual jokes or potty humor just to get easy laughs. However, there are also good sex-comedies, that are funny while they make fun of relationship woes and the sex itself. This is one of those 21st century, comedy films that rises above the cheap jokes and actually tells a humorous story about the pains of relationships, as well as, loss and gain, but in a hilarious fashion.The film revolves around the break-up ramifications of a TV music composer, Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), who ends up taking his break-up vacation at the same tropical island, that his ex-girlfriend, actress and TV personality Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) and her new boyfriend, entertainment personality, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), are now venturing at. Add in Mila Kunis, as the abnormally helpful hotel desk clerk and you have a mixture of great jokes, clever dialogue and satirical sex scenes in an entertaining comedy. It also helps that an excellent, supporting cast, consisting of names like Jonah Hill, Bill Hader and the great Paul Rudd, keep the laughs coming.

Good laughs!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my girlfriend. Segal has the hurt puppy dog character down pat and he put it to good use in a movie that revolves around it.I am a huge Kristen Bell fan and she certainly brought her A game. Kunis, also smokin hot, really knocked her role out of the park as well.Why no 9 or 10 star rating? The overused male full frontal nudity. It's become a disappointing trend in recent movies. You really don't need that sort of shock comedy with material this strong. Plus it's a bit annoying to have two absolutely gorgeous women as Bell and Kunis and the best we get is a bathroom photo and some bikini time. Seriously disappointed in that. I'm sure your target audience is males in the 18-40 category. Think about it! You don't have to go all porkys on us, but a few T & A shots of these two girls would have gotten you those two extra stars. Much like the birthing shot in Knocked up.

Forgettable Sarah Marshall,"The writer/star of FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, Jason Segel, is the kind of artist who isn't afraid to let it all hang out there for everyone to see and subsequently appreciate or pick apart. He writes his pain on to the screen and isn't afraid to get naked on the path to true understanding. In the writer's world, naked is a fairly obvious metaphor for vulnerability but here it just means nude. And so, as Segal's penis flaps back and forth against his painfully pale body, moments before Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) breaks up with him, the Judd Apatow movie machine unleashes its latest raw comedy from the mind of the modern male.This particular male is Peter Bretter (Segel), a slob who can barely pick up after himself but somehow manages to maintain a serious relationship with a gorgeous actress girlfriend and holds down a job as a composer for schlock television. He's not unattractive nor without his charms but he does raise the question as to how he ever managed to get himself this well positioned. He also has no trouble at all finding numerous beautiful women to help him take his mind off Sarah. And while forgetting Sarah Marshall proves much more complicated than Peter had hoped - it doesn't help that they have found themselves both at the same Hawaiian resort  he can at least have the last laugh by vilifying her as a horrible human being before the credits role. Without giving too much away, he will have the option, as the sympathetic character, to walk away happy but Sarah, as the heartbreaker, has been doomed since Hester Prynne was sent to prison with that darn scarlet letter across her chest.If I were Apatow, I would be a little tired of hearing my name being attached to all of these projects. If anything, he should make sure to have a firmer hand in the process in the future. FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not without the hilarity and genuine character development that his past productions have captured so poignantly but its bizarre subplots and many rushed moments make it somewhat forgettable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's just one of those movies,You know how some movies are so stupid and dumb they're also great?Forgetting Sarah Marshall is kind of like that. I laughed a lot.Also Jonah Hill is in this and I'm a big Jonah Hill fan. Everyone should be.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie with a good heart... but just too scatter-shot to recommend,"The premise should be familiar to anyone reading this, but just for the sake of being thorough: A television music composer, Peter Bretter (Segal) gets dumped by his longtime TV star girlfriend (Kristin Bell). This break-up is completely unexpected to Peter and in an effort to get over his failed relationship, he inexplicably winds up vacationing in the same Hawaiin resort as his ex and her new love interest. All is not lost for Peter, as an attractive employee at the resort might just be just what he needed.Typical of most movies from the Apatow stable, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is somewhat crippled by a script that just can't decide what it wants to do... and ultimately throws everything up on the screen hoping that it all sticks. There is a story here that just about anybody who has ever been dumped can easily relate to, it's just too bad that the gloriously simple premise is under-minded by pointless cameos and subplots and general meanderings that hurt the pace while returning far few laughs. Even setting aside the Apatow stable of recurring actors, there are still a lot of scenes that just don't really go anywhere apart from giving Segal somebody new to talk to.. a bartender here, a chef there... Sometimes these scenes lead to a laugh and sometimes they don't... but they always succeed in making the movie feel somewhat aimless and confused. A few seconds later, and Peter is back in his room crying over Sarah. The editing and pacing is just all over the map.First time screenwriter and leading man Segal does an admirable job when he sticks to the basics of his universal premise. Granted, the setup is nothing short of dumbfounding... As somehow he winds up at the same resort as his ex, and for reasons that nobody will ever properly explain, manages to score the best room in the place for free... but that is all a minor nitpick once the movie gets rolling. When the wheels really come off the train is when the usual stable of Apatow cronies elbow their way into unwarranted screen time. Paul Rudd and Johan Hill do little to justify their presence. I have nothing against those two in particular, and they have both done great work in other works from the Apatow posse... but here, they just distract from what could have been a much more well honed piece of work.When the movie stays on point, you have a pretty respectable romantic comedy / breakup movie. Segal isn't going to be quitting his sitcom actor day job anytime soon, but he acquits himself pretty well in the leading role. His character is generally pathetic and self-loathing, but always in a ""lovable loser"" type of way that manages to keep the audience rooting for him despite the mess that he should only blame on himself. Kristen Bell frequently rises above the material, especially later in the film, giving what could be a typical ""cheating ex"" cliché of a character some decent depth. Mila Kunis is also surprising as the new love interest for Peter, as she shows some true chops that should make you forget about any ""That 70's Show"" typecasting. Last but not least is Russell Brand as ""the other man"". His character was so ripe for overdone parody, it's a credit to Brand that he pulled it off with such wonderful subtlety. With the few exceptions when he is actually performing his ""music"", he steals many scenes without ever appearing to try.Overall, there is an enjoyable movie wedged in here... It's just too bad that it's so scatter-shot in it's execution. A solid 20 minutes of runtime could have gone to the cutting room floor and the pacing in general could have been much tighter. I had a good enough time seeing this one, as it did feature a decent chunk of legitimate laughs. It's just too bad that the days of a concise, character-driven comedy seem to be a thing of the past. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a lot going for it, but ultimately it's bloated running time and odd pacing make it a less enjoyable viewing than it could have been.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

absolute to sh!,"I endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst films I have ever sat through. I am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. The acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny film I cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. Check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. Come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breaking up really IS hard to do...,"...and for Peter Bretter(Jason Segel,also the screenwriter),it proves to be something akin to a test of his spirit and willpower.Much of the Judd Apatow stable of actors fills out the scenery and situations,the action mostly taking place on the scenic island of Oahu as the lonely,mopey hero of the film seems to be vainly trying to get over his ex of the title(Kristen Bell,tough to forget),a sexy but somewhat shallow and ultimately selfish TV actress and co-star of a CSI type drama. Of course,it only seems news to Peter that the tropical getaway he chooses to escape to was introduced to him BY the girl he's trying to forget,so his incidental bump-in(?!) with her,avec new boyfriend(Russell Brand,stealing this movie),a drippy,sleazy self-important British pop star. But just as his existential dilemma seems to be reaching critical bleakness,Peter trips into the lovely and mildly interested eyes of the pretty hotel desk clerk/concierge(Mila Kunis,completely 360 from her ""That '70s Show"" character).As per any film from the Apatow company,there is more than plenty of indelicate relationship/sexual material. While the plot and character transformations take their own sweet time,it's still a mostly fun ride. Plenty of choice supporting players that include a truly repressed Christian newlywed couple(Jack McBrayer and Maira Thayer,fantastic!),a man-crushing Maitre-d(Jonah Hill making the best of a throwaway role)who aspires to be a star musician much like Brand's character,a bad-ass bartender,a low-key native party organizer and a surfer dude who's got permanent stupid(Paul Rudd in what is a hilarious somewhat inflated cameo).NIcholas Stoller directs what could just as well be a ""ghost directing"" job for Mr.Apatow,as the wisecracks,naughty material and relationships seem to be grafted straight from such stuff as 40-year old Virgin or Knocked Up. A mildly painful watch for anyone who's been devastated by a break-up,this is still pleasantly raunchy, good-natured and not a waste of about two hours of time. Good fun!",,Anonymous,Romance
Lacks the big moments.....not the kind of raunchy that most men enjoy,"I've seen more Adult comedies than most people.There are certain things people like me expect from such movies.1) gratuitous female nudity/ non nude titillation.2) A reasonable script which can even be based on regular events like parties, vacations, college life.3)Hot chicks.4) At least one thing about the movie being big, be it a premise or a scene or even a dialogue.Luckily there are many of us out there who share similar tastes and there is a steady state movies that fit the above which get released year after year.Every once in a while there comes a movie that most of the above but tries to something more.....and sometimes it doesn't really do much for the film.This film is all about Jason, to the point that you just don't want to see him anymore. Lets face it he just doesn't have it yet for us to see so much of him....literally.Which bring us to the other talking point of this film, male nudity, it probably served it purpose to create the stir that it was supposed to create , but when you see it in the context of the film, it really seems totally unnecessary, especially towards the end when it actually turns redundant to the point of annoying. When you couple that with the lack of titillating scenes involving females the disappointment starts knocking of stars.The other thing about this movie is the lack of the BIG, even the most regular adult comedies will have a premise or a dialogue or a scene which will remain in your memory for years to come and this movie just doesn't have them.But this movie does have what you will expect from its Apatowish cast.Well written characters and script (loved Russell brand).Witty if not hilarious dialogue.Elements of the hopeless romantic (its more rom com than adult comedy).Decent Acting all around.It just doesn't have what it takes to be above good despite what the ratings suggest.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should be considered a Classic,"Top notch hilarious screenplay, relatable characters, layered story, and a gorgeous tropical backdrop. 
Once every 4-5 years Hollywood makes a comedy that is thouroughly enjoyable upon the first viewing and actually becomes more enjoyable with every viewing. 
Rather than giving an overview of the plot as I'm sure there are many other reviews for that, I'll discuss why I believe Forgetting Sarah Marshall deserves to be considered a classic Hollywood comedy.
The first strength of FSM is in the character depth, complexity, and rawness. 
Jason Segel Portrays a deeply depressed and conflicted man who believes his recent break up (he was dumped) is the reason for his depression, but as the movie progresses, it becomes clear he was already unhappy in the relationship. As fate would have it the ex lovers end up at the same vacation resort and the story unfolds from there. 
The movie is FULL of top notch comedic character actors playing in supporting roles. Highlights include Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and my personal favorite Jack McBrayer. Kristin Bell is solid and Mila Kunis is glowing in her role as the beautiful new potential romantic partner. The casting of Russell Brand as the aloof Brit Rocker is simply stellar. 
The Hawaiin location adds amazing flavor and culture to the backdrop of the film, bringing in some great locals to tie the scenery and story together.
As the film progresses, every actor gets a chance to shine. There are a countless number of classic one liners in the film.
A raw and hilarious beginning, tons of hilarious situations, and a satisfying ending make for a classic comedy worth watching again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
All of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of memorable laughs,"While the melding of genuine human interplay, romantic comedy tropes and obnoxious male directed humour has seldom proved an easy course to navigate, with many such efforts leaning too strongly on one aspect at the risk of compromising the others, recent comedy superstar Judd Apatow proved particularly deft at manoeuvring the balance between them. Striking a particular chord of vulgar, bawdy humour and sweet sentiment, the unusual balance has recently become almost a subgenre in itself, permeating the recent comedy mainstream. As such, Forgetting Sarah Marshall (which Apatow produced) aims to keep a good thing going, striving for the same unique hybrid which past hits such as Knocked Up and Superbad championed. However, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, try as it might, cannot help but pale in the shadow of its predecessors, offering all of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of exceptional laughs.Which is not to say the film has nothing to offer comedically, but rather than the memorable factor of it is essentially reduced to two bookending setpieces: the much hyped naked break-up which proves the catalyst setting the plot in motion, and an inspired climax far too good to give away but which proves the indisputable high point of the film. It is the content in the middle which lags, with well intentioned gags such as mopey protagonist Peter (Segel) attempting to overcome his sorrows post break-up through a series of one night stands (though an exceptionally funny montage sequence proves a standout), and eventually fleeing to Hawaii only to find his celebrity ex-girlfriend (Bell) also vacationing there with her new beau (Brand). While the premise offers a tantalising wealth of comedic potential, the execution is less satisfying, with many gags being overly drawn out or overdone to the point of the comedy waning, despite the occasional standout laugh.It hardly helps when the film becomes drenched in sentiment and a groan-worthy moral of striving for one's dreams being battered over the audiences' collective heads and falls prey to the typical Apatow pitfall of feeling 10-20 minutes overlong. Similarly, director Nicholas Stoller never appears to have an entirely firm grasp of how to treat his protagonist, both at times milking pathos and viewer sympathies from Peter's predicament while otherwise portraying him as weak and pathetic and extracting cruel laughs from his moping, making it more difficult to empathise with the protagonist. Granted, such a dualistic approach does accurately convey the mix of of sympathy and annoyance towards those struggling after a break-up, but a more balanced and cohesive portrayal would have made empathy with the protagonist all the more possible and appealing. However, such a double-edged complaint also mirrors one of the film's foremost strength: the authenticity and credibility of its human interactions. Scripted by star Jason Segel, the characters and their interaction with one another ring laudably true, making the film easily a sufficiently charming and amusing way to spend the time, if not as riotously funny as it feels it should be.One of the later performers to join the pantheon of ""flawed, schlubbish yet earnestly lovable"" Apatow heroes, Jason Segel easily exudes easily enough charm to carry the occasionally shaky film, delivering a performance which feels both honest and irreverently silly enough to easily justify his upgrading to leading man. Mila Kunis similarly boasts a unique charm which manages to encompass being both abrasive and tender, making the romantic tension between her and Segel all the more fresh and enticing. Kristen Bell, despite struggling with an underwritten character as Peter's actress ex-girlfriend manages to bring a refreshing honesty to her performance, thankfully defying an easy stereotype to fall into. Similarly, Russell Brant raises several laughs as her spacey, pretentious new age rocker boyfriend, an essential spark of vibrant comedic life which always serves to benefit the picture. The same goes for Apatow stalwarts Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, both making hilarious use of minuscule supporting parts as an obsessive waiter and brain-dead surfing instructor respectively.Occasionally clunky and overly syrupy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall remains sweet and likable enough throughout to make it worth its while, though it suffers by comparison to its superior Apatow production predecessors. Nonetheless, what it lacks in belly laughs, the film makes up for in heart, making it an enjoyable if slightly forgetful film worth seeing for any fans of the genre.-6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Might go down as one of my all time favorite comedies,"As a huge fan of the show How I Met Your Mother, I felt it was only appropriate that I watch Jason Segel act in one of his biggest movie roles. And man, it did not disappoint whatsoever.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very raunchy and kinda silly romantic comedy. I felt like it was one of the most genuinely funny romcoms that I had ever seen. Every character (except Sarah, i laughed AT her situation though) was very funny in their own way. It was definitely not family friendly and was fairly immature humor, but that's what I love.The thing that shined the most for me was the character development amongst 4 different main characters. I really loved the relatability and silliness of Jason Segel's character (Peter). I loved Mila Kunis' character (Rachel) the most, her character was so nice and charming and beautiful and meshed so well with Peter. Russell Brand's character (Aldous) was very funny and so nonchalant about everything, he added a great dynamic to the movie. Lastly, Kristen Bell's character (Sarah Marshall) was the huge driving force behind the plot, made out to be basically be a manipulative psycho by the end of the movie. Her character was unlikable but was very much necessary to be this way for the plot to work, obviously.All in all, this movie combined elements of romance and comedy in a relatively fresh way. The character development was on point, its plot was complex but not hard to follow, and it was super funny. Great movie, potentially one of my favorite comedies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"Written by and starring a very naked Jason Segel, I thought this film would be incredibly easy to identify with, given that it dealt with a man who didn't see his breakup with his hot girlfriend coming in close on the horizon, until the very last minute. Starring as musician Peter Bretter, his relationship with the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) came to an unexpected end with her cheating on him and moving on with new beau, rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).And for the most parts initially, it was easy to identify with, really, what with his failure to accept reality, and his brooding and incessant whining to friends and family, which are primarily set up for laughs. But the best bits of the comedic aspects of the story were included in the trailer, leaving only but the bland and tired one liners in the movie that failed to elicit laughter. You can almost predict how scenes are engineered toward a certain punchline, and that expectation drew away any semblance of a genuine ha-ha. The usual pop cultural references were just there, but gone are the honestly sincere approach at making a mickey out of them.So what did Forgetting Sarah Marshall really get at? It was actually more of a classic romantic story instead, and brings to the screen very vividly, relationship challenges and issues in today's world, coupled with basic bugbears like Expectations. In a Hawaii getaway, nothing's worse than spending a vacation alone in a romantic location and bumping into your ex with her new beau in tow, living in the, horrors, next room. But Peter's luck took a change with the opportunity presented in a pretty hotel staff Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), who in movie land would be single and available and just about finds him attractive in a certain way too. So here the dynamics get set up as we play observers to two pairs of relationships in parallel - one where sex rules above all, the other just budding with almost everything being fine and dandy.Until of course one looks back constantly over the shoulder at what was, and almost always start to appreciate things that once were. While it's always easy to do that and mope, it takes a lot of strength to be able to say no, and move on. We take comfort in the things tried and tested and sometimes lack the courage to venture out and take on life's challenges head on, but have to realize that moments that are past should stay buried in the past, and not forgo and give up opportunities to start afresh. And when you do, treasure it, and not be a dick. What I truly enjoyed in the movie, is how perceptions of oneself are likely to be skewed, where in many scenes we may sympathize with certain characters for being receiving the short end of the stick. But like how it takes two hands to clap, we're also presented the larger picture through revealing flashbacks, and realize that hey, sometimes we are selfish to always think about ME, and fail to see things from the other person's perspective, especially of loved ones whom we tend to lapse into taking for granted.Never mind if supporting cast from the Apatow Clan like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill are here to lend comedic support to the film. Forgetting Sarah Marshall triumphs for its earnest reminder about the basic things that make a relationship, and the easiest ways to break one stemming from complacency and the lack of honesty.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

More of a romance than a comedy.,"The Apatow group makes another film which by the way isn't a stoner comedy. For me Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a more of a romance movie. It's no match for other comedies from the same group such as Superbad and is also far from being hilarious. It's indeed smart and witty at times, But the jokes in this film aren't consistent, as they were in the other films. The film's characters for the most part are all funny, such as Aldous and the Hawaiian waiters. The actors also were awesome.

Jason Segel is definitely an underrated actor from what I see in this movie and delivers this great role of a good guy who wants to be loved.

"A Likable Comedy -- Nothing Special, But Decent","After being dumped by actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), a composer named Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, who also wrote the screenplay)tries to take a vacation in Hawaii. But, as luck would have it, she's there with her new boyfriend (Russell Brand). Cue the new girl named Rachel from the front desk (Mila Kunis). Does Peter try to get Sarah back? Go for the new girl? Walk away and move on with his life? Guess you'll have to wait and see.While I didn't find myself rolling around on the ground laughing, and even though most of the plot is incredibly cliché and predictable, I found something endearing about this film. It comes off as a raunchy film -- especially with the full frontal nudity -- but has a lot more character and less juvenile tendencies than ""American Pie"" . In some ways, I could almost sympathize with Peter (especially the way he'll eat abnormally large amounts of breakfast cereal).The Mila Kunis was nice -- she's a decent enough actress and very easy on the eyes. The lead was strong. Kristen Bell was a bit weak, but managed to pull off her part. What was really great was the cameo cut-aways with William Baldwin and Jason Bateman. I looked forward to each one-liner, no matter how bad they were going to be. This was really the clincher between a one-time view and a repeat. I'd be glad to see this one again.I was torn on the Dracula musical. It was clever and I think this had a lot of potential, both as a subplot and even as a stand-alone spin-off if they wanted to make it. But I don't know how much I liked the idea of puppets, and when we finally see the finished project I found it rather disappointing. Not something I would go and see. So, Peter, I hope you made Rachel happy because you failed me.Nothing new here, but a classic love tale and some decent jokes with full frontal nudity (male). If you like a good comedy and don't mind some smut, check this out. I suspect it will be better than Kevin Smith's attempt at raunchy humor, and I already know it tops the string of teenager films from the past decade. And if you need a break from Will Ferrell, here's a good chance. Although, sadly, since Judd Apatow produced it, there's some scenes with Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill that I could have done without.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Forgettable,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall was like a would-be grand fireworks show that got rained out.

It was underwhelming from start to finish. Every joke seemed to be aborted before it really had the chance to get off the ground. I kept waiting for the big payoff, but it never came.

Another winner from Team Apatow.,"'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is almost certainly another classic straight from Apatow's seal of approval. It's brilliant. Gold, yet again. It takes another familiar formula, but 'Sarah Marshall' pulls it off like few could ever dream of. Laugh-out-loud funny, incredibly raunchy, but with a great story to be told. This is a must-see, and I doubt there will be a funnier film this year.Apatow's acting troupe are clearly set for life. Whether it's a starring role or a small supporting appearance, Apatow has never faltered to remain faithful to his 'family', many of whom have been with him since the short-lived 'Freaks and Geeks'. And this time around, it's Jason Segel who gets the opportunity to showcase his talents by writing and starring in his own vehicle. Segel has absolutely no problems carrying 'Sarah Marshall', and no about qualms baring all. Literally. Segel pushes the envelope for what's allowed in an R-rating, and it's truly unforgettable. Segel, you've got nothing to be shy about.Apatow, who produces 'Sarah Marshall', continues to set the bar for the sex comedy. Like 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Knocked Up', and 'Superbad', 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' continues to restore the genre to glory by delivering nearly two hours of sustained laughter. It isn't afraid to knock down barriers rarely explored in film, and it's why these films continue to be so fresh and so enjoyable. It takes the basic ingredients and runs with it to new heights. To all those in the Apatow posse, don't stop doing your thing. Please.Forgetting 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' will be a tough thing to do. A great film, from its penis-flopping beginning to a Dracula musical. What more could you ask for? You won't forget it anytime soon, and why would you want to? With a star-studded cast and near flawless execution, 'Sarah Marshall' is every bit as good as anything we've seen from Apatow in the past, and once again delivers something you do not want to miss. Like the film says, ""God put our mouths on our heads for a reason."" Well... maybe that means something else entirely, but our mouths do get quite a workout.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Enjoyable Adult Comedy,"Generally American comedy films specialise in ""gross out"" humour, British ones in a more subtle, wordy version. This plays largely to type but with a nice twist, with the twist being British actor Russell Brand who does both.Producer Judd Apatow specialises in a puerile, obvious humour which was successfully exploited in Knocked Up, The 40 year old virgin,and Superbad,all of which have enjoyed considerable commercial success.Afficiandos will not be disappointed. Mens genitalia are supposed to be funny, and spoof blow job videos hilarious.Yet in this simple romp emerges a comedy which does have its moments.Anti-hero,and writer, Jason Segel pretty much plays it straight as jilted Peter Bretter to a very pretty, but less than convincing Kristen Bell as Sarah Marshall.However the stand out turn comes from Russell Brand, almost playing himself, as Rock Star Aldous Snow. Brand offers a performance of swagger, style, panache and braggadocio which steals every scene he is in. He has all the best lines and knocks a solid supporting love interest role performance from Mila Kunis as Rachael Jansen solidly into touch.Neatly combining wild excess, with witty wordy observations,Brand romps through the role in the same way that he would through a nunnery!Some odd editing, and clunky scene changes do not detract from some very good, and funny, set pieces, and the story stops thankfully short of any moralising.The four hander between the ""foursome"" at dinner is by far the stand out scene with brand coming to terms with a particularly offensive ""shirt as gift"" with the memorable cry ""take my eyes but not my shirt"" to an over eager waiter.Not a ""big screen"" essential by any means,but well worth a look nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
vapid penis flashing characterless garbage,"This movie appeared as its predecessors, knocked up, 40 yr old virgin, to be crude and immature but with occasional funny parts worthy of a Saturday night at home. This was not so, the movie stars an undefined characterless loser with no personality who, i guess is supposed to develop and grow into something more during the movie. Well that doesn't happen. We get to see his sagging penis flashed throughout the movie though (i suppose the writers were so frustrated with their inability to actually develop a worthwhile plot that they thought throwing in full frontal male nudity would make make up for its overall dreary stupidity, it only made it worse). The films continual crude scenes of awkward sex and the general focus on actual intercourse further added to its vitriol and made it seem like it was written by a 13 year old boy. which seems likely. The plot descended into such nothingness, i honestly stopped watching halfway through. I thought Russell brand would make the movie marginally worthwhile, but his personality doesn't even make whimper. All in all, plot= vacuous, acting= bad bad horrible, especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role , and don't , for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord, what a waste of 1 1/2 hours..",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unfunny people,"There is some clever stuff in this, brought down by uninspired attempts at comedy. So if it's just laughs that you're looking for, they're all rehashed here with familiar faces to deliver them, better reach for Superbad again or the recent Bridesmaids.But the film deserves a few words on the structure, it's an excellent design. The protagonist is a guy who's been living beneath the image of his girlfriend, a TV actress for a CSI-type show. He is comfortable that way, as we learn it's the only thing that makes him get up from the couch and clean up his place, preserve some semblance of order. His job is to score the episodes for the show, he does this by literally working on the synthesizer beneath her giant projected image. She dumbs him, he tears the image in a fit of frenzy. Slinks depressed again back into the couch.He gets up from the couch for a trip to Hawaii, once more something he has picked up from his girlfriend. There he learns how to pick himself up again, on a surf board, or up in front of an audience to play the piano. His dream, sidetracked by slovenly routine and a passionless job, is to orchestrate a rock opera about Dracula, a man who was doomed to love eternally in his head.It's meant to be a dark, emotional piece, yet playing one of the songs for an audience of disinterested tourists, it elicits hearty laughs. Turns out that what he was writing all this time, funneling his own important self into the thing, was after all a comedy and not a drama. So the circumstances around him open up the self-pitying work into selfless entertainment.Eventually he stages his vision, we can tell this much early on, and it's an uproar. It's an opera with muppets, with himself in control of the protagonist. He plays his own strings, finds a love that does not merely give him a reason to get up from the couch but inspires creative passion out of him.For all intents and purposes, it's really potent stuff the way it's structured. One of the best for the year, as far as layering a lesson about the mechanisms that control life within a fiction that is transformed with that life is concerned.So I doubly lament that it's an Apatow production, a middling one at that. Paul Rudd plays the goofy stoner surfer. Jonah Hill plays the bumbling waiter with aspirations of a music career. It's miserable stuff I tell you, every attempt at a laugh. Our entry in Hawaii is completely touristy, the shiny plastic of a postcard, like the real place I suppose has turned by now, one big holiday resort for people who can afford it.Which is all highly ironic, given how the whole thing is not meant to be a drama. But we don't make the discovery with the protagonist for this to matter deeply, it's a dumb comedy from the get go. If you're patient enough or don't mind, you can watch just so you can imagine a better film out of it.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Judd Apatow Factory Produces a Genial Though Meandering Break-Up Comedy,"As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" a lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much like ""CSI"". The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid"", except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although obviously, interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"") acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late of ""That 70's Show"", the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role in ""Superbad""), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on ""30 Rock"") as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mila Kunis is like Lucy Liu, maybe.","This is like ""Good Luck Chuck"" meets ""Along Came Polly"". The result is a movie that has more male nudity than female. And also some strange cut scenes that somewhat resemble Family in a strange and perverted way.Anyway, a man loses his famous girlfriend. Somehow they meet up in Hawaii when he is trying to get away from her and she is trying to have a relationship with a rocker. Throw in some odd ball honeymooners and Mila Kunis as part of the wait staff and you got some sort of movie on speed pills.Jason Segel, who is not the best looking man in the world, shows the world who he is in more than one way. And I was intrigued with Mila Kunis in this movie, whom I have seen in ""That 70s Show"". She is more beautiful than many actresses that I have seen and should be given that.Overall, strangely funny.

Extremely crude and adult...but also very enjoyable.,"Jason Segal not only stars in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but he wrote the screenplay. It's a most enjoyable film...but I should warn you that it is very adult and its crude sensibilities might easily offend.Peter (Segal) and Sarah (Kristen Bell) have just broken up and instead of handling it like an adult, Peter spends his time feeling sorry for himself and brooding over losing her. As for Sarah, she's a successful TV star and seems to have gotten over him VERY quickly and has taken up with a nice but annoying rock star (Russell Brand).After weeks and weeks of him feeling sorry for himself, Peter's brother convinces him to take a vacation. Peter choses to go to Hawaii...and ends up going to the exact same resort where Sarah and her new lover have gotten a room. The film concerns Peter's journey from being a wimpy loser to ultimately getting his life together.The film is very likable and the dialog and characters are terrific. But the film is adult...there's a significant amount of nudity (mostly, eww, Segal) and dialog that occasionally is pretty adult. Again, if this won't offend you, you'll love the film. But the rest of you might just to think twice.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring and mila kunis is super annoying.,"I thought this movie was really boring and monotoned. It was not funny at all. Mila Kunis was absolutely horrible at her acting. She was really annoying. Her voice was enough to drive someone nuts. I thought this movie had no plot what-so-ever. All there was that happened was lots of sobbing, lots of stalking, and idiocy. Garbage. It tried too hard to be funny. It was a complete waste of time. I thought that it made no sense at all. The ending was sloppy and random. it seem like they tried to rush the ending just to get it over with. I had no idea why and how he even got to send a letter to the girl! The beginning was super dull and showed no relationship value between peter or Sarah Marshall. The acting was super phony. I think that the only reason why it would have good reviews is because of all the excessive sexing and apparently Mila Kunis' tits.. which is not even a real picture of her.. its photo-shopped. so think before you even bother to watch this stupid movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing Really Special,"When one of the preeminent film critics of our time labels this film one of the 50 greatest comedies of all-time; your expectations can't help but be high. Maybe high expectations were a problem because I found the movie to be very ordinary at best. Richard Roeper is well respected and usually right on the mark but his sense of humor must be very different from mine. There are some humorous moments but nothing that warrants high praise. It's warm hearted but borderlines on watching someone else's vacation home movies. Mila Kunis is phenomenal (truly deserving of that high praise) but EVERY other supporting character is more annoying then they are endearing or funny. Forgetting Sarah Marshall contains many chuckles but no laugh out loud moments. Sorry to say, nothing really special at all.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Mmovie has a charm, lightness, but doesn't avoid some darker elements","Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). There is something different about Forgetting Sarah Marshall as this romance comedy but in a good way. Jason Segel's Peter Bretter's character is more refined and credible in his comedic performance than Matthew Perry's Oz Oseransky character in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) even as both their character share similar personas. Kristen Bell's inevitably second to Mila Kunis's character (later Best Actress Oscar winner in Black Swan) surprisingly retains a powerful and in ways sympathetic presence almost to the end, which is only saved by the unusual insert sequence with the ending credits. There is something honest and gripping in the script as it presence relational turmoil and regretful mistakes on the part of its characters. The overall movie has a charm, lightness, but doesn't avoid some darker elements as well as a genuinely sensitive and humorous and touching musical rendition of a Dracula character.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Loose yourself in F^($""","As wild as that line is, it's hilarious when you hear it delivered in this movie. It's one of number of memorable moments that you'll get from watching this comedic gem.Basically, the movie is about a fellow who gets dumped by his TV-actress girlfriend. When he goes to a Hawaiian resort to forget about her, he learns that that's where she and her new rock-star boyfriend are staying - and he keeps bumping into them!It's a pretty standard-sounding storyline, but the movie has plenty of gags and engaging moments to keep one interested. The fast pace makes it easy to stay interested. The movie is a bit edgy - so keep that in mind (case in point: there are some extended scenes with full male nudity of the lead, Jason Segel).All an all, this movie was very well done. Not only are there are a number of laugh-out-loud moments, but you'll get interested in the story as well. Definitely worth a watch if you're in the mood for a comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

life after getting dumped... involving Dracula puppets,"I enjoyed this. It's a typical romcom, with all the clichés but it has a little bit extra. There's Russell Brand for a start - always entertaining - and a few other familiar faces in a large cast where everyone has very specific characters they aren't just incidentals; Paul Rudd (Object of my Affection, Friends) almost unrecognisable, Taylor Wily (Hawaii 50), and Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street), Jack McBrayer (30 Rock) and William Baldwin! I know Jason Segal from 'How I met your mother' and he wrote this as well as starred, and I liked him. I could have done without the full-frontals (plural) but hey. He wrote them in, he must be proud. I love Mila Kunis (Friends with Benefits) in everything I've seen her in, and this is no exception. Kristen Bell (Couples Retreat) played annoying want-it-all girlfriend well.Basically a girl dumps boy, boy can't stand it, tries everything to get over her movie... he runs into girl with new boy and fun in the sun ensues. Set against the stunning backdrop of Oahu, Hawaii, it's an easy going watch and you get swept along. As I say, it's not original, there are clichés, and you pretty much know where it's going but that's okay. It's not a rocket science film, it's not groundbreaking nor is it Oscar worthy, just enjoyable, funny, cringeworthy but also with a few interesting things to say. Good writing, and it looks like Segal can really play the piano! Bonus. Very watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Apatow comedy that's a winner!,"Honestly, I did not think Judd Apatow had it in him to be involved in another comedy that would be good. So far, everything he has been involved in has been immensely funny (The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad). Forgetting Sarah Marshall can be added to that list, because this is one hilarious movie. Jason Segel is very, very good as Peter, who decides to vacation in Hawaii to forget about Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) who recently dumped him for Aldous Snow (a quirky Russell Brand). Unfortunately for him, Sarah and Aldous are holidaying at the same resort as he is. Luckily for him, he meets Rachel (a gorgeous and talented Mila Kunis) and they hit it off.What sounds like an average romantic comedy is turned into a smart, well-paced, always funny and just plain excellent mid-year movie. It is easily one of this years best and I wish there were more comedies like this. The supporting cast were consistently funny. Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill, Apatow regulars, are gold. The movie is very quotable and most importantly, believable. The relationships all break off and build in a slow and effective way, so we are allowed to time to understand and feel sympathy for the various characters. The jokes rarely missed, for those who like their jokes raunchy, this is your movie! Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the movies I listed earlier. I look forward to the next Apatow clan comedy.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everyone looks good in Hawaii.,"Java Man Reviews ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (Rated R). Directed by Nicholas Stoller. Written by Jason Segel. Starring Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Kala Alexander, Paul Rudd, William Baldwin, Jason Bateman, Jack McBrayer and Da'vone McDonald. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2008.OVERVIEW:Schlubby Peter Bretter (Segel) composes music for a CSI-like TV show that stars his gorgeous girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Bell). Relegated to such indignities as holding her purse during photo shoots, Peter is nevertheless deeply in love. So when she tells him that ""there is someone else,"" he is devastated. The someone else is self-absorbed British rocker Aldous Snow (Brand), who could have been separated at birth from Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.After a tragicomic montage of meaningless sexual encounters, Peter decides that a trip to Hawaii would be just the thing to encourage him to live up to this film's title. But as luck (and movie logic) would have it, Sarah and Aldous are already shacked up at the same hotel when Peter arrives. Amid the chance encounters and amusing awkwardness, Peter meets Rachel (Kunis), a hotel employee who may be a romantic prospect--or just a competent resort worker who his pleasant to her customers.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java MugsIf you like movies that begin with a break-up and end with a match-up (and who doesn't?), then this is the film for you. But it is the midsection of the movie, the time spent in Hawaii, that is the most entertaining. The film is a slight variation on the romantic comedy formula: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy and Girl Both Go to Hawaii. Why so far away? Woody Allen could have filmed this story within a few city blocks of his Manhattan apartment.Here's why: Since fantasy vacations are becoming so expensive, why not let the movies take us to some of these exotic locales. And Hawaii is one of the most stunning, a place where beams of golden sun bathe land and sea and make everyone look good--including the lead actors and lighting directors.Segel, who also wrote the screenplay, gives an adequate performance as Peter, and provides some of the film's more embarrassing moments with brief(less) episodes of frontal nudity. The two women in his life are appropriately attractive, though it may stretch credibility to believe either would actually be interested in Peter.Other memorable performances include Brand as the cynical, oversexed rocker, Rudd as a drugged-out surfing instructor, and McBrayer and McDonald as Christian honeymooners who are just realizing that there is a physical aspect to the marriage sacrament. Some of the funniest moments come with send-ups of the police procedural TV genre, featuring hilarious, straight-faced cameos by Baldwin and Bateman.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Laughs,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)*** (out of 4)A music composer (Jason Segel) gets dumped by his actress girlfriend (Kristen Bell) so he heads to Hawaii to get away from his heartbreak but runs into more when he bumps into the ex there with her new lover (Russell Brand). His tears start flowing even more but that all changes when he meets a young woman (Mila Kunis) who works at the hotel he's staying at. This is another good entry in the recent trend of ""gross out"" comedies but it's certainly not in the same league as The 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up. I think both of those films did a great job at mixing the laughs with the more heart felt moments but I was a little surprised that this film wasn't funnier. That's not to say there aren't any laughs here because there are a lot but just not enough to justify the long running time. I watched the extended cut, which runs 118-minutes and I must admit that I think the faults of this film are in its running time, which is just way too long. Many of the jokes just keep getting repeated and while they're funny the first time they're aren't the fifth time. The non-stop crying jokes are one example as are the countless shots of Segel's penis. What really keeps the film moving are the very good performances from the entire cast with Kunis stealing the show. Segel makes for a good lead, although I think a stronger one would have suited the film better. The actor does a good job at making us care for him and he handles the comedy very well. I thought Brand's character was a tad bit poorly written with his ""peaceful"" attitude towards women and sex. Bell is very good in her part as Sarah Marshall but this film belongs to Kunis. I believe this was the first time I had seen her and she certainly has the charm and charisma that really jumps off the screen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Much better than expected,"Although the movie has some of sophomoric humor you would expect from this kind of premise and this group of movie makers, it actually surprises you with some stylish humor in its design that bears some (dare I say it?) originality.First, it's written with more attention to character study than is customary in these types of comedies. The writer gave them depth, and concocted them with strategic flaws, quirks, strengths, etc., so that their contrasting personalities would collide and bounce off each other with humorous results. The rock star new boyfriend (Russell Brand) of Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) in most movies like this would usually be a worn-out cliché of a dim-witted guy with slow mumbling speech who thinks the world owes him something. If anything, the film actually takes pokes at how these clichés have been so over-used. Brand takes this surprisingly amiable guy, who befriends his potential rival Brian, and runs with it. He gets some of the best laugh lines, too.Bell, as the titular Sarah Marshall, is excellent. She, too, could have been a stock foul-mouthed, self satisfying, worthless bimbo type who spends hours in front of the mirror. Although the selfishness is there, it's at a believable level, and there are even fleeting moments when a good side to Sarah is shown. Mila Kunis plays Rachel, Peter's new girl friend, who works at a resort hotel in Hawaii, where all the action takes place. Either Kunis has improved immensely since her sitcom ""70's Show"" days, or else her role here as Rachel just gave her a more rounded character to work with: she is fabulous in this film.Only Jason Segel (as the broken hearted Peter) is weak in his role; ironic, since he is the writer of the script. It's obvious his intent is to reverse typical gender personality types for the comic effect. Peter is clingy, explosively emotive, cries, and can't let go of the broken relationship. This all works for funny moments, but Segel's performance has a feel of ""Look how fully I am!"" It's more over done than comic exaggeration needs to be. Also, someone tell Mr. Segel we really don't need to see his full frontal poses: he plays them as a joke, OK, but they evoke barf bag reactions, not laughs.This film falls into the trap of throwing in some mindless stuff, but overall, it's a surprising treat that's fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Running into each other frequently, Peter tries to forget about Sarah and start things with Rachel, but things may prove to be a tad more difficult as he has a hard time adjusting to the break up and Sarah's new boyfriend. I really wanted to like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and while I didn't hate it, it didn't particularly wow me either. I found little to no humour in the film and when it tried to be funny, I found the jokes to be stale and some of the same material got repeated several times which just got to be tiresome and boring after awhile. I also really couldn't identify, or like any of these characters because most of them got on my nerves with their constant whining and self loathing. I also found the characters to be really into themselves and self indulgent which made it even harder to like them and identify with them and find pleasure in watching them. I guess there were a few moments where the creativity peaked, but mostly the film didn't feel particularly new, or anything worth raving about. The performances while not bad, couldn't really save the film either from just being a mediocre film that could have been a lot better. When you have a comedy that isn't particularly funny, inventive, or when the characters grate on your nerves, you know it isn't going to be a hit movie and Forgetting Sarah Marshall was certainly no hit in my books.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

(You Won't Be) Forgetting Jason's Penis,"For better or worse, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)' is mostly remembered for the fact that Jason Segal hangs dong in the first ten minutes. That's a bit of a shame; the picture itself is a competent and cohesive romantic comedy that's actually surprisingly nuanced. At the same time, though, Jason's penis gets people talking about the film, so I guess it does its job. The flick is one of those films that's just easy to watch. Even when it isn't funny, it's always fairly fun. It has a handful of likeable characters, some suitably absurd sequences and a somewhat mature emotional underpinning. It does have a couple of big laughs and it also has some surprisingly affecting moments, but it isn't the sort of thing that's going to have you in either kind of tears.

Had its moments but nothing special,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall is basically another film Judd Apatow produced comedy with a roundabout of the same humor. This stars Jason Segel (surprisingly good) as a guy who's desperately heartbroken after a break-up and needs to refresh his whole life, and so he decides to go to Hawaii to seek out new interest.Now, I never go into a comedy with high hopes, because I always end up disappointed - luckily, with this I got myself a good laugh. It's standard procedure sure, and the film does lend heavily on the romantic button at several occasions, but still there's lots to laugh at when mentioned Segel, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. There were a few laughs, some minor some rather bigger but not enough for it too be that great. The females were played out by Kristen Bell and the sweet Mila Kunis, does only provide positively for the issues regarding romance, and not for the issues regarding comedy or mildly affecting drama, note: mildly. Their were some real awkward scenes and some other good scenes. One thing that was weird is how everywhere he went, Sarah Marshall was their. First he goes to Hawaii to forget about her, and he ends up running into her. Then, he rents a room and it ends up being the room right next to her. Weird and sorta unrealistic? Also he goes for a yoga class and she and Aldous Snow is there. Then he later goes to dinner and she's right there in front of him. Very strange. Also since she's a TV star, her show was usually on TV when he was watching. He couldn't get her out of his mind.One thing that was weird was her character, she didn't seem that mean but they explained that she broke up his 5+ year relationship and during the last year, she was sleeping with Aldous. I though her character (Sarah Marshall) could have been meaner and more of a b****. Perhaps Kristen Bell wasn't the right choice. The ending was also really weird. She started having feelings for him again and likewise with him but he like Mila Kunis (Rachel) she he ended up getting with her. Not that surprising but somewhat surprising. Overall it was a decent movie, I enjoyed at parts it but it could have been better! After a rewatch (03/31/17') this film is more well rounded and the writing is quite good, more so of a mature comedy than what we are used to seeing in past years (such as Adam Sandler films). Rating changed from 6/10 to 7/10. For another watch 06 26 19' this film remains an enjoyable and at times funny film.

Or half if it, anyway. It's the first movie I fast forwarded.Honestly, this movie's plot barely moves. Nothing interesting happens, and nothing that's supposed to be funny actually is. The acting completely sucks. COMPLETELY. All they're missing in here is Miley Cyrus and they could call it a party. It probably doesn't help that I'm not fond of neither Kristen Bell NOR Mila Kunis.I just think this is a movie with cheap humour and a shitty writing.

"Segel, Rudd, Hill, Hader, McBrayder, Brand... and a little bit of Bateman.","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is another Judd Apatow produced comedy with a roundabout of the same humor. Better then '40-Year Old Virgin', worse than 'Superbad' this stars Jason Segel (surprisingly good) as a guy who's desperately heartbroken after a break-up and needs to refresh his whole life, and so he decides to go to Hawaii to seek out new interest. Now, I never go into a comedy with high hopes, because I always end up disappointed - luckily, with this I got myself a good laugh. It's standard procedure sure, and the film does lend heavily on the romantic button at several occasions, but still there's lots to laugh at when mentioned Segel, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill (and even Jason Bateman in a small role) go together on the screen. Now note that the two female characters of any importance, played out by Kristen Bell and the sweet Mila Kunis, does only provide positively for the issues regarding romance, and not for the issues regarding comedy or mildly affecting drama, note: mildly. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' delivers breezy goods and never goes feverishly stupid, it's slight, light and fine fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I will not be!","I'd only heard of this film after watching 'I Love You, Man.' I googled the cast, and then turned my attention to Jason Segel. Realizing I had never heard of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I researched it, only to find so many of my favorite actors! Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Jonah Hill AND Mila Kunis all together?? I then rented the DVD and discovered that Forgetting Sarah Marshall is of the same genre as I Love You, Man, and Segel does the same quality of acting. I liked that he was able to get his life back on track, and find a love interest along the way. I was also happy to see that Sarah(played by Bell) got her comeuppance. Russell Brand also does a fantastic job, considering his love for sex in real life. Anyone in the mood for lots of goofy sex scenes will enjoy this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"I sit before this computer awestruck, currently experiencing what I call ""Cinematic Grandeur"" running through my very veins. I have felt the once-in-a-blue-moon feeling of wanting to see a movie the second it was over. No, not Juno, not Crash, not The Matrix, not one of them life-altering Oscar flicks. No, this is simply a potty-mouthed laugh attack.And it's brilliant.Forgetting Sarah Marshall (A Judd Apatow Production), details the life of Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, How I Met Your Mother) following a break-off of a five year love-a-thon with TV celeb Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell, Heroes). Broken-hearted and crying like a schoolgirl, Peter resorts to a trip to Hawaii to calm his state of panic, only to find everyone's favorite celebrity ex and her newest boytoy, British rock sensation Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The heartbreak continues despite being surrounded by the most beautiful part of the country, until encouraged by friends to secure a hot date with the lovely receptionist Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis, That 70's Show). What follows is a laugh riot featuring great cameos and one liners that'll leave you in stitches.It should be noted right away, though the plot sounds quasi-cliché, it feels anything but. Snappy one-liners and cut-away jokes make for brilliant surprises in the plot, and the timing of said jokes is phenomenal. What I refer to as ""Family Guy Syndrome"", aka the ability to drag on a joke way too long, is gone completely from FSM. Just when one of the jokes seems tedious, it's over and the plot advances. The writing is top-notch, brilliantly funny, and delivered solidly by the four main leads.The aforementioned leads carry the plot like a sloth carries moss. Segel's moments of sheer embarrassment are to die for, and I mean embarrassment. Full frontal embarrassment. Meanwhile Brand attempts to steal the show as the British music idol who's borderline straight-edge and consistently delivers comedy gold. Kunis and Bell each act out their respective girly parts well, and you manage to find yourself caring about each character despite the way you want to hate Marshall.Perhaps most intriguing is the ability of actor cameos to bring a smile to your face, whether's it's Jonah Hill (of Accepted and Superbad fame) as a waiter obsessed with the career of Snow, Paul Rudd (star of previous Apatow projects, 40-Year-Old-Virgin and Knocked Up) as a dim bulb surf instructor or even Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) making a great cameo while the credits roll. All the bit parts are played competently and each manages to steal the scene when they're on screen. If anything, all the comedy belongs to the background players while the big four advance the plot. Oh, and did I mention Jack McBrayer (30 Rock's Kenneth) plays quite a part himself?When push comes to shove, I don't how much more praise I can lay on this movie. It's heartfelt, hilarious, and dare I say it, near-perfect. I'd love to say it's perfect, simply because I can't find any flaws, but I'm hesitant to dish out that scary ten out of ten. That said, FSM is the funniest movie I've seen in years. Better than Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, Knocked Up, Superbad, if you name it, this movie's likely funnier. Led by strong acting, snappy writing, and an all out fantastic showing by everyone involved, it seems Judd Apatow has once again struck comedy gold. My only question is, how does he outdo this one?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A heartfelt masterpiece,"Since his Apatow arrival on Freaks and Geeks, Jason Siegel, has always had the little parts in the past many Apatow produced films, at least until now, and it's a performance not to be forgotten. This beautifully scripted and wonderfully acted film features Jason Siegel getting over a recent break up in ways that'll make you laugh as hard as ever before, and in the end, you'll leave in a state of ecstasy because of how much fun you had. But my main point of interest was how well this film emotionally connected with its audience. The nakedness of Siegel during the break-up (which was strange and comical while also saddening), the wonderfully casted and beautiful Mila Kunis, and the script all come together to stretch out a sad yet hopeful hand that sweeps the audience up and never lets them back down even after the movie is over. I know of nothing else to say except...see this movie and enjoy.9/10!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fading attraction: Kristen vs Jason,"This was a decent movie. Not nearly as good as I had hoped, but decent. The funniest part was just the shock of seeing full frontal male nudity! Yes, you see Jason Segel's junk several times. Kristen Bell is gorgeous in this movie as well as Mila Kunis. Jonah Hill (SuperBad, etc) is in this but is used sparingly. His attraction to the weird rocker (I don't know his name) is one of the funniest aspects of this movie. I'm not a fan of Jason Segel (don't like him in How I Met Your Mother) and this movie didn't really change my mind either. 6 stars is a generous rating from me. It's fairly generic in its approach and really nothing in it is surprising or really entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kind of long.,"I wish this was a better review, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with this movie.Like the newspapers said, it had MOMENTS that rocked, but they were few and far between. Jason Segal was good, the girls were all hot, but the supporting players took me out of the film. I know, they are all ""Apatow regulars"", but every time they came on the screen I thought ""Hey, there's that guy from _____, that other Apatow movie"". Normally that doesn't bug me, as they are usually well cast.But Paul Rudd as a surfing instructor? I didn't buy that at all. Jonah Hill as the waiter? Took me right out of the story.I like the nudity, and some of the jokes, but this film was LONG and I wish I'd waited for the DVD.",,Anonymous,Romance
A clever gem.,"I am excited about the new crop of American comedies that have been emerging lately. This Rogan/Apatow crew has consistently brought audiences modern stories full of honest characters (""Knocked Up"" being the exception) and jokes that have not been dragged through movie mud over and over again.At first, I was unsure of where the comedy was going with this one. It starts off a little shaky, but then finds its groove and carries the audience laughing all the way through the credits.The plot is simple: A guy gets dumped. Her tries to et over her, and winds up running into her. Her falls in love with another woman, and the ex now wants him back. Easy enough, right?But with the dead on humor (some raunchy, some just genuinely hilarious), this movie shines as a comic tour-De-force for all involved. The jokes are timely but not dated (whereas ""Knocked Up"" lacked credibility with its Hot-Girl-Loves-Slob routine and its dated references to movie lines and TV shows.) This one is funnier than ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" but not quite better than ""Superbad."" All in all, these original comedies are fresh, exciting and genuine to the core.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

To get over it, he goes to Hawaii where Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand) also vacation. What are the odds that they would end up in the same resort? A great cast makes the film worthwhile. I enjoyed seeing Kristin Wiig, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and others. If it doesn't make you want to go to Hawai, nothing will.

Apatow lite,"About ten years ago romantic comedy started to merge with raunchy comedy  an early example was ""There's Something About Mary"" after which I've never felt quite the same about hair gel. Judd Apatow as writer, producer and director has become a deft exponent of the resulting amalgam, though in this case he and the gang (Nicholas Stoller, director, Jason Segal, writer and lead actor, and others) have not been quite as deft as they were in ""Knocked Up"", which had a semi-serious plot. Here we have Apatow lite. Peter (Jason Segal), a rather ineffectual, self absorbed composer of TV show music whose improbably glamorous girlfriend of five years, the eponymous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), suddenly leaves him for Aldous (Russell Brand), an English rock star with a vast ego and voracious sexual appetite. Peter takes a vacation at the Turtle Bay resort in Oahu, Hawaii and guess who's there too? Yes, it's Sarah and Aldous, noisily in the next suite.Rachel (Mila Kunis), the gorgeous desk clerk at Turtle Bay, unaccountably takes an interest in Peter, who is overweight, depressed and generally unappetizing. But things bump along from there and there are plenty of funny scenes, before the denouement, which involves a rock opera production of Dracula using puppets.A number of the actors are from US television and handle the challenge of parodying their TV roles very well, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis in particular. The absurdly pretentious Aldous is given some of the sharper lines, which has the effect of making the rest of the cast look pretty dumb. But the laughs keep coming. Like ""Seinfield"", it is a comedy about nothing (almost) but the lines are good and the scenery is nice. Turtle Beach Resort will be happy. We didn't get to see turtles breeding though, despite them being ""in season"". Apatow and co are entertaining, if somewhat on the slight side, and the raunch is kept under control, despite Apatow's determination to remind us of the importance of the penis.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Universal Pictures message to teenagers;,"""This is how adults in their mid to late 20's behave."" Okay, I know this is another Apatow ""comedy"". Fair enough. But, the target market for this film isn't the adult 20-something crowd. The target market for this movie are adolescent and pre-adolescent males.Which is amazing, since the film is supposed to be adult in nature, but really dives to the bottom of the cesspool with the sight-gags and some of the other obvious humor.Having said that, and having thoroughly disapproved of most of this film, I can safely say that I did laugh a few times. I mean, even though this film had the F-bomb being dropped during much of Act I and a good part of Act II (probably rivaling Pacino's use of the word in ""Scarface""), the funniest lines seem to come out of the Aldous Snow character. Lines which, I'll add, didn't contain any cussing.Look. I swear. Most of us do. But there's a time and place for everything, and even though I worked in production where swearing was taken to a whole new height (above and beyond sailor usage... in the classical sense), I have a hard time believing that the film makers think most of the public uses this kind of language on a habitual basis. But, like I say, the film's marketed towards teenagers, not really adults as such, but persons with teenage sensibilities.I guess what I mean is that this film could've been a real gem. So much more than popular opinion and some professional critical acclaim. Like Jonathan Winters says, dropping your pants for a laugh only gets you so far. And yet this is what really bothers me; using nudity as a shock comic device really isn't funny. Yet by reading the boards and comments on this film, one would think this kind of humor was comic genius.But it isn't.In fact, it's really stupid.Like I say, I did laugh at the more conventional and intelligent humor (what small portions there were), and therefore concede that this film has some funniness in it, but it's also fairly lame brained. It's like a sexually obsessed child writer was given a breakup story, and asked to write a script about it. The result is this film.Directorially, it's okay. There's a few mildly inspiring shots. The thing looks professional enough, but also misses a lot of potential. In short the shooting style is good and passing, but it's not comical.Why this film gets praises is not beyond me. But, however, it is disappointing. Had this film been released in the ""sexually liberated"" 70s, it would've achieved cult-status, but, in my personal opinion, would've been voted out of the theatres via lack of ticket dollars.Call me a prude, but that's my take.",,Anonymous,Romance

It shows you how to grow from adversity and shed the needless and often self inflicted pain and it gives you that while making you laugh the entire time.I give this movie 10 stars because after a million rewatches it has never lost its savor.

A decent if massively implausible flick,"Jason Segel is a musician living with TV star Kristen Bell, who dumps him. Not handling it well, he decides to run off to a resort in Hawaii that Bell liked, only to immediately run into her with her new boyfriend rock star Russell Brand. Luckily for him, romance blooms with resort employee Mila Kunis.There's something about this film that doesn't exactly work for me. It's a funny film (at least it is after the first half hour when it finally hits the resort), but I'm constantly confronted with the fact that thoroughly average looking, perfectly nice but nothing spectacular Segel is so seismically beyond Kunis's league that I can't help focusing on what fantasy it's trying to fulfill. It seems like an essential part of the Judd Apatow brand that thoroughly average, stunningly flawed men can find love with nearly perfect women just by being minimally nice people ... or at least they SHOULD (emphasis mine).How much does this bother me? Not a ton, but if it did bother someone a lot I wouldn't blame them. Personally, I was entertained, even though like most comedies of this era, it's overstuffed with extraneous nonsense (no matter how much I liked him on ""30 Rock"", drop Jack McBrayer's plot line from this film).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sweet and lovable delight,"Judd Apatow's latest production follows a formula similar to some of his other films, but it still works quite well. What Apatow and his crew bring to the table are more fully developed characters, an emotional core and a refreshingly adult sense of humor. Kids can have their Meet the Spartans; I'm perfectly happy with this. Jason Segel stars and wrote the screenplay. Kristen Bell is the actress who broke up with him. Russell Brand plays her new boyfriend and Mila Kunis the new girl whom Segel meets. Pretty predictable plot-wise, of course, but the laughs are frequent and I actually cared about the characters. It's great to see the film not resort to making Bell and Brand outright villains. They feel like genuine people. The real treat of the film is the wonderful supporting cast and their lovable characters, including Apatow mainstay Paul Rudd as a stoner surf instructor, Jonah Hill as a guy obsessed with Russell Brand's rock star character, Bill Hader as Segel's supportive step-brother and Jack McBrayer as a sexually frustrated newlywed (his wife played by Maria Thayer, who played Tammi Littlenut in Strangers with Candy).

The scenery is stunning too, and the cinematography does it justice.

"Very funny, but predictable","It's a little tough for me to get a handle on how effective the first 20 minutes of this movie are, because the projectionist was showing it in the wrong ratio, meaning the boom mic was swinging around the screen like a bee that had been let in the room and was intent on following the conversation. A bee on a big metal arm like.Still, once that got sorted and the distraction was out of the way (idiotically jabbering cinema patrons not-withstanding) I had a pretty good time with this movie. It's completely predictable, and in most respects like just about every other romcom you've ever seen but still manages to hit a consistent laugh rate. A lot of those laughs arise from the japes of Russell Brand though, who is a marmite personality if there ever was one, so if you have an irrational hatred of the man then you may want to steer clear. He does very well though, his character effectively being Russell Brand and appearing to ad lib all over the place, thus avoiding any awkwardness that his transition to the big screen might have resulted in (I haven't seen ""St. Trinians"" though, so can't vouch for him in that, he might be a roasted turd in it for all I know).Also deserving mention is Paul Rudd, who is brilliant as always and comes close to stealing the show. And an entertaining show it is, ignore that it's horribly clichéd, forget that it follows the cookie cutter structure of every rom-com on the planet, relax and have a few laughs with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Forget"" the rules of the typical romcom, this one is funny & innovative","Peter (Jason Segel, who also wrote this gem) is a composer of television theme songs. His longtime girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is the star of a crime show that sports his musical compositions. But, horror of horrors, Sarah stuns Peter by breaking up with him and moving out. Since Peter was completely in love with Sarah, who did little things like buy him a tupperware container to keep his cereal from getting stale, his heartache is acute. Needing a change, Peter decides to head for Hawaii and clear his head. Yet, when he arrives at a posh hotel and is greeted by a lovely hotel employee, Rachel (Mila Kunis), Pete soon discovers that Sarah is also a guest, along with her new love interest, Brit musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)! Now, how in the heck is Peter supposed to ""get over"" Sarah when he meets her everywhere, in the restaurants or on the beaches? Trying hard, Peter takes up surfing with a local stonehead (Paul Rudd) and even works himself into a few dates with the lovely Rachel. But, will his heart heal? Forget about the typical romcom rules and just enjoy this ""male"" take on the ups and downs of love. Segel should receive much praise for not only starring in this comic winner but writing it as well. Bell is great as the ambitious blonde beauty who is not as empty headed as one might believe and Kunis, with her huge, beautiful eyes, does a fine job as a possible new hearthrob for Peter. Rudd is a hoot as the 24/7 stoner while Brand is likewise hysterical as the full-of-himself rock star. The rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill and Bill Hader, is quite nice as well. As for the Hawaiian setting, it is beautiful to the maximum and worth the ticket or rental price alone. Add on great costumes, amenities, and direction and you have a polished film indeed. The writing is very funny, such as the scene where Peter signs up to help with a luau, not realizing he will asked to ""kill"" the poor pig. However, one caveat is that if you are in search of good, clean fun, this one is not the film for you, as it has many risqué, sexually charged scenes & themes. Nevertheless, for couples on the lookout for a flick to please both genders, here is a terrific choice, for it has plenty of raunchy humor and wistful romance at the same incredible time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Might be Screamingly Funny if You're in your 20's or 30's,"For someone my age (I'm well out of my thirties), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is only mildly funny and the ""hilarious"" segments inserted for the youthful audience were not at all funny for me or my wife.

One thing that surprised me. There are two scenes with frontal male nudity. The famous Marlon Brando movie, ""Last Tango in Paris,"" got an X rating because of frontal male nudity -- and this is the first time since then I've encountered a film which broke that taboo. Have there been others? (The ban never made sense to me, but I wasn't responsible for the movie rating system.) The real revelation in this film is Mila Kunis: absolutely gorgeous.

Great sense of humour and charm elevate this above the average rom-com,"Judd Apatow has done the impossible. He has crafted, over the past few years, a series of movies that have sealed his name as a franchise; just as the name Quentin Tarantino attached to a crime movie means something to the movie going crowd, as such has Judd Apatow's name attached to a comedy become to mean something similar. Whether he's directing or just producing, Apatow and his troupe of actors, many of which appeared on his early, short-lived and underrated television program ""Freaks and Geeks"" bring a certain something more to the otherwise average romantic comedy genre.Indeed, like most of the previous movies attached to his name, Forgetting Sarah Marshall features a fairly simple, typical set-up and storyline for a romantic screwball comedy: A man is dumped by his girlfriend and he decides to take a vacation at the same resort his girlfriend and her new man are vacationing at, all the while falling in love with another girl who is clearly far more perfect for him. But Apatow, or in this case, his faithful troupe of actors, give the film a little something more that elevates it above other average comedies. That certain something is a sense of down-to-earthiness, crafting real, fleshed-out characters that most of us can fairly easily identify with  because they are essentially playing themselves, which is more than often famous, older versions of us  funny, awkward, movie-loving geeks.In continuing with his trend of giving lead starring roles to the actors who appeared on Freaks and Geeks and in small but hilarious supporting roles in his films  last year the breakthrough leading role was given to Seth Rogen  Forgetting Sarah Marshall stars Jason Segel, who finally gets a chance to showcase his true talent, and he certainly impresses. Besides delivering a hilarious, poignant performance in the film, Segel wrote not only the film's screenplay but also the numerous original songs that appear throughout it, including the musical numbers to the Dracula puppet musical. I can only hope that Segel will enjoy a slightly more mainstream success just like Seth Rogen has been since the release of Knocked Up last summer.But the real show-stealers are the various members of the supporting cast. First off, the Apatow regulars Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader who are funny as ever with their quick-witted, probably mostly improvised comedic performances and who provide the flair and the extra punch with their supporting turns. Next up are the totally different, very British comedic styles of Russell Brand. Anyone who has seen The Big Fat Quiz of the Year will know that his performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall is just a taste of his comedic brilliance. And then there is Mila Kunis, who takes a sharp 90-degree turn from the annoying loudmouth character of Jackie Burkhart as seen on That 70's Show and who personifies absolutely the sweetest most lovable girl possible. Kristen Bell is okay but probably the most uninspired casting in the film.In all, a very particular and absolutely hilarious sense of humour, along with a level of charm and believability elevate this film above the average romantic comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hey! Thumbs up for a good romantic comedy for a change!,"You know how movies about breakups tend to fall immediately into a pattern, becoming uninteresting and purely financial?

"funny, but nothing special","In recent years, movie spawned from the mind of film maker Judd Apatow have made a lasting impression on the comedy genre. I can't count the number of times I have sat laughing hysterically with friends while reciting hilarious lines from Superbad, Knocked Up, and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Apatow's most recent addition to the movie world is Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Unfortunately, after you see this film, ""forgetting"" is exactly what you will be doing.The basic premise of FSM is nothing new. It's the classic ""boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy wallows in self-pity and cries himself to sleep every night because he wants girl back."" And trust me, the main character Peter (Jason Segel) does a ton of childish, female-like crying. His best friend Brian (Bill Heder) is fed up with Peter moping around eating salad bowls full of Fruit Loops for every meal. So he tells him the best thing to do is take a vacation to a foreign country: Hawaii. Peter figures Hawaii is the perfect elixir to help him forget about his television star Sarah and, in doing so, get his life back together. Wrong. When Peter arrives at the hotel he runs face to face with his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell) and her new boyfriend, English pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). This sends Peter into an even deeper depression. All hope for Peter seems to be lost until he meets Rachel (Mila Kunis), a cute hotel worker with an adventurous spirit and an infectious personality. What ensues is an out of control semi-romantic vacation full of disaster. A sex obsessed tourist, a weird surf instructor, a quick witted bar tender and an overweight employee with pop star ambitions (Jonah Hill) all do their share in adding to the mayhem.FSM is not a bad movie by any means, but it wasn't a good movie either. The funniest scenes of the movie almost all revolved around Aldous Snow. Usually with films involving a breakup the new boyfriend/girlfriend character comes off as a total douche. Aldous is exactly the opposite. His facial expressions and deadpan honesty make him funny and incredibly likable. In the opening scene of the movie, we see him in a music video singing a song titled ""We've Got to Do Something."" The song and video, which are a parody of musicians who talk about climate change and so forth, feature him singing about nonsense, making humping movements with his hips, holding up signs that say things like ""sodomize intolerance"" and making out with random people on the street. In another scene, he has a hilarious piece of dialogue where he makes fun of Sarah's movie (she plays a television star in FSM) about a cell phone that murders people.Let me be frank (you can be Sam), Snow stole the show and without him this movie would have been terrible. This is a testimony to Blake's acting schools, but it also reflects the lack of funniness in the rest of the film. A member of the supporting cast outshining the lead is never a good sign. Can you imagine if someone had out-shined Jim Carey in Ace Ventura Pet Detective or Bobby Di Cicco in Ghoulies IV? I didn't think so. The verdict is in: Thumbs down.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not your average romcom,"I want to start by saying I hate rom coms. I typically find them boring and annoying and too pandering. This movie however is genius. It appeals to basically every type of humor and has an excellent plot and performances while actually delivering a good amount of real relatable humor that most people have experienced. The progression of Peter as a character and the interaction he has with the other characters is genius. I also don't want to seem biased but this is one of the only rom coms that shows perspectives from BOTH sides of a relationship but an emphasis on the man. If your homie just got broken up with, show him this movie immediately. I would consider this an essential watch for almost everyone and easily the best romantic comedy I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sarah Marshall is easy to forget,"Nicholas Stoller directed Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). Jason Segal was the scriptwriter, and also stars in the film.Segel plays Peter Bretter, a composer who has a dead-end job with a TV crime show. Kristen Bell portrays Sarah Marshall, who has been his girlfriend for five years. The film opens with Sarah dumping Peter, which is why he has to forget her.Both Peter and Sarah wind up at a resort in Hawaii. Sarah is with rockstar Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Mila Kunis portrays Rachel Jansen, receptionist at the hotel.OK--now we have a love quadrangle with two attractive women and two attractive men. In Hawaii.The problem with this movie for me is that Sarah Marshall is portrayed as a mediocre actor and a mediocre person. Why has Peter stayed with her so long? Why is it so hard for him to forget her? The premise just didn't work.The best part of the film comes at the end. If you decide to see it, and can't stand it, fast forward to that. Or don't see it--just fast forward to the end.Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a decent IMDb rating of 7.1. I disagreed, and rated it 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant comedy.,"This is one of the best written comedies of all time. It's a little bit of a bait and switch as well, because it definitely morphs into rom/com territory. Let me say though, that this movie speaks to me personally on so many levels. There is an amazing amount of healthy humility in this story. Typically, men don't want to admit when they are heartbroken. The truth of the matter is that men are just as much lovers as women, and we all can be emotional train wrecks from time to time. Jason Spegal has captured this so well with a great screenplay and an amazing performance. I have to admit, that during certain low points of my life, this movie got me to laugh at myself and start thinking more positive about the future. It's a powerful comedy, in my opinion, and perfectly captures the chaotic nature of people's love lives. It's absolutely hilarious and it might even make a tough guy cry when no one's watching. Bravo. Great job with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Unfiltered, unrelateable fun","This movie made me laugh audibly like no other I've watched in recent times, but these were more from whacky one-liners from the side cast than intelligent jokes that made the main characters more likeable. I enjoyed Jason Segal as a more attainable goal as the male protagonist in a romantic setting, with the writing playing into his awkwardness as well as matching his ginormous frame with the smallest women possible. I thought his quirky hobby was important for the plot and provided some funny moments. Personally I wouldn't have chosen Dracula musicals to be this hobby, but maybe I'm not cultured enough to get his art. Out of girlfriend love interests, I liked his original girlfriend about as much as I think I was meant to (not very much), with Mila Kunis being a lot more genuine and adventurous. The movie also has Jonah hill, Paul Rudd, and Jason Bateman with about a combined 27 lines, which tells me some cool people were behind this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An adequate romantic comedy,"This is a romantic comedy about a man who got dumped by his famous girlfriend. He escapes to Hawaii for a holiday, only to see her there with another guy.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is mostly a typical romantic comedy, with a guy having to decide which attractive ladies to have a relationship with. The portrayal of emotions he goes through is quite deep for a romantic comedy, but still the film maintains a light hearted attitude and deliver laughs. Mila Kunis is attractive and sexy, she is right for the role. Kristen Bell's feelings, especially towards the end of the film, is well expressed, making me feel a little sorry for her character.One interesting thing about ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is that it features quite a bit of male frontal nudity from Peter the leading man. Russell Brand also is not so shy about his body, but not to that extent.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is an adequate romantic comedy. It's not groundbreaking, but it is a good watch.",,Anonymous,Romance
Amusing comedy from Apatow-works,"Yet another Apatow produced movie about a schlub who is inexplicably able to attract women way too hot for him. (These movies always make me wonder about the lives of screenwriters; does the access to Hollywood starlets convince them that getting women is easy, or if they are simply writing the world they want.) And like most of the movies from the Apatow factory, this one is pretty funny.The plot is very simple, with a guy getting dumped, brooding then going on vacation where he has the misfortune to run into his ex. There is the predictable new love interest, the funny new beau of the ex, and the usual confusion displayed by people who were once in love.While the movie doesn't exactly explore new territory, it is quite funny. There are many amusing offbeat characters and silly gags. But what makes this work is that the movie genuinely cares about its characters, and even shows a little interest in their emotional underpinnings.It's still pure guy wish-fulfillment, and total nonsense, but it is also funny and likable. Just a warning to schlubs everywhere: you're not going to have this life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Segel strikes gold with his script and charismatic performance.  A real winner and adorable comedy.,"Ah, Judd Apatow and his band of hilarious misfits. FSM features the lowest amount of Apatow regular cast members (3, I believe) of all those movies, but is no less funny than the likes of Knocked Up and Walk Hard. What you have with FSM and all the other Apatow joints is a constant theme of vulgar yet lovable humor, and a beautiful underlying romance. These themes are consistent in The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Walk Hard, and to an extent, Anchorman. What is truly great about all these films is that they bring a different thing to the table each time. They are NOT carbon copies of each other, which is absolutely excellent.The plot of FSM, as with the other Apatow movies, is straightforward, but evolves as the movie goes on: Peter (Jason Segel) is broken up with by his beautiful TV star girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell), and decides to take a vacation away from Los Angeles to get his mind off Sarah...of course, who should be vacationing at the same place as him but Sarah herself?One thing that is very important to remember is that though we call these movies ""Apatow"" movies, more often than not, Judd Apatow does not write or direct the movie. This is true with Superbad, Anchorman, Walk Hard (he wrote, not directed it), and this film. The lead actor Jason Segel is behind the script, and it proves to be among the best of the bunch. The dialog is witty, sharp, vulgar, and just plain irresistible. Segel's ability to charm the audience is also no less prevalent. He's a lovable leading man, and I would love to see him do this again. The audience is going to love Peter all throughout the film, and Segel gives far and away the best show of his career, out doing his work in Knocked Up and How I Met Your Mother. The other Apatow cronies that show up in FSM are Jonah Hill (who seems to be in pretty much every single one of them) and Paul Rudd. One could consider supporting performer Bill Hader a member of the group, and if you include him and his great performance as Peter's brother, you get 4. The film also features cameos from William Baldwin and Jason Bateman.The main supporting cast, always integral to the plot, is great. First you have Sarah Marshall, played by Kristen Bell. Bell, despite playing one of the most unlikable characters of recent memory, managed to make me feel for Sarah at some points, without completely stealing attention from Segel and the actual love interest of the film. Good job by the TV veteran Bell. You've also got British comedian Russell Brand nearly stealing the show as well as he steals Sarah from Peter in the film. He's one of the best parts of the movie and couldn't have been funnier. He also holds one of the funniest lines in the film, opposite Jonah Hill. Lastly, but surely not not least, is another TV star, Mila Kunis. Famous for her roles as Jackie on That 70's Show and Meg Griffin of Family Guy, Kunis creates yet another memorable character, Rachel Jansen, that is tailored perfectly to her talents. I absolutely LOVED her character. She brought out the best in Peter and the chemistry between her and Segel is wonderful.I'd say that this would have to be the cleanest and least vulgar of the Apatow 'R' rated comedies as far as dialog goes...however, the now infamous nude scenes of Jason Segel hold nothing back. Director Nicholas Stoller does a great job of using Segel's manhood to his advantage (wow, that sounds wrong). I wonder how awkward the cast and crew felt around Segel when those scenes were being shot. I really loved this movie, though it sort of falters towards the end, but the ending more than makes up for it (it's absolutely adorable).FSM is yet another winning Apatow movie that is lovable, vulgar, and absolutely adorable. Jason Segel gives one of the better comedic performances of recent memory in a movie that should be a bright spot on his career and on the careers of everyone involved. I really think you should see this film if you get the chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing spectacular,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall follows the same formula than 40 yr old Virgin, Knocked up and Super Cool but to be honest I didn't feel the same impact that the other movies had. Yeah it may have some funny moments but in general the jokes aren't that funny. The story isn't that original and the plot is kinda predictable. The cast is good, Jason Segel made a decent and funny performance but for God's sake keep your clothes on. Mila Kunis proving that she can act and be funny at the same time. Kristen Bell was good, doing the necessary and Russell Brand was very funny. Maybe the best of this movie was the photography, the landscapes from Hawaii were beautiful. In conclusion, if your are a Judd Apatow fan this movie is for you if not then you can watch it just to waste your time",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

On a whim, and heavily suggested by his brother, Peter flies to Hawaii for a vacation. There he meets Rachel, a beautiful young lady, played by the unequaled Mila Kunis. Side not, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous as they happen to be on vacation at the same hotel. I know! Peter starts to develop feelings for Rachel and Sarah does not make this easy. There is a whole lot of hilarity thrown in. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as well in the small role afforded him here.

This was the funniest movie of the year,Forgetting Sara Marshall was one of the funniest movie I have ever seen. It was a very fun movie to watch from beginning to end. I thought that from the start of this movie it had you laughing till the very end. It starts out with the boyfriend getting dumped. Then he plans to take a trip to get over his ex girlfriend. When he gets to the place he sees his ex girlfriend. Then the fun begins. They try to make each other very jealous. I loved how the whole movie pretty much took place in Hawaii. It was very raunchy and had some great funny sex scenes. They talked a lot about sex pretty much the whole movie also. For the girls who go to see this movie they had a guy that showed his penis. The girls never showed their breasts besides for on pictures. I think that many teenagers and adults would enjoy this movie. besides for raunchy and many sex scenes it had some good messages. I didn't think that this movie would have a lot of meaning but it did. I loved the story behind this movie. The acting was very good and they were cool to watch. The visuals all mostly took place in Hawaii. The romance in it was good. In my opinion this didn't really copy off of any other movies. It was pretty original. They had many flashbacks of Sara Marshall and her ex boyfriend. Overall this was a fun and enjoyable movie. It's well worth your money.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

very funny,"Jason Segel screenwrites a film where the protagonist gets to be naked and hug Kristen Bell and then Mila Kunis. And have a montage of sex scenes with various hot women. And then gets himself cast as the protagonist. You have to hand it to the guy - he isn't shy. But, in his defence, he can write. This is a funny, well-acted film that evokes great performances from the ensemble cast. Love him or hate him, Russell Brand riffs brilliantly off his own persona here. Mila Kunis is naturalistic and manages to inject range into her character, with sympathy, rage, pity and anger all brought to the fore at various points in a plausible display that never reaches. There is hardly a missed beat here; even minor characters such as the best friend's wife, only ever seen on a Skype screen, are either cute or laugh-out-loud funny.

I wanted it to be good but I don't think I had incredibly high expectations (I really expected silliness). My husband was equally surprised at how boring and unfunny the movie was. He had no objection to missing the last part of the film, because he too didn't care how it ended.

Jason Segal is good, he nailed the comedy and even some more dramatic scenes, had both down.

The script and the dialogue is funny sometimes, well most of the time, it's never really bad, just had its shining moments and it's alright moments. Now I did kinda take some issue with Jason's full frontal male nudity, it was meant to be comical, but I felt more uncomfortable then amused, especially since he isn't particularly all that physically attractive (sorry :/).

Apatow comedy comes roaring back to new heights,"How is it possible that one man could be behind so many of the decade's best comedies? It seemed like Judd Apatow hit his peak with 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" a film that sky- rocketed both his and actor Steve Carrell's career. But the successes did not come without failures. While last year's ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" continued to redefine comedy, there was also ""Walk Hard"" and ""Drillbit Taylor,"" films that led audiences to believe he was getting stale.But fear not, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" not only eliminates that trend, it might very well have established an era of comedy in movie history with Judd Apatow as the reigning emperor.""Sarah Marshall"" is hysterical, gutsy, clever, sweet and real. It hits on all the things that make Apatow comedy successful while conquering new comedic territory. While it's easiest to give Apatow all the credit, however, Jason Segel deserves his encore. The ""How I Met Your Mother"" star has a terrifically written script that is powdered and pampered by Apatow's connections (the ability to put Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill in as small, very funny parts).What Segel has tapped into about comedy through his writing is that there is no reason to be afraid of what is real. What's real is what is funny and then when you throw in some ridiculous twists through strange or unusually funny characters, you have a great, easily likable comedy. While previous Apatow films push in that direction, ""Sarah Marshall"" seems to hit it the most directly, especially in a film where the plot is essentially about a guy getting over a girl.In addition to a terrific script, ""Sarah Marshall"" has a wealth of unique, humorous characters and young, sure to bloom after this film, talent. While lead actresses Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis have a solid amount of credits, the exposure from this film might very well shape their careers in the future. Bottom line, there is so much talent and humor here that when you try and recall all the best characters with the best lines, you find yourself forgetting some.While Judd Apatow will most likely find a share of failures, the amount of great comedies will continue to emerge and the money will likely keep rolling in. Only horrendous reviews could stop someone from going to see something with his name attached to it. This film forecasts a great 2008 for Apatow Productions or at the very least making a profit on ""Step Brothers"" and ""Pineapple Express""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
surprise,"I'm not exactly sure what I liked about this movie but I did. It was really one of those romantic comedies that I would usually complain didn't have enough laugh out-loud moments to keep me into it, and I can certainly say I've come to expect more from this writer but there was enough chemistry from the actors and enough quirky little moments that I came away happy with my viewing. It's been weeks now and I still find myself singing the Dracula song to my wife in a thick Transylvanian accent and it still gets a warm reception. I was also surprised to so easily accept ""That 70's Show's 'Jackie"" on the big screen but she handled her role like a pro and I'm guessing my already established history with the actress had me a little more emotionally vested in her relationship than the script actually earned. Regardless of the personal mystery I came away pleased and have to say it's a pretty decent movie. Even that British fellow I had already decided I hated after the MTV awards partially won me over in this one. My only other real critique is the story seemed to think it made us really hate Sarah Marshall when they had actually gave us some room to see where she was coming from.

Now that is called humour !!,"Jason Segel is trying to forget his girlfriend who breaks up with him at the very beginning of the flick and forgetting her is what he actually endeavours in the entire movie. Although it isn't as easy as it seems. Every time he tries to get away from her he deliberately ends up getting close to her.The movie is a comedy and of course a romantic one with a great star cast (most of them are my favourites). Who doesn't love Russell Brand and wait he shows up as Aldous Snow the psychotic singer who is the current boyfriend of Kristen Bell. Mila Kunis is a receptionist at Hawaii where Jason Segel goes to mend his broken heart and ends up finding his girlfriend with Aldous Snow, (although I'm pretty sure that was an intentional attempt too). Mila Kunis aids him at the time of need which grabs the attention of Jason who finds her attractive and caring. She dates him (so he says) and starts liking her although he isn't able to move on as Sarah shows up every now and then. This however causes some tension between Mila and Jason which leaves a miffed Mila eventually. Now it is the job of Jason to move on, stop thinking about his ex and make matters straight with Mila Kunis who is in deeply in love with him.The movie has some great characters like Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd etc. who added flavour to the comedy.I personally like Jason Segel for his acting and he happens to be one of my favourite actors for the character Marshall Eriksen the one he plays in 'How I met your mother'. I have seen him act in a couple of movies and I must say I am pretty impressed with his comedy.

Well thought movie and a total entertainment,"I thought Forgetting Sarah Marshall was going to be one of those chick flick movies that would be to cheesy for me, but apparently not. Jason Segel really played a good role as a guy going to a heartbreak. For people who experienced that feeling, I'm sure this movie would be enjoyable. As I watched it, there was so much emotions that i can reflect back and certain behaviors that Jason Segel portrayed in the movie. By shooting it in Hawaii, made it really ironic because it's usually a place to have love instead of escaping from one, which was well thought. The the two girls with totally different personality that Peter (Jason Segel) had to deal with and played by Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis, made the movie exciting. So many love and sex jokes in this movie. If people would like some funny, not-cheesy love stories, this movie would be one. This movie contains many love and life morals that made me change my thought on how I see certain things,which is good in some ways. Although it's not great and not an Oscar quality movie, it's totally an entertainment for those people who needs something to watch over weekend, it's worth a shot.

There's a reason most movies don't include scenes like that - because it's not appealing, not necessary and most certainly not funny.The movie's plot was basically: guy loves girl, girl cheats, guy finds another girl, messes up. The end. The movie is 1 hr 15 mins long - and even that felt like too much.Russell Brand, whilst he tried, came across as a bland, boring character and Jonah Hill (who played the waiter) couldn't even out this mess of a movie.With an unnecessary shock-scene in the beginning, atrocious storyline, poor dialogue and lack of pace, this movie gets a 1/10 from me. If it wasn't for Russell and Jonah, this movie would be a 0/10 (if I could rate it so low).Bottom line: Don't rent it, don't watch it. It's trash. If you ignore my message, then all I can say is: I told you so.Thanks for reading. Now I'm going to try find another comedy to cheer me up, because this movie didn't.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mila!,"Lightweight romantic comedy about a guy who goes to Hawaii to forget his ex-girlfriend, a self-absorbed TV actress who has taken up with a raunchy rock star. Unfortunately, the ex and her new beau show up in the very same place the schmo has flown to. No matter what he does, he can't seem to get away from her or the new boyfriend. But he does meet a nice girl working at his hotel, and romance soon blossoms. Meanwhile, the rock star dumps the ex. Guess where all of this is going, folks! Formulaic, occasionally funny, an easy film to watch on a slow Saturday night. Kristen Bell is the TV actress and Mila Kunis is the hotel worker. In all honesty, I think I would have switched their roles. Russel Brand as the obnoxious singer has a truly funny, if vulgar, bit performing his hit song, ""I'm Inside Of You,"" with pelvic thrusts that would make Elvis blush. Really, this one is for the girls. Guys, beware. Although I must say Kunis would be sexy simply reading the phone book. Jason Segal as the schmo gets the role Ben Miller would have played about 10 years before.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ignore the trailers, this is a brilliant comedy!","I approached this film with more than a little apprehension, especially after the lackluster trailers. Russel Brandt? Acting? ""Poor Casting"" was my immediate thought.How wrong I was. The adverts did not do the film any sort of justice in portraying how hilarious this film is. I went to see this with two of my mates, both male, as there wasn't much else on at the cinema, and we were all extremely glad we watched. This was a real laugh out loud comedy, with the (slightly immature) humour never letting up. I haven't spoken t to one person who didn't love ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". So, if you haven't seen it, go now!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Among family is better,"The Judd Apatow produced ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is one of the latest examples of a comedy form in American cinema that hopefully still has some things to show us. It's also a movie made in family, in which you feel everyone had a really good time and worked really hard so you could laugh out loud; and don't forget, the work of people that have respect for each other and their talents.Some time ago, the humble Apatow directed a script co-written by him and Steve Carell; ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", and gave Carell the lead role. He had already worked with him in ""Anchorman"", which is not another story because both movies share, among other things, cast members. Then came ""Knocked Up"", an opportunity for Seth Rogen to steal the show; then Rogen wrote the script of ""Superbad"" and was also part of the cast; then Jason Segel (just Jason in ""Knocked Up"") wrote a script, which ended up in the film I'm reviewing, directed by another writer, Nicholas Stoller.Essentially, everything here is about the script. What the script requires, the movie will deliver. After we meet Peter (Segel), naked, being dumped by the super famous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) and we hear him cry, we also want what his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hader, from ""Superbad""-and ""Knocked Up""-) recommends for him: a vacation.In Hawaii everything looks more colorful, and I don't know if Segel knows much about the culture and the people there, but the way the script puts it, the beach and the hotel where Peter ends up seem to be paradise; specially when a beautiful woman (Mila Kunis) salutes you at the reception. But is it paradise if your ex-girlfriend is staying there with her new guy (a British rockstar wonderfully overplayed by Russel Brand)? I don't need to tell you how funny this movie is because you should know already for the people who made it, although I'll tell you how they admirably work to make it funny. They save us discussions and dialogs about the couple breaking up by going directly to the point; they provide us a vacation with plenty of characters to meet and supply each one of them with a killer line that is not repeated later (smartly, thankfully) for a greater effect-there's only character played by Jack McBrayer that has an inevitably continued joke-; they even make sure we know some of the people we meet (Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill get us an instant smile when we meet them and we feel that we are safe among friends).Segel's screenplay is hard work, developing one character that shares the 'Apatow sindrome' (not to good looking but scoring a strikingly good-looking girl, not getting out of home, few friends, tenderly-or not-addicted to sex) but somehow strikes as different. Segel's writing and his performance make us see a sensitive and committed guy in the way Peter speaks but don't forget to show us the flashbacks of a relationship that most of the time made him look stupid (anything for the sake of a good laugh). The script also dominates the shape of the modern romantic comedy, with its typical structure, adding some elegant personal touches that are all of Segel's merit.The film is not better than others like ""Knocked Up"" because in the whole development of Peter, the movie forgets about the rest of the characters and loses a bit of the Apatow humanity. The women are not fully developed (in fact, the Sarah Marshall of the title seems like a heartless doll, which is in part the point) and there's a lot of the friendship factor, values and talks missing.It's all good though, because the honesty is still there, and because the movie runs too long again and we don't complain (thank you Jason Bateman there in the credits). We just keep laughing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very solid comedy!,"There's something really quite lovable about this film. It's nothing revolutionary but it does exactly you want it to do. It's a goofy late night comedy that knows what it is and embraces this fully.The plot was pretty straight forward. Peter and Sarah break up and in an attempt to clear his head and move on, Peter heads to Hawaii. Unfortunately Sarah happens to be staying at the same resort with her new boyfriend. As you can imagine, hilarity and farce ensues. A very simple premise but executed very well. It never felt overly corny or cliched, although it was highly predictable. Forgetting Sarah Marshall makes for a lovely, bite sized and easy watch.A lot of this enjoyment is down to the cast and characters. This is the first Segal written film I've seen, and he knows his way around a comedy character that's for sure. His character, Peter, was simply a fun character to spend a couple of hours with. He wasn't overly mopey which could have been draining had that been the direction Segal decided to go down. There wasn't anything too remarkable about Sarah or Rachel (played by Bell and Kunis respectively). They were decent enough characters and both had enough back story and development to make them interesting. One criticism would be of Russel Brand's Aldous Snow, who I was borderline bored of come the end of the film. He's an eclectic character, and thankfully the film toed the line with his inclusion, which could have been too much in my opinion.The real triumph comes with the supporting cast. So many great comedy actors in this film which I had no idea about. Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig (albeit briefly), Paul Rudd! You'd expect nothing less than excellence from these comedy veterans, and that's what we got. Hill's character was spot on for me, exactly my kind of humour and a real highlight of the film. Bill Hader was also excellent, delivering some fantastic dialogue.I'd find it hard to believe anybody hating Forgetting Sarah Marshall. It's not a revolutionary comedy, and if you've seen other Apatow productions you'll be familiar with some of the character/comedy styles, but that's by no means a bad thing. I had a blast watching this film, and will definitely be watching it again. A feel good comedy which won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Far better than expected,"I expected this would be another shallow chick flick with recycled jokes and two-dimensional characters. Luckily this movie far exceeded my expectations. It is a funny, fairly original comedy with a decent amount of character development. It especially surprised me how both Sarah and her new boy-friend are portrayed not simply as self-absorbed jerks. In the course of the movie you will probably find Aldous a weird but likable guy, whilst you will understand why Peter's and Sarah's relationship failed. The flashbacks of their relationship are very entertaining because it will certainly remind you of a relationship you or your friends had (or have). Overall, the casting department did a really good job and each of the characters got some good laughs on their side. Jonah Hill's role was a bit superfluous in my opinion, whilst Jack McBrayer really cracked me up by playing just another version of his role in '30 Rock'. Russel Brand's character was my favourite, very well written and played. There are a few sex scenes and vulgar jokes, but they come in small doses such that it won't put people off who do not appreciate this kind of humour. Go watch this for some light and not too brainless entertainment!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)-review,"This kind of film is by no means my kind of film and I was not really expecting a great deal from it considering that it was ""from the guys who brought you The 40 year-old virgin"". However it has to be said that this is a very funny film it did genuinely make my laugh out loud on more than one occasion and has a semi original story line.The acting is not exactly the highest order but there are many funny performances in this film. At first I was critical of Russel Brand for doing this film as it seemed to me he was putting his wallet before his reputation and back bone so to speak but he is without a doubt a very funny man and this is evident in the film itself. He provides many laugh out loud moments as he is basically playing himself so his trade mark humour shines through. Jason Segel provides a good main character and is not to short in the laughs department also. Jonah Hill plays a hotel clerk with an unhealthy obsession with Brand's rock star character and is almost as funny Brand but is only playing a minor character.Bill Hader and Paul Rudd are also very funny in their respective roles.It must be said that the story is not really anything new when it comes right down to it and at times the story and event are very predictable but that does not take away from the film on the whole.very funny but with its faults like any other film of this genre 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll Soon be Forgetting Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"It's no surprise that this film pretty much divides opinion between the young and not-so-young (according to the user ratings) and, to a lesser extent, between women and men. You'd expect it to be a chick flick rom-com (if you forgot that Judd Apatow was involved) but, with its irreverent gross-out comedy and stock of hot females, it's no wonder that it appeals to young men.Jason Segel stars as Peter, a musician who finds himself dumped by his TV star girlfriend. On the advice of his slightly nerdy friend, Peter decides to fly to Hawaii to forget her, but guess what? She's only there! At the same hotel! Who'd have thought it? Unfortunately, she's there with the man she dumped Peter for, a hairy rock star played by the witless Russell Brand. This being a product of La-La land, it's absolutely impossible for either party to consider changing hotels, so the hapless Peter runs into his ex and her new man everywhere he goes. Luckily for him there's a luscious receptionist on hand to help soothe his painThe film's amiable enough, but it struggles to find many laughs in such a clichéd situation. Many scenes and situations seem to have been created for no apparent reason: a sub-plot involving a dorky pair of newlyweds goes nowhere and is abruptly dropped, leaving you to wonder why it was included in the first place; Pete's ex's TV programme is dropped while she's on holiday but, after a brief conversation, is also forgotten. Apparently the story is based on the writer's own break up from an actress, so maybe there's some kind of catharsis going on here, but that doesn't excuse a plot that is more merely a collection of incidents than a properly constructed narrative.Jason Segel makes a likable leading man, although, like most of us, he looks immeasurably better in his clothes than out of them. He just about manages to get the audience on his side, even though his character would no doubt be something of a nightmare to live with and he would be lucky to maintain a meaningful relationship with a woman for five months let alone five years. Kristen Bell as his errant girlfriend looks yummy, but her character is poorly written. Is she a heartless cow, confused, or simply at the end of her tether? Whatever she is, the script treats her with something approaching contempt much of the time. Mila Kunis, as Segel's true love outshines Bell in every department (can she really be the voice of Meg in Family Guy?), but again her character lacks consistency. Russell Brand manages to be marginally less annoying then he normally is, which is probably the biggest compliment he'll ever receive from me.This isn't a great film by any measure, but its popularity will probably prove enduring enough to ensure it's shown every other day on some second-tier satellite channel.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

New low,"This film finds a new rock bottom. The theater was unfortunately full. The buzz from this film was very effective in bringing millions of people to spend money on this film. How do slime films like this manage to make so many people between fifteen and twenty five think they have to see it. This film is full of gross stuff that is degrading to the audience and degrading to this country. Of course, it will also degrade worldwide audiences.This terrible streak of nasty, gross, immoral, and despicable comedies began around the time of the sleazy American Pie. This idea of comedy is to keep pushing the envelope further and further into absolute decadence. Hollywood has convinced movie viewers that each one of these movies is extremely important to see. But these films are worthless. The bottom has fallen out in film comedy and sleaze and bad taste is now the norm. Comedy has now become a tragedy.Occasionally a comedy is decent like Drillbit Taylor. In general, Hollywood thinks that we are sleazy idiots.This is surely the darkest review I have written. But this film has hit rock bottom.

A reasonably amusing romantic comedy,"I found this to be a reasonably amusing romantic comedy. Jason Segel's comedic oeuvre seems to be finding himself in utterly humiliating situations, and proceeding through with that hangdog expression, and that's what he does here. Some of the stuff works better than others, like his self-abnegating song, and the Dracula puppet musical. Others, not so much. Russel Brand as the totally self-absorbed rock star was pretty funny, too. Kristen Bell looked good, and did her not-terribly-likable role pretty well. The show-stealing was done by Mila Kunis, with whom I am not familiar. Her fresh prettiness was perfect for her role, which she nailed.

will not forget Forgetting Sarah Marshall so soon...,"To tell the truth, I went to this movie with doubts. Some comments read this movie as not funny. But it is after all an Apatow production. What's more, I really like Jason Segel from ""How I met Your Mother"" and was curious as to his abilities as a writer. And with Paul Rudd, Russell Brand, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and others, this movie seemed to be potentially perfect.I was not let down, actually I was surprised! This movie IS really good! It's funny in the right ways, its charming to the right point, and its simply pure fun!I believe what I like in the formula of this line of comedies is the lack of pretentiousness, focusing on our hero who is an antithesis to a hero and using extraordinary events around a really ordinary person. The jokes are not mainly ""hit on the head"" jokes. I found more depth and intelligence to a lot of them.In the end what really convinced me was that in our cinema hall people from all ages laughed together, whether they were in their 20th, 30th or even 60th.I believe this movie is for everyone in the mood for 2 hours of cinema love and fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is anything but forgettable.","In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" musician Peter Bretter -- played by Jason Segel of ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Freaks & Geeks"" fame -- finds himself at the receiving end of a dumping by way of his TV-star girlfriend, the titular character of Sarah Marshall (Kirsten Bell). It goes without saying that he takes it rough, attempting to heal his wounds by boozing it up day and night, slumming in a string of one-night stands and barely catching a glimpse of daylight. It's not bad enough that every time he turns on the TV or goes to work he has to see her face (he provides the score for her TV show), but when he decides to take off to Hawaii in hopes of fading her from his memory, she happens to be staying at the exact same resort as him, with her new lover, the charismatic rock-star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) in tow. With a little help from a desk-clerk played by Mila Kunis, he starts to come to terms with his predicament, while simultaneously finding new love and a renewed sense of passion for a long in-the-works rock opera about Dracula -- with puppets.What makes ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" great, and what sets it aside from typical break-up comedy fare is that it's also a movie about finding the drive and ambition within yourself to do what truly makes you happy. It's in the same vein as other Judd Apatow fare such as ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" in that while it's got a filthy mind, it's also got substantial heart. This flick, while being an Apatow production, was actually written by its star, Jason Segel, giving it a very personal feeling. Nothing is overly sugar-coated, as Segel finds himself in awkward moments that are a little too realistic to be works of fiction. The supporting cast -- consisting of Apatow regulars and otherwise -- are as wild as they seem natural at times. Mila Kunis is stunning and sweet as Peter's newfound love-interest, while Kirsten Bell plays the manipulative, confused ex-girlfriend to a T. Russell Brand isn't so much playing the role of the self-absorbed, sex-nuts rocker, as he is playing a character that seems to exist within himself. Other, slightly minor roles from Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill and Jack McBrayer provide some of the more off-color humor of the film. Its a well-rounded film that will speak volumes to many people, regardless of where they are at in their lives. Segel's script keeps things feeling real, playing it close to the chest and not afraid to delve into the most awkward and true-to-life situations. Its ending is a bit clichéd, but would you want it any other way? Overall, you'll leave this one feeling satisfied and with a little left to chew on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great comedy,"Nicholas Stoller has put together a great comedy, and Jason Segel, who also wrote the script, does a solid job as the main character. He's funny, he's believable and you sympathize with his situation. There are several hysterical moments in this movie, and unless you think nudity is something ugly we need to be protected from, you'll going to have a good time. The movie does what it sets out to do - give you some light entertainment - nothing more, nothing less.Comedies can something get a bit too silly or ""over the top"", but this on track.

It has been a long time since I had such a good laugh, thanks to all who made it possible.

"One of the very worst, least funny movies that I've ever seen","This is without doubt one of the worst and least funny movies that I've ever seen. I have nothing against nudity, male or female, and one of my favorite comedies of all time is the original Harold and Kumar (White Castle), and I mention that just to give you some background. Now that I done that, let me first say that there is nothing whatsoever funny about a penis. If a penis was intrinsically funny, men in locker rooms would all be laughing their heads off. I've been in plenty of locker rooms where there is plenty of penis to be seen, but I've never once seen anyone laughing about it. There just isn't anything funny about a penis. What I've written here is probably ten times as funny as anything in this non-funny movie.The story is just lame, and is not meaningfully distinct from any one of several similar movies that have been made over the past twenty-five years, most of them being a whole lot funnier than this.The real test of whether a movie is really funny, is whether the people in the theater are genuinely laughing, or whether a handful of mentally deranged people are letting out the occasional loud shriek every time that someone in the movie says a dirty word. I have nothing against dirty words when they are used in a way that is truly funny, but a dirty word in and of itself is just not funny, any more than a penis in and of itself would be funny.The first really funny thing in this movie, that made me laugh at all, was just after an hour into the movie, when Peter finally stood up on his surfboard and then something unexpected happened. There was another moderately funny scene shortly after that, when Peter and Sarah were both trying to be as loud as possible while doing it, so that the other one, on the opposite side of the wall, would hear them and be jealous. But that wasn't really all that funny, and this is hardly the first time that I've seen this very joke. Those were the only two moderately funny moments in the entire movie.I hate movies that are supposed to be funny but that obviously are not, as evidenced by that occasional loud, forced laugh that the same three or four people down toward the front of the theater let go of once every few minutes, usually when there isn't anything that is the least bit funny, unless of course you think that the sight of a penis is funny, or you think that anything that you would not say or want anyone else to say in front of your mother is funny.This movie is just bad. It isn't the least bit funny. It is just a bad movie. It was a complete waste of time and money. I would not even recommend it for the cost of a DVD rental. The only thing that I can't understand is how on earth this horrible, forgettable movie garnered an 8.2 viewer rating on IMDb. I just can't believe that that many people are that retarded to find anything funny in this movie.I will never again put any credence in an IMDb viewer rating. The movie that I intend to see next is ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"". I need something to remind me that I really don't have a problem with humor that is in questionable taste, as long as it really is funny. Hey, I even liked Borat. In fact, Borat was hilarious. But this movie was not in the least bit funny. It is a truly forgettable piece of junk.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not like other romantic moves you've seen, nor like comedies and its far beyond romantic-comedies (as far as I got it).

A few GOOD laughs, many moments that cause you to grin or just smile but many where you're just amazed by the seriousness of the movie. I mean, the thing was to picture the suffering and love and fun and whatever feeling and it succeeded pretty good.

Russell Brand is the Major Highlight,"Jason Segel proves he's more than just a great supporting character actor as he writes and stars in another highlight from producer Judd Apatow's crew. Based on his own break-up experiences, Segel wrote the film around Peter Bretter, a musician who is dumped by his TV star girlfriend (the titular Sarah Marshall). In an effort to pull himself from his miserable situation, Peter vacations to Hawaii and finds himself staying at the same resort as Sarah and her new boyfriend, English glam-rocker Aldous Snow. Through the course of his stay in Hawaii, Peter deals with Sarah's new relationship while meeting the odd locals and, more importantly, the cute hotel clerk.As with Apatow's ""Knocked Up"", this movie doesn't have as much in-your-face laugh-out-loud moments but it's still got great comedic performances from the entire cast. Seriously though, the funniest part of the whole film was Russell Brand as Aldous Snow. That man was so funny, he stole every scene he was in. I also wish Paul Rudd (as over-backed surf instructor Koonu) and Bill Hader (as Peter's step-brother Brian) had larger parts in the film, as they were hilarious. Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis give great honest performances as the key players, so it all adds up to make the film of my favorite from the Apatow canon.This movie is great from anyone who has ever found themselves in the same situation as it helps you see it all with a comedic eye. I loved the characters and we're introduced to Russell Brand, whom I hope to see in more Apatow films in the future. The movie did seem to wander aimlessly at points but it never became boring, as there was always something funny around the corner. It feels a bit long in its near two-hour runtime but it doesn't feel wasted. I generally don't go for romantic comedies but this is one of the best I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really surprisingly great!,"A genuinely funny comedy, I went in to the film feeling slightly unsure, despite being a huge fan of some of the actors involved, but all of my fears were completely cleared away within the first 10 minutes. It's a very solid film with huge laughs and few weak moments. I fell in love with all of the characters, I cared about them very genuine, lovable and 3D. I was never bored and I was actually in pain from laughing. Russell Brand is particularly good playing the dippy drug addled over sexed rock star, Kristen Bell was perfectly cast as Sarah Marshall and writer/actor Jason Segel was absaloutly wonderful, his performance made the film. The ending was heart warming (if slightly predictable)without being to sickly sweet. It was the best comedy I've seen in a long long time",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hey, why? Eh!","Forgiving, for a moment, that this is Mr. Nicholas Stoller's first attempt at directing, we can say, with all honesty, that this attempt is also as easily forgettable. With Jason Segel who on par with Vince Vaughn as to total charisma by-pass, this laid out road map of a movie is at least amusing to the extremes of bewilderment as to ask what was the point? Set in the lush location of Hawaii, this beautiful island is more looking like the flotsam and jetsam of bad scripts, limited efforts' and a weak plot to the point of sheer tedium.There is a level of predictability in, certain, movies that when having crossed a certain level, usually the lowest, then turns any movie into outright worthlessness, Forgetting Sarah Marshall falls snugly into this description, too. Predictability, here, is the name of the game, added with the dull, and more than often, painful dialogue, this all to obvious direction throughout is seen as lazy or just plain unimaginative.With little attempt to convey any higher ground of thought to the narrative, this stance leaves nothing but an open road with no turns, twists, slip roads and bends to excite and planning this journey can be so easily done with ones eyes closed, such is the obvious horizons' that this film projects.Then, apart from the shady editing, being choppy at best, in other places very poor, in particular during the conversation between Aldous Snow and Matthew the Waiter and the demo disc. There is too the gags; simple, cold and listless, with comedy it needs a character, a character with persona, wit and timing, this lifeless, dull and time wasting exercise deals no punches and only solidifies itself in a similar vain to a petrified forest. The only redeeming artifice here is the wit of one Russell Brand, who seems to have the best lines here too, and with this self loving man of free love, and too, the newly-weds of desperation, is the films only real redemption. It really is a pity that this characterisation was not carried off to other members of the cast, otherwise, this may have faired well in the road to recovery, instead it is well worth remembering that it only takes a slight wrong turn and very quickly ends up looking like road kill.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The guys of the Judd Apatow camp strike comedy magic once again.,"This is all from our website, mysocialstandards.blogspot.com/ if you want to see more...All good things come to an end, and because of this, I know it's only a matter of time before these Judd Apatow movies lose their luster. The seemingly endless list of recent successes that he has touched include Superbad, 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Talladega Nights, and Anchorman. When you put those together with his TV successes, you are assembling one ""fairly"" impressive resume. Well, after viewing Sarah Marshall, it looks as if we (thankfully) are going to have to wait a bit longer for that ""end"" to happen.Director Nicholas Stoller and writer/star, Jason Segel combine to create the perfect romantic comedy that satisfies both the guys and the girls in the audience. The raw comedy may not have been as high as Superbad or the 40-Year Old Virgin, but that doesn't mean that it was lacking as I laughed from beginning to end. As a writer, Segel made the characters extremely likable and easy to relate to. The magic in this movie is that you could sympathize with everybody from Peter (our main character), Sarah (the actress/ex-girlfriend), Rachel (hotel front-desk clerk), and even Aldous (the European rock-star new boyfriend of Sarah who may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but still seems like a cool guy) as they suffer from heartbreak, embarrassment, confusion, awkwardness and grief.I actually had the chance to partake in a focus group for the previews of Forgetting Sarah Marshall a couple months ago, therefore watching the many forms of the trailers several times (at least I got paid to do it). While some of the previews make the movie look like your classic ""girl breaks up with boy and boy getting back at girl,"" (without getting into too much detail) Segel's script did a nice job of steering clear of that as life rarely allows us to act in such a way. Instead, that is replaced with criss-crossing relationships and complexities that even the best of us can relate with. And other then being forced to look at Jason's prosthetically enhanced 11th appendage about five times too many, I was very happy to be involved in these characters lives for the two hours of this movie, and there is a good chance I will see it again soon.Writing: Writing a comedic romantic-comedy can't be easy. The genre has been done so many times that usually either a) they are all the same jokes or b) everyone tries to be so original that it just comes off as corny and unrealistic. While not a perfect script, Forgetting Sarah Marshall does well at keeping the characters real, not allowing the story to become too predictable, and including well placed one-liners to keep the audience off-balance.Verdict: SEE IT TONIGHT. Bring a date. It is worth the price of admissionand an overpriced popcorn and Coke  it's only 25 cents more for the large after all.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Comedy of '08 So Far!,"If I hadn't won tickets to see this movie last night, I might not have seen it until it came out on DVD and I was able to watch it at home, avoiding the outrageously high prices at my local theater. Let me say that I LOVED this movie, its cast, and the humor in the writing -- and I would pay to see it again and again if I could afford it. That's just how much I loved it.Sarah Marshall is an actress on a show called ""Crime Scene"" and her boyfriend Peter Bretter writes the music for the show. She breaks up with him within the first five minutes, and he becomes this sad, pathetic, crying mess soon afterward. When he can't get his mind off her, he decides to go to a resort in Hawaii that she had mentioned to him a few times before, unknowingly arriving at the same place that Sarah is with her new boyfriend... and trouble ensues, as with most movies of this particular genre! I figured ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" would be this sappy chick flick peppered with some humor here and there, but I didn't give it nearly enough credit. It's not sappy, and I definitely wouldn't consider it a chick flick; it's got a little something for everyone (unless, of course, you're under 17 -- and I wouldn't recommend taking anyone under that age to see it, either). The humor is somewhat crude at times, but will still make you laugh to exhaustion, though the nudity often caught me off guard, and there are elements of a romance plugged into the plot, which will please the women who see this movie.Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Bill Hader (probably best known for ""SNL""), and the unknown Russell Brand really came together and pulled off this hilarious movie. I definitely recommend seeing it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hysterical Sarah Marshall,"In a hysterical scene, Sarah Marshall (gorgeous Kristen Bell) complains that ex-boyfriend Peter (Jason Segal) can't ""rise' to the occasion in an intimate tryst. In reply Peter (Segal) screams, ""Could it be that you broke my heart into a million pieces?"" I was laughing so hard at this, and at all of Director Nicholas Stoller's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Jason Segal also wrote the screenplay for ""Sarah Marshall"" which is probably the year's funniest movie. Segal is funny as Peter, and his script is smart, hilariously on point, and really very sweet. Segal as Peter also sings in Count Dracula affect a song from his angst ridden rock opera about Dracula, which Peter always envisioned with hand puppets. There is a kabuki-like performance of his play that has got to be one the most inventively funny moments in years. The punch-line for Peter is that he admits someone pointed out that a Dracula rock opera was funny. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a wonderful surprise. Peter Segal is going to be a star. As Peter he plays a sweet vulnerable guy recovering from a break up. He is about as vulnerable as can be with his numerous full frontal scenes in hilarious effect.Peter's girl friend of 4 years is Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Sarah is a big time TV star on some ""CSI"" clone crime show. Here Billy Baldwin makes a great cameo as her ridiculous detective co-star. Peter writes the musical score for the show. Peter and Sarah are Hollywood's next power couple. However, this is about to end. Sarah breaks up with a literally naked Peter. Sarah pleads with Peter to put some clothes on. Peter asks if he puts some clothes on, will she not break up with him. Sarah reluctantly cops to seeing someone else. Peter discovers from ""Entertainment Tonight"" Sarah's new man is British rock star Aldous Snow (spaced-out cool Russell Brand). Peter's step brother Brian (charmingly geeky Bill Hader) urges Peter to move on. However, even meaningless sex reminds Peter of Sarah, and makes him weep. Dude has it bad. So Peter decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to get away from it all, only to find that he is at the same North Shore hotel as Sarah and Aldous. Rachel (stunning and spirited Mila Kunis) has compassion for Peter, recognizing him from the tabloids. She books him the $30,000 a night suite that Oprah usually gets for freethe only catch is that he has clean up the room. In hysterical scene, Rachel calls Peter in his suite and says that customers are complaining of a woman crying. Peter says he hears it too from the room above his. Rachel reminds him that he is in the penthouse. Predictably Peter falls for free-spirited Rachel, much to the ire of Sarah.Peter is befriended by an endearing and strange cast of characters at the resort, most of all Aldous (Brand). Brand is classic oblivious rock star, and its caricature of sexuality. Newlywed and very religious Darald (clueless funny Jack McBrayer) is in desperate search of his wife Wyoma's (Maria Thayer) cl------. Aldous instructs Darald in a ridiculous montage on the beach. The genuine Peter admits to Aldous while out surfing together, ""You really are cool"" And Peter's surf instructor Kunu (whacked out Paul Rudd) says ""When life deals you lemons fk it!""Mila Kunis is totally charming as Rachel, and completely believable as the woman Peter falls in love with. Kunis and Segal have amazing chemistry. Kristen Bell really has the tougher role, and she is great. Sarah Marshall is beautiful, and a fathomless bitch. To her credit, Bell keeps Sarah light, avoiding the object of audience hatred. Russell Brand is over-the-top genius as Aldous. Ultimately, this is Jason Segal's movieliterally. He wrote the movie, and as Peter he nails a new age James Stewart charm. Segal as Peter is brilliant as the object of humor. Segal is smart and touchingly funny as a guy healing his broken heart.See ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". It is the funniest movie of the year with a surprisingly sweet romance. Jason Segal is going to be a big star.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Hilarious!,"Going in to this i did not think that it could come anywhere close to topping ""Superbad,"" or ""Knocked Up,"" but it did. And it did with flying colors. This movie is awesome, the casting and writing are easily the two best parts of the movie, as you truly care about the characters and laugh at almost everything they say. Jason Segel is surprisingly awesome at writing scripts, I knew he could act after watching ""How I Met your mother,"" but this was just THAT funny.Mila Kunis is hotter than ever in her role, and really does a great job. This movie kept the entire theatre laughing out loud the entire movie, with constant laughs, as there was probably only a few points in the movie where the were no jokes.Overall fantastic comedy, one of my favorites ever.---10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a Waste,What a waste of time. I feel cheated out of 111 minutes of my life and i want it back. Definitely not funny and not even a good movie in any other respect. Russell Brand was mildly interesting but it wasn't enough. I can't understand how it could get a 7.3 rating on IMDb except that their must be lot of high people watching and then reviewing it. Find something else to watch and don't trust the inflated ratings on IMDb. And this minimum review length is lame. How long do you need to read that i thought this movie sucks monkey butts? How many ways does it need to be said? This movie gives Jason Segal a really bad name since he is the guy that wrote it (for now he should just stick to acting).,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another solid comedy,"The popularity of Judd Apatow and his raunchy but hilarious comedies are on the rise! This is another funny one that is also pretty cute. Forgetting Sarah Marshall ends up a funny movie that is a worthy follow up to Superbad.The films is about the life of Peter Bretter, played by Jeff Segel, is a struggling musician who writes the music for his girlfriend's TV show (played by Kristen Bell). One day, his girlfriend announces that she is breaking up with him for a British band vocalist. In attempt to get away from things around the house and himself that reminds him of her, he takes a vacation to Hawaii. Not only does he find Sarah and her boyfriend there, but he began his recovery by forming a relationship with Rachael (Mila Kunis).The movie is very very funny. The comedy is a little toned down and not as vulgar and explicit as some of his other films but it definitely is not for people who don't like sex orientated comedy. The best aspect about the humor in this movie is that it does not come from only a handful of characters. All of the cast cracks very funny jokes. Like I said before, don't bother with this movie if you're not a fan of these kind of humor.The plot is very similar to a rom com type film. The best comparison would be The 40 Year Old Virgin. So this movie can appeal to the ladies as well. With that being said, there is one warning. If you wondered why the rating box contain ""Graphic Nudity"" that is from the flashes of male nudity present in this film.The ending is cute and perfect for the film. It is a nice happy ending for the film. Overall, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another worthy comedy from Judd Apatow. Full of raunchy humor and creative characters/cast (mainly), it is a very solid laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is it possible  for the Apatow gang to make a bad movie?,"The reason I saw this one was because it was another Apatow movie, and every single one of his movies are on my top ten favorite movies list, superbad being my number1 . FSM was amazingly funny , from the acting to the story. The best performances where definitely from Segel, Brand, Kunis and Belle.They did there parts so well, Segel as the lost puppy Brand as the could't give a damn rocker, Kunis as the flirtatious hottie(seriously is it just me or did she get ten times hotter since that 70s show), and Belle as the bitch ex. The most annoying part, was the part that Johnah Hill played, the waiter. Even thought I loved him in superbad, in this movie he always had the same boring jokes bout how he loves Aldous Snow,the funniest thing he said was when he was making fun of Peter being alone and when he is on the phone withe his friend talking about buying pot. And that was the beginning, so after that it goes down hill for him. The funniest moments where A: When Aldous and Peter are talking about the killer cell phone movie that Sarah played in, it was so funny I missed 3 minutes of dialogue, B: the part when he makes love to plenty of women and C: when Aldous shows Darald how to make love. Al and all it was the best movie of the year so far, great comedy with just the right amount of love( I went to see it with my fiend who thought is was only a love movie, but was completely blown away afterwards). Ohhh ya one more thing Apatow movies seem to be getting a reputation for showing more male nudity then female, superbad, walk hard, and now this all have at least 30 seconds of dicks being shown, and you know what? I think its funnier. Don't forget to catch my next review when I will be talking about Harold and Kumar escape from Guantanamo bay.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally!,"Finally, a funny movie with some substance. I am SO TIRED of the repetitive ""poop"" humor of the likes of Seth Rogan and Johah Hill. They are so redundant and rely solely on the shock factor ""youre a douche. well, you're mom's a douche. well, you're mom is so fat she uses a really big douche."" Superbad and Knocked up are sooooo overrated. I cannot believe that people actually thought those movies were funny. I think I'd rather watch a Dane Cook standup routine for 2 hours. I bring this up because I feared Marshall would yield the same disappointment. Thankfully, it's a solid flick (despite Hill's pointless cameos) with better than average comedy acting, successful jokes, and characters you actually like. Note: Paul Rudd is always hilarious...keep his cameos coming. Definitely check this movie out.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly hilarious.,"This being the first Judd Apatow film I have seen, I wasn't sure what to expect from this knowing that his forte is gross-out humor with a touch of a heartwarming message. After seeing Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I am pleased to say that is exactly what you get. It was gross sure enough, but there have been far worse. What is so surprising is the amount of heart and soul there is to this story. It really focuses in on Jason Segel's character as he tries to overcome his heartbreak and finds new challenges along the way. It is hilarious at times, as well as sad. Overall, though, it was quite enjoyable and makes a great date movie for guys and girls. The script was great, but Mila Kunis and Russell Brand really make this story work. Each gives a different type of character that you can love and feel sympathy for. Everyone is great, but these two stand out. So, go see this movie if only for the humor and the touching love story that has been missing in Hollywood all these years.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A genuine and pleasing rom-com (with sausages),"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. You could see the plot coming a mile away but it was executed with such easy panache that you can forget how obvious the plot is, and just enjoy the ride.One of the things I liked about the film is they managed the unusual feat of making the whole thing believable. The characters seemed genuine, even the millionaire lothario pop singer, and the action did not seem forced. There was just the right amount of sentiment, it was not gushy, yet there was the feeling the characters really did care for each other. I am not sure if the dialogue had any element of improvisation, but the exchanges, especially at dinner had a sound to them as if they were actually communicating, and not just waiting for their next line.For me, the two most surprising performances were from Mila Kunis, who not only had a captivatingly cheeky smile, but brought some depth to her character, and Russell Brand, who made his character seem like a nice bloke despite all the very obvious flaws and callous attitude. I do suspect that Russell had an advantage, though, in that I imagine that is how he is normally!I have seen some criticism of the film for shoddy camera work, but I didn't notice anything amiss, though I admit I was too wrapped up in the film to really notice. Other have commented on the fact that Jason bares all in a few scenes. For me as a bloke it wasn't anything that I don't see every morning, night and several times during the day, so wasn't bothered. You'd have thought from all the fuss, that he was starkers for the whole thing. In actuality it was only a couple of shots. Not really worth all the furore. The girl sitting next to me seemed quite shocked by it though. I think she was a bit excitable.In summary, I found it a very funny film (after the first ten minutes or so) with a suitable amount of sentiment, and a pleasing feel-good factor. I would recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Much better than you would think.,"After Knocked Up and The 40 Yr. Old Virgin, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's newest film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, maintain the same success as the earlier films. Try this as a surprise, Sarah Marshall is Judd's best film yet. There's far more comedy in this film than the previous efforts and the actors are perfectly suited for the film. Easily this is Jason Segel's best work and is the perfect vehicle for Russell Brand, whose Aldous Snow virtually stole the show and Mila Kunis, as this film was her best performance as of yet.Although Aldous Snow stole the show, with some of the best one-liners ever, everyone in the movie you come to laugh at and enjoy. It was a pleasant surprise to see everyone have a happy ending and that the movie was actually really good! With Judd's recent effort, hopefully the way of the one-joke movie will finally die off and make way for entertaining comedies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nice Apatow comedy,"I started watching Judd Apatow films this summer, when it was a rainy day and my friend and I had rented a movie called ''The 40 year Old Virgin'' and I have been watching them since. I even saw ''Step Brothers'', ''You don't mess with the Zohan'' and ''Superbad'' without even knowing Apatow was included in them. Unfortunately, I did not get to see ''Pineapple Express'' this summer, however, my review doesn't focus on these movies, it focuses on the new movie in which Judd Apatow was a producer. I saw it this afternoon, and that movie is called ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'', and it stars Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis.The story revolves around a man (Segel) who, after having his heart broken by his girlfriend (Bell), who is a TV star. He sets off to find a relaxing vacation in Hawaïï to forget about her, and is seduced by the charming receptionist (Kunis), only to find out that his ex is also there. I like Apatow comedies, and, while not being directed by him, features his graphic vulgarity style. The actors, particularly Jason Segel, are very good. Mila Kunis is actually good and I can't wait to see her in Max Payne, hitting theaters next week. But Kristen Bell has a little bit of work to do, as she sounds a bit more like a drama actress, but that fact is taken away when you look at her freakin' hot body.However, this movie has it's flaws too. It reminded me of this summer's Hellboy 2, the Golden Army. Whilst it does have a nice screenplay, the story doesn't captivate all the time and that's bad considering that the classic 40 year old virgin captivated me all along. But still this is a very charming film with potential and it's very good.So in other words, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is very funny, and I recommend it very much.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Remember Marshall, Sarah","There is nothing quite like the joy of having a movie be pretty hyped up only to watch it and still have it blow you away. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of the best comedies I've seen in quite a while. It's hilarious, there's wonderful character building with characters that feel legitimately human and natural. I was genuinely astounded by the depth these characters have, especially given how one dimensional they would normally be in movies like this. It's beautifully shot, Hawaii really highlighted here. I watched the unrated version and, this is going to sound weird, but as a straight male I really appreciated the amount of penis in this movie, given how lopsided that usually is in Hollywood. It also pulls a magic trick of moviemaking by having tons of familiar faces and excellent talent here and yet they all feel like they just fit rather than being a string of nonsense cameos.This is a strong recommend for me. I think anyone looking for a solid comedy and doesn't mind some crassness and sexuality will get an absolute kick out of this. Absolutely worth seeking out and enjoying.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Anesthetize me,"What can sometimes redeem a movie that does not necessarily need a craftily inventive plot or a believable story are characters that are memorable for their bizarrely idiosyncratic humor such as characters from some of the other Judd Apatow movies such as McLovin from Superbad (which actually contained a really compelling story) or the characters in Knocked Up. The plastic characters created in this movie were such mundane clichés, lacking personalities and so unmemorably unfunny that they fail to redeem this unrealistic, poorly conjured story.The main character goes away and happens to find his ex girlfriend randomly in the same hotel in the same spot he decided to travel to. Then there are some love triangles, they both get jealous and feel bad, it just gets ridiculous and uninteresting to the point where you will ignore the story. It is true, we do not go to see these type of movies for the compelling story lines. We go to laugh. The forced raunchy humor has been done in other movies in a more over the top and intelligent way. The humor just wasn't there. One of the biggest laughs and the only innovative scene comes from showing the main characters crown jewels and gratuitously showing them again and again as his girlfriend breaks up with him. It was stupid, it didn't shock, it wasn't funny, i just didn't care. This movie may be comparable to some of those dull forgettable romantic comedies. They, however, actually have some heart and poignancy. This has none.The movie is memorable for having the worst sex scenes on film. The scenes were meant to be funny but they just seemed stupid.For all these reasons the movie was an absolute bore to watch. It wasn't that shocking, the humor was done before and was much better, and the story was absolutely terrible. Not the worst movie because it did contain a few forced laughs.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Can't forget Sarah Marshall,"last night I attended a special screening of this movie. While I laughed heartily throughout the movie, I did find myself pondering why I wasn't completely immersed in a guttural laughathon.When I returned home I actually started to feel a little depressed and then it hit me . . . Forgetting Sarah Marshall is equal parts drama as it is comedy. Jason Segel has created a character and a story that are masquerading as typical Hollywood farcical romantic comedy fare but in reality are so honest and relatable that when you walk out the theater door, you can't just brush it off with a gesture of ""that was cute"" or ""if only life were just like that."" Because life IS just like that. And if Sarah Marshall teaches us anything - it's that despite the confusions and frustrations and heartbreak in life - we should all take it a little more lightly, focus on the positive and open ourselves up to new experiences.Thank god for the return of smart, involving yet fun movies.

It was also hilarious to see Branscombe Richmond playing after quite a while.

Jason Segel is a absolutely Hilarious,"The previews for this movie do not do it any justice. Before I went to see the film I thought it looked funny and it had the same crew from other hilarious movies like Knocked Up and Superbad, but I wasn't sure what to expect. The end result is that Jason Segel in his first main role picture played the character amazingly. This movie is not a romantic comedy, although there is some level of romance, on the whole it is filled with hilarious antics and crude humour, two ingredients found in most top movies. I love 'How I met your mother', and am a fan of Jason Segel in the show but personally I believe he has stepped it up at least 10 notches in this film, I look forward to the next film by these guys and will recommend this film to all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I was expecting something similar from FSM but was hugely disappointed. The film is very slow paced and although I summoned a small smirk here and there, rather than funny the comedy just seemed forced and the characters were just not likable or real.The only reason to see this film is if you really like Russell Brand who was the only person remotely funny or entertaining and Kristen Bell really looked hot in a bikini. Put it this way, even the Heartbreak Kid was funnier and that was not a good film, so save your money and time and avoid this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Love hurts...until you finally meet the right person""","FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is the perfect kick off to the summer season of comedies as last summer's wonderfully entertaining KNOCKED UP proved to be. Plus, the film captures what it means to lose someone when you are least expecting it, and how the hurt can propel you on a journey which may eventually bring you someone who will really make you happy. And Jason Segel is a character who the audience immediately likes from the first frame, and you can feel his anger and pain, as he attempts to forget Sarah and drown his sorrows.The dialog is very ""today"" in what young couples experience and Segel makes for a very entertaining lead with Mila Kunis at his side. Kristen Bell is just another ""Hollywood blonde"" in a sea of young blonde's in Los Angeles and is unremarkable as Sarah Marshall-except of course, to Segel. The rest of the cast adds to the story and the location of Hawaii makes for a romantic background.

Not too much of a comedy,"I just got back from my second viewing of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (there was something wrong with the sound the first time) and I have to say I see it a little differently now. At first you remember all the funny parts because you know it's supposed to be a comedy but even still it seems more like a romantic comedy. But on second viewing you notice that it's really much more of a relationship movie and not even a romantic comedy. Most of the laughs go to the supporting players. The lead character played by Jason Segel, who I'm sure you know also wrote it, is just a guy going through a break up. So even if some of the situations are comical it's still kinda sad and you don't want to laugh at him. It's not a bad thing but if people go expecting to laugh the whole time I think they could be slightly disappointed. It's really a heartfelt movie about a poor guy who is trying to get over a woman he probably shouldn't have been with in the first place. The funny stuff happens around him.Jason Segel is great. I've been a fan since ""Freaks and Geeks"" and I think he did a great job especially with the musical aspects of the movie. I loved Russelll Brand and Jonah Hill. I thought their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. And today I realized that the best chemistry was between all the male characters instead of between the male/female pairings. Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are talented young actresses don't get me wrong. I just didn't sense a lot of chemistry between them and the guys. But that would really be my only complaint. Paul Rudd again is hilarious in a teensy supporting role.It was an enjoyable movie that most adults should like. And I mean adults. I'm not saying teenagers can't see naked people. That's up to their parents. But it's about adult relationships that don't really concern them yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Awkward, and not because of the sex and nudity","Freaks and Geeks is probably my favorite TV series of all time, but when I watch movies like this I feel like a freak -- why does everyone think this is so great while I'm cringing and wanting to leave?

I came away thinking that Jason Segel just didn't want to leave his buddies Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd et al, on the cutting room floor. But, alas, he should have.Because what he ended up with is a movie chock full of awkward scenes and overwrought stereotypes -- the stoned surfer dude, the hen-pecked husband, the religious guy with the horny wife, the massive-but-sensitive Hawaiian guy. (Oddly the one character that could have been the biggest stereotype of all wasn't -- Aldous Snow. He was also the best thing in the movie by far.)Oh, and one last curmudgeonly rant. The scene in which Rachel gives him the 6k/night room for free. I find this technique so insulting in movies. Either take the time to write a scenario that is likely to happen (6k/night room for free I don't think so) or just have it happen and let us suspend disbelief. Stop trying to preempt the audience's disbelief by writing 10 lines of dialog to explain why it COULD happen.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"why would a 60 year old go and watch something like""American PIE"" (or this movie)and be surprised they didn't laugh?","This film is truly HILARIOUS!!!!if YOU LIKE films LIKE: ""AMERICAN PIE, MEET THE PARENTS, 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, DUMB AND DUMBER. if you don't find those remotely funny then do not even try it. and don't bore us either on here. cast your vote if you like, good for you. there are some scenes i was still giggling even 2 minutes after, they were so comical, I needed recovery time. Most of the actors are brilliant especially THE MAIN GUY, THE ROCK STAR/SEX GOD, THE surf dude (from ""FRIENDS""), THE GROUPY WAITER.and a few more. Sarah Marshall is easily forgotten but who cares the rest of the cast will soon be a part of my DVD collection when this baby comes out!!

Apatow: King of Comedy,"Jason Segal is a relatively no-name actor whose biggest role so far has been playing a character on the TV show ""How I Met Your Mother."" He's now managed to write his own screenplay, get it sold, and actually get the lead role on top of all that, despite being a no-name. What I'm saying is, it's damn good to be a friend of Judd Apatow. And so far, nepotism seems to be paying off for everyone. No winging it here, Apatow knows some really funny dudes. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Steve Carell, and now add Segal to that list with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", a laugh-out-loud funny movie about breaking up.He stars as Peter Bretter, a struggling musician whose life is pretty lame, except for the one bright spot of having a gorgeous television star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter continuously finds himself pushed to the background while she lives the perfect life and still, he puts her up on a pedestal. So he is shocked when she dumps him. He takes it hard and after a terrible time of trying to get back on the horse and an on-the-job nervous breakdown, he decides to take a trip to the Oahu beach resort to clear his head. Only horribly enough, Sarah is also vacationing there with her British-rocker boyfriend (Russell Brand). Just as things look there worst, a resort employee named Rachel (Mila Kunis) takes him out for a good time, leading to a flirtation that tempts him to regain some confidence.Sex and nudity gags are the movie's bread and butter (in fact the film starts off with one of the funniest male nude scenes I've ever seen) and it takes some really good pot-shots at murder mystery shows, but like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"", the real charm is in the personal journey of the main character(s). A break-up can leave you a sad, pathetic, obsessive shell of a human being and Segal mines the material with a good eye for comedy but also sends Peter on a path toward not only new love, but toward his own self respect. That Peter and Sarah wind up reluctantly together again is another comedic highlight, especially during an awkward dinner scene and an even more awkward sex scene afterwards. The romance also works. Segal does a nice job of playing emotionally scarred and timid while Kunis counteracts it well with energetic positivity. Not to mention she is still ridiculously hot, as is Kristen Bell, who makes Sarah a little more than just a bitchy overachiever. And Brand is hilarious, not just in the heavy British accent he puts on but also in the laid-back and self-involved way he portrays the character. And Jonah Hill pops up every once and a while as a creepy waiter. He's a funny guy, I wonder if he has a screenplay in him as well.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is another Apatow movie about learning how to grow up and deal with life's curveballs, and oddly enough, there are a lot more crude gags in that process than you might think. What's interesting and ultimately winning about these movies is how flawlessly they manage to combine the two.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

In an attempt to move on from his unexpected breakup our lead vacations at a resort... where his ex and new boo are. Helping him get over it is an employee (Mila Kunis).

The characters also work well off each other. The main character's friend's over the top yet it's completely understandable given the things he does.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of those comedies that you can watch over and over again. That's how well it was done. With that being said, give it a watch. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mildly Funny, Moderately entertaining, A significantly average comedy","Stoller's 'Forgetting Sarah Marshell' is quite an entertaining comedy that does have its dry moments along side funny moments, but for me, this is predominantly a very average comedy and somewhat over-rated by the IMDb and general public.Its basically about some guy being dumped by his superstar girlfriend and he takes very hard.Jason Segel pulled off an amusing performance as you would expect, his script was snappy, cool and well written despite the definite issues of pacing. Russell Brand was surprisingly good in his role as Aldous Snow. Slight hints of satire in his irreverent character.This film is very current and its aiming for a very current audience. There's an array of beautiful women, pop culture jokes (sex and the city joke was great) and crudeness. That is why this may not be for everyone.This is one level higher than Superbad but the dragging story and lack of hilarious comedy drags it down. I only found myself laughing out loud once at the beginning where Brand's character unites a Jew and an Arab as a sign of equality, other than this, I was only chuckling.5.3/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Heartwarming and Hilarious,","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a brilliant movie with a lovely story line and a great cast,not to mention plenty of laugh out loud scenes.The whole movie is a delight from start to finish,with a great script and largely inspired performance from Jason Segel,I also really enjoyed Mila Kunis,Russel Brand,Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd,he doesn't have a huge role but every part he is in is hilarious,like he always is.I found some of the songs stuck in my head after watching this movie,which I didn't expect,especially 'Inside Of You' and the Dracula song.Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) heads to Hawaii to forget about his recent break up with Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell),but she ends up being at the same hotel with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russel Brand).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprise... Surprise...  A great movie...,"Surprise, surprise...One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. I was initially very skeptical of Jason Segel as a leading actor, but after watching this I truly feel he has the most potential of the ""Apatow Crew."" He comes off as very believable playing the victim of a bad breakup with an overbearing woman. I have to say, that this movie was as real as it gets (with the exception of everyone being successful actors and musicians which isn't very ""real,"" but for movies sake I'll relent).Jason Segel shines the brightest and the fact that he wrote the movie may be why he seems so real in the character's skin. Overall, the balance of Apatowian crude humor and the passable and stomachable romantic aspects of the movie really make for an enjoyable passing of time. A new must-see, along with Swingers and Annie Hall, for gentleman in great need of getting over their very own Sarah Marshalls.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great comedy with some depth too,"I went in to this movie expecting either a chick flick or a gross-out, Will Ferrell type movie. Instead, I would say it took the best of both and turned out a great flick for everyone.The movie is a romantic comedy that even the bro's can like. Jason Segel (Peter) plays the ""lazy average dude"" well, showing the hurt, desires, and frustrations most guys go through in a break up. Kristen Bell (Sarah Marshall) is the TV star celebrity who didn't know what she had in her relationship till she threw it away. Mila Kunis plays the hawaiian hotel worker who eventually hits it off with Peter. She is insanely hot and plays the chill, ""guy's girl"" as well as I've ever seen. I hope to see her in upcoming female lead roles. Finally, Russell Brand is the hilarious British rock star who's contrasting views about women and life with Peter carry the movie well. Throw in Jonah Hill for his always- funny awkward interactions as a side character and you've got a great comedy.It was one of those comedies where I actually found myself wondering, ""How is it going to end?"". Oh, and not to spoil anything but the Dracula play at the end was hilarious. I heard Jason Segel really wrote that song.Overall, a great movie for men and women to enjoy. Lots of laughs and a well-written storyline. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Deep,"This movie is not in the same category as Knocked Up, Superbad, those types of movies. No, i thought it was too until i saw it. FSM carries some surprisingly deep stuff. The plot was not actually that predictable; i was pretty much wrong about what was gonna happen. The 4 leads do a pretty darn good job of acting their roles, though Kristen Bell's character is a little confusing, she does a good job in it. Seth Rogen is pretty darn funny in this movie, although i have to say, it wasn't THAT funny. There were some parts that i laughed a lot at but overall there was more romantic stuff than i thought there would be. A solid romantic comedy overall.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Apatow film so far,"Judd Apatow is really a godsend to the comedy genre. The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad and Pineapple Express are all great. However, this one tops them all.Jason Segel and Russel Brand are both absolutely hilarious in their roles. Like most Apatow productions, this film finds the perfect balance between raunchy comedy and heartfelt moments. Jason Segel's character was so full of pain that it really struck a chord with me. It should also be noted that Segel, in addition to playing the lead role, wrote the excellent screenplay. I only hope he gets more leading roles in future films, he has just as much potential as Seth Rogen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
how can people dislike this?,"again i'm mystified by many IMDb reviewers who hated this movie, if you have any sort of a funny bone and you have been in and out of a relationship in your life, you will love this film. People are crowing about apatow this apatow that, but he was only a producer here,great credit must go to director stoller and writer/actor segel for creating an adult romantic comedy thats big on laughs but has an engaging story too. I hadn't seen much of segel or his dong before but it was easy to sympathise with his character and while I loathe schmaltzy, happy endings it was acceptable here. Along the way,kristin bell and mila kunis provided great eye candy as his love interests and in the ""how hot am I stakes"" but russel brand as he has a habit of doing with his sardonic deadpan humour was the stand-out for me, it sounds like ""get him to the Greek""will have him in more of a central role with the same writers as here so I'm very much looking forward to seeing that one. If there was a slight disappointment, it was jonah hill who has regressed since superbad, i can see him relegated to be doing stand-up in a few years. Gratuitous sex is never funny but well played, OTT scenes are and thats in abundance here, its not a riotous comedy but it'll leave you with a big smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Writing! Brilliant Cast!,"It's one thing watching a typical rough comedy film; it's another thing watching a rough comedy that puts a lot of work into character development. Judd Apatow the super-producer of comedies has always been good at putting his own known style into a movie by having much more material then you are used to seeing in a comedy, a deeper meaning if you will. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a total gem to be honest and is not far away from movies like Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, even better actually in some areas. And if we are talking about Apatow movies, i think this one is better then Walk Hard, Pineappla Express and Superbad. There is something just so wonderfully likable about this movie.Firstly, she is packed with wonderful actors that play strangely believable characters. Seth Rogen step a side and make room for Jason Segal. Jason Segal is much funnier playing the dork that everyone is rooting for. Segel who's always funny in his hit TV show How I Met Your Mother gets praise from me for brilliant comedic timing and a great script that is totally in his own hands. Kristen Bell does also a good job here playing a person who seems as a one sided character but has a secret side. Same can be said about Mila Kunis (It's impossible to not connect her voice to Meg from Family Guy) and the always special Russel Brand who steals every scene as the Looney-sex addict Aldous Snow. Jonah Hill is also always a class act.It's not only rich on fantastic characters, it's also hilarious in every turn. Nothing more complicated about that. The Humour is never over-done or forced rather it just becomes funny on its own. For example when Aldous was rambling on about the shoe he lost. Brilliant! Like every Apatow movies, it's rather long and suffers a little bit for that. The story is so thin that they could have easily made it quite shorter. The movie is also great in avoiding cliché's but that's always good no matter what movie you're talking about.8/10 -- If you haven't seen it check it out now!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not worth seeing in the theater,"I was supremely disappointed during this entire film. There are a few good lines in the movie, but it is not nearly as clever or as funny as Super Bad, Knocked Up, or 40 Year Old Virgin. I think I may have gone into this movie with very high expectations since I had heard such good reviews on it, or maybe it's because I just may have not been in the mood, but I can always throw in one of the movies mentioned above, sick or not, and enjoy it.You will recognize a lot of the actors in the movie, but they are just not funny!!! I know that a lot of people that were in the theater with me thought it was great, but trust me...after REALLY enjoying the movies I mentioned above, this one is just a horribly not funny movie at all.

Apatow delivers...again...,"I am no fan of typical romance movies. I am no fan of cheesy comedy movies. And I fully despise the traditional romantic comedy. Yet, the Judd Apatow company has succeeded for the third time (following the THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP) in getting me to appreciate a romantic comedy. But let's be frank here: calling FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL a typical romantic comedy is doing it a great disservice. Apatow has specialised in merging the male raunchy comedy with the female romantic comedy to create something that is quite watchable, by all audiences.The story is a rather good one, following the fortunes and misfortunes of a man trying to get over a break-up after a nearly 6 year relationship. While the story is pleasant overall, there are moments that feel rather cheesy, tacky, and over-done or superfluous. Surprisingly that does little to take away from the film. The acting is rather top-notch, as Jason Segel (who also helped pen the screenplay, and is a name to watch for in the future) does a brilliant job of portraying the 'lovable loser' protagonist. Mila Kunis was the standout for me, not only because she was easy on the eyes, but she demonstrated a comedic range and timing befitting of her character. Kirsten Bell is also quite good, as is Russell Brand, who infuses his own brand of humour into this vehicle. The supporting cast is also decent, and there are no discernible weak links. Kudos to Paul Rudd, who has to be one of the most dependable, yet under-appreciated comedic actors today.The main selling point of this film is its humour. Where typical male comedies go to great lengths to be vulgar and derisive, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL takes the higher, less disgusting, less raunchy road. That's not to say there's not much for guys to laugh at, as I found that this film was quite hilarious. The other big selling point was the romance, and Apatow made sure that the romantic elements in this movie felt real, and not overly cheesy. The balance between the romantic aspects and the raunchy aspects was almost perfect.For the third time in a row, the Apatow gang has made me appreciate a 'romantic comedy'. If that's not genius, I don't know what is. 8/10. 3 stars. Will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie that hits close to home... But in a good way.,"Before I start this review, I want to tell a brief story. When I was 13, I got into a relationship with a wonderful girl, who just so happened to be my first girlfriend. We went through high school together, until the 4th of July 2008, I presented her with an engagement ring. I don't think I had a single doubt in my mind at that moment. Before the Christmas of 2008, we broke up, having been in a 5 year relationship. As of this review, I am 18 and still trying to get over what I thought would have been a great relationship. I tell this story not to be a downer; I tell it because it helped me understand the character in the movie so much more than I ever would have.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a brilliant comedy created by the Apatow team and written by Jason Segel, who plays the lovable Peter Bretter in the movie. Peter is in a relationship with the beautiful Sarah Marshall, played very well by Kristin Bell. Sarah Marshall is a famous actress on a hit TV show and Peter, her boyfriend, composes the music for the show. Peter's life is going swimmingly up until Sarah breaks up with him.Peter, torn up by the relationship that should have been, gets told by his step brother, played by the very funny Bill Hader, that he should go out dating, and when that goes sour, go and relax somewhere nice. Peter goes to Hawaii to forget all about Sarah, but runs into her... and her new fling, famous British rock star Aldous Snow, played by the very rock star looking Russell Brand. Peter isn't adjusting much better, but a lovely hotel clerk, played by ""That 70's Show""'s Mila Kunis tries to help him adjust to a relationship he goes he can get out of.I will admit, when I saw this movie in previews, I was skeptical, but the movie was earning rave reviews, and I had planned to watch it at sometime. Now that I am single, I feel like this movie spoke more to me than what it could have done if I was still in a relationship. The moments with Peter's sadness was probably done for humor; I honestly felt myself laugh for a few seconds, then literally go ""Aw"" right after all of that. I honestly felt like Peter up until I saw this movie.That's what makes Apatow's comedy better than any National Lampoon sex comedy out on the market, it's made with real people in mind. Peter isn't sex crazed, he's just trying to get over a relationship, and he's surrounded by people that are kind and real. There are cynics and skeptics who will probably argue that no one should have acted as mopey as Peter did, and he should have sucked it up. They haven't been in a relationship for a really long time, I would imagine.I liked this movie because it had heart and soul. There are very few movies that can make you laugh and feel sad almost at the same time, and with this movie, I nearly felt all the emotions of the emotional spectrum. This is a great movie, for romance lovers, for rocky relationships, for couples (be aware there are some naughty bits in there) or for people who want to laugh at people that are as real as you and me.I give this movie a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my favourite Apatow comedies and one of my favourite movies in general.,"This movie is, what the media referred to at the time of its release, a guy-friendly romantic comedy. It very much is. The plot isn't the best but it's was Segel, the writer and starring as Peter, does with the characters that makes the movie so entertaining. The plot is very simple but is also quite realistic, probably the most realistic comedy in recent years.I've watched this many times and jokes don't lose their funny on me. The characters are well thought out and are very three-dimensional and the actors definitely understood their role in everything.I'm pretty damn sure this will never get old for me so I feel it's safe to highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone looking for a guy-frienly rom-com as well as a funny and heart-felt character study of sorts.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garbage for idiot teens and emotionally stunted 20-somethings,"Another in a string of pathetic Hollywood films directed at already mentally and emotionally screwed up teens and emotionally stunted 20-something degenerates who will guffaw at anything even remotely connected to sexual organs.It seems as if every single scene was slapped together from a string of random improvised actions the actors did. ""Sit at the bar there and do various stupid things that imply you're drunk. We'll pick and choose later and just put them all in a row."" Stupid jokes that make no sense whatsoever, characters showing up who are irrelevant to the plot, incredibly trite interjections of four letter words till you're sick to death of hearing them.This film is for the squishy-brained imbeciles who enjoyed idiot entertainment like ""Grandma's Boy."" At least ""American Pie"" was creative in its dirty jokes and possessed a real plot, with character development and a satisfying conclusion.This film has none of that. It is a waste of time, marketed to loser high school students and 7/11 clerks who probably lack the intelligence to accomplish anything real in their time here.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
See it!,"I didn't expect much from this movie, just to waste an hour or two since the choices on other channels sucked. And yet, I ended up liking this movie quite a lot!I've noticed that a few professional critics take the film to task for it's ""sophomoric"" and explicit humor. Listen, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" ain't Fellini or ""Citizen Kane"" or some high falutin' BBC costume drama, nor does it have to be. Movies can be fun and silly and sex-oriented, and that's just fine. ""Animal House"", anyone? Hey, it's now considered a classic! And no one (except for, perhaps, Chris Farley) was as juvenile as John Belushi.As far as the nudity and masturbation jokes go, in my youth the bar for this genre of movies was set by ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" If you recall, Judge Reinhold jerked off in the bathroom while fantasizing about Phoebe Cates's breasts - and that was almost 28 years ago (and set in HIGH SCHOOL!) ""Sarah Marshall"" isn't any more explicit than ""Porky's"" (COLLEGE STUDENTS!) At least we're talking about young ADULTS here, and oftentimes the humor of that age IS sophomoric. So what? Not every 24-year-old can be Noel Coward, for Pete's sake.The main characters in ""Sarah Marshall"" are fairly original, even if some of the minor ones are variations on well-established Hollywood stereotypes.I found all the characters engaging - even the narcissistic British rock putz. I'm not all that familiar with actor/comic Russell Brand, but he really won me over in this film.I was pleased to see Kristin Bell and Paul Rudd. I always enjoy Rudd, even in a throw-away role like his empty-headed stoner here (it seems to be genetically impossible for Rudd NOT to be charming in films OR in real life. Anyone see him on ""The Daily Show"" a few months ago?)Kristen Bell has a bright future in show biz, as far as I can tell. If you haven't seen David Mamet's ""Spartan"", you absolutely should: she'll blow you away with her raw performance. She matches Val Kilmer scene-for-scene, which is pretty amazing given his legendary intensity. I knew then I was watching a serious young talent. Also, look for Bell in an old HBO ""Deadwood"" episode (if you get the chance), ""Suffer the Little Children"", where she plays a teenage con-artist who deservedly comes to a bad end. That's the first time I noticed her. Unlike too many Hollywood starlets, she's more than just a pretty face.Jason Segel is a talented writer/actor. He projects a real vulnerability and decency (even when his character is, frankly, kind of creepy.) And sorry, all you nudity prudes: I, for one, admire his egalitarian willingness to go full-frontal. Now, if Segel can (or wants to) stretch beyond the comedy genre? Well, that remains to be seen . . . unlike his Johnson.Watch ""Sarah Marshall."" You'll be pleasantly surprised!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Sappy, Unfunny Chick Flick","From a young guy's perspective (I'm 24), this was a horrible movie. ""Sarah Marshal"" is just another romantic comedy that everyone has seen before.Simple Synopsis: Guy is heartbroken when girl cheats on him, he finds a rebound girl, his old girl wants him back but he's moved on so he gets his revenge, THE END. Completely formulaic steaming pile of dog crap. In addition, Jason Segel (who wrote the crappy script) is a terrible lead actor. This dude seems to copy Chandler from ""Friends"" in every role he is in. He also decided to show his dick 3 times in order to get some shock appeal laughs. This can sometimes work, except it better be in the right situation. In ""Sarah Marshall,"" it just comes off as an extremely contrived way to get laughs.This is a chick flick in every way imaginable, so I can see how females may have a different opinion than I.The only redeeming qualities: Kristen Bell is SMOKIN hot, Mila Kunis is pretty hot, and Russel Brand as Alduos Snow in the 2nd half of the movie is actually pretty damn funny.

apatow rock-machine!,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall comes from breakthrough producer Judd Apatow. Directed by Nicholas Stoller and written by and starring Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the latest offering from Team Apatow after the success of 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad.The film, very delicately and realistically deals with the period of post break-up. It also sheds light on celebrity/part-celebrity relationships. Containing a huge amount of situational as well as slapstick humor added with a hilarious performance from Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another success story in the book of Apatow. The fact that men are as emotionally involved in a relationship as women are is clearly shown in this film. It is more reality than fiction. The fame aspect added in by the character of Kristen Bell brings in the slapstick humor. The characters are all perfect in their roles. Russel Brand and Jonah Hill are two very important pieces of this jigsaw puzzle. Mila Kunis is plain cute.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is just a good time at the movies. No real complications here, just a simple story of a highly complex situation, well told. It's wonderful how Team Apatow just come up with these films.

The Best Film of the Year,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall is by the far the best movie of 2008. There are only thirty minutes left of this year, and because of this, I felt obliged to write my one and only review of the year. Overall, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy classic. The premise itself is unoriginal, revolving around a man recently dumped by his girlfriend who takes a trip to Hawaii and meets his ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend. However, the film had me and everyone in the theater laughing out loud almost every other minute. Jason Segel, the star and writer of the show, should become a star after this wonderful comedic turn. Kristin Bell who plays Sarah Marshall is also very good in her role. However, Mila Kunis (the prettiest woman ever) and the hilarious Russel Brand are the best in the film. Another high point of the movie is the numerous characters that pop up throughout the film such as Kemo, Dwyane, Koonu, Bryan, and the newlyweds, all of whom add their own comedic touches to the film. Each line of the film is so memorable and hilarious, and no other comedy has been even comparable to it this year. The movie is vulgar and raunchy at times, but also is a sweet and touching romantic film that should please everyone. Therefore, if you have not already, go see it. I saw it twice in the movies, and I've seen it six times since then. Make sure to get the collector's edition DVD and watch the gag reel and deleted scenes. All of it is priceless. It is simply one of the best films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

He is destined for many god things, considering he had a hand in writing it. Another flick with himself and Paul Rudd will be out soon. Unique and surprising.

Below my lowest expectations...,"Today,I went to a movie theater with a friend to catch something because there was nothing else to do. We have already seen the dark knight -very good by the way- but there was nothing very interesting left.We say hey let's see ""forgettin sarah marshall"" a typical American ""adult"" comedy dealing with sex and love with this stupid from the waist down humor,so my expectations were very low about it. But what we saw was a true abomination. The story was poorly developed but It's not the point here right. But what I hated the most was the unnecessary frontal nudity of jason segel,the sexual jokes failing to make anybody laugh, too many sex scenes without any added value to the movie and the pace of this whole mess. The movie fails in everything and people start lefting the theater in the ten first minutes. To keep it short and simple: avoid it like the black plague.

what i thought,"hi my name is Ben Moore. I saw this movie the other night and thought it was hilarious!!! I loved it. Every time a Judd Apatow production comes into theaters i have to see it cause i know i will crack up. This film was very funny and i want to see it again. I thought the actors were great. A lot of the faces were familiar from films such as The 4O Year Old Virgin and Knocked up, but thats a good thing. If your looking to see movie that will crack you up go see Forgetting Sarah Marshall. So far, its the best movie I've seen all year. Even though it wasn't my favorite of Apatow Productions its still very good. I cant wait to see the Pineapple Express cause Judd is Producing that also along with Will Farrels ""Step Brothers"". I loved this film cause it was hilarious and sexy. But I may warn the parents if you plan on seeing this with your kids or with your teenagers you may feel a little awkward cause of the strong nudity and sex scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A funny comedy with well developed characters,"We all have been dumped and we all have dumped someone. This makes it already easier to understand the main characters. But what helps it even more is the fact that the characters are very well done.Jason Segel is great in his part. He is sweet and vulnerable. Sarah's character is great as well because she is not done as a ""monster"". Even though we feel for Peter we still can understand her. This is what makes me like this movie so much, the characters are human and not just ""good vs. evil"".Not only the main characters but the supporting ones are great as well. It is full of awesome and funny actors. A special mention deserves Paul Rudd. Whenever I see him in a new movie he plays a different kind of character and always with a great success.I like also that the movie has a great balance of comedy and romance. It is not too sentimental and one gets too laugh a lot. Aldous's music video and song lyrics as well as scenes from Sarah's TV show were in my opinion especially funny.My only problem with the movie is that the ending was too long. It went on and on and on. The last few scenes could have been done much faster, it actually feels longer than it was",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, Eclectic and Not Novel, But Still Pretty Enjoyable","A fellow has written here that the only thing that stands out in this film is male nudity, which is not a plus, and the acceptability of this film depends on the viewer's tolerance to averageness. Well, I am not going to strongly oppose that or anything, and maybe to most, that is what the film amounts down to, but I find this film much more enjoyable that Good Luck Chuck, or Heartbreak Kid, or other similar films a film school student has categorized as ""apato"" in another comment here.Things shown in this film are, as always, not theoretically impossible, but it just doesn't happen. There are things the drop dead gorgeous beauties could do, that would change the lives of many, which they do not, except in the movies. But of course, it is a movie, so what the heck! One of the things that make this film more enjoyable than most other similar films is the fact that the central character of this film is not a veteran in the industry of playing loony characters, like Ben Stiller is. So it does not take too much of patience or tolerance or hard work to make yourself believe that this guy Peter, who is trying to forget Sarah Marshall, can actually be a normal man from a normal society, who is just sucking at living right now, but he is not completely banged up in the head. When I watched ""There is Something about Mary"", I felt severely suffocated and awkward, because it was mostly not funny and none of the characters in the film did anything at all like an actual human would do! Abnormal or dysfunctional are not synonyms of funny. It should not be too hard to understand, but people often don't! So in an industry where ""There is Something About Mary"" has received complements like ""Phenomenal!"" or ""A True Collectible!"", Forgetting Sarah Marshall deserves at least some credit, in my opinion.There is not much else to say. I recommend this film over most other mindless comedies made in Hollywood. Not that this one is something very special, but at least I, as a not-so-outdoorsy and not-so-cool-but-still-normal man, could relate to it, and understood it, and had a few good laughs, and also could relate to the sad moments of the film.If you are sick of films like Good Luck Chuck or Heartbreak Kid, there is a fair chance that you may still like Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is very funny, and with actual, real characters","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is the low-end, crass comedy that we have come to expect from Judd Apatow and company. This one is written by Jason Segal and it's hilarious. The comedy is crude, vulgar and rude, but that doesn't really lessen the quality of the film because it's so well written.The film gives us real, three-dimensional characters whom we can all relate to and learn from as we laugh at them for two straight hours. Segal is Peter a struggling musician who is trying to get over the heartbreak caused by Sarah Marshall, the famous actress. And we can all relate to the pain and humour of Peter watching her with famous singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).There are a lot of comedic actors, and they can all make you laugh.

Guy goes to Hawaii after his girlfriend dumps and he runs into her and her new boyfriend there.,"I am really dumbfounded how so many people find this movie so funny. It does have its funny moments. However, the plots sucks big time. It is patterned after B-movie comedies of the late 40s and 50s except for the sex in it. It is really a dumb and senseless plot. Is this what comedy has come to in the current age? It seems like movies today are either grossly violent or just plainly uninspired. There have been a few exceptions, of course, like Juno.Even the male nudity doesn't score here although some reviewers think that this a great new trend. Oh, save me from this insipidity. There has been male nudity of this sort since the 70s, so I fail to see what the big thing is here. Pun unintended.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is way easier said than done!","In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is way easier said than done! As the film opens, Sarah, a famous television actress, has just dumped her boyfriend of five years, struggling musician Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, also the film's screenwriter). Heartbroken and unable to Forget Sarah Marshall and after having slept with almost every woman in town in an attempt to dull the pain, he takes the advice of his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hager) to go on vacation to Hawaii, to try to get over his former love.Just to get this out of the way, the early scenes featuring Peter trying to get through the break-up are pretty painful, but also demonstrate that Segel, in a truly breakout performance, is a truly great actor capable of dramatic depth, as well as brilliant comedic timing. You really feel sorry for Peter and truly sympathize with his plight, which makes our connection with him genuine. Like most features that comedic impresario Judd Apatow has been behind (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" ""Superbad"" and my personal favorite, ""Pineapple Express""), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" has those elements/themes of love & companionship, boys being dragged kicking & screaming into adulthood, friendship, romance, and ""bro-mance"" that has made his films so popular, and returning some sense of dignity to the comedy genre.When Peter arrives in Hawaii, he finds that his ex-girlfriend Sarah Marshall is also vacationing at the same hotel on the same island he is staying at it. And not only that, Sarah is there with her new boyfriend, self-absorbed rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Love or chance, take your pick, it seems that everywhere Peter goes, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous. So he goes to about trying extra hard to forget his ex, and so he begins hanging out with Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), the cute hotel desk clerk who knows how to show him a good time during her off-hours with some of the other oddball characters on the island.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a brilliant, touching, and heartfelt romantic comedy. Director Nicholas Stoller finds a lot in the layers of Segel's screenplay, which as is true for all of Apatow's productions, rides a fine line between raunchiness and comedic excess. Boys will be boys, as is also true of all Apatow productions. But these boys, and girls, are given a lot of emotion and compassion and sensitivity, and are indeed flawed individuals (in other words, they're real people, just like us), something usually lacking in these sorts of movies. The acting is fantastic from the cast, especially Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" you got to love this movie!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
We Are Marshall and We Rock!,"We guys have all had some Sarah Marshalls during our lifetime- a ridiculously beautiful little blonde bombshell with a perky zest for romance, adventure, and sex. OK, don't we wish! But we guys have also been victims of The Marshall Plan when the Sarah Marshalls of the world have dropped the trouncing breakup bomb on us. The highly entertaining comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" encompasses the bitter tastes of the brutal break-up victimization process with comedic connotations. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is yet another brainchild of comedy producer mogul Judd Apatow and his riotous entourage. Jason Segel stars as Peter Bretter, a television show score musician who has scored himself with the hottie star of the show Sarah Marshall played by the bellisima Kristen Bell. But bedding Sarah Marshall becomes a past phenomenon for Peter when she breaks up with him. Peter is in the raw when she does the malicious dumperiski act so there is no doubt she lays the naked truth on him. Peter's life becomes a disarrayed existence in coming to grips with the heartbreak. He takes solace in his stepbrother Brian to help him ease the pain but to no avail. After some uncontrollable crying, Peter starts participating in the one-night-stand routines to help him forget Sarah. But Peter is still in the heartbreak dungeon. Eventually, he decides to go on a solo Hawaiian escapade. But faster than you can say ""Aloha"", he runs into Sarah and her rock star new boyfriend Aldous Snow portrayed by the unrestricted Russell Brand; Snow is a sex crazed British singing lunatic lothario who has an appetite for all hotties named Sarah (pause). , and Diana, and Jane, and Mary and. you get me. Brand has branded his raunchy British comedy to the States with an overwhelming welcome. Back to St. Peter- he encounters numerous outrageous experiences and befriends eccentric characters (besides Snow) during his Hawaiian experience including: Rachel Jensen (Mila Kunis), a cutesy hotel attendant who helps Mr. Peter roll over the breakup hump by devouring him of much pain and even a potentiality for a new romance is invoked. The ensemble acting of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was a firecracker thespian experience. Besides the stellar performances from Segal, Bell, Kunis, and Brand- we also get some outlandish supporting turns from Paul Rudd as an amnesiac surfer (my personal favorite character of the film), Jonah Hill as an obsessive fan waiter, and the stupendous Bill Hader as the previously mentioned ""Stepbrother of Peter""- Paul; I mean Brian. Director Nicholas Stroller is able to stroll his characters with effective dynamic scenarios and I also quite enjoyed how he incorporates Hawaii as central character to the film's developments. Double kudos goes out to Segal for also scribing the very funny screenplay; and the whole ""Dracula Rock Opera"" thang did not suck as some have said.

Jason Segel gave us the best film of 2008!,"Who thought the young man who played Nick Andopolis on ""Freaks and Geeks"" would write and star in what I consider the best film ever to come from that show's alumni? What Jason Segel has created is full of naked emotion and soul rattling, loony creativity, the likes of which come around so rarely, it's truly a wonder to behold. Every major character in this film has bad and good traits that come to light sooner or later and the hilarious combination of anger, fear, passion, artistry and hope for a better future explode in one memorable scene after another. I paid to see this 10 times and the last view was just as entertaining as the first. Hawaii has never looked so inviting.The famous from television Kristin Bell and Mila Kunis prove themselves resourceful big screen actresses in their deeply played roles as Jason's former and current love interests. Russell Brand wows in his first significant US part as a self absorbed pop star who remains likable after all the trouble he leaves in his wake. Firm comic support is provided by too many other actors to name here (they're all great!).

Much much better than expected,"When I saw the tagline of this movie (from the people who brought you ""Knocked up"")I was scared... very scared...

I was planning to skip this one until a friend told me 'unlike knocked up, forgetting sarah marshall actually IS funny'.And he was right! Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a pretty funny romantic comedy that follows a quite standard format, but maintains to be better than the lot of them. The storyline is nice and although in some places predictable, contains enough funny and 'painfully' true moments and situations to make you laugh. You should definitely go and see it! The only big minor point about this movie is Jonah Hill's character. It's useless and not funny.

Possibly the best comedy today,"There are very few comedies out there that are able to actually combine a rather serious plot with amazing humor. They are either just without plot (Meet the Spartans, Scary Movie) or are just depressing and unfunny (The Savages). Forgetting Sarah Marshall is brilliant in its ability to provide a real story with extremely frequent hilarious scenes. The jokes range from subtle to obvious, and almost every single one is worthy of laughing out loud. The pickiest movie-goer and the most easily amused could watch this film and enjoy it to the fullest unless they are just easily offended or not into this kind of humor or movie.

Wonderful,"Simple, but quite funny, and very sweet- Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves itself to be a very relatable and oddly unique comedy that isn't afraid to shy away from more personal elements. Jason Segel, as always, gives a wonderfully heartfelt and funny performance- and the starred supporting cast also gives it their best. Most notably in supporting roles, is Mila Kunis, Paul Rudd, and Russell Brand- who all make the most out of their characters. The film can be a bit hard to watch at times as it deals with awkward situations, some of which may seem a bit predictable. However, most of the time it is able to keep its head, and do so at a decent pace, as well as provide quite a large amount of laughter throughout its interesting storyline. The film does have some surprisingly emotional depth in between the humor, and is my favorite part of the film in general, as it handles its depictions of the issues involved very well. In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is yet another great addition to the comedy genre from 2008, and is quite a loveable film with a lot of humor and a lot of heart.
My Rating: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flaccid.,"I remember reading that Forgetting Sarah Marshall was supposed to come out in the summer under the even less imaginative title of Dumped, but they pushed up the release date after lackluster early screenings to avoid it from getting murdered at the box office. Since it's been billed as a ""romantic disaster movie,"" a better title for it might have been The Mangina Syndrome.Jason Segel plays Peter Bretter, the world's biggest p***y. Sarah Marshall, a made-for-TV actress, dumps him and he cries and cries and cries. When he goes to Hawaii to clear his head, he runs into Sarah and her obnoxious rock star boyfriend, and he runs into them over and over again. Then, he cries some more. A free-spirited young womanwho (as the cliché goes) happens to be better looking than the famous ex-girlfriend even though she is only a hotel conciergeslowly brings Peter out of his shell. He also mingles with the hotel staff and guests, and they are expectedly quirky characters: the comic fatso, the wisecracking doper, the stuffy Christian etc.Because the writing is not exactly what you would call ""witty"" or ""illuminating,"" the movie needs to be outrageous to be funny and sustain interest, but genuinely over-the-top moments are too scattered over the 112-minute running time. If you're college-aged or older, the rest of the misnamed ""adult"" humor and dialogue should seem very played-out to you. While the main love triangle is being self-consciously telegraphed, the story is padded out with some disconnected tangents involving the supporting characters and these are only mildly amusing.Three of the main characters work in entertainment so we get some backstage digs at showbiz, including parody segments and musical numbers. These are the same as anything you could see on ""Mad TV."" It would also be easier to swallow these jabs at assembly-line Hollywood products if they weren't taking place during the course of a predictable romantic comedy. A send-up of ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" might've been funny 4 or 5 years ago, which makes you think the script has been sitting on a shelf somewhere.Jason Segel is adequate. He's like Jason Biggs. Not that good, not that bad. And you don't care about him either way. I'd never heard of Russell Brand before, but he's good as the new boyfriend. Though, I'm not sure what era his character was supposed to be from. He doesn't resemble any of today's popular artists and looks more at home on a VH1 reality show for 80's wash-outs. Paul Rudd should be able to play his character in his sleep by now and it looked a few times during the movie as though he did. Mila Kunis is very loose and charming in front of the camera. Kristen Bell gives a mannered performance, though it's not as forced as her acting on ""Heroes.""Basically, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a paper-thin excuse for some new gross-out gags and slapstick, but it doesn't even deliver on that promise. If you want to see a gross-out comedy, you probably won't be satisfied. If you want to see a romcom, it adds nothing to an already bloated genre.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Russell Brand...Forgetting Sarah Marshall essentially has my comedy dream team in it.You feel nothing but pity and horror for Jason's character as the movie starts, but he never comes off as so pathetic that you don't root for him. This is one of the more ""realistic"" comedies that I've seen, even though there are tons of outlandish scenes. The next time you want to watch a date movie with your significant other, try this for a sure- fire hit. It's flat-out hilarious, and that doesn't change with repeated viewings.

Very good for a comedy,"This movie is one of my favourite comedies, of its type. I have watched it more than a few times now, and it never gets old.

It's funny from the very start, and is the perfect combination of comedy and love.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is basically the tale of a melancholy man who's famous partner, Sarah Marshall, breaks up with him, and by complete chance, they end up going on breaks to the same resort in Hawaii. This provides a brilliant setting for all sorts of funny events.The soundtrack is wonderful, it is worth mentioning. You'll find yourself searching for some of the songs online after watching just to hear them again.Overall, I would say this is a brilliant feel-good comedy.

A better-than-expected comedy,"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is another in the sequence of comedies bearing Judd Apatow's imprint. Here Apatow acts as producer while the direction is handled by first-timer Nicholas Stoller and the script comes from the pen of star Jason Segel.The story concerns a guy who gets dumped by the titular Sarah Marshall and has a tough time getting over it. When he follows his brother's advice and vacations in Hawaii he arrives only to find that his ex is staying at the same resort with her new boyfriend. Awkward. Needless to say, hilarity ensues.I find Jason Segel to be a likable presence in films and this one is no exception. Kristen Bell is also quite likable as Sarah Marshall though I think I wouldn't have much trouble forgetting about her with the lovely Mila Kunis around. Meanwhile, Russell Brand makes a fine addition to the mix with his effortless delivery and cocksure attitude. Add to these some notable individuals in support - including Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill and Bill Hader - and you've got an enviable comedic ensemble.Nicholas Stoller's direction does the trick though there's not really anything special about it. It competently presents Jason Segel's script, which is funny, insightful and original. I've also got to single out the soundtrack for some special praise; opening as it does with Cake, closing with a Hawaiian translation of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and featuring a number of good tunes in between.In the end, what elevates this comedy above most of its brethren is the story. The simple premise paves the way for a story that feels authentic while also hitting the right notes for a romantic comedy. Certainly worth viewing in my opinion, though I should note that Segel goes full frontal in a couple of scenes, so you might want to choose your company accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Another comedy from Apatow Productions, and as I expected, it's another raunchy and funny one","I've seen a bunch of comedy films produced by Judd Apatow, and haven't been impressed with all of them, but have found most of them funny. Before watching ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", I knew it was another production from him, and also knew that Russell Brand was in it. I had never seen him in any movies before, but first heard of him a while ago, hearing about his friendship with Noel Gallagher, who was then still in Oasis. Brand has become very famous in recent years, getting lots of media attention, but is also a very polarizing comedian. Many hate him with a passion, and you might hate me for saying this, but before seeing this film, videos I had seen of him online had convinced me that he was a talented guy! Anyway, I was expecting lots of laughs from this particular Apatow Productions effort, and I definitely got them.Peter Bretter is a composer in Los Angeles who has been in a relationship with actress Sarah Marshall for the past five years. She stars in a TV show called ""Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime"", for which Peter writes the musical score. However, after five years together, Sarah suddenly announces that she is breaking up with Peter, as she is now in love with somebody else. The composer is devastated by his loss, and finds that one-night stands don't help him get over it, so he decides to go on vacation in Hawaii. He arrives at a Hawaiian resort hotel to ask for a room, but as luck would have it, he quickly discovers that Sarah and her current boyfriend, Aldous Snow, the lead singer of a rock band called Infant Sorrow, are also currently guests at this resort! Due to this inconvenience, it doesn't look like this trip is going to help Peter at all. During his stay in Hawaii, things do begin to look good for him as he falls in love with hotel receptionist Rachel Jansen, but the struggling composer might still have feelings for Sarah.This R-rated romantic comedy begins by showing us Peter as he is happy at home, just before Sarah comes in and tells him the bad news. I didn't laugh much at this point until I saw the video for Infant Sorrow's ""We've Got to Do Something"" come on to Peter's TV. After this, it is memorably funny when Peter learns that his relationship with Sarah is over and we see his reaction to this. Many laughs quickly follow as we see the protagonist's struggles after this breakup and before he goes on the trip, which definitely includes the part where he destroys a screen when he sees Sarah's face on it! The funny gags keep coming during Peter's vacation trip, with his frequent encounters with Sarah and Aldous, his computer conversations with stepbrother Brian, some of the people he meets in Hawaii (such as Chuck, a surfing instructor whose beginning instructions are very hard to follow), a bunch of sex scenes and lots of sex talk, etc. The laughs aren't as consistent as I could have hoped, as there are some weaker parts, but there are still lots of comic highlights and well crafted characters. Jason Segel puts on a satisfying comedic performance in the lead role of Peter Bretter, and most of the other cast members are steady as well, including Russell Brand as Aldous Snow, who is funny in a number of scenes, one of them being the part where he helps the Darald Braden character with his sex life. In addition to the humour and characters, it also helps that this film also features some beautiful Hawaiian scenery.Since this 2008 release is from Apatow Productions, it's unsurprisingly a very crude comedy. The swearing, sexuality, and nudity are the reasons for the film's R rating, and with all these elements, it's obviously not for the kids, but just like any extremely raunchy comedy, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" can also disgust many adults and make them think that anyone who actually thinks it's funny must be out of their mind! However, if you can take all the raunchiness and you tend to like these modern-day R-rated comedies, including the ones Judd Apatow produces, plus you're not one of the many who hate Russell Brand, who doesn't play the starring role here but still has a lot of scenes for this breakthrough performance of his, you just might get a lot of laughs out of this movie, just like I did. As much as I'm sure MANY would disagree, I do think this particular Apatow Productions piece is much better than ""Superbad"", a more popular comedy from the same producer, but one which I just couldn't understand the reputation of!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The comedy, great dialogue, and entertainment value are some of the best well deserved for any high ratings; I've recently watched a handful of comedies really heartwarming vibes. I remember my sisters loved the when Jason would sing at the piano it is genuinely awesome and I bet Hawaii is phenomenal I don't know what's it like to have such a lavish wholesome vacation away from city life. Interesting how there's other movies with multiple of the cast like I love you man, Knocked Up and Get him to the Greek all are great ones.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sex, Lies and Rock Stars","In the expanded Judd Apatow universe, Jason Segel has always had the role of the oddball character, be it on TV in Freaks and Geeks or, later on, Undeclared, or in Apatow's directorial effort Knocked Up. Now, following the lead of former co-star Seth Rogen, he takes his stab at starring in a picture, with an additional, significant contribution in the form of the screenplay (with Apatow producing, of course). And despite the implications of the title, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a more than decent effort.Segel plays Peter Bretter, a TV composer who gets unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, small-screen star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell in slightly self-spoofing mode) while in the buff. As per the recommendation of his brother (Bill Hader), he goes to Hawaii on a little trip to find happiness again. And it all seems to go well, what with the company of hotel employees Rachel (Mila Kunis) and Matthew (Jonah Hill) and surfing instructor Chuck (Paul Rudd). However, one big problem has to be dealt with: Sarah is also there, with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)...Sticking close to the Apatow template (hence the presence of regular players Rudd, Hill and Hader), Forgetting Sarah Marshall attempts to deftly mix sweeter material and rude comedy. The former comes in the form of Peter's very real and affecting relationship with Rachel; the latter is best embodied by Segel's infamous full frontal nude scenes (based on real events, apparently). The balance works quite well but is somewhat disturbed by Segel and director Nicholas Stoller's show business-satirizing agenda. Some ideas (the Seinfeld reference, a Dracula musical with puppets) work brilliantly, others - including the titular character - fall a bit flat.The lead performances are equally uneven: though he lacks the weird charm of Seth Rogen, Segel is a likable protagonist; Bell, on the other hand, is stuck with a very clichéd character and isn't able to elevate her above a basic starlet caricature. The supporting cast is, fortunately, up to the challenge and effectively lifts up the movie. Best of the bunch is Brand, also in a vaguely autobiographical zone as a British rock star with various addictions. Profane, honest and hilarious, it's no wonder he got his own movie recently.In short, Forgetting Sarah Marshall isn't exactly the best of the Apatow bunch, but it's got solid laughs, an ace soundtrack and, for better or worse, Jason Segel's penis. Oh, and did I mention the Dracula puppet musical?7,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the better comedies in recent years.,"Peter (Jason Segal) is dating Sarah (Kristen Bell), has been for a long time. Peter is supposedly nerdy while Sarah is hot and famous.Sarah dumps Peter.Peter shows his doodle and pleads for her to come back. Sarah then says she is already seeing someone else.Peter is very sad.After the obligatory ""Peter tries out a bunch of skanks"" montage, which at least allowed the filmmakers to add Bill Hader as his step-brother, Peter decides to take some time off and heads to Hawaii to recharge the batteries.The holiday is unplanned, he literally gets on a plane and arrives at the airport without any other structure. So the first hotel Peter gets to is fully booked, and who do you think shows up?????That's right Aldous Snow the famous rocker...No wait, I haven't told you about him yet. Sarah Marshall his ex-missus, that's it. She is there with her new beau Aldous Snow the famous rocker (Oh so that's where he comes into it!) and they are celebrating their new love in paradise.Peter is understandably unsettled by this unexpected (but totally expected) turn of events, and imagine his surprise when the desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis) helps out by allowing him to stay rent free in one of the more luxurious suites, happens all the time right? I mean she has that power. Who else wouldn't risk their job for someone they never met before?I bet you would!As Peter continues feeling sorry for himself and boozing his way through the week he keeps bumping into the new happy couple which depresses him more, and other guests and staff try to cheer him up which leads to encounters with Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, and more and more meetings with Rachel.Peter learns that Aldous Snow is actually quite cool, as well as being a world famous rock star he is a recovering addict and a pretty nice guy, which sh*ts him. He also finds out that Aldous and Sarah have a past that goes a little further back than he first thought, that sh*ts him more.As Peter gets along better with Rachel a mistimed polite gesture becomes an awkward double date, with both chicks trying to one up each other. (For the record: Mila by a mile, even if she has absolutely no arse.)Forgetting Sarah Marshall definitely has its share of potty talk and there are some dirty bits for the grown ups, but in the main it is kept pretty light and likable. Thankfully there are no fluid or put down jokes that seem to be the thing these days.As well as being pleasing and almost constantly funny Forgetting Sarah Marshall managed a few other notable things:* It announced the now seemingly ever-present Russell Brand.* It showed Mila Kunis as more than merely Meg's voice, but that she is hot, friendly and spunky, a pretty winning combo.* It showed Jason Segal can carry a film, he even made I Love You, Man seem more fun than it was.* It showed that Kristen Bell is harmless enough but imminently forgettable, even now writing this I had to IMDb her name as it slipped me.Aside from the much publicised doodle showing and some low key sex scenes Forgetting Sarah Marshall is basically a feel good comedy. There is little to detest or recoil at, and even if you don't agree with Aldous Snow's philosophy on women it's still pretty hard to dislike the guy.Final Rating - 8 / 10. Throwaway fun with jokes aplenty and a beautiful backdrop, both Hawaii and the two leading ladies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It doesn't get much funnier,"So back in 2008, this was one of the few movies I had in my house with no cable and limited internet. Streaming wasn't a thing. I had to cycle through the same 30 some odd movies if I wanted television entertainment. That lasted about two years. What I'm saying is, I've seen this movie more times than I could possibly count. To this day, I laugh every time.If you told me that was Russell Brand in real life, I'd believe you 100%. He is so convincing with his character and completely hilarious while he does it. Paul Rudd has a small part and all of it is absolute gold. Bill Hader as well.The end drags a bit for me. I'm with Sarah when she says she just doesn't ""get"" the whole Dracula puppet musical. It's fine I guess. The rest of the movie is funny enough that it isn't a big deal. It's not a purely dirty humor movie, there is definitely some heart and cuteness intertwined. Overall a staple in my comedy collection.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excruciatingly unfunny,"Apart from about 10 minutes of vaguely amusing dialogue 3/4 of the way through the film, this was an absolute trial! I enjoyed Knocked Up, I didn't mind the 40 Year Old Virgin, but this was just WOEFUL. I cannot BELIEVE this is hanging on to a 7.9 rating on IMDb and can only assume some serious vote rigging.Apart from anything else, the sight of the lead actor ""tackle out"" was enough to put me off food for life. I am sure it cracked up some infantile teenagers out there, but it wa sone of those lame ""whoa, how CONFRONTING!"" moments that people use when they can't think of anything clever.Who the hell WROTE this turkey???

Jason Segal Shines As A Star,"The movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a sleeper in a class of many great romantic comedies. As a film the movie flowed well, and had a seemingly flawless view of the life and struggles of the main character. Whether it be a comedic flashback or a small gesture you barely catch, Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a humorous moment for everyone. I can promise that even if you are not a fan of Judd Apatow this film will make you laugh, and you will forever remember parts of this film. I personally am not a huge Apatow fan myself, however this film was intriguing to me at first because of the actor Jason Segal. You may recognize Segal from the hit comedy show How I Met Your Mother as the character Marshall Erickson. I knew prior to seeing this film that Segal was a funny man, and he seemed like a good enough actor to star in a movie. So this got me to the theater.Segal's performance in the movie was stellar, and as a fan of his acting prior to the film, this just backed up my beliefs of his skills. His acting led to the viewer wanting to know more about this character, and the struggles he now faces. He makes you feel his heart ache and sorrow, and does a good job of making you somehow relate to this man. As a viewer he immediately grabbed your attention with his goofiness, and from the first five minutes on you view him as almost a friend. Segal brought the best acting to the table in the movie, but he was backed up by a surprisingly strong cast. Not only was the cast newer to film at the time, but most of the names were a pleasant surprise to me as a viewer, and now if I see them in other movies I immediately connect them to this film. I enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and if you are a fan of goofy, R-rated, Romantic Comedies then this movie is a perfect fit. See It! This movie also led to somewhat of a sequel in the movie ""Get Him To The Greek"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing...,"It just seems like the effort wasn't there. This is a crew that came out with Superbad, 40 year old virgin, and although I haven't seen it i've heard it was good, Knocked up. The first two films were just laugh-out-loud comedies. Sure there was crude humor, and some childish pranks, but you know what you're getting into when you see the previews. They are films in the mold of the Farelly Brothers, like Kingpin, or something about Mary. These are crudely fashioned moralistic tales, with a lot of raunchy, sometimes gross humor. But the main point is they supply enough gut busting laughs to sustain one through an hour and a half. Sadly this film doesn't accomplish that mundane task. It drags, the leading ladies don't appear all that appealing, and the laughs (when they do come) just don't satisfy. Skip it, and rent a classic like Stir Crazy, or Used Cars, hell even settle for UH1 or Dirty Deeds.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
very well-written and acted comedy,"This is a very funny film, as noted, extremely well-acted and written. I do wish that Hollywood had a broader net for comedic incubation but that said, many of the films which Judd Apatow is involved in are very funny. I enjoyed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" though I found ""Knocked Up"" to be a bit harsh on women. I found ""Pineapple Express"" loopier but ""Superbad"" overly reliant on bad language. Apatow did not direct all those films but has had an influence on all of them. This film I really enjoyed. It is written by Jason Segel who also stars in the film. Segel has a great sense for how people act and interact and his dialogue bears this out. There is some great acting from Mila Kunis as a helpful, thoughtful hotel staffer. Jack McBrayer and Maria Thayer are truly hilarious as repressed newlyweds, Kristen Wiig is very funny as a passive-aggressive yoga instructor, Paul Rudd is almost unrecognizable as something like a human ""Nemo"", and Da'Vone McDonald is very funny as an opinionated and helpful staffer at the hotel.Among the leads, Jason Segel is fantastic as a sad-sack TV show music composer whose life becomes very complicated when the TV star who he breaks up with (Kristen Bell), is at the resort where he is trying to escape from her. Segel communicates a great deal of humanity and seems very likable which makes us more sympathetic to his plight. Russell Brand absolutely steals every scene he is in as an over-sexed but not very talented music star. The songs which Segel wrote for Brand are hilarious and Brand absolutely steals the film with his full-throated depiction of his inane, over-the-top music star.The writing and direction are very good and the performances, as noted, are wonderful. There is lots of profanity and quite a bit of male nudity which is quite funny in and of itself. At times it seems a little forced but only a bit and it doesn't distract from the essence of the film. This truly is a fantastically written film. Segel could have quite a career as a writer. I have to admit I found Jonah Hill quite annoying. I generally find him annoying and his ""I'm overweight and a nerd"" schtick has worn thin and never more in this film. I thought it was funny how friendly hotel staff was, but these are tiny reservations. I highly recommend this hilarious film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Several laugh out louds,"8.0 stars.I've seen this film about five times. It never gets old. Yet another genius comedy by this genius group of actors and producers that we've seen before. Mix and match here and there, but with the brilliance of the actors, and oh what an ensemble, you really can't go wrong with this classic rom com.This has the same general blueprint as most of the films that are either written by or star Jason Segel. You can recognize his signature in the dialogue, minimal slapstick antics and a bit heavy on the f-bombs and p3n1s jokes. I personally could do without the conversations being drenched in the gross innuendo and intense s3xual oriented and overwhelming dirty humor, however you miss out on all the other great aspects if you throw out the crude stuff. So I persevere, after all, I'm pretty hardcore, not a softie.But, it's still about a man with a broken heart doing his best to cope.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If You Want To Laugh....,"When I heard the previews on the radio every day upon the film's premiering, I thought it sounded bad. I had no interest in some movie where the girlfriend dumps her boyfriend and there's some joke about him being naked. That's about all the previews did for me. When it was on television, however, it changed my entire view of it. I came across it accidentally and I laughed the entire time. It's clever and ridiculous at the same time. Russel Brand is of course a genius at his character and Jason Segel is perfect at portraying a character he himself created. He chose his actors well and as a writer myself, I admire this piece of art!

Great comedy,"I must have missed this one when it came out because I didn't know what I was getting when I caught it on cable but I was greatly surprised by how clever and funny it was. The characters are great fun and the plot just seems effortless in it's ability to make you forget you are watching a movie and just flow with it. Jason Segel is convincing as a lovable loser and Russell Brand's character is just retarded funny. A great date movie with all the right pieces, the fake TV show Kristen Bell is on is hilarious and she is very cute in this too, but the show stealer is Mila Kunis who can be both beautiful and approachable at the same time. Do not miss this great comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One to remember,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a consistently funny and at times utterly hilarious movie. Can't ask for much more than that from a comedy. That the movie has some heart to it is a nice little bonus. Yes the movie is somewhat raunchy but it's also kind of sweet. It's a delicate balance but one which works. Full credit to writer Jason Segel for pulling that off. Of course Segel is not just the movie's writer, he's also the star and his performance provides much of the film's ultimate appeal. He plays Peter Bretter, a composer for a popular CSI-style television show in which his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, stars. Unfortunately for Peter his carefree, blissful and somewhat sloth-like existence is about to be rudely interrupted. Sarah dumps him. Peter, to put it mildly, does not take the news well. You can't help but feel for the big lug and that's a feeling that stays with you throughout the whole movie. Segel has created a character who is so easy to like. But as much as you like him you can laugh at him too. And as the movie plays out there will certainly be plenty of opportunities to laugh at the expense of poor Peter.After wallowing in post-breakup grief for a while Peter decides that perhaps a vacation will help him forget Sarah Marshall. So off to Hawaii he goes. Unfortunately it turns out that Sarah is vacationing at the same Hawaiian resort. With her new boyfriend, the pompous, narcissistic British rock star Aldous Snow. Awkward. But this situation is a potential comedy gold mine and hilarity most assuredly will ensue. Segel is great throughout but Russell Brand threatens to steal the show with his portrayal of Aldous. I am not really a fan of Brand at all but there is no denying he is perfect for this role. Mila Kunis has plenty of good moments in playing Rachel, the hotel receptionist who helps Peter break out of his funk. And the likes of Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd are on hand in smaller roles and each of them is very funny as well. Ironically, given the movie's title, the most forgettable character is Sarah Marshall. Kristen Bell plays the role and there's nothing wrong with her performance. Her character just never seems to get the big comedic moments. She's the straight woman who is largely left to react to all the antics going on around her.Funny throughout the movie really kicks into high gear near the end. The big climactic scene is rather bizarre but delightfully so. It's a fitting cap to a thoroughly enjoyable movie-watching experience. The movie clocks in at nearly two hours which you might think would be a little long for a movie of this type. But the movie never really drags. The story keeps moving forward and there are plenty of moments of comic genius sprinkled all along the way. It's a movie that has big laughs and big heart. There's also room for some memorable songs which are all performed wonderfully and which provide some of the movie's funniest moments. Everything comes together quite well. This is a movie to remember, one which definitely leaves you with a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie.,"I honestly didn't expect to enjoy Forgetting Sarah Marshall as much as I did. Now don't get me wrong, I expected it to be hilarious, and it was, but I did not expect it to actually be a quality movie. Jason Segel proves that he's more than just a funny sidekick and the supporting cast of Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Russell Brand, in addition to the smaller roles performed by Johan Hill, Paul Rudd, Jack McBrayer, and more, made the line-up fantastic. Mila is absolutely breathtaking and this film really helped launch her career by showing that she can tap into that humor that transcends ""chick-flick rom-coms"". The plot was engaging, though not entirely realistic, but being a comedy movie, realism isn't always the biggest requirement. Overall, the crudeness isn't for everyone and it's more of a guy's film but I think most people would enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Trying too hard...,"Judging by the ratings, I had higher expectations for this movie. It had some funny moments in the beginning. But after a while I got the feeling that it was trying a little too hard to be something it was not. After all, you can only be disgusted and shocked so many times in two hours. The best part about the movie is that almost all the actors (except for the pretty girl from ""That's 70s Show""), were a bunch of unknowns, and that was kind of refreshing.Okay, I'm not being completely fair. If you loved ""40-year-old Virgin"" and ""Old School"" you'll probably love this movie.

"has the plot of a date movie, but the raunchiness of American Pie","I thought this movie was pretty funny. And it's ONLY for adults. Some of the language and visuals( like full male nudity and various sex positions) make this a far cry from a date movie. However, the story says different.TV star Sarah Marshall breaks up with her 5 year boyfriend Peter. He gets really down in the dumps over it. At first he tries to tag any girl he can but is still depressed. So, he decides a vacation to Hawaii is best. He picks a hotel that Sarah often talked about. And as luck would have it, Sarah is there on holiday with her new boyfriend, British singer Aldous Snow. Peter decides to stay anyways, and front desk clerk, Rachel, helps him out by letting him stay in the best suite for free.Peter begins to like Rachel and they go out several times. He also keeps running into Sarah and Aldous, and they try to act like it is not as awkward as it is. Aldous is like most stero typical rockers, he's all about the chicks. So, it doesn't take him very long to get bored with Sarah. He's very polite and wants to be Peter's friend.So do things work out with Peter and Rachel? How many women does Aldous bag? Or how about does the naive honeymoon couple finally figure things out?FINAL VERDICT: One of the funnier movies that's been released in the past year.

"Fulfilling, Honest Romance Dryly Flaunts Huge Laughs","Jason Segel, the writer and star of this surprisingly great entertainment, is plagued by melancholia. The film evinces that he likes to feel like a star, at least in the ragtag circle he's amassed of Judd Apatow's expansively talented posse. His character here is a TV musical sting composer who has spent five years adoring his girlfriend, television star Sarah Marshall despite living completely in her shadow like some deposed tsar still doing his seemingly post-middle-age royalty routine for flatterers/bartenders. His journey seems essentially to aim as high as he may in love, not settling for second-best rundowns, and yet to still secure the same kind of neutral lifestyle with a righteous babe with brains, bod and spirit, the challenge of the journey being to realize that that has been his circumstance for five years.Director Nicholas Stoller seems to surrender to a higher power, so to speak, by being entirely malleable to Segel's material, providing merely a backdrop for the cast to let loose with the goofy, impeccably timed extemporaneous hilarity to which they've become accustomed under Apatow's philanthropic wing. This is indeed the charm of Stoller's elusive touch from the illusory helm, showing an unusual degree of flexibility for a film director.In subduing any style, the story flows very deeply, mainstream romantic comedy or not, and allows Segel's underdog lead quite an expose of a journey to ""forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" a catharsis of the id which conquers his depressed self-image. Along the way are quirky escapes such as Russell Brand's about-face in my perspective as surprisingly interesting in the role of the title character's new narcissistic rock star boyfriend, Paul Rudd's burnt-out surfer, Bill Hader's ungraceful friend from back home, Davon McDonald's silver-tongued bartender and Jack McBrayder's hilarious rendition of a repressed young religious virgin who's just gotten married. The highlight of the film is Jonah Hill's Hawaiian waiter, who comes to be an awkward, overzealously pushy fan of Brand's. As with Superbad and Knocked Up, he sprinkles fleeting nuances of over-the-top inflections that inspire huge laughs.As is Apatow's agenda, it's a romantic comedy aimed at guys. All the men in the film get in touch with their feelings, inadequacies and gross idiosyncrasies, rather than safely remaining with the limitations of merely a hot guy who's cool and cocky. And indeed, these films have a much better probability of being satisfactory entertainments, because in spite of their condescended genre they give honest impressions of what it's like to be a horny young guy who seeks the approval of his friends and the women to whom he's attracted. From a film like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we are fulfilled by the best one can hope for in a film of its kind, and it does that by releasing the leash of social pressures. Jason Segel is funny because he depicts himself as so insecure, but there is nerve in doing that because he imparts to us that there is wisdom in insecurity.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Could I see less nudity and more acting, please?","This movie is as canned as a stripper at a church. Not only is the plot predictable, but the acting is terrible. It had a few funny jokes - the kind of stuff that draws you in during the trailer - beyond which there was nothing but fluff. Further, the MANY shots of full-frontal male nudity were nothing less than obscene. What the movie lacked in actual substance, it tried to make up in vulgarity. This is not a movie you'd want to see with your spouse/parter...and it barely qualities as one of those love-to-hate movies you would see with close friends.

"Not really ""raunchy,"" unless maybe if you're a celibate.","I think part of the problem with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, like so many movies, is that it only exists to try to outdo the gross-out gags from the last gross-out comedy, but everything that's allowed past the MPAA has already been shown. The current pattern can't sustain itself unless the restrictions on content suddenly disappear, which isn't likely to happen. Most of the jokes don't even have punchlines. They just show you a penis over and over and expect you to laugh at the sight of it. If the sight of a penis is enough to make you laugh, you have access to much more explicit and free content over your Internet connection. We live in the age of ""2 Girls, 1 Cup."" There's not much left that can shock us.I'll forgive the silly PG-13 sex scenes, even though the movie advertised itself as a wildly raunchy R-rated sex comedy. When characters have sex underneath the sheets, it takes me out of the film because it is something people only seem to do in lame movies. Some people might blame it on American prudishness, but it didn't seem to be a problem in Wedding Crashers or The Last Kiss. People were naked when they were supposed to be naked (and it was almost always the women). It makes me feel like the movie is geared to an audience that is 18 or younger.On a side note, some of the dialogue sounded like it was taken from somewhere else. I'm pretty sure I heard the joke about God putting a playground next to a sewage system in one of Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up acts. The ""happy tissues, sad tissues"" line was vaguely familiar, too. The rest of the movie is also derivative so it doesn't really matter.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you're going to be broad, go big or go home.","I can only judge if something is funny or not by how much I laugh and I never really laughed during FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. I think I smiled at one or two parts and said, ""Heh,"" but I never really laughed. If a movie doesn't affect me, I can still rate it highly on other merits such as originality and good writing. There really isn't anything else to recommend this movie, except for a few nice performances from Russell Brand and Mila Kunis. The humor is as broad as any mainstream comedy, but it still doesn't go far enough over the lines of acceptable taste as to be funny. It's not outrageous enough to be funny and it's not nearly smart enough to offer you anything else. A waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrible movie.  We couldn't wait for it to end,"From others' comments, folks either loved the movie or hated it. I wonder if there is a generational gap. I am 70 and my wife is 66, and we go to a lot of movies. When we were watching it, younger people around us were roaring with laughter at jokes that did not seem funny to us. We couldn't wait for the movie to end. Our daughter and her partner were with us and felt similarly. They are in their mid-30s, and older than the average person who was in the theater. I agree with other comments that the acting was not very good. The sex scenes were hardly a turn-on, but with due respect were probably meant more to be comical. These scenes came across to me as quite flat. Next time I see an IMDb review of a movie with an 8.0 rating, I will definitely read the detailed reviewer's comments before going, which is what we exactly did before seeing iron man this evening.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Few Laughs, Forgettable Characters","As a comedy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall failed pretty thoroughly. We waited about two-thirds of the film to finally see some snappy dialogue between characters, and the movie found its stride after all four main characters begin talking together near the end. But the plot setup dragged on and we found ourselves staring at each other thinking, ""This film better get good fast!"" It didn't.While we don't really mind clichéd characters - after all, paying homage to archetypes makes for perfectly good stories - we truly didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters. While likable and funny at the end of the film, we see 45 minutes or more of the main male lead bawling his eyes out with no character development whatsoever, and therefore we lose interest in him.We did enjoy the final twenty minutes - too bad for the people who walked out; it did get better - but a nice conclusion does not a good story make.Forgetting Sarah Marshall would be great as a 45-minute film. But as a 1.5 hour 'comedy,' you'll have fewer laughs than Letterman on a bad night. See it at a friend's house for free later.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very poorly written and poorly executed.,"I can see how one or two of the jokes could've potentially been funny, but they must have been extinguished by the limp pacing and some genuinely bad acting. This movie has no energy. I won't go into the plot much because it just a very predictable Hollywood story. It is actually an extremely average romantic comedy in every respect (except for the male-genital exposure) but I had to take a star off of the rating because it is not so good on the technical side. The director, who has no other directing credits, managed to make a movie set in Hawaii with a good-sized budget that looks cheap. I've never noticed things like the direction or the editing in a comedy before but they stand out in a very bad way in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall.""I probably would have enjoyed it more if the characters had any charm. The movie expects you to feel sympathy for the main character, but it's never earned. He has a cozy job ""composing"" mood music for a TV cop show. In his spare time, he just lounges around doing nothing. His girlfriend is a TV star and he cries (quite literally) like a baby when she dumps him. I think the 40-year-old virgin had more testosterone than Jason Segel's character. Steve Carell was also likable and actually made you root for him. Watching Segel's self-loathing character mope around sadly when you know he's inevitably going to be with the beautiful Mila Kunis becomes tiresome. There are other obnoxious, unfunny characters.

not my cup of tea,"Another Judd Apatow produced film-so its another question of why did I bother seeing it when it clear I'm not going to be happy. Okay its not bad but it didn't thrill me.In a nutshell Peter is a composer for TV series. His girlfriend is Sarah Marshall the hot star of a hot cop show. She dumps him for a Lothario singer and he pines for her. He then goes off to Hawaii and ends up at the same resort that the ex and her new beau end up at.For me the problem is, as with Knocked Up, I can not understand what the two main characters, here Peter and Sarah, are doing together. Peter is a sweet schulb of a guy and she is twit, a babe but a bit shallow. What are they doing together? Or rather why is she with him in the first place?I kind of lost respect for the originality for the film when Peter is seen in one of the first scenes sitting on the couch with a huge bowl of cereal letting himself go until Sarah calls, he then goes and straightens himself out. But its been done before, why are we doing it again? Give the filmmakers points for showing Peter naked a couple of times (in places he really would be naked-which made sense to me but cause much of the audience to laugh around me, I'm guessing from nervousness) but take a good many away from not being creative enough to stay out of the cliché rut. I did like the final bits of the film which actually seemed to have real characters and situations but I getting to that point was a chore. Its clear that the creative team can make a winning romantic film as evidenced from several of the final scenes, but for me it was too little too late.Your mileage may vary.

Disappointing,Absolutely nonsense.Do not watch it even if you have so much sapare time,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should Be Called 'Forgettable' Sarah Marshall,"I went to see this movie a week ago, because of all the good reviews it's been given. Richard Roeper said it was 'one of the greatest comedies of all time'. It was also produced by Judd Apatow, who directed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", which is most definitely one of the greatest comedies of all time. So, of course, I went to the theater expecting to laugh my butt off. Needless to say, the movie did not live up to the hype at all. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it definitely wasn't the best either. I must admit it had potential, but I think the ball was dropped on this one.For one thing, for a comedy, it wasn't that funny. It had it's amusing moments, but only one or two laugh out loud moments. I could see there were a few lines that I think the writers intended to be funny, but they were awkward and fell flat. And there were a few too many melodramatic moments for my liking. It's not really a straight out comedy, it's more like a raunchy chick flick with a few humorous moments.Another thing, the editing is atrocious. I don't usually notice that sort of thing, but the cuts were so abrupt it was almost a distraction. Obviously, the person working in the editing room either had too much to drink the night before, had no idea what they were doing or perhaps it was a combination of both.There was also a lot of bad acting. The main characters are mostly TV actors and it was painfully obvious that they aren't ready for the big screen. Jason Segal, who played Peter Bretter, was the biggest offender. Though he's cute, there was no way someone as gorgeous as Kristen Bell would ever give him a second look in real life. The audience was told repeatedly in the movie that Peter was extremely charismatic, charming and funny as heck. The problem is that he was actually none of those. He's actually very average, boring and not very funny. There is also no way that someone like Mila Kunis' character, Rachel, who is also extremely beautiful and has a pretty wild life, would ever fall for him either. The two people who really shine in this movie is Russell Brand as perverted rocker Aldous Snow and Bill Hader, who plays it straight and serious as Peter's step-brother Brian.And I wasn't the only one who thought this way. The theater was half full and no one except my husband and I laughed throughout the whole film. And we only laughed maybe once or twice.All in all, it wasn't that great and I regretted having spent nine dollars in order to see it. If you're really interested in watching it, I'd wait until it comes out on DVD and then I'd get it from the Redbox.

HORRIBLE! This movie fails in just about every way a movie can!,"How this movie got good reviews, I will never know. And how people got tricked into liking this movie, is mind boggling. Just a note, I really liked Get Him to The Greek & I Love You Man, so I usually enjoy this realm of comedy. But the comedy in this movie is weak and falls flat. In hindsight, I try to think of one funny moment in this movie and I honestly can't. Well then; the story line must be good and/or entertaining... nope, not at all. The 2 main characters are undeveloped and unlikeable as well. The main character Peter (Jason Segel) is really good in I love you man, so it was obviously the directer and the story line that sucked. Mila Kunis (Rachel) has some like-ability. I also like the Aldous Snow character, but that can't even come close to making up for this pathetic excuse for a movie. It's not only humorless, but approx 3/4 of this movie are uncomfortable to watch and at no point are they situations that are uncomfortable in a funny way. I don't always dock a movie because of predictability, but from the moment Peter get's to his vacation destination, you know exactly how this movie will play out. Some things in life are unexplainable; for example, the Pyramids and how people got tricked into liking this movie. It's uncompromisable & mind boggling!

A refreshingly vulgar romantic comedy.,"Characters: 2 Screenplay: 4 Cinematography: 1 Emotional: 3 Overall: 3.0 This film felt different than other comedies. While some of the script writing stereotypical elements a bit far, it still left a nice fresh feeling in my mouth. Jason Segel did an great job with the writing and pacing. The jokes are well timed, and range from vulgar to funny digs. Even though the cast is filled with those known more for their TV shows, there were good performances all around.The film starts off with shocking and memorable scenes revolving around Jason Segel and his seemingly distance star ex, but slowly unfolds to something more realistic and relate-able. The ex isn't portrayed as a complete bitch and cause of all the issues, and each character shows themselves to be more rounded than you'd expect. Jason Segel was excellent with the lead role he wrote, Mila Kunis is charismatic, Kristen Bell is crazy, but Russell Brand and his character is hilarious.The only thing is that you don't really feel that there really could be a relationship between any of the people that were. But that certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. A refreshingly vulgar romantic comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

The writing is shallow and atrocious - no talent whatsoever - as one reviewer put it ""it seems like it was written by a 13 year old boy"". There was no humor unless one laughs hysterically at the mention or sight of a bodily function with no other wit/intelligence. The two male leads were dreadful!!! The two female leads were very attractive which should count for something, but there were so many strong negatives that the movie deserves a subzero rating. The one good mini scene was a short monologue by Kristen Bell when she says ""I tried ..."", but that dialogue effectively destroys the so called plot.

There are some scenes in this movie that are completely unnecessary, slowing the pacing down to a point where you keep checking the watch. Some characters are annoyingly unbelievable, like the smoking hot receptionist who just happens to be the nicest, most down-to-earth girl and falls in love with an unattractive slob such as the main character.Seriously, I'm not asking for much when it comes to comedies, but when a movie gets as much praise as this one, I'm hoping for a little better entertainment. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" does have some good scenes, but all in all it is slightly amusing at best. If you liked ""Knocked Up"", you're gonna love this.

The film's premise has mild potential as it sees Jason Segel's Peter Bretter getting dumped by his TV star girlfriend and jetting off to Hawaii to get over her, only to find she is staying at the same hotel with her new boyfriend (Brand). However, what follows is a by-the-numbers plot line that is straight out of the standard Hollywood Rom-com scriptbook. There is little of the originality that made The 40-year-old Virgin such a break-out hit.Jason Segel is barely a poor man's Steve Carrell or even Seth Rogen, with little of the hangdog likability that either of those had in abundance – to the extent where you wonder what Kristin Bell's Sarah Marshall of the title (herself little more than an identikit blonde) ever saw in him in the first place. Russell Brand is his usual obnoxious self whilst Mila Kunis plays the standard model new girl in Peter's life, but she at least manages to breathe some charm into an otherwise two-dimensional role. Apatow merely produced this film, and the lack of his name in the writing credits has clearly harmed this comedy.The humour is less painfully funny and more just painful for large parts, while any time that Brand is on the screen is outright nauseating. The story plods along going in no direction in particular, seeming content to just meander and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hawaii, which the entire film feels like an extended advert for the holiday island. There are one or two mildly amusing scenes, generally involving Kunis, but do not expect this to live up to Knocked Up or Superbad; its pales in comparison. Perhaps Apatow has become a victim of his own success, as expectations are very high now, and this certainly did not live up to them. Had expectations not been so high, then possibly the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii and Kunis's charm might have made this film somewhat watchable.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Raunchy,"I liked 40-Year-Old Virgin a lot, even though Steve Carrell is usually a bit too odd for me. And Knocked Up was one of my favorites of that year, in spite of those crazy sex scenes. But this movie really pushes the envelope too far. To be fair, the funny moments in this movie were very good, and it was thoroughly enjoyable during those times. However, the balance of romance and gross overboard nastiness was not well-balanced this time, in my opinion. I think that most good movies are kept from being great by editing too much of it away. In the case of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the director, Nicholas Stoller, could probably have used Apatow's eye in the cutting room.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Okay,"It was funny at times but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The acting wasn't bad at all. The characters were believably emotional at the right times. It just seemed to drag on and was just boring. It didn't really have a good build to the plot, more like a crawl over an ant hill. It was boring at times focusing too much on the melodrama but I could be wrong.Surprisingly Mila Kunis was surprisingly the worst character in this film and I really like that actress.The jokes were okay but not really funny. If you see the trailer then you see really the only good humor in the movie.Over if there's nothing else on its something to do but I wouldn't pay for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not funny enough for my tastes,"It's too long, too vulgar (even when edited for television) and not funny enough for my tastes. The Dracula musical is the highlight of the movie. I like Jason Segel.

very much in the same vein as recent apatow films.......but a dearth of laughs,"dorky guy is dumped by beautiful woman seeks solace, and surprise another stunning beautiful woman falls for him.just no forget to include the humor this time. ..just kinda there. let's hope the cut i saw is spruced up....the female cast is game, but just treated with disrespect and as cardboard stereotypes. In fact, all the cast and characters....been there. seen that. cameos from Jonah Hill and Paul Ruud as stock characters in the Apatow can. Ruud has a few yucks. Jack McBrayer as a honeymooner is yet again the same character ... he is so funny on 30 rock. i wonder if he is one-trick pony.and just too much male nudity. not funny and not needed.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Forgetting Forgetting Sarah Marshall is easy,"Full of high hopes, I set the DVD loose in the player and prepare for the best. Through the first scenes involving far too many seconds of gratuitous male nudity of the the main character Peter Bretter (Jason Segel)isn't most male nudity in movies gratuitous?we both stay the course thinking, ""Well, it's certainly not going to continue in this vein."" We've just seen the initiating breakup scene, where Sarah (Kristen Bell) arrives to Peter's apartment to give him the bad news, and he starts crying standing there and running around in the altogether. In the next few weeks Peter thrashes about having bouts of depressionpersonally I don't see getting all broken up over this little Superficial Sarahand meaningless sex, which, again, doesn't have to be anywhere near that explicit to get the point across.Indeed, if there's one main objection I want to make covering the entire film, it's that writer and/or director seem to want to make physically explicit every conceivable interaction among the charactersespecially scenes that might otherwise be humorous in subtlety and implication. We don't get to have any imagination....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Terrible comedy,"When I came here to see the ratings for ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", the average was 7.7 stars. A lot of 9-star and 10-star ratings. I avoid doing supposedly objective analyzes of anything, especially films, but here I'll make an exception: this film is awful, it is totally overrated. It's one of the most boring comedies I've ever seen in my life. It is hard to believe that this project was actually approved by executives in a studio.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Crude and unfunny,"I am always a bit shocked by the vulgarity of American humour, which is rude, vulgar and crass toilet humour. This one is one of the worst that I have seen. It is a not so veiled attempt to undermine a loving harmonious society with poisonous filth. This repeated recipe has succeeded in destroying western civilisation after centuries of hard and loving labour by our forefathers. The lead actor is really obnoxious and talentless and it would have been better if this had been a crime movie where he was murdered and his girlfriend was investigating the crime. His girlfriend was also obnoxious and completely right for him. The puppet finale was ghastly.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
They just can't make us laugh,"Proper comedians can make us laugh by being funny completely on-the-spot, such as interviews, podcasts etc I'm talking about the likes of Louis CK, Ricky Gervais, Larry David, Bill Burr, Adam Carolla, Patton Oswalt etc. If you ever hear these guys they are completely hilarious with zero effort and zero preparation. Then at the other end of the spectrum you have this rubbish. Give a guy 30 million dollars budget and god knows how many man-hours to make a funny movie and he succeeds in making me laugh a total of about 3 times. It is absolutely pathetic. What is worse is that these movies are cash-cows, is this really the standard of comedy in the year 2013? Crude sexual references and scenes every 2 minutes, none of them funny. The bulk of the script dedicated to couples having bitchy arguments and fake dramatic (teary-eyed) speeches about love. I cannot believe a man actually wrote this, clearly at some point in the process somebody made sure it was loaded up with this female melodrama so it could sell more tickets. Does anyone in the world seriously want to see a couple argue? Christ, give me 1 minute of Bill Burr's podcast over 2 hours of this carp. LAME",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Get smelling salts to wake people up,This movie was mildly funny at times. It was too long to stay funny. Why waste time with the virgin couple and the waiter who was in superbad? Those parts of this movie were boring. Funniest poop was between the actor from that TV show with Neil Patrick Harris and rock star guy that was a John Mayer clone. That had me laughing. Rock star character saved this movie from being a BOMB!!!!. I'm a fan of Ben Stiller when it comes to romantic comedy type movies. Forgetting Sarah Marshell was trying to either be a romantic comedy or serious drama like Some Kind of Wonderful. Never was either. Thr real life GF from that actor Home alone confronts her ex on a beach. I'm thinking okay this going some place. NOTHING. later the TV show actor guy is waited on by the waiter that punches him after shagging oh so hot reception desk girl. this time happy guy refuses drink. hey didn't that guy beat you up on the beach? Rent if based in rock star character. Thay guy is FUNNY.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time.,"Thanks to corona, I have come across this piece of crap. Let's just say, just cause you can pay a ""well known"" actor/ actress to play a certain role, does not guarantee the story line to be decent.
I have no idea what the heck they were thinking. I waited until half way through the movie and gave up. Nothing but a grown ass man who acts like a 2 year old when he goes through a break up. He kinda gives me Phyco stalker vibes as well.

Typical white guy humour,"Foul language, unnecessary frontal male nudity, attempts at making deviant sexual behavior the norm or desirable. The lead character is just annoying.

One of the most disappointing movies ever...,"In fact, i had high expectations before watching this movie. Really i had... I read lot's of good commends about it ( It has 7.4 points over 10 on IMDb!

Keeping all of them in mind, i prepared myself for a good and enjoying survey. But unfortunately what i got is bad acting, unnecessary nudity (how come a person could think that watching a crying fat completely nude guy is funny anyway? or Was it necessary to show Mina Kunis's breasts on a picture on the wall of a toilet? ), bad dialogs and waste of 2 hours in my precious life.

"You're pretty; no, you're pretty; trust me you're a lot prettier than I am. okay you're right!","This is one of those movies that I both disliked and enjoyed at the same time. I'll try to explain why.The lead actor, who also happens to be the writer to producer the director and goodness knows what else, and whom I have never heard of before nor ever seen in anything at all, was playing a pathetic character with the shapeless blob of an embarrassing silhouette for a body. He is obviously an exhibitionist with a real life humiliation fetish, as there was no reason for him to lingeringly be flashing his cock any chance he got, gratuitously, and several times at that! On the plus side it wasn't a female for a change, except for a photo of Mila Kunis' budding training bra ""contents"", which left so much to be desired, that one has to wonder if what they say about humiliation rituals in Hollywood are actually a thing. Clearly was one, and shame on her for flashing her shortcomings.Kristen Bell's character was pathetic and unlikable to the max and also surprised that she would accept such a (supporting) role. Her flip-flopping at the end seemed out of character and made the movie all the less enjoyable.Russell Brand was just Russell Brand and i already forgot that I came here to check if he was actually a sober person during filming just like his character. In the end, I couldn't care less. The story is ok and the movie's fast-paced enough, but I don't know what everybody else is talking about Hawaii, because you don't see Hawaii scenery at all; it takes place pretty much indoors in a hotel room, restaurant or bar and that's it.I agree with those who said it was too vulgar for my taste, but there is actually more pathetic and vulgar, as I had the displeasure of founding out earlier today when I watched the beginning of Some kind of Beautiful with Pierce Brosnan.The Dracula puppet show was a tiny bits interesting with excellent singing but pretty much pathetic and there's not much of anything else going on except for the beautiful rendition of Sinead O'Connor's Nothing compares 2U but in Hawaiian lyrics by Daniel Ho. Comes at the very end, as the credits roll. Skip the movie to the end and listen to this song and then it will be perfect entertainment; as it is I'm giving it to 6/10 and I sure hope never to have to see another film featuring the shapeless, buttless body of this Jason character, whatever his last name is. The film is rated way too high on here.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jason Segel at his best...,"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a man breaking up with his TV star girlfriend. They both traveling to Hawaii without knowing that the other one will be there. Things are getting even more complicated when she brings her new boyfriend.I liked this comedy movie because it contained many hilarious scenes along with a simple but funny plot with some plot twists I did not expect. The interpretation of Jason Segel who played as Peter Bretter was simply hilarious and he made the difference on this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Mila Kunis' who played as Rachel Jansen, Russell Brand's who played as Aldous Snow and Kristen Bell's who played as Sarah Marshall. The direction which was made by Nicholas Stoller was very good and he made very clear from the start of his movie that the audience will laugh a lot. Lastly, I have to say that ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a nice movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure that you will laugh a lot too.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Apatow triumph,"""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is yet another fantastic comedy from producer Judd Apatow, the man who gave us ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" a few years back.As with those previous films, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" which was written by Jason Segel (who plays the lead role) and directed by Nicholas Stoller, has as its center a fairly ordinary person just trying to make some kind sense out of a world that seemingly could care less that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In this case it's Peter Bretter, a fairly average-looking musician, whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Mila Kunis), the beautiful star of a cheesy TV crime drama, has just dumped him for Aldous Snow, a scruffy, longhaired rocker played by Russell Brand. In an effort to get over his loss, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii, only to discover that Sarah and Aldous are staying at the same hotel he's checking into.The element that separates ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" from so many other sex-tinged comedies these days is that it actually knows how to find humor in the offbeat moments of life. The jokes are never obvious, and the situation, though certainly contrived to some extent, is close enough to real life to make us care. Furthermore, the screenplay boasts an unusually large number of impressive secondary characters, including Bill Hader as Peter's exasperated stepbrother; Jack McBrayer (""30 Rock's Kevin the Page) as a sexually repressed man on his honeymoon; Jonah Hill as a sycophantic maître d'; Da'Vone McDonald as a blunt-spoken bartender; Paul Rudd as a zonked-out, 40ish surfer; William Baldwin and Jason Bateman as Sarah's hammy costars; Taylor Riley as a chef with a sumo wrestler build; and Kristen Bell as a sweet and gorgeous hotel clerk who has a few issues of her own lurking just beneath her deceptively placid surface.Each is a joy to watch and each brings something unique and refreshing to the comedy table. And that's not something one can say about most movie comedies these days.",,Anonymous,Romance
hats off to Jason Segel who finds the right balance,"An uninspired TV music composer has his heart shattered into a million little pieces when out of the blue he's dumped by his girlfriend of five years, a big-name television actress. Devastated, all by himself, and feeling like a sad sack, he decides to flee LA for an impromptu trip to Oahu hoping to clear the cobwebs. Wouldn't you just know it, but his relaxing getaway turns into a powder keg when the ex-girlfriend in question shows up at the same resort canoodling with her sprightly new rock star boyfriend, a daft Londoner and lothario with loose morals. Segel goes for broke in a dual role of lead actor and screenwriter in this laugh-out loud funny comedy that effectively melds the raunch with the romance, smartly never overdoing either one, plus he's in good company as each of the other actors are just as well-suited to their respective roles. It concludes inevitably, but the journey there is a fun one, and it also takes a few jabs at the world of television for those who enjoy that sort of thing. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
An overlooked sweet & raunchy comedy,"**A WORD OF WARNING: This film features brief but full-on frontal male nudity of the star actor (Jason Segel). The scenes are short and don't spoil an otherwise good movie, but viewers should be warned up front to avoid any possible movie night embarrassment. (It is a rated-R comedy, remember.)**The movie is about a man (Jason Segel, also the writer) wallowing around in self-pity after being dumped by his girlfriend of five years, who happens to be a famous TV star. To clear his mind the man treats himself to a Hawaiian vacation, but runs into his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell) with another man (Russell Brand). Unlikely as it may seem, the film takes an uplifting turn in the second half. The man learns to stop feeling sorry for himself and move on with his life. I'd say that FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is a great film about breakups, as it shows how depressing they can be, but leaves the viewer with a sense that people can pick up the pieces of their lives and get back on track.I think this film is overlooked when it comes to recent comedy hits. Everybody loves THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, SUPERBAD, and THE HANGOVER, but SARAH MARSHALL seems to be forgotten in a sort of second-tier of also-rans. I think this movie is plenty funny (and plenty raunchy, if that's what you're looking for), with a lot of heart and soul. I think the taboo of frontal male nudity probably scared some people away, but looking past these brief sight gags the movie is a winner in my book.I also think that people don't appreciate how great this film is on a couple different levels. The character of Aldous Snow (Brand) is a world-famous singer and the film includes two of his original songs. It's really worth checking out the full music video for ""We've Got To Do Something"" on the DVD. The film itself only shows snippets and they can't do the song justice. The whole thing is hilarious, both the lyrics and the accompanying video. Also, Jason Segel's character in the movie stages a Dracula-themed puppet musical. The concept for such a musical was an actual idea Segel had in his mind for years. The songs are all original, the puppets were created for the film by the Jim Henson Company, and some actors actually get to do some puppeteering. The hit TV show that stars Sarah Marshall is a over-the-top parody of shows like ""CSI"" or ""Law & Order"", with Billy Baldwin providing terrible and inappropriate one-liners.A lot of effort had to go into these songs/shows-within-a-show, and I feel that the creativity goes under-appreciated. The film is funny at the surface, but it's even more impressive upon further consideration.Russell Brand is great at delivering hilariously constructed bits of dialogue, and his performance here is a minor revelation to viewers unfamiliar with the British comedian. The cast also includes many Judd Apatow regulars, notably Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Bill Hader. Rudd's supporting role has some great moments. Some less-famous actors stand out in supporting roles as staff at the Hawaiian resort. The whole ensemble (which include's Mila Kunis and ""30 Rock""'s Jack McBrayer) is pretty solid.FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is full of depictions of and references to sexual intercourse and features quite a bit of profanity as well as brief nudity. It is rated R for a reason. But it's one of those ""raunchy comedies with a heart"", produced by Judd Apatow. Much of the humor is sex-related and/or vulgar and, as one would expect, the film features trademark Apatovian improvisation.It's a lot of fun, from the endearing characters to the comedic performances to the charming Dracula puppets. Shot on location, the film really captures what I'd like to believe is the feel of a Hawaiian vacation, with the sun always shining and the blue ocean in the background.The movie didn't impress me at first, but it had grown on me by the time it ended. There's plenty of funny R-rated comedy, but the uplifting spirit of the film is what really won me over. This film makes me feel good.",,Anonymous,Romance
No envy here.,"I'm trying to forget director Nicholas Stoller's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a female's rom/com cum rude male comedy, because it feels so much like director Judd Apatow's 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. But maybe that's OK because it can be witty where the others are just funny. And Apatow is producer.Writer Jason Segel plays Peter, a TV composer whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, played by Kristen Bell, dumps him. He falls apart and goes to Hawaii to regroup only to see her there as well with new boyfriend. You can fill in the rom/com blanks.Except for the frontal male nudity, not an elegant addition to any film, but becoming a rule with Apatow film.
