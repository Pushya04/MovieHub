A thought-provoking and darkly comedic drama with lots to say.,"""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either.The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed.One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally.If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Anger begets more anger,"Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A comedic masterpiece with a stellar leading performance from Frances McDormand.,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script.For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place.It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a clich√© one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A dark, twisted comedy about grief, tragedy and three billboards","Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This is how a drama should be!,"Martin McDonagh has made critically acclaimed throughout his career. I haven't seen In Bruges but I liked Seven Psychopaths. However, it's with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri that made me realise what a talented writer and director he is.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri follows Mildred, a mother that rents three billboards to challenge the authorities in order to find and capture her daughter's murderer after they fail to do so.With this film, Martin McDonagh has crafted one of my favourite dramas to ever exist. I was thoroughly entertained throughout and couldn't spot a single thing I didn't like. One of the best parts of this film is its unpredictability. With a story like this, I thought I knew where it was headed but McDonagh managed to surprise me every time. Without taking the route many films do with this kind of story, McDonagh subverts our expectations by taking us on a more psychological journey with the characters of Mildred, Dixon and Willoughby. The writing is one of the smartest I've ever seen as McDonagh writes characters with immense depth and emotion. No character is perfect and as the films unfolds, McDonagh peels back the layers of each one of them to create an arc you wouldn't expect them to have on their odyssey of anger, revenge and love. The realistic and humane approach McDonagh takes made me genuinely care about the characters. There are also moments of dark humour spread across but they don't take away from the dramatic elements and impact you're meant to feel.Aside from Martin McDonagh's outstanding writing and direction, the acting is some of the best you'll see. Frances McDormand is an actress that consistently delivers exceptional performances and her performance as Mildred is one of her best. She is an absolute force to be reckoned with and deserves winner the Oscar for her work here. Sam Rockwell is extraordinary as Dixon. This is his best performance yet and he deserves all the awards he got for this film. Woody Harrelson is terrific as usual and plays Willoughby with enormous skill. John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges and Caleb Landry Jones are also great.Every single aspect of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is done exceptionally well. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest films of 2017. With its dark subject matter, impeccable writing, directing and extraordinary acting, I consider this film to be one of the best dramas to ever exist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Entertaining, but flawed","There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand's character in this film really struck a chord with people. She's on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation. She doesn't care who she offends, she won't be intimidated into silence, and she'll stand up for herself in some violent ways. In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he's dealing with that. The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film's best. Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching. There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line ""Penelope said 'begets'?"", in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand's ex-husband.The film started strong, but along the way started losing me. It suffers artistically from a lack of restraint, and everything seems exaggerated. The profanity. The characters, who start becoming cartoonish. The level of violence. The coincidences. It seems to me that McDonagh's writing is a real issue here. Her last words to her daughter were ""I hope you get raped,"" really? To leave that in the script is egregiously bad, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The Molotov cocktails, really? The guy being in the station to begin with, and of course wearing ear buds, really? A man thrown out of a window, and no arrest, really? And on and on, until an ending which is pretty awful if you think about it. It's just tough to appreciate the message of the film or its cast in light of all this. It was entertaining to watch, but in my humble opinion, not worthy of all the acclaim.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Comedy, tragedy and morality rolled into one","Saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the promise of one of the year's best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh's previous work.On the most part 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film's many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it.Did have a couple of issues with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one.Epileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed).Abbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn't have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred.There are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon's actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.However, there is so much to like about 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn't in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand's performance is a career high and one of the year's best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don't condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother's worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film's most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage's, although Dinklage doesn't have the film's most tragic scene).Sam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it's the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him.Another standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not ""likeable"" ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially).A large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It's the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does.With the exception of one scene, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell's music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous ""Last Rose of Summer"" exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere.Overall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year's best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Tense and unpredictable in every way.,"This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.Every actor in this film did so tremendous as well. I really can't think of an actor or actress that outshines the rest. But if I had to pick favorites, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were just that. But a lot of that just has to go into the writing of the characters themselves. The cinematography in this film allows the actors to take advantage of facial expression. There's a scene relatively early in the film that is mostly sitting and staring but the actors have such convincing movements and gestures, it goes to a point where you don't need dialogue to tell what they are feeling and what they are thinking about.Really the only issue I have in this film is some scenes felt a little unnecessary. Can't give away too much without spoiling, but in a film where every character goes through in arc, there's one character that is just there to break tension and crack personally unfunny jokes. But this character did not affect my score and they were barely in the film.I highly recommend checking this out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Drama and comedy at the highest level,"I went to see this movie because I hadn't seen any trailers to it. It's something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can't even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout.

"'All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.'","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement.The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Inconsolable grief,"It's ironic that the first of Frances McDormand's Oscars came for her portrayal of a
sheriff in Fargo. For her second one she plays the antagonist to a sheriff she
feels isn't doing her job. The sheriff is a most popular individual in the town,
Woody Harrelson. But this is a woman with a mission.None of the people in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri are of any kind of
heroic stature. They're just I suspect as ordinary as any of us with our good points and bad. One of them, Deputy Sam Rockwell is one unapologetic
racist who uses his badge to harass and assault folks of a different skin tone.
He's McDormand's greatest antagonist and in the end the two come to an 
interesting relationship.McDormand is a mother who just can't accept the loss of her daughter. I'm the
son of one who never got over the loss of her daughter. But my sister died of
natural causes, McDormand's teen daughter went out one night against parental advice and was raped and murdered.That was months ago and there's no accepting her loss for McDormand. She
got her Best Actress Oscar not just for words spoken, but for some incredible
body language and facial expressions. Her rage at what she sees is the lack of
interest by law enforcement will not be abated.So what she has done is out of whatever money she has scraped up together is
pay for three large billboards outside the main thoroughfare of the town of
Ebbing, Missouri calling attention to the lack of progress on her daugher's
homicide and getting personal with Chief Woody Harrelson. Harrelson in turn
has some personal problems of a serious nature which the town knows about
and the sympathy that McDormand might have had is turning to resentment 
toward her.Her grief isn't the only thing that has turned McDormand into the unpleasant
creature she is. Her husband John Hawkes who seems to be no great prize
himself left her for a 19 year old chippie. Her son Lucas Hedges is also feeling
alienated from both parents.There's no such place as Ebbing, Missouri but the uniformly fine ensemble of
players sure makes you think you're in mid country America looking in on a place that's a cross between Grover's Corner in Our Town and Winesburg, Ohio
in the 21st century. Of course the cast is topped by Oscar winners Frances McDormand for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor.
Woody Harrelson also got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor

Picture.See this one by all means.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The storyline is interesting but low and the message is intense, important, but already heard in many other movies and books.
Violence creates violence, only forgiveness or the ability to leave things go can stop the circle: it is absolutely true, however we already know it.
The picture of the United States in a quiet small village is maybe too negative and exagerated, the total opposite of some american comedies in which everything seems perfect: here everything seems corrupted, violent, full of anger and hate, hypocritical.

McDormand is in fine form,"12/3/17. I got a free ticket to see this but I wasn't sure if I would like it. That's because in recent years McDormand has been playing the bitter older woman,unhappy with life. However, she was a surprise in this. Though she continued in the vein of the unhappy older woman she is somewhat subdued in her anger over the stalled investigation into her teen daughter's death. However, she has enough anger to launch a publicity campaign against the police department, in particular, the police chief who has his own health issues to deal with. The film is basically a slice of life of small town USA and does not paint a very pretty picture of small town living. Worth catching.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A nice change of pace from universe destruction films,"To suggest Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, is contrived is to ignore that the entire town is contrived. In fact, Ebbing, Missouri, does not exist, I know, because I looked for it on Google Maps, and if Google does not know where something is, it simply does not exist.It's no secret that Frances McDormand is quietly powerful and a top- notch performer. Sam Rockwell does his thing in a role that requires less, and Woody Harrelson offers us a rare moment: we almost forget he's Woody Harrelson, even if for a moment, despite his clangy drawl and lack of hair.I venture to guess this movie is about finding quiet power in a world where extroverts dominate. Being a woman, being a dwarf, being black, being poor, being sick, or possibly being gay, these are aspects we are told should be quiet, while others can be loud and yell and get what they want, because the early bird gets the worm, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and hard work leads to promotions and a better life because Good Life Choices.Rectangular billboards are flat circles, time is a fleeting concept, and some problems cannot be solved now or ever, despite what we want or what we need.Buy some ad space and speak your minds!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
How can one film be so perfect in so many ways?,"Last year I had the unfortunate duty of giving the eventual Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards a negative review. 'Moonlight' was not a movie that sat well with me. Now this is a very early call on my part but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm writing the review for the 2018 winner as we speak, and I can assure you it's not going to be a negative review this time around. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the finest film I have watched in a long time. How a film that can break your heart so effortlessly can also manage to be so damn funny and charming at the same time is simply beyond me. It shouldn't be possible. However writer/director Martin McDonagh proves that it can indeed be done.Frances McDormand in the lead role is astonishingly good. There are many cries at the moment that there aren't enough movies with females in the lead role. Well showing them that the best film in 2017 has one is a good place to base your argument from. She is so good that you can feel her broken heart and soul almost as if it is your own. Sam Rockwell is also nothing short of superb. He remains one for the best actors working today and I only wish he would take on more work. Finally Woody Harrelson is fantastic in the film. He seems to be so endlessly charming in every film he appears in these days. Was that always the case? Regardless, he is a brilliant edition to this film.Be prepared going into this movie is all I will say. It will take you on an abolsute rollercoaster of emotions. There are times where a hilarious line is delivered and you might actually stop and question yourself, ""Am I allowed to laugh in a film this dark?"" I know the Oscar nominations aren't even out yet, but I am extremely hopeful that this is the final film read out on ceremony night. Great films deserve great recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One Of The Best Films Of The Year,"It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.From the very first few frames of this film, you can tell the tone will be handled perfectly. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh with pure class, you can tell that he was very passionate when bringing this film to fruition. Every line of dialogue either progressed the story along, developed a character, made the audience laugh, or provided deep insight into the event of the murder itself. While not having the bearings of a conventional murder mystery, many viewers may not like the way this film concludes, but in the context of the movie as a whole and everything it's setting out to accomplish, it really does have a realistic and true finale.It's arguable that some of the law enforcement officers play just as significant a role as Mildred does throughout the film, being pretty much present every time a revelation occurs, but I gravitated the most towards Officer Dixon. I've always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell, and his character here is one of the most essential to this story, set on being there from beginning to end, trying his absolute best to be of any help. While Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Chief Willoughby is by far the most important to the story at hand, it's the characters around him that drive him to his actions throughout the course of the movie. The characters are truly what make this film as likable as it is, and they're all wonderfully drawn.Overall, when looking back on my experience watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, I find myself not being able to wait until its official theatrical release to watch it again. I found this film to be stellar in every sense of the word. From a noteworthy performance by Francis McDormand, devoted secondary performances, a screenplay that will have you consistently laughing, while also being emotionally involved with the serious storyline at hand, and pulling the audience in with its subtly composed score, everything about this film is worth praise. This was a huge surprise for me and I can't recommend you checking it out enough. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic piece of modern cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Absolutely amazing; blows everything else out of the water!,"We saw this last week at a special screening as part of the SAG Film Society series and it just blew everything else we had seen away! I really loved Breathe and Wild River, but this was not only riveting in its development and surprising in its plot twists, but just fascinating to watch. The plot is crafted like an intricate puzzle that slowly spins out as the characters interact and react in completely unpredictable ways. The only thing I did NOT like about it is the ending, because I felt it not only left the audience hanging in the middle of the film, without resolving to a satisfying (for me) conclusion, but I also did not want it to END! That's how fascinating the characterizations are. McDormand and Rockwell are both standouts, but Harrelson definitely holds his own with them, as well as all of the supporting cast. I don't usually write reviews, but this was so memorable that I had to post something. I will not give anything away because it is better the less you know, but GO SEE IT!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unusually deep for a crime drama,"Original, deep and thought provoking films like this one are hard to come by these days. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes a completely different approach to the conventional crime drama. Instead of detailing the story behind the missing girl, the focus is instead of the mother's way of dealing with the disappearance and how she handles her grief and anger towards the authorities.This film is excellent in just about every area. The script is intelligent and surprisingly funny, the storyline engaging and convincing, and the acting is first rate. Frances McDormand is outstanding in the lead and thoroughly deserved her Oscar.'Three Billboards' is a unique and fascinating film, great filmmaking all-round and highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"An almost perfect exploration of justice, revenge and redemption, with amusing and extremely witty dialogue","This is a great movie whose only fault is that dialogue is sometimes too witty for its own good.But this is a deep and touching movie, that speaks the truth and inspires and touches the viewer. Like Blue Ruin, it has a lot to say about justice and injustice and has an ironic steak, but it is a somewhat richer and more interesting movie.Apart from great acting and interesting premise, it has a fun dialogue that sometimes comes across as contrived and unnatural, and that is the only objection to it. But it is great fun, and movie has a lot to say and it does in a way that uses talents of perhaps the best English speaking screenwriter of this age, if you are into darkly humorous tones and intelligent and profoundly true script. The best of the applied Irish literature at work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I dissent. Regretfully.,"I wanted this movie to be great. It wasn't. The performance by Frances McDormand is good but not great. She's very good at showing overwhelming anger, but that's all she's allowed. Her character never gets the chance to breathe. Blame the script, not her--she's a terrific actor, but this is a one-note performance.2. There is a sub-theme about race. Race is an important issue and deserves to be treated honestly, but in this movie, it felt like a side-road that led nowhere. (It actually feels like moral preening on the part of the scriptwriter. It didn't add much to the movie's meaning.3. Wonderful performances by Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as a police chief and officer. Woody especially brought grace to a character who at first seemed unsympathetic. (BTW, McDormand's ex-husband has a young and beautiful girlfriend, and that relationship is treated as awkward and shameful. Harrelson's wife is young and beautiful, and that relationship is treated as idyllic.)4. Police officers don't talk like that among themselves or to others.5. I particularly didn't like the Chief's take on racist cops, saying essentially that all cops are racist. That may be accepted as dogma by some Hollywood screenwriters, but any chief who talks about his beloved employees--or cops in general--like that shouldn't be a cop. Coming from this character, the sentiment is cheap and clunky and inexplicable.6. There are a couple of plot holes wide enough to drive a billboard through sideways. The most egregious (no spoiler here) is what happens (actually what should have happened but didn't) immediately following the window scene. (You'll know the scene when you see it.) The thing not happening was necessary keep the plot going. Everything that happened after that feels tainted as artificial and contrived. Likewise a later scene in a bar, involving a coincidence beyond coincidence.7. It's impossible McDormand's character wouldn't have been arrested several times in the course of the movie, for several serious crimes. Once again, he plot depends on that not happening, and thus the plot again is contrived.8. There's a letter delivered to Rockwell's character late in the movie which is full of Hallmark Card sentimental drivel. It can't be justified by either what we know of that character or what we know of the writer.In a world (as the movie trailers used to say) where we are awash in numbskull comic book movies and incoherent special effects spectacles, it was a small miracle this film even came to my local cinema.

Hyperbole,"I always enjoy watching Frances McDormand ever since I saw her in ""Fargo"". She is one of Hollywood's best actresses and doesn't disappoint here.

Also trapped in the pointless plot is another favorite, Woody Harrelson as the Police Chief, but he has to play it straight in this misconceived black comedy.The cast play foul-mouthed white trash types, but in the Midwest rather than the South.

mixed bag,"Three Billboards is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are carnivalesque, outrageous and troubling in one turn, heroic and inspiring at the next. McDonagh quite deliberately does not let you find a moral centre in his tale. There is a 'save the cat' moment very early in the film, a character helping an insect rather than crushing it, that is so mechanical that I flinched. Shame on me for falling so easily into McDonagh's trap. The plot zig-zags and leaves you breathless trying to process each new piece of information. The dialogue crackles with delicious insults. I laughed hard, and often. And then I cried. And winced. And laughed again. There is one scene of quite shocking violence. The performances have been lauded, and rightly so, as Frances McDormand, Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell , and Woody Harrelson bump and smack against each other tied to the roller-coaster plot. Peter Dinklage gets the chance to show his range. But while the praise for the acting is merited, the praise for the screenplay is more problematic. A huge coincidence in the final 20 minutes sets off a chain of events that leads to a redemption that is unearned, and a reconciliation that seems implausible. ""Love,"" implores a missive from one character to another, and the moral turn that character takes on that one command is too abrupt and too unequivocal. It also asks for forgiveness of acts already witnessed, and implied, that are far too egregious to be forgotten. A flawed film then, but perhaps all the more interesting for those flaws. Don't make the mistake of seeing it alone like I did - you will definitely want to talk to someone straight after viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

.................................(10/10),"I tried to write the summary of this movie for three days and still i have not found the correct words to connect them in order to make a sentence capable of expressing the quality of it. I have written the summary many times and i have erased in every occasion. So i decided to show some dots in the summary. That is the symbol of how excellent the movie is.The plot :The plot is very much uncommon. it has so many facts that it offers you a guessing 2 hour while you goes through the movie. It provides enough backbone to the rest of the element of the movie. It creates a concrete base upon which the movie stands firmly.The mystery :As the movie deals with a murder it contains enough mystery to shake the audiences. Scene after scene all this unpacked. But they have to wait till the end to solve the puzzles.The resistance :The movie is about the resistance of a mother. It starts with the desperate mission of a mother to bring the killers of her daughter to light. Those billboards, the sudden attacks, burgaining against the local authority.. all these are the part of a resistant mother which is also the part and parcel of the movie.Acting :Acting in my view is up to the mark. Frances Mcdormand is exquisite in her role as a mother seeking justice. Others have also come to the party.Direction :This is the characterstics of the movie i was most impressed with. Although the plot and the acting is out of question but it is the director who has the sole credit to connect all this. He has slowly but cleverly unfolded all the sector available. He is good enough to make the movie what it looks like in the projector. He has turned the raw materials to a mature masterpiece.Questions and answers :last of all the main event is the answers of the question that were aroused during the first session of the movie. You have to wait to find the answers. This waiting makes it more attractive.So clearly it is a movie of great quality..a bit older type..but you know old is gold..",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A great movie, in many ways flawless","Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri (2017)A stunning, moving, funny as heck movie. You almost have to compare it to ""Fargo"" for its depth and wit simultaneously. Both movies dig into a caricatured America, in this case the South (I'm not sure they ever say where, but it feels like Georgia.)The great character here has to be the woman who pays for ads on billboards, and who drives the plot--Frances McDormand--and who also happens to be the amazing lead in ""Fargo."" Yeah. Here she doesn't quite don a full southern accent the way she became rural Minnesota in a lick, but she's a perfect type, and tough. Around her are the nuanced but funny kinds of people you'd expect, especially a cadre of cops that includes Woody Harrelson, always an asset, this time as an honorable chief of police with cancer.The third big name is Sam Rockwell, who is terrific as a troubled cop. His role grows as the movie twists. Any scene with McDormand and Harrelson, or with her and Rockwell, is really amazing. Good acting is good acting.
 The script here is great. I think it is the screenplay of the year and should get the Oscar, never mind the fun originality of ""Get Out"" which lacks the subtle insights and natural language here.There are other levels to love this movie on, from the music (Carter Burwell) to the photography (Ben Davis). Almost no one is a famous contributor beyond the actors, including the director and writer, Martin McDonagh. That's partly what makes it all fresh and honest.

Wow! That was a great film!,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) really is a fantastic film, definitely deserved its Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards. They just got everything right with this one! A film of this type is very difficult to make. The main reason it's so tough, is because yes it's pretty dark due to the subject matter, but it also has some comedy sprinkled in occasionally. You have to make sure that the comedy sprinkled in does not make the subject out to be a joke, or that it doesn't diminish it in any way. Luckily, this one was done in a very smart fashion. When there is comedy, it is very funny, but when it's time to be serious and focus on the darker aspects, no on is laughing. That's how you pull off a film like this successfully. The plot surrounds Mildred, played by Frances McDormand. She rents three billboards just outside of Ebbing, where she lives. Those billboards have messages on them that go after the local police department, she is doing this because her daughter was raped and murdered and she doesn't think the cops are doing anything about it. After she does this, there is a lot of backlash and there are consequences that people suffer. I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that you won't be taking your eyes off the screen. Part of the reason for that is because of the cast this film boasts. McDormand gives a fabulous performance here, I mean I was blown away by her raw talent that was displayed here. So glad she took home the Oscar for this powerhouse performance. Woody Harrelson is good here too, his character isn't quite as big as McDormand and Sam Rockwell's, but he still did a good job. Sam Rockwell is a very talented actor and he proved that talent here with his portrayal of the very complicated, messy character that he plays.

so many issues,"In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents three billboards on an isolated road to berate police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for his failure to find her daughter's killer. Willoughby is actually dying from cancer and the town ostracizes her. Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is a volatile racist deputy living with his overbearing mother.British Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh tackles Americana. He has incorporated plenty of American issues but it's done as an outsider looking in. I wonder if Rockwell starts his performing with an American director, he wouldn't be told to take it a different way. His action in the middle of the movie is absolutely crazy. The aftermath needs more expanding rather than a simple firing. I can't believe that he's not locked up. Then his character takes a 180 turn as the movie climaxes. He leaves the movie a two dimensional billboard rather than a fully formed human character. I am much more impressed with Mildred, Willoughby, and their connection. McDormand delivers a driven character of the first order and Harrelson is more human in his reservation. There is real power behind their performances whereas Rockwell is doing a cartoon. I am surprised at its critical love. Some of this is funny and there are plenty of intriguing characters. The issues are so important that I can't take this as satire.

3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri - Sells Little At All,"Lately, when many people see Awards being dished out to movies they begin to think twice about their worth, in much the same way as when advertisers spend up BIG to tell us their latest product is the BEST on the market - you can often expect a cop-out. With Francis McDormand heading up the cast you might expect the Cohen Bros may have been somewhere in the wings to push it along - in fact, this work offers many of the depressing earmarks of some lesser Cohen productions (maybe that's partly why the Academy selected it?) The overly sensationalistic mix contains all the ingredients that one could cram into a plot filled with a continuous succession of near impossible coincidences (not to mention some perverse PC agenda pushing) With little or no character development and too many stretched situations - we are taken through a series of shocking actions that would land anyone committing just half of them, in jail or would have the local community after the perpetuator's blood! - but no, our 'hero 'Francis violently assaults school kids, dentists, and near anyone she feels like with few saying little more than boo. And for those who attempt to excuse this as ""black humour"" - the 'humour' is just so 'simplistically' dark as to be virtually invisible.The local police (an unconvincing bunch of simplistic stereotypes) bash people near to death in broad daylight, and this is all taken as just another day in a town where every inhabitant tends to be on the edge of a mental meltdown. There's almost no-one the viewer can emotionally identify with or support - unless they too, are on the loopy side of Mental Health Denial. Add to the above, a lazy writer determined to create a swear fest - where all the foulest of outright mean language is paraded - in an attempt to out-shock any that's gone before. This is juvenile trendiness in the extreme.Viewers bright enough to see beyond a manipulative piece of exploitation - may see this rather pretentiously overrated concoction for what it is. While it attracted a lot of people to the ticket box, it's obvious from the Huge amount of viewer feedback - published on IMDb, etc; many of these audiences were bitterly disappointed and would like both their time and money back. And, lets not even get started on the pathetic ending.The end credits thank the local inhabitants for their co-operation but, I somehow doubt many would welcome them back - given the image painted of them!

It doesn't have to be politically correct to be sensible,"There is something about this film that I really love but I can't point out.The acting? Frances McDormand is a wonderful and a compelling actress and man I got won over by Sam Rockwell's convincing acting which got me love-hate him. And poor me, I didn't even know who they were before this one.Perhaps the senseless direction of the plot and the underdeveloped characters? If you really think about it, the story was going nowhere. All you got a bunch of characters who never seem to get what they want. We got characters that fight their own battles. A mother who seeks justice for her child, a cop who still lives with his domineering mother, a chief who is pressured to finish an unresolved case knowing that he is dying, and bunch of other ideas of a character that seem to show up and disappear.Maybe everything about this film fit perfectly for me. The screenplay, the direction and cinematography, the overall production.Should I get mad that the film failed to highlight the struggles of minorities? That there are misogynistic and racist characters? Am I stupid if I say no?Reality is, people are racist, the justice system is flawed, grief makes people do crazy things, hate is everywhere, love always gives and doesn't demand, some families are dysfunctional, forgiveness is not everything, and answers aren't always available no matter how we demand it. This movie is a reflection of these things. People are flawed and we all go through hard times and we fight different battles and despite this, there is a glimmer of goodness within us.Not everything has to be politically correct to be sensible. At the very least, shoving political correctness up on everybody's asses is preposterous at a time like this in my honest opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Disappointing,"After hearing a lot of praise and having been fond of the cast, I thought this would be a slam dunk for me, but I left disappointed. I will keep this review concise and sweet.The acting is above average and the main players especially have solid roles that they make the most of. Unfortunately,one of the main problems to me was the sheer loathsomeness of every character, McDormand's included. I'm all for dark comedies, gritty film making and art that explores the dark side of life, but the interactions that the characters have in this film are downright unpleasant. One scene after another. There is also a heavy racist undertone in the film, as well as stereotypes of southern life, crooked cops and racist hillbillies. The few black characters in the movie are portrayed as straight laced and well adjusted, at times saviors, while the crazy deranged white folks engage in all kinds of derelict behavior. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Do the Right Thing in Ebbing, Missouri","It takes not only a considerable amount of skill to match deep-dark- heartbreaking dramatic storytelling and characters with a pitchüò®black comic edge; to go the extra mile one should hopefully have a voice. Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clich√©s for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on.While it's one of the best films of the year, I'm sure if I try, more or less, I can find some nitpick or even flaws - the daughter Hayes scene could be one simply for the final two lines mother and daughter have, I understand the point but it's too far on the nose, especially for this artist; another could be how quickly ""f***head"" Rockwell comes around to a kind-of-sort-of-maybe redemption in the third act - but all of this is overshadowed by the giant moral and social-political-emotional scope of everything else. Mildred Hayes is one of those movie characters that, male or female (but especially make), stays with you for not so much how balls they are but how marvelled they are by their own ballsiness.McDormand has such a command of the character in the big moments - those trailer bits that, if ones been going to the movies this year, has been overplayed (though luckily practically all of the major story points aren't revealed) - one may miss a moment like when Mildred realizes a character did something horrible that she punished someone else for, or how she looks after a tough a-hole comes into her shop coming face to face with a threatening countenance. She's played so many people who carry an ocean of complexity but whats appealing is how she carries a lot of it without needing to show much. Hell, one beat where she has her two animal slippers on their feet talk in bold violent terms is among the great acting moments of the year.So how relevant is it to now? I mention Do the Right Thing because not so much it having the same dramatic build up so much as it has a similar anger - no sorry not true, boiling, scornful rage - at how segments of our country have been, are and may always be (the mother of Rockwell is one such character who inspires such rage at least for me, and she is just your average white-bread matriarch. Also like Lee's film it shows a community who are inextricably linked, and at times the stark racism is almost like a bad joke (Rockwell's cop being a torturer of black inmates, if not more than one, is almost a goof; he's akin to the John Tururro type in DtRT, a man who just is what he is and it's too late to change now, so everyone looks at Mildred in this story and her whole billboards ""thing"" closer to something like a basic acting-out in grief than a howl for justice. And then when it comes time for a new man to come in to the town's police force, and I won't say how or why, and id rather you just see it than me put in the spoiler marker, it is like a cold bath of irony: the genuinely tough, decent, on top of it older black man.This is as towering a script as we may get in American cinema this year, and if it has imperfections it shouldn't matter much. The central idea here is such: if you don't bring a light on stark injustice, people wont do much if nothing else because it's not on their mind or (frankly) in their own interests. Willoughby says at one point the billboards are a ""chess move."" What is the ""king"" to take then? The ending of the film may seem to leave things too open-ended for some, and I get that. To me, the end is that there's never an ending when it comes to looking at rape (which is assault) and other violence (which is more directly assault) there is no clear ending. You can kill yourself, sure, but that doesn't solve much for those who have to live in total pain. I love this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very intelligent tragicomedy.,"The screenplay of this movie is absolutely stunning. The script handles this mode of tragedy very well but at the same time manages a very intelligent and very well thought comedy. Although some of the characters try to be funny in times of stress and tension, which makes them insignificant in my opinion, the whole cast is amazing, but obviously the most outstanding is Frances McDormand's character. She is an unfiltered psycho who seeks justice for the death of her daughter. She's everything in this film, even her facial expressions are amazing. The film manages a very interesting comedy, for example, Carter Burwell puts a slow music to put you in a sad mood and make you feel for the characters and suddenly... you laugh. It is very unusual but hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
So 'Ebbing' Great!,"Billboards... Ebbing... So many ""B's"" but a B-movie it sure ain't... far from it actually, this is high-level film-making, a movie meaning ""B"" for excellence, B as in Business!And watching some shots of Frances McDormand driving across some random Missouri road and turning her head to her passenger made me feel I was watching an older -and grouchier- version of her most iconic character Marge Gunderson. That both performances earned her Oscars is no coincidence, she was born to be Marge and Mildred, Mildred Hayes to name her. The traits are more severe-looking, age did alter her woman-next-door charm but there's something in the eyes that left room to a certain gentleness, decency and sense of humor, no matter how twisted it is.Sense of humor indeed... in a story involving police brutality, racism, and rape, the evil trinity wrapped up into another of these typical atypical Midwest crisis, something you wouldn't believe it was possible before watching Martin McDonagh's acclaimed ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"", the film that came so close to winning the triple crown of Best Pictures yesterday (but took home the right acting Oscars). Yet as horrific and seemingly cynical (seemingly underlined) it is, the film immediately drained from the wells of the Coen brother's masterpiece's memories. If not as close to perfect as ""Fargo"" is, it's as close to cinematic perfection as many recent movies confronted us to, there's just something immensely satisfying about ""Billboards"".""Fargo"" was crazy, wicked but remember how it ended, Marge was summoning the newly arrested criminal, telling him that there's more to life than money, and he was going to jail on what was a 'beautiful day', the masterpiece of dark humor ended with a light of hope and you could even sense remorse growing in the sociopath's eyes. Just when it became so trendy to have decent characters descending into madness and psychopathy and all the viewers secretly wishing they could loosen up a bit as far as their ethics go, here is a movie where characters start behaving like the bad guys we expect, only to discover that there was something good about them that only waited for the right opportunity to blossom. If that film didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, at least, it shows what ""Crash"" should have been to really deserve it.""Fargo"" and ""Crash"" weren't the only movie ""Billboards"" reminded me of, there was something in McDormand's wounded soul playing like a reminiscence of Kathy Bates' underrated performance as and in ""Dolores Clairborne"", a Stephen King's story that ventured into similar realms of traumas and vengeance by focusing on the tortured mind of an average woman. The parallel that can be drawn between the two performances (besides the fact that Bates should have been nominated) is the defining line of the film ""Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to."" That line encompasses every single action of Mildred Hayes, never as an excuse but an explanation. When a mother has her daughter killed, abused and savagely burnt and the investigation leads to nowhere, she can only resort to the bitchiest side of her soul and yes, some wicked sense of humor... as the billboards would be referred to as a 'joke' by one of the main concerned people, and not in a condescending way.So how about the infamous billboards? These three unused things of the 80's in a road nobody takes, and the opportunity to 'create a buzz', at a time where Internet, twitter, Facebook attracted every attention-whore of the world, here's one hell of a clever use of medium, anachronistic, inventive (screenplay-wise very clever but wouldn't you expect that from the writer director of ""In Bruges"") and the starter of a chain of events that will challenge and tease all your expectations. Because it's not much the set-up that ""Billboards"" establishes which is its main strength but how it plays with it, toying in the process with what we would expect after watching ""Fargo"", ""Crash"" or ""August Osage County"". The film opens with a hardened Midwest divorced mother, a worn-out but benevolent Chief of Police targeted by the billboards played by Woody Harrelson, a redneck deputy played by the great Sam Rockwell, so many characters' tropes in a nutshell that end up being totally deconstructed, for moments of laughs, shock and some heights of emotionality you never expect (not from 'these' characters anyway).And it's all in the deconstruction that ""Billboards"" work, McDonagh has just a way to make the story advances so that once you think you spotted a contrivance or felt something was going in the predictable Aesopian-arc way that the film takes a detour into a twist you didn't see while maintaining its plausibility and revealing a higher esteem on humanity. This is a journey whose starting point is a horrific act of barbarity and ending up with 'bad' people realizing that deep inside there's more room for decency than they would believe... and people who realize that just because they defend a noble cause, aren't immune to punctual bits of vileness. Now, that's challenging. And later, the film takes another path that leaves the perfect cloud of uncertainty, but I'll stop here because this is one experience I don't want to spoil, just enjoy ""Billboards"", it is THAT good.The film is served by great performances, besides Oscar-winning McDormand and Rockwell, there's also Peter Dinklage who has a great shining moment and there's the so underrated Woody Harrelson who always hit the right note between pathos and humor and the neutered tone of the man who starts to take things seriously, just like this movie does but not without a level of edgy self-awareness that makes the whole thing oddly entertaining no matter how dark it is. Really, one of a kind!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.","The writer & director, Martin McDonagh, has managed to capture the subtle dark sense of humour which often seems to accompany death and grieving. He recognises how it is used as a coping mechanism to deal with the loss of a loved one; yet the line between drawing offense or being funny is thin. 
McDonagh mastered this in his first film, In Bruge, which was marketed as comedy, even though it dealt with murder and suicide. A lot of the audience see 3 billboards as a comedy too, but it is not. Truthfully, it is another film which deals with grieving and loss, all five stages of it, with all the myriad expressions of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.
The small town setting in Missouri works really well. It could almost be a small town in Ireland , or anywhere for that matter. Small towns are small pools in which the big fish are always the more louder and brashist characters. Enter Sam Rockwell, who plays the role of a racist policeman who redeems himself in the end. He is the equal to Colin Farrell's characters in 7 Psychopaths (another McDonagh film which they both starred in) and In Bruge. 
Frances McDormand is commanding in nearly every scene playing a local anti-hero who everyone is polite to on account of the recent loss of her daughter, yet behind her back they all judge. 
Woody Harrelson is just getting better and better at playing yet another role in which he almost sucks in both respect and empathy. 
This is such a fine film that I watched it again, the very next day. It is a non-Hollwood production which despite winning Best Picture at the Golden Globes, it seems to be getting it fair share of 'haters' in America. I would guess that this is because of the dissmissive way in which the narratve deals with racism in the Southern States. It seems to say that at the end of the day, people are just people and that a person's colour is irrelevant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the best films of 2017!,"I came into ""Three Billboards"" with zero expectations. I hadn't seen the trailer. I knew nothing about the premise. I was just there to watch the 9 Best Picture Nominees for 2017 and this was one of them.I walked out of this film knowing that it was one of my favorite films of the year and my top film out of the Best Picture Nominees.""Three Billboards"" is about a woman who's daughter was raped and murdered, yet the local police have tossed her case to the side, so in order to get their attention, the woman (played by Frances McDormand) buys advertising on Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (the name of the film) directed with controversy towards the chief of the police station.All of a sudden, the chief starts looking over the case again.If this was any other film, it would've been a predictable Life Time TV movie. It's not though. Unlike other films, there were predictions that I made, subconsciously, and the actual outcomes were completely out of left field. I was constantly shocked at some of the events that actually happened, making this a very entertaining film.All of the lead actors had phenomenal performances, so it was no wonder that Frances McDormand was up for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson were both up for Best Actor.""Three Billboards"" was a special film and if you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely make it a priority!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The frequent shifts of tone from tragedy to comedy are brilliantly scripted.A tough film to watch, but a good one - even a great one.

They must love the succulent stew of characters he cooks up, because he catches the very best.I can't find enough superlatives for Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. They are, here as in everything they've ever been in, great. They are ably supported by Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Clarke Peters, Sandy Martin, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes, Amanda Warren. The only weak link in this superb ensemble is Abbie Cornish, who is warm and smiley but is unfortunately out of her depth: a very odd piece of casting.Cinematography, production design, costume, editing, music - they're all top of the range.

Three Billboards had such an emotional story that was surrounded by a dark sequence that was funny at times, and extremely distressing at others. 
I now finally understand why Frances McDormand is winning all these awards because she was truly staggering playing Mildred.

Decent yet aborted film that is over rated as far as receiving six (6) Oscar nominations,"Mrs. Shullivan and I liked the film but neither of us felt it was a memorable film that was deserving of receiving six (6) Oscar nominations. Three Billboards also won two (2) Oscars for best actress in a leading role (Frances McDormand) and best supporting actor (Sam Rockwell) . Personally I thought Woody Harrelson who also received a nomination for best supporting actor was deserving more of the Oscar than his fellow co-star Sam Rockwell.I do not want to second guess the Oscar voters but Frances McDormand in my opinion was just playing herself in this film. If you don't believe me watch the film and then google her Oscar acceptance speech and then tell me if you do not agree that Frances McDormand's acceptance speech is exactly the feisty character portrayal of Mildred in Three Billboards. I felt Sally Hawkins performance as the mute cleaning lady on The Shape of Water was far more difficult to portray on screen than Mildred in Three Billboards.Three Billboards supporting cast also included some great talents wasted in peripheral meaningless roles such as actors Darrell Britt-Gibson, Lucas Hedges, Amanda Warren, Zeljko Ivanek and especially John Hawkes. The story line of a distraught mother who wants her daughter's rapist/murderer brought to justice and how she goes about pressuring the town Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to not only do his job, but his deputies as well.Lastly, I felt the ending was aborted purposely to allow for a sequel and another revenue producer at a later date to cash in on the six (6) Oscar nominations.

"A dark, funny and serious crime drama.","There is a lot of movies that has some okay moments, but great highlights near the end. Examples of those movies is Bad Times At The El Royale, Ready Or Not, and Sorry To Bother You. I love these movies because of the highlights. Well, I like everything in most of the movies, but some scenes makes the movies better. There is also a lot of films that can have a serious theme, and mix it with dark humour. Examples of those movies, is BlacKkKlansman, Hunt For The Wilderpeople, and Jojo Rabbit. Well, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri can write its name on both of the lists, 'cause this movie is amazing.It manages to have a dark and serious theme, and mix it well together with extremely dark humour, so it don't get too dark and gloomy. Almost everything in this movie is perfect, and some of the actor performances made me want to cry. That's how good this movie is.Everything in the movie builds on the highlight in the end, which is one of the reasons I saw this movie. There is a plot twist about 40 minutes in the movie which you probably don't expect the first time you watches it, if you haven't read about the movie. It keeps you guessing on which turns this movie will take. Everything becomes much, much darker and sadder and more serious than the first part. The bad thing in this movie, is that right after some of the sad scenes is done, the movie chooses to build on another scene with more dark humour, which totally kills the mode everyone is in. That's the only bad thing in this movie. Rest of the movie, is fantastic.The cast in this movie, is also fantastic. You've got an amazing Frances McDormand in the kead role, accompanied by famous actors like Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges, Kathryn Newton, Samara Weaving, and John Hawkes. But perhaps my favorite in the movies is Sam Rockwell as a drunk policeman who's struggling with doing the right stuff. The highlight in the movie, is when he, at the end, tries to impress his boss with solving a long-lasting major case. Just watch the movie if you haven't already.Everything in this movie is a total blast, from start to finish.

It will make you explore deepest thoughts,"There are always new ways of exploring crime stories and Three billboards goes in such directions that you could probably never imagine. Story of Three billboards explores human nature as it finds itself trapped in mystery and missing answers, which will show us how far individuals are capable of going to get peace and satisfaction over pain and grief. If you stop asking yourself and keep pushing toward better and healthier state of mind without any satisfaction you will face how you go mad and so Martin McDonagh creates story in such fashion that main character is strongest person and is capable of provoking and harming everybody that doesn't want to help her (Mildred). Mildred (Frances McDormand) is the mother that seeks answers and keeps pushing everybody around her as far it is possible and with doing so (Frances) gives a powerful performance of strong women that will melt and destroy them all if they try to defy her. Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) are two officers that are being influenced most by actions of Mildred and it was pretty horrifying to see how they will cope with such pressure. Sam Rockwell is giving us one of the most honest performances as he turns completely from inside out. Martin McDonagh is an absolute master in creating difficult situations that can also be explored in his previous movies such as 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' and continues to write and whole story that will suck you in as easy as you drink your drink at movie theatre while looking Three Billboards and wonder how actually good is he as movie maker. If you love crime drama genre you will absolutely fall in love with this one and it is easily one of the best movie this year because it will make you think about everything that has happened and try to evaluate how is it to deal with all of it which also gives a huge philosophical characteristics. 4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly good!,"This film was a cinema treat for my mum as she fancied seeing it on her birthday. I had no clue going in what it was about. And if I had to describe it afterwards to someone, I'm sure it wouldn't sound like a particularly amazing film. The story wasn't terribly exciting but the characters made the story so moving and gripping. The acting by everyone in it was superb. Not a big fan of all the bad language but it did make the film feel more grittily real. I usually prefer more fantastical films which give some escapism but I surprised myself and the film itself surprised me. Sam Rockwell (whom I have liked since The Green Mile) was such a dislikeable character but the way he developed through the film was really well done. The film plays well on your emotions and somehow manages to bring little bits of humour out of a tragic situation and some appalling decisions. I still smile thinking about my favourite bit when Sam Rockwell's character shies away a little bit from his lighter (because of what has happened to him - I won't spoil it by saying what). It doesn't sound funny here but he makes even a small thing like this funny. The film makes you think about how inherently decent people can make bad or good choices and what the unexpected consequences can be. I wasn't too sure about the ending but I suppose it left the viewer to decide for themselves what happened next. I would say this film definitely deserves some oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not bad but lacks focus,"In an effort to track down who raped and murdered her daughter, Mildred Hayes has three billboards erected outside her town of Ebbing, Missouri. They accuse the Sheriff of doing nothing to catch the killer. This causes a largely adverse reaction amongst the town's folk , not least one of the sheriff's deputies, the hot-headed, irascible Jason Dixon.Heaps of potential, much of which is wasted. The movie is intriguing and entertaining from the outset - the murder mystery, the town dynamic, the interesting array of characters, all presented with dark tongue-in-cheek humour. Just from the trailer this reminded me of a Coen Brothers movie (not just because it stars Frances McDormand and feels Fargo-esque, or because McDormand is married to Joel Coen) and the initial part of the movies goes some way to reinforce this.However, writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) never quite matches the effortless slickness, tightness, engagement, focus and story-telling ability of the Coens. Most tellingly, the plot seems to stumble along, with no clear direction. Yes, there is the murder mystery, which is intriguing to the very end, but the sub-plots around it seem disjointed. Moreover, there is little in the way of clear themes. Even at the end, the messaging is confused and seems to be more a case of McDonagh having a bet each way, rather than making a solid point.A little bit of focus would have gone a long way.Can't fault the cast though.

A grieving mother seeking justice and answers, and the Chief of Police who feels he's done his job to the best of his ability. McDormand's blunt, rude, vulgar, and uncensored character is extremely charismatic. The other characters (one in particular after some major character development) are very charismatic as well. This film takes the audience on a very dark journey where nothing ""expected"" or ""predictable"" really happens.

"Angry and profane characters, could have been much better.","This movie received lots of Oscar buzz and the actors really are great. My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library.There are a number of writer/directors who relish in angry, profane characters with few redeeming values. This is one of those movies. 
Frances McDormand is Mildred, divorced and angry, mostly because her daughter was raped and killed 7 months earlier and she doesn't think the local police are working hard enough on the case.On the small road to her rural home she notes three old, dilapidated billboards and decides to use them to poke fun at the local police chief, hoping to shame him into working harder on her daughter's case.Sam Rockwell is one of the mostly inept local cops, Dixon. He is a drunk and a hot head. The captain is played by Woody Harrelson as Willoughby. He has a not-so-secret secret, that he is dying from cancer.Ultimately the movie turns into a revenge story, and it doesn't even matter if the revenge is towards the guilty ones.

The police department, especially thuggish cop Sam Rockwell, are very unhappy about this turn of events. The town is divided. Harrelson is a popular man, but the department has a history of mistreating the town's less fortunate citizens (particularly the African American population), so many folks like seeing them called to task. This sets up what seems to be a very straightforward ""little guy vs authority"" story, but McDonagh has a more morally complex story in mind. Harrelson is a dying man, suffering from terminal cancer, and his explanation of why the case has gone nowhere seems quite reasonable. McDormand is suffering from understandable grief, but you learn that some of the grief might stem from a feeling of personal responsibility for the tragedy. Good characters do some really bad things. Bad characters commit horrifically violent actions, but then suffer from violence due to heroically self-sacrificing acts.

I expected it to be a lot more thrilling, it certainly moves a lot slower than Martin McDonagh's previous films, but it did not bother me one bit, the pace actually adds to the suspense and the mundanity of these people's lives.I did feel Peter Dinklage was a little wasted, I loved every scene he had and thought his characterisation was terrific, but he simply was not used enough. His character had so much more potential than what he is given.The cast is absolutely flawless, every single role, big and small, fits in to this world magnificently. Frances McDormand is completely immersed and utterly believable from beginning to end as a conflicted mother looking to avenge her daughter, and Woody Harrelson is the heart and soul of the film, delivering a character who begins simple, but winds up having a powerful arc. The highlight of the film, for me, was without any doubt Sam Rockwell as Dixon. Normally playing very likeable characters, he starts off completely unredeemable and soon later, McDonagh and Rockwell manage to make us sympathise with this character despite giving us no real reason to, great scriptwriting and acting simply comes together beautifully here.Impactful and original. Some of the best acting and writing I have seen in a while, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri does not disappoint and I would recommend it to all moviegoers.A woman rents out three billboards in her town as a message to the police officers that still have not found her daughter's killer.Best Performance: Sam Rockwell",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Dark, funny, poignant and provocative","This movie deserves every Oscar nomination and award it got, It's a bold statement about America right now. It's filled with Drama delivered through comedy without falling into parody, it will make you laugh and tear your heart down all thanks to its complex characters and poignant themes such as police brutality, Rape and racism, So it's OK if you find yourself riding a roller coaster of feelings while watching. Those billboards are nothing but a symbol of a belief or a stand that everyone else is against and the movie teaches us to stand for those beliefs and fight for them no matter what's the outcome. It's also a representation of our time as you can see those billboards as tweets too, tweets that made the whole community talking about the case and at the same time taking action. A typical image of social media's era with #metoo hashtags and many more... To conclude, this movie isn't about Mildred finding her daughter's rapist but about her standing up in the face of injustice and standing up for herself but the one thing I would reproach to this beautiful story is the ending that felt cut in the middle and ambiguous yet it doesn't change the fact that it's one of this year's best movies and one of my all-time favorites",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fargo meets In Bruges,"Two of the finest dark comedies released in the past 20 years have included ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"" both of these films were written and directed by Martin Mcdonagh. 5 years after his release of ""Seven Psychopaths"" Martin Mcdonagh has released ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" another perfect black comedy filled with a a lovable but flawed cast of characters.""In Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" Frances McDormand plays a mother named Mildred who desperately wants justice for her daughter who was raped and murdered. She decides to take action into her own hands by putting up three very abrasive Billboards that criticize the cops who failed to solve this case. In doing this Mildred angers many cops and citizens including Sam Rockwell's Dixon and Woody Harrellson's Willoughby in the small town of Ebbing Missouri leading to torment that can be humorous at times while also being darkly disturbing.Three Billboards succeeds at everything it sets off to do. The one thing it succeeds at the most, however, is the introduction of the huge ensemble cast in a fluid and natural way. Each one of the characters has been fully developed in a satisfying way leading to redemption in some cases and tragedy in others. The main reason this development works so well is the performances. Frances McDormand is fantastic as Mildred and makes you feel the desperation, and regret every time she is on screen. Sam Rockwell is FANTASTIC as the dim-witted corrupt cop Dixon. Rockwell's performance offers a huge amount of comedy while also offering some the most disturbing moments in the film. Woody Harrellson Peter Dinklage and Lucas Hedges all also do a fantastic job in the film.The Cinematography was stellar, it fills the small town of Ebbing Missouri with life and beauty. There is one stellar one shot in the film that never shies away from the horrific event that is occurring on screen.All in All ""Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" is a funny dark ride that pays off in every way because of the great acting by every member of the ensemble cast and the direction by Martin Mcdonagh",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An Excellent Piece About Loss and Revenge,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is quite simply one of, if not the best film of 2017. It rivals Blade Runner 2049 in sheer greatness. There were so many moments in Three Billboards that genuinely surprised me. It was truly refreshing seeing a movie as unpredictable as Three Billboards. Perhaps the best part of the film, however, are the characters. The performances from pretty much all of the actors in this movie are fantastic. Frances McDormand gives an absolutely spectacular performance in this film (Probably the best performance of her career). And Of course, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, and Caleb Landry Jones were fantastic in this movie as well. However, there is one actor in this film who did pretty poorly in my opinion, which was Lucas Hedges. His performance was pretty bad in this film, but luckily he really wasn't an important character, so his performance didn't hinder my overall thoughts of the film. But it's not just the performances that really make these characters great; the way these characters are written is absolutely genius! I genuinely cared about every character in this film. There were some characters that I never expected to care about and sympathize with by the end of it. Each character has a brilliantly written arc that blends perfectly with the pace of the film. Three Billboards is a film worthy of the Oscar it is nominated for. I highly encourage you to go see this movie as soon as you can, before it stops showing in theaters. It is truly a film worth seeing on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

McDormand does her usual teeth-grinding, eye-rolling bits & Woody Harrelson, well, his part is mercifully short.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a prime example of a character study and why crime is rarely black and white","In most crime cases, there are not just two, but many sides to the story. Let's say a thief was caught steeling someone's wallet. The victim and the police would agree that what he did was wrong and was damaging to the owner. The thief, in return, may say that he's dirt broke with a starving child and only needed a few extra dollars for some food. Are any of these people in the wrong? Yes and no. It all depends on the people and what it is their doing. A stolen wallet case is a simple wrongdoing, but what about an emotional scaring murder?In the case of a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, we get the case of a death of a teenager, and yet the scene was so clean that the authorities are hard pressed to even go after any suspects. So her mother decides to take action. Now what she does paints one picture about how the response has been. yet we do get another side about the complications about following the rules and not wanting to make false assumptions. So let's see how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri looks at it's though situation.Single mother Mildred (played by Francis McDormand) is grieving over the loss of her teenage daughter Angela who was killed, raped, and burned. The local authorities have been investigating to find the culprits, but have yet to find any good leads. Having run out of patience, Mildred rents three billboards on a rural road with each one saying ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"". This draws immediate attention from the locals whose reaction is quite negative. Mildred's son Robbie (played by Lucas Hedges) doesn't like the attention, her ex husband Charlie (played by John Hawkes) is furious, and the majority of the town sides with the chief.Chief Willoughby (played by Woody Harrelson) is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration and even talks with her about his complications and how he's suffering from pancreatic cancer (the reason the town is siding with him). She nevertheless keeps the billboards going, which only make town folk even angrier. She and her son are harassed and she even attacks her dentist when things get violent. It doesn't help that fellow officer Dixon (played by Sam Rockwell) is high tempered, not that bright, and takes the billboards as a personal insult.I find it amazing that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was not based on any incident and is an original story. It feels like something that could have happened, because of the characters involved. It would have been easy to make this story a corrupt police and show Mildred as a hero, but like that TV show Game of Thrones, almost everyone here is within a gray area. Including Mildred and Chief Willoughby, they have their strength, but heavy flaws that don't just affect the case, but their own lives. This is another example of a character study.Because this is a movie that relies on it's characters, the actors are phenomenal. Francis McDormand plays a woman who had already had life beaten her down, but with that extra death on her conscience, makes her a storm cloud of angst. She carries a lot of stress, but also seems to believe she has nothing more to lose. Sam Rockwell plays a different kind of...stupid that you don't see too often. He's in his own lazy bubble with the concept that as long as things stay status quo, then he'll be fine. As the movie goes further, you see everything he understands falls apart and what that does to his personality.I'll give this ten red billboards out of ten. Sorry that the review is short, but there's a lot in this movie I cannot give away. It's an engaging story that's not even much of a mystery. It's a character-driven drama at heart and knows how their actions will dictate the plot. Go see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and understand why even with all sides of the story on the table, it's hard to tell whose right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Better than expected,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a different take on a crime/drama film filled with bits of dark comedy. What stood out for me in this film mostly was the acting, it was phenomenal. Frances McDormand plays this strong independent woman who fights for what she believes in. She does a great job of coming out as a cold person with no fear. Sam Rockwell stole the show for me, he brought most of the humor in my opinion. Overall the film had a thorough and entertaining plot which had you captivated, especially once the movie picks up pace.

"Booooooo, men!!!","This movie epitomizes the depths to which Hollywood will sink in an attempt to redeem its misogynistic reputation for by producing formulaic, feminist schlock in the hopes the gullible public will eat it up.

And the only redeeming men are the ones who display no signs of ""toxic masculinity"" (i.e. the effeminate poster salesman). Meanwhile, the anti-hero is a foul-mouthed old hag deliberately cast by a recognizably aging actress so no one can claim the ""hot chick won the Oscar"" this year. And of course, there's the obligatory (and completely gratuitous) scene where the main character bad mouths the Catholic church, because of course everyone in Mississippi is Catholic (no, really...just suspend your disbelief here one more time) and they film needs to take a swipe at every form of patriarchy known to mankind. Add to this the very predictable ""all southerners are ignorant, racist red-necks"" and boy howdy, you got yerself a real Hollywood piece of Oscar-bait (or crap...depending on how many brain-cells/capacity to reason you have left).",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The greatest writing delivered in earth shattering performances. exquisite.,"You couldn't get more mid-American than Missouri. You'd be forgiven for not knowing that the state capital is Jefferson City. It's an unremarkable state and Ebbing is an unremarkable town (made up it would seem); it's not trailer trash, it's not deep south. It's just a nondescript, middle-class, American provincial town frequented by the usual mish-mash of not quite Hillbillys, not quite racists. They'd have voted for Trump in big numbers; if the place existed.It's here that Frances McDormand (just like in the unremarkable town of Fargo) stakes her claim for a place at the top table in the pantheon of greatest living actresses.It's here that Martin McDonagh cements his position as the greatest living comedy writer. (As if In Bruges wasn't enough, he's got his theatre canon of work to bolster those credentials - The Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Lieutenant of Inishmore are both comedic masterpieces.)And it's here that both Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson put in career defining (and probable Oscar winning) performances.To say that Frances McDormand has everything you need to be the complete actress is an understatement; she's hilarious, brutal, droll, moving, sympathetic, antagonistic, bombastic, arrogant, crazy, vulnerable, arch, facetious and deadpan. And that's only in the first 20 minutes. This will unquestionably win her, her second Oscar.And Martin McDonagh will pick up his second for best original screenplay (14 years after winning best short in 2004) and maybe even his third for best director. He already has no fewer than four (yes 4) nominations at the BAFTA's and I expect him to win at least half of them - because this is writing and direction of the very highest order.He's moved on since In Bruges. Sure the C bomb is dropped very early in the first dialogue scene and turns up several times more. But this is not the full pelt filth that Colin Farrell deployed to intense pleasure in the former.This is a subtler, equally dark but even more brutal exposition. Each word seems to have been crafted on a lathe. I gasped several times at the sheer dexterity of his writing delivered by masters of their craft.There's a dwarf, yes.There's an idiot, yes.But I ain't telling you no more than that. I saw it without spoilers so you deserve the same respect.It has a breathtakingly bold finish, I'll tell you that; spoiling nothing.This is cinema at its absolute finest. The best film I have seen this year by far (and I thought Dunkirk was truly outstanding).Go Martin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very Satisfied (9.5/10),"I went to the movies expecting to see a good film from the director of ""In Bruges"" and ""7 Psychopaths"" , but it surprised me and went far beyond my expectations.
I mean clearly Three Billboards is 2017's surprise. It's got some of the year's best performances, from Sam Rockwell's foolish, racist, corrupt and resentful Officer Dixon to Woody Harrelson, who's proving that 2017 was his year after good performances in both ""War for the planet of the apes"" and ""The edge of seventeen"" then ends the year with this sensational performance of a beloved parent and respected chief of police confronted by an angry, grieving mother played by the incredible Frances McDormand, seriously words can't describe this woman and her performace. Besides, the supporting cast, including Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and Peter Dincklage, was stunning although it had little sceen time.
And what can I say about writer and director Martin McDonagh's work other than complete. The screenwriting was flawless and the events were unpredictable in a way you would jump of your seat. And eventhough the film was about grief, anger and vengeance, the script has got plenty of funny moments which were all effective.

The Best Movie Of 2017!!,"I have now watched this film twice and I can honestly say that it is perfect in everyway. Im going to try and explain why this movie is great but my explaining could not really do justice to this film. This film has all the key things a film has to have to be great like a strong engageing plot, strong characters, great camera work, great sound track all of it.I will try and not spoil the plot but it starts with a mothers attempt to stir the police of her town into finding her daughter's killer. From there the film leads a dark path of vengence that is very humorous at times as well as heart breaking. The scrip was written by Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed two of my favourite films. This is his third film and honestly it is his best work. He brings his a game in the direction, story writing and camera direction. Honestly the man, in my opinion, is the best director working at the moment.Not only is the director brilliant with loads of development and twists but the cast is stella and Frances McDormand is THE BEST part of this film. Her portrayal of Mildred is awesome and made me feel for her character and what she goes through. I can say the same for Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell actually has the most character development. He changes from an a**hole into probably the best character. The way he portrays this change in the character is inspired and has cemented him, in my mind, as a fantastic actor.The way Harrelson plays the cheif of police and the masterful way he develops this character and breaths life into the part McDonagh has written is beyond brilliant. Then you have a great supporting cast that adds background colour. I even loved the guy who put up the billboards AND HE WAS IN TWO SCENES!!!!
 
The Two main strenghts of this film are the plot and performances which i can't say enough good things about. However the technical side is masterful with great cinematography, beautiful sweeping shots shots and the scene with Rockwell in the advertisers office is a masterclass in camera work for anyone. It actually looks like it was done in one take however im not sure if it was or not. Again great work and very enjoyable to watch.The use of popular music is very characteristic of McDonagh and is used to great effect in especially the advertiser scene with Rockwell. I loved that iit captured the mood of the characters an their actions so well. Honestly Im running out of different ways to praise this movie.You know that annoying friend who is like ""Dude you NEED to watch this film"". Honestly if he is talking about this one PLEASE for the love of god listen to him it is that good. Hence why it is a 10\10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unusual but AWESOME,"We saw a lot of great movies in 2017 and I can confidently say that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of them. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the movie is a winner in every category . It's original, it has great performances and a plot full of brutal, funny and sad moments. It's balance of humor, violence and drama is remarkable and not easy at all to find in today's movies. The real asset of this movie though is Frances McDormand. She plays a non likable and very complex character and delivers one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. She manages to make you like and fully understand a violent character, basically the 'villain' of the movie something that I have experienced very few times and that's one of the reasons I gave the movie 10 stars. The truth is ,not everyone can appreciate and understand the bizarre style of the movie and I am very disappointed to see that this movie is hated by a lot of people. Love it or hate it there is no denying that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a unique movie and definitely something that you don't see everyday. I believe though that even more people are going to love it and that's the reason I decided to write this review.

What a terrific performance from Frances McDormand,"Phenomenal film. Loved every second.I've been aware of this film, in name only (didn't know any of the plot etc.), since it came out and have always had a great feeling about it - I just had an inkling it would be great. It isn't, it's much more than that... it's incredible.The mix between the humour and seriousness is superb, I found myself laughing aloud one moment and then feeling saddened minutes later; that was the case a ridiculous amount of times throughout the 115 minutes.The premise is pretty mad and filled with coincidences, but I absolutely adore the way it is written and put together onscreen. The cinematography is also beautiful, as is the score. The pacing is fantastic too.

Hate is the answer... or not?,"Martin MacDounagh has written one of the best screenplays of the decade. ""Three billboards out of Ebbing"" manages to delve into human psychology better than almost every film that I have seen up to date. The events are being portrayed both with tragic and comical scenes giving a grey aspect in the film's aesthetic. Same goes with the characters. No one in this movie is either bad or good person. They are just persons. With both their good and their bad side. The film doesn't choose sides. Frances McDormand is excellent as the mourning mother of her horrible killed daughter. Woody Harrelson is amazing as the dying from cancer police chief of Ebbing who tries his best to do his duty in a world that doesn't appreciate it. But the revelation of this film is Sam Rockwell. This actor delivers his best performance until now and maybe for his whole career. All the actors (leading or secondary) are acting their roles perfectly delivering us the message of this masterpiece of a film; no person is only good or only bad. The film doesn't justify any person's actions and doesn't choose to support anyone. It just presents us the events as they are; a mingle of tragedy and comedy just like life. People can easily do bad as easily as they can do good. And they can be really good if they try.

Vintage Martin McDonagh... A Masterpiece.,"Every now and then a film comes out that lives up to all its pre-release hype and reputation and then some. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is absolutely one of those films. From the opening credits to the end I was continually impressed and taken aback by this movie at virtually all levels - From the outstanding performances to the raw and darkly funny screenplay to the wonderful score by Carter Burwell - Who incidentally composed one of my favorite western themes for the Coen Brother's ""True Grit"". Already being a fan of Martin McDonagh, it wasn't difficult for me to believe the people raving about this movie on the festival circuit. He is easily one of the best auteurs working today which might be helped by him being a successful former playwright. McDonagh writes and directs this film and injects it with his signature cynicism and black comedy. It just so happens that he also assembled the perfect cast led by essentially the Queen of black comedy Frances McDormand to knock it out of the park. Even though McDonagh's feature debut 'In Bruges' is perfect in my opinion, I also think 'Three Billboards' might just be his best work to date.The plot revolves around a mother named Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) who challenges the local police department specifically the chief of police Willoughby (Woody Harrellson) after her daughter's brutal rape and murder goes unsolved for eight months, by putting up three provocative billboards outside town. This surely captures the attention of the police including one of Willoughby's officers, the racist and all round loathsome Dickson (Sam Rockwell). What follows is plenty of twists of turns that come completely unexpectedly that I will no spoil here of course. One of the biggest achievements of McDonagh's screenplay is the complex nature of all characters in the movie. Everyone is three-dimensional here, they all have flaws and they all have moments where you root for them- Very impressive when one of the characters namely Dickson is accused of torturing 'black folk' in the past. But even the protagonist Mildred does some very questionable things throughout the story.As I mentioned I absolutely love the score by Burwell which evokes Ennio Morricone's themes of the classic spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. It helps set the tone from the opening shots of the three billboards and the long winding decommissioned road that runs alongside them. The editing by Jon Gregory is also very effective in creating suspense in certain scenes and nailing comedic timing in others.One of the strongest elements of 'Three Billboards', of which there are many, is definitely the performances by the stellar cast. It is a true ensemble and probably the best one of 2017. Frances McDormand is ferocious and commanding as Mildred Hayes and she portrays her sorrow, guilt and search for justice very believably. Sam Rockwell although billed as a supporting character is pretty much a co-lead as he gets the most screen time second only to McDormand. This is probably his best role to date and it allows him to show his range as a character who in other movies would have just been reduced to a stereotype but emerges full bodied in this one. Woody Harrelson as family man and local police chief Willoughby also has a great showing and is in some of the funniest and most tragic scenes in the film - The several scenes in which his voice-over reads out a letter to certain characters spring to mind. The cast is rounded out with notable turns by a remarkable supporting cast including Caleb Landry Jones, Lucas Hedges, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes and Samara Weaving.Ultimately, Martin McDonagh has created something truly special with 'Three Billboards' which is in tragic and heartbreaking in equal measure and is hands down the best film of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Oscar-worthy performances, uneven movie","I'll say this: I very much enjoyed seeing """"Three Billboards"" and would recommend it to anyone that asks, but it's because of the talent involved onscreen. Everyone in the main cast is incredible and these players help keep the movie going when the story falters. McDormand, for her part, is a force of nature, and years' worth of this character's pain and unflagging determination reside on the actor's face; the smolder in her gaze does plenty of talking. It's why the first half of the movie is exhilarating.Tonally, it's a bit off, with that excitement waning at around the halfway point (almost precisely with the death of a major character) as sorrow and brutality take over. Sadly, we never get that opening power back, and this feeds into a complicated ending. But one thing I really liked about this movie is that it does become about more than McDormand's grieving and turns into a small-town drama; and empathy comes from the most unexpected of characters. Despite any of these issues, it's highly worthwhile and I doubt I'll forget about this anytime soon.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A condescending, disjointed embarrassment to middle America...","If it wasn't for the big names to carry this movie it wouldn't deserve a third of the critical praise it has received. I can't even fully describe to you, dear movie goer, where this movie is flawed. First of all, these characters in real life wouldn't talk like this. The vast majority of middle America doesn't curse this much in regular every day life. There isn't a lot of ppl that live in small town USA that walk around dropping a GD and an F in casual conversation at the dinner table talking to a priest, at the dentist office, sitting on a swing talking to a cop dying of cancer. That was the first major problem I have with the story. Like seriously WTF? The characters have no authenticity to them. And in a movie where character development is key, I found myself struggling for resolve. I mean the woman's daughter was raped and murdered for goodness sake. So that's major issue if you can't find something else in this woman's life to identify with. Furthermore, I can't help but wonder if making this a fictitious town was intentional or if the director actually wanted to use the town that they filmed in but city officials vetoed that once they heard the dialogue. Honestly you're better off watching an episode of Dateline and then following that with the Departed. Those 2 things make more sense than this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A triumph,"Great story, stunning performances from the entire cast, perfect blend of comedy and drama, good ending, real characters saying real things and dealing with real emotions of loss, anger, hate, vengeance, love, change and redemption.

A very funny movie with a serious story,"While not really billed as a comedy this movie had me laughing on so many occasions it was hard to realise that it is about such a sad situation.Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are outstanding and Frances really did deserve the Best Actress Oscar.Being a big fan of all three top billed actors made this a very easy choice for a movie to watch and repeated viewings are almost essential.While the story and some situations are heart rending, very sad and in some cases brutal, the subtle comedy still shines though.This would have to be, for me the best movie of 2017 and I will be watching it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Anger Begets Greater Anger""","What is it? A black-comedy drama. But my fear would be that with such an 'art-house' title, it's going to put a lot of people off. But it really really shouldn't. FOR THIS IS A GEM OF A MOVIE... and so, so entertaining that two hours just sped by.Frances McDormand (""Hail Caesar"", ""Fargo"") plays a mother - Mildred Hayes - in pain. Her daughter Angela (Kathryn Newton) has been raped, set alight and murdered (so clearly LOL territory!) After ten months and no culprit arrested, she takes things into her own hands by renting the three billboards in question and posting a message to the local police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"").But the popular Chief Willoughby has his own problems, setting many in the town on a collision course with the feisty Mildred as tempers flare. Stoking the flames is the racist, unstable and unpredictable Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell, ""Moon""). The billboard advertiser Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones, ""Get Out"") is uncomfortably caught in the middle of the battle.In terms of the story, nothing in this film goes in the direction you expect. Willoughby's reaction to the crisis is extraordinary... in a good way. Dixon's reaction is also extraordinary for different reasons! Red herrings are scattered throughout the script to further set you off balance.The film reminded me greatly of ""Manchester By The Sea"", and not just because Lucas Hedges (as Mildred's grieving and uncomfortable son) is again playing a very similar role. There is gut-wrenching drama, but diffused in the blink-of-an-eye by laugh-out-loud dialogue. Whereas ""Manchester"" could perhaps be described as a drama with black comedy, ""Three Billboards"" is probably better described as a black comedy with drama. But the comedy is dark, oh, so very dark! Some of the lines are so outrageous (both in terms of language used - very extreme - and the racial/homophobic nature of it) that you are sometimes uncertain whether you should be laughing at all. But it's been brilliantly balanced and orchestrated.As I commented in ""Battle of the Sexes"" the Screen Actors Guild Award for ""Best Ensemble Cast"" is one of my favourite categories of award, and I thought that film should have been nominated (it wasn't)! But the ensemble cast in ""Three Billboards"" is another great example, and this one IS nominated! (Hoorah!) For this whole town just LIVES AND BREATHES, thanks to the combined efforts of the cast: as well as the lead names, the cast includes Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones"") as a diminutive used car salesman; Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby; Zeljko Ivanek as the police desk sergeant; Amanda Warren (""mother!"") as Mildred's put-upon co-worker and (particularly) Sandy Martin as Dixon's wizened and cranky old mother. All are fed with great lines and scenes to bring the story alive.At the helm is writer/director (and London-born!) Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"", ""Seven Psychopaths"") and he delivers genius. I recently cruelly made fun of the writers of the awful ""Pitch Perfect 3"" for not coming up with any sort of viable plot. Here I am at the other extreme, in awe of how someone can sit down with a blank piece of paper and come out with this story, these characters and this dialogue. It would be foolish so early in the season to predict the Oscars, but here must be a great candidate for Original Screenplay.Elsewhere I would see Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson both as Oscar nominees for Best Actress/Actor and Sam Rockwell is surely a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this.... I wonder what odds I can get for a win? Jason Dixon (is this perhaps a pun because he always keeps crossing ""the line""?!) will I think be one of the most memorable characters for me in the cinema this year: a character you can despise, pity and even strangely admire at stages throughout the two hours. Something that Rockwell balances with consummate skill.In terms of my one criticism, the script (in my opinion) rather over-eggs the pudding in the last ten minutes, stepping over into actions I didn't find realistic. It was a nice ending when it came, but not one I felt invested in. So I'm going to put my (rarely used) '10*' back in my pocket, and instead rate this one just a tad lower. But regardless of that, ignore the title and GO AND SEE THIS ONE!(Just a final note for those severely affected by the subject matter: while there is some significant violence in the film, the rape is not shown - i.e. there are no ""flashback"" scenes, apart from some - very brief - corpse photos in a folder Willoughby looks through).(For the full graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

Character driven filmmaking at its finest.,"I have watched and enjoyed films my whole life. The beautifully nuanced script allows the characters to drive the film. The perfect cast bring the characters to real compelling life.

This focus on character interaction reminds me of some of the very best Japanese films, and the best films from the former Soviet bloc. (Check out Japanese film: It's Only Talk directed by Ryuichi Hiroki, or Romanian film: The Death of Mr. Lazarescu directed by Cristi Puiu. Totally different in content and mood, but the characters and storytelling are at the same astounding level.)

The whole cast seems to be inspired perform at their peak. No wasted gestures, nuances, shrugs, expressions, reactions, movement, stances...

The scene with the deer. Frances and her writer/director Martin Martin McDonagh deserve Oscars and beyond for these brief moments of unbelievably perfect art.

great,"To say why it is real great can be a mistake. Because, from story to the performances, all is admirable. But, more important, it is a film just about yourself.

A True Dark Comedy,"From Martin McDonagh, director of In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, comes Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. If you liked his other films, you'll love Three Billboards. Once again, a large cast of characters who are just just far enough out there to be funny, but grounded enough to be realistic find what should be an ordinary situation rapidly escalating out of control.Frances McDormand stars as Mildred Hays, a grieving mother who decides the best way to encourage the police to solve her daughter's brutal murder is to put up three billboards outside town calling out the chief of police. That is enough to lite a fire under the town, quite literally, as the dying Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his intellectually-challenged mamma's boy officer (Sam Rockwell), the town midget (Peter Dinklage), the man who owns the billboards (Caleb Landry Jones), and Mildred ex-husband (John Hawkes) all end up on a crash course towards each other. As they say ""Anger just begets greater anger"" and there is a lot of anger in Ebbing, Missouri.Amazingly, a movie that is essentially nonstop chaos and overreactions manages to actually develop its characters and have them grow.

Wasn't quite convinced,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri stars Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges and Peter Dinklage, and is directed by Martin McDonagh, who brought us the sensational In Bruges, and Seven Psychopaths.It tells the story of Mildred Hayes, played by McDormand, who some time ago, her teenage daughter was to quote the film, ""raped while dying"", in small town Ebbing in the mid-west of the USA. The local police and authorities, Chief Willoughby and Dixon, played by Harrelson and Rockwell, at least in Mildred's eyes, aren't pulling their weight in avenging and bringing to justice her daughter's perpetrator. So she takes the liberty of erecting three billboards outside the town, bought and paid for through Red, played by Landry Jones, to raise awareness of her daughter's death. However these billboards stir up some controversy within the town.Now I'm just gonna come clean here and say that I wasn't a huge fan of this film, but I'll address the positives first. Absolutely top notch acting, Frances McDormand brings serious bite and something really scathing, and I definitely think it's one of the best performances of the year, possibly the best of her career. Woody Harrelson, to an extent, brings real humanity to the role, not to get into spoilers, but there's a scene where he approaches Mildred about the billboards for the first time, and there's a big reveal of his character and what he's going through, and Mildred's searing comments on this reveal, and Willoughby's reaction to said comments was top tier acting. In a single shot, and in his expression, you really saw tragedy, heartbreak and a sense of pity for Mildred, completely brought by Harrelson's fantastic performance. Then you have Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, whose character, like Willoughby, goes through some VERY unpredictable directions, at the start he's a bigoted, ignorant, racist buffoon red neck, and by the end he still kinda is, but many many more things as well, which was completely unexpected. I think Rockwell was the big standout of the film. It's an example of with certain screenwriting, you can have a character's arc and morals go completely up, down, sideways, backwards, in circles and inside out, and I was amazed by where he went just as a character, so credit to him and McDonagh's accomplished writing.The editing is right on point too, there's scenes where Harrelson's character is reading letters that he wrote, and the way the structure of shots goes back in time, forward in time etc, as he's narrating these letters, and just the shot structure and lengths for scenes throughout the film is pretty brilliant.Ultimately however, I just wasn't that convinced by this movie as a whole, Harrelson's character makes a big ol decision midway, that was meant to be SHOCKING and devastating, but there just wasn't any build up to it, so it just kinda happened unexpectedly and suddenly, that my reaction was more just ""Oooookay?!?!?"" than what it was meant to be. Dixon's character also makes a big decision upon what happens with Willoughby, and it just felt completely out of left field and unconvincing, even for a crazy bastard like him....So it was two BIG scenes that just didn't click for me. The film is also SO unrelentingly sardonic, mean spirited, depressing and angry that it just left me feeling... kinda nauseous. I've definitely never been one to just be like ""well that movie wasn't happy-happy joy-joy and didn't make me feel good and nice, therefore I hate it"", but there's just no end, no opposition and no upside to the bitterness that it just felt like ""misery porn"" interlaced with quirky, off-beat humour, and it just didn't sit well with me. But like I said the acting, directing, certain aspects of the character and writing, and editing is all phenomenal. But you just can't have a movie where characters just DO things without adequate motivation, build up or reasoning behind it, and for me at least those things weren't adequate enough to be convincing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Ambitious, moving and compelling drama...","..and one of the best movies of the 2010's, if not quite easily the best movie of 2017/18. Three Billboards shows how anger, tragedy and emotions, lead to more tragedy if you react aggressively to everything happening to you. 
Three Billboards is a psychological study, a moving experiment, that is so realistic and unconventional, that when you see it, you think finally I'm seeing something really great. The acting performances are phenomenal, everybody works to his strengths. The movie discovers the principals of society, the relationships, that aren't one sided.

Film of The Year,"OK, I have not watched that many films this year for one reason or another. However I have watched enough over the years to hopefully know a good film when I see it. The acting was superb and like Benito Del Toro in Traffic, I am sure Frances McDormand is a shoe-in for a few awards, however my standout was Sam Rockwell. A loathsome character, with lots of flaws but ultimately redeemable. Woody Harrelson was his usual laconic joy to watch and keeps getting better.

Pain is Contagious,"Questions and accusations go hand in hand when everyone knows everyone. Mildred has thrown up a three-part whooper of an interrogative just on the outskirts of town, just so any newcomers are privy to the neglect that burns through her faded, but defiant jumpsuit.The billboards' target lands on Chief Willoughby, a rugged yet compassionate family man, who loves saying ""goddamn"", and his force provides all the opportunities to pull it out. A man capable of viewing the larger picture in a speck of a town, he spatters red in attempts to wipe the advertising demons out of mind.Mildred has always spoken with her hands, and the moment she once spoke spiteful words haunts her to this day. Holy men, and blue men have no chance of cooling her. They are all culpable for the breakfast silences and cereal fights. Her son, Robbie, writhes in discomfort as she disregards reputation with crotch kicks and viral marketing.Officer Dixon is more of a short fuse than a racist, but particular sins float to the surface. His actions are deplorable, yet his heart rests in his momma's lap. He is the canine companion of Willoughby, and acts in contradiction to the Chief's every command. This zealot disciple might just be an incarnate desire emerging from a red wall.The inter-connectivity of small town living makes for scolding tempers and egregious lack of judgments. When a big city crime creeps into their preservation, Ebbing inhabitants end up making unlikely friends and easy enemies. Arson becomes untraceable, but the motive is as clear as the pain of a lost child, or perhaps husband.McDonagh has wrangled his wacky surrealism into a heart-stabbing community drama complete with genuine surprises and courageous late chapter restraint. Falling in love with the most slimy characters reveals how truly empathetic his vision was in creating a mystery with no clues and only heartache and growth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
American Gothic,"""Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness."" - MLK Jr.It is perhaps the most sentient lesson one can take from Three Billboards Outsie Ebbing, Missouri. The darkest film of 2017. A film so unrelentingly angry and brutal, that it laughs in self-awareness and asks the audience to do the same. Not a single person in this film is likable, by any stretch. Not a single line of dialogue is delivered with the premise of you bursting out laughing. Three Billboards is what it is. Unapologetically politically incorrect and gritty. Martin McDonagh piles it all on high like a plate at Thanksgiving dinner (to make a timely reference). But consequently, it gives the film a charm of it's own and a poignancy that is unmistakable. Reminiscent of the great films of the Coen Bros. and Quentin Tarantino, Three Billboards takes itself as far as it can go down the dark comedy rabbit hole and you will be smitten by that instantly. Three Billboards is a remarkable film and the most memorable film I've seen this year.Frances McDormand, in what can only be described as her most commanding on-screen performance since Fargo, plays Mildred Hayes. The grieving, blisteringly vengeful mother of a young girl raped and murdered by an unknown psychopath. In righteous indignation, she rents out Three billboards, that just so happen to be outside of Ebbing, Missouri (as the title suggests), that bluntly criticize the police department of Ebbing for what she sees as incompetence. ""Raped while dying,"" ""And still no arrests,"" ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"" they read. Chief Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson, takes offense by the billboards as he feels it unfairly targets him, especially coming on the heels of his cancer diagnosis. Backed up in outraged is Officer Jason Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, in a role that seems tailor made for a young Michael Rooker . Officer Dixon is the world's stupidest cop and the most bigoted for sure. As time goes on, the outrage comes to ahead when a new specific tragedy (that I won't spoil) happens to Chief Willoughby. Defiant, Mildred insists that the billboards stay up. The tables have turned for Dixon, who now has a righteous anger of his own. Desperate for revenge, he tries to get back at Mildred, only to reap what he has sowed, by chance, in a Molotov cocktail attack on the police station. Also, by sheer chance, he runs into who he thinks is the killer of Mildred's daughter and to atone for his bad cops sins, tries his best to indite the SOB.What is this movie getting at? A simple tale of the madness of current American society at it's core. Nobody is ever who they seem and we all aren't perfect. Also, how fate can change lives and the perspectives of themselves and others on a dime. Furthermore, tragedy and hate tend to become vicious cycles, as we all like to blame some kind of scapegoat to heal ourselves. It never does. Three Billboards cuts deep, even as it takes itself not very seriously... or so we think? The characters all curse up a storm and beat each other up, yet they all cry real tears. Can a film this strange make you feel the feels? The answer is it does. By some miracle, it does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
McDonagh Delivers Another Well-Made Dark Comedy,"Martin McDonagh's new film is an incendiary dark comedy that has some tonal similarities with his two previous films, ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths."" However, this film is also plenty unique, and while not perfect, it's a wickedly thoughtful while also somber film due to its plot and general merits. The film tells the story of a woman in a small town in Missouri who puts up three billboards to depict her disapproval of the local police chief's failure to investigate her daughter's rape and murder. Gleefully profane and politically incorrect, the film's no-holds-barred script generally works to create dramatic irony, tension and a sense of collective outrage. However, there are a few moments where its more hyperbolic senses fail to create the intended effect on viewers--or come across as if such writing devices are simply trying too hard to do so.""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" should be commended for its exceptional acting. Frances McDormand's performance in the lead role is simply outstanding. She manages to pull off a genuine sense of grief combined with a twisted and engaging sense of humor that complements her otherwise-serious characterization quite well. The supporting cast is impressive as well, particularly Woody Harrelson's role as the police chief. Despite these unique strengths, the film does also contain some flaws. The climax and ending happen to go on too long for no particular reason, and there are portions of the film that do feel slightly atonal. However, this is a generally well-made and certainly well-acted dark comedy. Recommended. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Tedious garbage masquerading as art.,"Boring and slow but I watched it in its entirety in the same way one morbidly looks at a bad highway accident because the movie is enlightening as to how low functioning, ignorant and racist Hollywood perceives the average person (you & me) to be. The police are portrayed as stupid to the point of mental retardation, openly committing violent & utterly pointless felonies in front of countless witnesses. They are inexplicably not held accountable for their actions. Likewise, when our almost equally ignorant hero firebombs a police station, the entire community knows she did it, and yet nothing comes from it. Such a crime would be an international news story that would mandate a major FBI investigation. The point is, this movie is completely detached from reality in every regard. Real people don't think or talk this way. People don't act this way. Reality dictates that there are unavoidable consequences for bad choices that don't apply in the fantasy world of this movie. Although this movie is not unique in this regard, I don't know that I have ever seen one so overtly contemptuous of common people. Ironic given the lack of education and real world experience that most of these Hollywood elitists actually have. Here is a tip for Hollywood on how to make real art instead of this garbage masquerading as art: in reality, the differences between the average person and the smug elites is negligible. A few bad choices for those without a safety net can create a life trajectory very difficult to recover from. Enough with the smug disrespect for customer base.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A masterpiece of film making,What a fabulous movie.

"Rich in story, full of unconventional characters","No violence and blockbuster action, no definite forms or results of the crime, no division of a hero and a villain.. just pure power of the story, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a smart crime movie. It contains many important events, stories, and messages, and not a single one is obscure or overly complex. Angela Hayes' murder, police's incompetence, domestic violence from her husband, and public getting tired from her constant request to find out the assaulter, Mildred has to fight against all the odds. Frances McDormand portrays a strong but painful mother with masterpiece performance. Her strength is not viewed as headstrongness, and her challenges against public force is not viewed as violent or irrational. The movie keeps the balance so audience can support the protagonist till the end where she drives to Idaho. Willoughby and Dixon.. They are the characters hard to hate. I love the fact that they are not described as evils but flawed human beings. Dixon is violent, authoritative, and discriminatory, but the movie provides the backstory and his point of view.

"A thoughtful meditation on Anger, Hate, Love, Revenge and Humanity","Rarely does a film come along that truly encompasses a time better than this film, while all the while remaining timeless and able to send a message that speaks to any time or any people. I believe 'Three Billboards' is one of those films.A theme that reverberates throughout this film is 'Anger', and equally what it can do to us as humans. It can cause us to take drastic measures. Cause us to do unreasonable things. Cause us to not listen and let our emotions overcome us. Throughout this film, depicted through masterful performances by McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, we receive a story that manages to be dark, unsettling and even somewhat funny about what happens when we let anger take over our emotions and throw caution to the wind for any human that stands in our way.In a time where anger and vitriol are perhaps at their most prevalent, this film sends a simple statement in its closing moments: ""Anger begets greater anger"". The film itself illustrates just how far humanity and our emotions can push us, from the 'three billboards' in question into a domino effect that can ruin lives, destroy human beings, and only spawn worse and worse hatred for our fellow man.In the end, we find that only understanding and forgiveness can help us succeed as humans, and perhaps some of that humanity that causes us to do insane things can be good for finding understanding and chance for change. THAT, my friends, is what this film is about, and it tells an amazing story to get us there.The performances are certainly as good as you have heard. McDormand's performance is neither a hero nor a villain, but a human one and a vulnerable one. Harrelson is just as human, with plenty of heart and realism to go along with him. Rockwell is perhaps one of the most incredible development cycles of any character I have ever seen, but I will not DARE spoil it for anyone. His performance is worth the price of admission alone...This film is about humans. About emotion. About the dangerous concoction those two things can create and what they can ironically destroy through that...but at the same time, it is also about how powerful we can be when we allow that red-hot anger to simmer, and allow ourselves to be as good of humans as we can be.This film is about humanity, and there's no better time than now to be reminded of how good than bad we can...9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"You think it's about chutzpah, but it's about heartbreak","On a drive through the American South some years ago, British writer-director Martin McDonagh saw a set of billboards that challenged the authorities similar to the way the sheriff of Ebbing, Missouri, is challenged in this film. The rage they embodied stayed with him, and although this film is billed as a black comedy, don't go looking for belly laughs. Its true subject is heartbreak. 
With an intelligent script that's perhaps a few minutes too long, McDonagh's characters' actions impinge on others like billiard balls knocking about on the table. Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand-a genius at portraying tough, uncompromising women) intends for her actions to affect others when she pays for three billboards to be pasted up on a remote stretch of road outside town, blood red and anger-filled: ""Raped While Dying. And Still No Arrests? How Come, Sheriff Willoughby?"" Guilt and anger are written just as clearly on her unsmiling face.
The sheriff's deputies, accustomed to have their way in all local matters, great and small, are offended. They want her to take them down. Of course she won't. One of them, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is an overgrown boy, prey to his every violent whim and McDonagh gives him a complex character arc.
Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) has other troubles on his mind and, while it's true he hasn't made progress in solving Angela Hayes's murder, it isn't true that he hasn't tried. Although his place in their world is the slipperiest, he has the best sense of what that place is.
Several supporting roles are equally powerful (I especially liked Mildred's ex-husband's new girlfriend), and there are some laughs-people being their natural selves can be hilarious, usually without meaning to be. Though a broken heart manifests itself differently in all three main characters, it's Sheriff Willoughby who points the way to healing. Already the film has received numerous awards and nominations, including the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama, with Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Martin McDonagh (screenplay) winners too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

However, what we are left with is a wasted opportunity, when the movie takes a sudden change of tone, from a crime drama to an almost romantic finish. There were many moments where the film could have simply ended, albeit on a much better note, rather than extending it far too long, and creating unanswered questions the answers to which are essential to the main storyline. In my opinion, the film needed to be shorter or longer - either not have brought about new issues which were not explored sufficiently in the first place (shorter), or alternatively, extending the film a bit more to demonstrate the consequences of the character's respective actions (longer). Instead, we are left somewhere in between, completely dissatisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Silly, contradictory, implausible and foul","I read many reviews of this movie extolling its many qualities. I read that it won two academy awards and was nominated for many others. I watched the movie yesterday and cannot recall being more disappointed in a movie for which I had such high expectations. I will avoid being specific (consistent with the rules for writing reviews on the Netflix site), but to say that the storyline for this movie is ridiculous is being kind. This movie has been described as drama and dark comedy. It is neither. Rather it is an amalgam of extreme violence, course and foul language, misogyny and bigotry, all designed to push the envelope just a little further to satisfy an audience that apparently is no longer sustained by subtlety and a well constructed plot line. In a day and age when everything has to be ""in your face"" to gain attention, this movie delivers. The plot, which is in addition to being downright silly, inconsistent and contradictory, delivers no discernible denouement. Perhaps the writers found that at the end of this train wreck there was nothing of consequence remaining to deliver as a conclusion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri shows that a serious subject and dark humour make for a good combination.","This film really did blow me away, I mean I knew it was going to be good but...not that good! McDonaugh had my undivided attention immediately, and he didn't let me go. Not once. That in itself, is a damn achievement. The mother of a daughter who was raped and murdered rents three billboards as a way of getting the police's attention to find the killer. Sounds like it should be boring right? So you bring in the writer and director of 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' to mix things up abit. What he has managed to conjure up is the perfect equilibrium of depressing real life situations with dark humour in order to create a story about grief. You may not necessarily agree with Mildred's methods yet it evokes sympathy, you empathise with her. Her cold harsh exterior disguises the sadness and sorrow within. When I say harsh, I mean she is savage. Dropping F-Bombs more frequently than a B-2 Stealth, she obliterates anyone in Ebbing who gets in her way...and it is so satisfying to watch. I don't condone large usage of profanity in a script, but when it's put to ingenious use it somehow brings a smile to my face. ""Yeahhh, kick them in the crotch!"". It's a strange trait that actually complements McDormand's portrayal, and wow did she blow my mind. She was devastatingly outstanding to which I'm sure she will win many awards. Her serious demeanour just added to the hilarity of this dark comedy. Rockwell was hilarious as the local idiot officer and also deserves recognition. Harrelson provides some much needed heart and emotion as the chief of police. McDonaugh's best directing effort thus far. The musical score was well suited to the rustic town of Ebbing. I do think the ending could've been cut short by about 5 or 10 minutes, and very occasionally the pacing dips. Very minuscule criticisms for a near perfect film which I'm sure will be even more enjoyable after a repeat viewing. I can smell all the awards from here...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A dark comedy against an absorbing drama.,"If I can compliment a film with at least 5 adjectives, more than likely it's etched in my membrane, there to be championed to as many folks as possible who are willing to listen.Any film worth remembering provokes a mixture of emotions out of you; laughs, cries, interest, shock, awe. And any film that has a strong or unique story with equally unique characters, should resonate with you in a way that's either self-reflective or empathetic or ideally both.Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's latest offering is such a film. Ever since the red band trailer dropped some months ago, I was already psyched. Three Billboards managed the impressive feat of having a range of responses from me, from nervous laughter to unexpectedly crying to consistent intrigue. I was mesmerised by the bold, profane and at times delicate script as we're given a host of characters that are either unruly or difficult but remained sympathetic and captivating all the same.We see Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) driving down Drinkwater road one afternoon and she spots three unused billboards that hasn't been used in many years (a fine little detail we see is one of the billboards says 'worth stopping for'). She sits fidgeting for a bit, contemplating on what they could be used for. She heads down to the Ebbing advertising company ran by Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) to negotiate the terms on how to advertise and how much it is to advertise the billboards. She intends to use them for at least a year and for what she intends the billboards to say, Red is quickly sympathetic to her cause by saying ""you must be Angela Hayes' mother"".Angela Hayes is the recently slain daughter of Mildred. Some 7 months prior she was kidnapped, raped and burnt beyond recognition with no new developments on the case. Unsatisfied with this motion, the billboards say the following; RAPED WHILE DYING, STILL NO ARRESTS, HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?. From then on in She wages a one-woman war against the local police department by calling them for them seeming incompetence of their service. This doesn't sit well with the rest of the community as Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is much revered by everyone.Something noticeable throughout Mcdonagh's work is with all the cynicism and venom characters spew at one another, we have the vulnerability and depravity revealed in sometimes small doses but they never feel forced. It's not a mechanic used to force us to care about people, it's welcome in that they deal with their tragedy or luck with humour that's brash and twisted that enables them to push through their dilemma.The townsfolk of Ebbing had me caring for just about everyone, including the ones opposing against Mildred. There's no clear-cut villain here (other than the scumbag or scumbags who tortured and murdered Angela). We're shown how vengeance, rage and glee can evolve into something rather dis-compassionate. How sometimes dialling back and seeing the future of your rightful cause for inflicting your sense of justice can further down the line turn into you something dangerous and inaccessible for infamous reasons.Veteran talent like Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges and Abbie Cornish all shine here but Sam Rockwell's turn as the dimwitted, inconsiderate but disarmingly endearing Dixon is a plum role that deserves Best Supporting Actor recognition.
The showcase here is by far McDormand's volcanic, bad ass Mildred. She exhibits such humanity, drive and sardonic wit that her means of venting out and search for closure invites a whirlwind of frustration and anxiety amongst everyone around her. She's working on peak power, one that undoubtedly will score her an Oscar nomination. It's extraordinary work.Mildred is the strongest, most empowering character I've seen in a long time. Her arc serves to address how we all just need to step back and contemplate on why we feed the fire with fire. Even the smaller characters are well rounded enough in how they propose alternatives and insight to the more flawed characters. Mcdonagh never misses an opportunity to show us fire or red or some kind of tension. We're asked to recognise the potential of our anger and offset it with something more serene and responsible, a morality tale that asks us to be constructive, not destructive.This film is grim, twisted, devastating, unpredictable, inspiring, bold and of course funny. I'm sore I didn't see this in 2017 as it would've toppled Dunkirk as my fave of that year. Alas, it's 2018 and even though it's the first film I've seen this year, I'm positive nothing this year will dethrone Three Billboards as my fave of the year.Striking, wicked and brilliantly acted, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has raw power that's balanced with clever wit which makes for a rewarding and unpredictable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You Would Do The Same,"Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell is all I needed to know about this movie before seeing it. The trio only add to an already solid script and bring it to life as the three main characters.McDormand plays Mildred, an angry, bad-ass mother who won't take shit from anybody, especially when it comes to finding her daughter's killer. Pissed off that after seven months no arrests have been made in the case she decides to take matters into her own hands - in a most unexpected way. Just down the street from her home sits three billboards long since abandoned on the side of a road rarely used after the installation of a new highway nearby. Now, however, construction has re-routed traffic back to this stretch of road, and Mildred scrapes together the billboards' rental fee to post a little message to Ebbing's Chief of Police (welcome back Woody Harrelson). The message: get off your ass and do something (I'm paraphrasing).Chief Willoughby has his own problems, and tries the sympathy card to reason with Mildred. He wants the billboards gone for the better of the town he claims, even though the law says Mildred is doing nothing wrong. She doesn't want to hear it, and pushes him further into action.Enter seemingly corrupt mamma's boy cop, Officer Dixon (played brilliantly by Sam Rockwell) who knows a thing or two about how you solve problems in Ebbing. He too, it seems, will stop at nothing to get what he wants. What he wants is to protect his good friend (and the only reason why he still has a job), the Chief.This easy-to-follow, sometimes darkly-funny movie keeps you interested right from the beginning. This isn't your typical ""I know who did it"" crime-drama. This could easily be a true story, but it's not. However, the concept of using billboards to push for justice is true and happened more than two decades ago in the deep southern United States, according to director Martin McDonagh. ""What kind of pain would lead somebody to do that?"" he asked himself at the time.Now we know, and I would have done the same.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

This is not about justice, or even about revenge, her motivation is purely selfish.

One of my favorites from last year!,"Martin McDonagh is one of my favorite directors and from his first two films, I was certain I knew his brand: wildly witty, self-aware nihilism; the irreverence of Tarantino and panache of Guy Ritchie blended with quaaludes to a sweet, sludgy black. In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths were both favorites of mine, but their message - if one could charitably call it that - was ""Let's watch the world burn through a fogged-up funhouse mirror.""Three Billboards is a different, more mature animal. It has all the cleverness, and gleeful blasphemy, of his earlier films - unquotable monologues, manic fits of disproportionate violence. But it also has something serious to say, and is willing to take its brooding time saying it. In that sense, it's hard not to compare it to his brother's film Calvary. If Calvary asked the question ""What use is faith in a world whose institutions fail to earn it?"", Three Billboards asks ""What good is anger when there's no one to absorb the blame?"" It's a story of characters filled with righteous indignation and no proper place to funnel it. Mildred Hayes can't believe her daughter's murder hasn't been solved. Sgt Dixon can't believe his boss's good name is being dragged through the mud. In typical playwright fashion, improbably heightened events are used to tease out real emotions from real people: the point isn't what happens, it's how these characters would respond if it had. Perfectly scripted and wonderfully realized (Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are particularly great), those responses are always earned. If you go in expecting an A-to-B storyline with lovable heroes, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you're ready to soak in a few hours of gray, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this. One of my favorites from last year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Great Film about Anger and Grief,"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ out of 5)GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Three of the year's best performances in one of the year's best films.SYNOPSIS: A grieving mother angers a town in order to seek justice for her daughter's unsolved murder.JIM'S REVIEW: When one glances at Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), it is hard to ever imagine if this woman ever danced, or smiled, or loved someone. One wonders if she ever was an innocent child growing up. Her constant scowl, disdaining look, and furrowed brow, are all evident from a lifetime of disappointments which show us that here is a most unhappy person.ÔøºBut her appearance tells a deeper story... a tragic tale that gives her permission to be filled with hopelessness and a justifiable reason for her rage. Seven months ago, her daughter was raped and savagely murdered and her killer still remains at large. Justice has not been served and now she must intervene in Martin McDonagh's dark comedy, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Leasing a trio of outdoor displays, she will force local law enforcement into solving her daughter's killing by announcing their ineptitude and shaming the town in the process as the situation becomes even more violent as the investigation spins out of control. The film is superb.ÔøºJust as the morning fog rolls in like a shroud of ominous foreboding, so does a nagging sense of dread and melancholia which seems to hang onto this town and its inhabitants. Mr. McDonagh serves as director and screenwriter and has created a work of art. He deftly directs his own screenplay with masterful results, blending humor and dramatic tension seamlessly.The director / screenwriter's unique and slightly quirky vision fills his film with poetic images (a teddy bear slightly submerged by a riverbank, a deserted set of red swings gently moving in the breeze, a box turtle crawling over a sleeping woman, three disintegrated billboard alongside an empty road). His dialog is hauntingly real and filled with confrontational conversations and barbed words. There are scenes of unexpected poignancy (one between Ms. M. and a passing deer near those controversial billboards and another involving a conversation between pink bunny slippers that are heartbreaking) Each and every character, from major to minor, are fully drawn and react with complete honesty and quiet (and sometimes loud) rage.The casting is flawless. Frances McDormand is a commanding presence and makes an indelible impression as a woman on the verge. Overcome with bitterness and grief, she dominates this film with a no-holds-bar persona. The actress plays this unlikable but passionate character with a vengeance, literally speaking. She is simply astonishing. Her portrayal is a master class in acting. Even when not ranting against the powers that be or fighting to simply be heard, Mildred's silent pauses and side glances fill in all of the nuances of her character's emotional breakdown to chilling effects. (If there is any justice, on screen or off, the Oscar is waiting for her.)As Mildred's moving targets are Woody Harrelson who brings a nuanced portrayal as William Willoughby, the chief of police and Sam Rockwell playing his dim-witted, loyal, and anger-ridden deputy, Officer Dixon. Mr. Harrelson plays the film's most centered character in a town filled with hate and bigotry and the actor conveys a good man dying of cancer, frustrated by life's limitations and caught in a free fall of emotions. Mr. Rockwell takes his complicated character into areas of comedy and drama that defy description. It is a commanding performance as we watch his character grow from a bigoted mama's boy into a man finally questioning his own self-worth. (Another possible award winning performance in a film filled with great acting?)Adding even more depth to the complex plotting are Lucas Hedge as Mildred's forgotten and emotionally trampled son, Robbie, and John Hawkes as her abusive ex-husband. Only Peter Dinklage's character is a tad sketchy and in need of more screen time. He becomes her possible love interest...if Mildred could possibly love anyone. Providing fine support in minor but pivotal roles are Zeljko Ivanek, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Clarke Peters, and Samara Weaving.Production values are high. Beautifully filmed by cinematographer Ben Davis, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. uses a variety of musical genres, from opera and pop standards to twangy country tunes, which set that perfect tone in Carter Burwell's atmospheric score. Both words and image create a shattering look at grief that is unmistakably heart-wrenching.Yes, there are some illogical plot twists and sudden far-fetched acts of violence that never have any legal repercussion on the culprits in this community of law and disorder. But the script has such a lyrical and moving way of expressing the everyday sadness and routine of life that is so commonplace in many rural towns.Some moviegoers also may not be satisfied with the film's conclusion either. But I was transfixed throughout this film.

A Great Dark Comedy that Echos the Style of the Coen Brothers,"I had the pleasure of seeing the local premiere of Three Billboard outside of Ebbing, Missouri tonight at the Paramount Theater as part of Austin Film Festival. The film's style and humor is reminiscent of some of the better early Coen Brothers films (Blood Simple, Fargo, and Raising Arizona). The writer/director has basically stolen their style. Basically, a story that on paper is very dark and serious played with characters that are essentially humorous for dark comedic effect. The presence of Francis McDormand more-or- less completes the linkage. (She may well earn another Oscar nomination.) The film is deeply disturbing built around a mother's quest for justice after her daughter's violent death, themes of death and dying, police incompetence and brutality, and hints of racism and spousal abuse. At the same time, it can be hysterically funny and absurd. You want to laugh during one scene and cry during the next. The dis-functionality of just about every character is somehow both disturbing and hilarious. I think like the Coen Brothers, writer/director Martin McDonagh want you to take the issues raised seriously, but perhaps not to take ourselves too seriously. Overall, the acting and directing by a stellar cast is first-rate. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates this sort of dark comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Martin McDonough kills the cat: Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri movie review","Grief is an odd feeling to capture in writing, painting, or even in movies. Often times the sad part of grief is so emphasized upon that we forget about the anger, the anxiety and the unease that it carries. Perhaps because anger is associated with ugliness and rage, our heroes don't stay angry for long. They quickly get inspired and fight back to reach the happy ending where skies are once again blue, and grass is green. But anger is as relatable a feeling as hope or love, it clouds our judgments and pushes to limits we cannot imagine. I love Martin McDonough's work so much because ha challenges himself to use all that raw feeling to make art. There are no good or bad characters is Ebbing, they all try to cope with their life in their own ways and it's from depth of these characters (and not boundaries of movie genres) that we get sorrow, empathy and of course loads of dark comedy. The less you know about this feature going in, the better. The movie opens with Francis McDormand driving down a lonely road as the camera follows her from outside of the car. We see her looking up at something in front of her as she slows down, and when the car stops, we see the reflection of an old billboard in the windshield. We see the moment of her decision making all in one simple clever image. No cuts back and forth to clue us as to what she's looking at and of no lazy exposition. She decides to use the billboards to send a message to the chief of police in Missouri, asking what happened to her daughter's murdered. There is a book about how You can write a screenplay that you can successfully sell to Hollywood called ""Save the cat"" which outlines plot points and where the should happen, to generate a certain amount of forced empathy out of you for the characters in the film. You've seen the result in every Marvel movie, every blockbuster and more recently in ""Justice League"" and as fan, I find them to be more and more boring every time. Studios dare not to take risks, and continue to pander to our lowest common denominators as the audience so they can make a buck. My little rant on ""save the cat"" connects to ""Three Billboards"" because McDonough is aware of the audience expectations and he deliberately uses that advantage to surprise us and control our feelings. After all a director is only directing our attention during his film and not what we would like, and expect to see. This self-awareness is a double edged sword, as it can fire back for being too cheesy, to self-referential and too full of itself, but Three Billboards manages to walk the thin line perfectly, and you as the audience are lost in this movie's world because as you feel like you know these characters, and so you care! Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri has the best screenplay of the year, it has the best Female lead and best supporting male in Francis McDormand and Sam Rockwell, it is one of the darkest, and also one of the funniest films I've seen in years. Martin McDonough continues to build and own his tone as a dark comedic writer and my prediction is, very soon, just like the Quentin Tarantinos and Wes Andersons of this world he will be known for his own genre of film.

Disappointed end,Very disappointing end ... i can't imagine this great history come with end,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I am disappointed,"Three Billboards in Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy/crime thriller.The main focus is on Mildred (Frances McDormand) putting up three billboards to make the police department focus on catching the killer who murdered her daughter.Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is the Chief of the police department and he doesn't think that the three billboards are very fair because he believes that he and his department did the best they could within the law of their job.Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is an officer who is hell-bent on making Mildred take the billboards down. Dixon is a guy who will go outside the law in order to accomplish whatever he sets his mind to.The movie doesn't have a main focus on what it tries to tell.Is this about how people should come together for the greater good regardless of their differences?Is this about how people never can truly see eye to eye when there is a greater situation at hand?Everyone in here, for the most part, has a story to tell and yet none of this focuses on what I came to see in the first place.I thought this movie was going to be like Gone Girl mixed with comedy and that's not what I got.What I got was a movie that's funny, heartfelt, and genuine, but it doesn't have a focus on what story it actually wants to tell.I was very disappointed with this movie, it could've been so much more.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZjN8IxOD-4",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"A canonical class on character development, performances and direction.","A game-changer. I have just witnessed one of the- narratively speaking -more intense feature films ever, one that, surprisingly, doesn't require Parisian landscapes or delicate photographs to be the most effortlessly acidic film offer in a very long time, one incorporating a really powerful drama and a delicious caustic black humor, putting you as a voyeur of the pain of others, a depraved buy purgative activity.Without a doubt, the greatest strengths of this towering work are in its script. The plot places us directly at the heart of the matter: three polygonal and outdated billboards that serve as a purifying instrument for characters and audience alike. A succinctly-shaped storyline of this kind must be reputed as a narrative milestone, for as a result of a tragic event, a mother drowned by grief and her voracious desire for justice will be the perfect machinery for executing finely-chained maneuvers, prioritizing a down-to-earth plot that will keep interest at its highest level. I'm still seriously disturbed by this fascinating, groundbreaking and invigorating screenplay; it's some time now since an American-British screenplay with a level of humanity and moral complexity as outstanding and superb as Martin McDonagh's latest opus is, who in addition to directing, is credited as the absolute artifice of this emotional purge. Thanks to this man, the world has been able to enjoy situations surpassing the epic drama, crowning moments, allowing each actor to show off their major talents, without falling into shameful exaggerations. The leading role of "" Fargo"" wonderful actress Frances McDormand, which will surely lead her name to global media focus, she expels strength, even when her heart is broken into hundreds of pieces. This impetuosity is precisely the agent allowing an almost instantaneous connection from the first scene on the road, that imperfection, remorse and feeling, seeking vindication in such emotional ways that announces the establishment of a new Ellen Ripley, for indie-drama genre, her brave nature, supported on the grief of a mother, stirs up a sensational feeling from which the film drinks on several times to achieve an unbeatable narrative cadence. The second great discovery is underestimated-actor Sam Rockwell. Rockwell returns with a worthy-recognition role, a really big one, Dixon, an alcoholic sheriff who doesn't frequent good manners, an arrogant policeman who doesn't care to pass over the world to be victorious. Needless to say, this actor executes one of the most powerful moments of the film at the hands of his character. Last, but not least, is a not-remotely-unusual player, as most of his performances get to touch the overwhelming, the really overwhelming. Willoughby is a police chief who failed to fully resolve a murder and rape crime, moreover, he's outweighed by repercussions that cause the three billboards of the protagonist and a life-or-death decision, here a controversial debate rises up, to confront a dreaded fatal fate.A huge praise deserves some set-pieces pushing beyond the mettlesome narrative development. The film is rich in sequences that transmit by means of the pictures, and although it's almost impossible to avoid spoilers, it can be said that such strong points are distributed proportionately between the scenes where supporting and leading characters are involved in other words, between sequences that don't focus only on the bad-ass protagonist, even though, indirectly, all the moves lies on her. A mother, two local sheriffs, flames, explosions, love affairs, three billboards on deep-scarlet background and serious lettering, a surly dentist and a hired murderer are the ingredients used for the construction of a film which is based on its potent and articulated screenplay.The score is brutal. From the start, I have considered musical accompaniments as key pieces for the success of transmission of emotions, of truth; A filmmaker must get to most possible resources to make sense of the specific and general purposes of the story, so I personally think that a simple melodic structure supports fabulous acting and creative task. Carter Burwell, who curiously had also worked with Mr. McDonagh in ""Seven Psychopaths"", has behind him gold scores of the stature of ""Carol"", ""Anomalisa"" and ""Mr. Holmes""; Now, he reappears with full hands through compositions that are rightly coupled with the most heartfelt moments of the film, His score for this story express, on many occasions, more than pictures, because from masterful and harmonic sounds he transmits grief, tribulation, intractability and madness accompanying the characters, while potentiates his chances to opt for the coveted golden man. We will have to keep a close eye on this New Yorker, as he insinuates being the next monster producing excellent soundtracks for deep films thanks to his undeniable talent.""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" written and directed by Martin McDonagh will make history in my review Watchlist as the first motion picture in which I didn't evaluate technical or visually artistic aspects, which clearly are executed in a beautiful, crude and stunning way, however, I haven't considered them as a fundamental part because this film is purely story and characters. I was skeptical about a true audiovisual production mustn't be made up of visual, narrative and creative art, however, this work has shown me that art can be conceived by putting some components a greater importance than others, but finally, they are all there. A blistering catharsis led by top-notch performances and a glorified direction, this film is the most human, poignant, shocking and coherent drama I have seen in a long time, a major achievement for cinematographic narrative that reveals the potential emergence of a feasible writing maestro, while it serves as a magnet to unite a hugely talented group of people who make the film what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Engrossing, Albeit Predictable at Times","Three Billboards is rarely subtle, even though it gives that false sense that it may be. It is a film that feels both big and small at the same time, and as far as I'm concerned, that's an incredible achievement.Francis McDormand is once again utilized brilliantly, this time as an angst-filled, impatient mother willing to bulldoze a system she believes is not working on behalf of her family. It would behoove anyone watching the first minutes of this film not to be brought into a false sense of calm and believe you're watching something of a slow burn. Things happen fast, and it has a kind of intensity that one might not expect of a film like this.Sam Rockwell has always been a favorite of mine since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and rarely disappoints in the roles he chooses. It's no different here. A complicated man one could easily write off as an idiot, the arc of his character is breathtaking and nuanced. Almost poetic.Woody Harrelson is, to me, always at his best. He's easy to watch because he's an effortless actor. He knows his craft well, and he's given us a solid performance this film. The rest of the cast turn in fine performances (special kudos to Caleb Landry Jones), and don't detract in any way from the film. Everyone is watchable.The film is not perfect. There are times when I wondered why certain decisions were made, especially with the appearance of an ex relationship, a shocking end involving a character, an obvious insertion of a character to create more intrigue (however at the end one realizes it was totally unnecessary and not well thought out), and even a part where I nearly blurted out loud ""oh come on! He had to have heard that!"" Some of that was a little frustrating and seemed too contrived and unbelievable, but overall, this film it a good way to spend 115 minutes. It does not feel like a nearly two-hour movie. That's testament to its worth.All in all, it's a very good effort, and it stays with you. Not forgettable, and fun discussing over a drink afterward. Do I believe it deserved the Golden Globe last night? Well, it won. It was up against some very good films, and held its own. I've seen all but one of the nominated films, and I think it deserved the win. I think Frances deserved the win. I think Sam deserved the win. I don't think it should have won best screenplay over another contender. But... that's just my opinion.Such is life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A dramatic and black comedy film with terrific acting from Frances McDormand,"Thi is a darkly comic drama from Academy Award nominee Martin McDonagh (In Bruges).

Then Dixon, one of his officers (Academy Award winner Sam Rockwell), carries out violent executive acts . These happenings lead to many twisted situations that involve violence, hateful , tragedy, and redemption. .A good drama filled with very black and very acidic black humor

A Compelling Narrative with an Open-Ended Conclusion,"Unique and captivating storytelling experience, leaving audiences engaged and curious throughout the film. The distinct narrative structure and intriguing plot choices make it a standout cinematic piece. However, the open-ended conclusion might leave some viewers wanting more closure.The film skillfully combines elements of mystery and drama, effectively holding the audience's attention from start to finish. The characters are complex and well-developed, each contributing to the overall depth of the story. The use of billboards as a central plot point adds a layer of originality, driving the plot forward in unexpected ways.Despite its strengths, the film's conclusion takes an open-ended approach that can be divisive. While some viewers might appreciate the ambiguity, others may find themselves desiring a more definitive resolution to the characters' journeys and the central conflict. This choice allows for interpretation and discussion, but it may also leave some unsatisfied.In the end, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" stands as a testament to innovative storytelling and exceptional character portrayal.

A decent enough cast but with an aborted ending...does that mean an unnecessary sequel?,"Mrs. Shullivan and I were looking forward to seeing this move what with all the hype after receiving six (6) nominations and actually winning two (2) Academy Awards on March 05th, 2018. The cinematography and dramatic performances were both very good. We were however categorically disappointed in the outcome.Yes, Frances McDormand who plays a divorced mother named Mildred who loses her daughter prematurely as a result of a rape and brutal murder is distraught and frustrated with the local Ebbing Missouri police department who are making zero progress on finding out who was responsible for her daughters rape and murder, and what parent wouldn't be frustrated? However Mildred is not such a quiet introverted nor a passive mother. She is divorced from an abusive husband and willing to go to great lengths to literally push the Ebbings police department and especially the town's Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to put a heck of a lot more effort into investigating her daughters murder and to keep her informed into the police department's progress, or lack there of.I really thought the film had a strong cast including the likes of John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges, Zeljko Ivanek, Amanda Warren, Abbie Cornish, Peter Dinklage and Clarke Peters whose characters did not match up to the respected actors capabilities. In other words their performances were forgettable as they were peripheral roles in the film and the story line was suspect at best. Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand won an Oscar each for their performances, and Woody Harrelson could have and maybe should have beaten out his co-star Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor, and kudos to them all but I did not think this film was worthy of receiving six (6) Oscar nominations.Most disappointing was the abrupt ending after watching the film for near to two (2) hours which I will not divulge so as not to have to provide a spoiler alert. Maybe the Cohen brothers have plans for a sequel but that would be nothing more than sheer box office greed leaning on their suprising six (6) Academy Award nominations and two (2) winns to which I for one will not be fooled.

A non specific movie about a tragedie,"While I have a been a fan Of Frances McDormand since Fargo, this movie does however disappoint me to quit an extend.
She plays her role well, a feisty women who wants to take matters in to her own hands after her daughter is brutally raped and murdered and no one seems to care.
As a parent you can only feel compassion for her rage and determination.
That is the good side of the movie, the not so good is the fact all of the prejudices they want to shove down my throat.
In no particular order these are the ones that irritated me the most:
The black woman/man getting suppressed by the police;
The police is always well represented with bigots;
Pot should be legal;
It is perfectly fine to burn down a police station if you feel they let you down;
It is absolutely necessary to kick teenagers in the groin when they don't answer your question;
And last but not least, you should always compare a priest or pastor with a gang member.
The only thing missing is the son not being a member of the LBGTQ community, the all the leftists would be satisfied with this movie.My point being, leave politics out of the movie if they don't contribute to the story.

"""THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI""","Frances McDormand is clearly into character as she portrays a deeply sad but resigned mother with a goal.
Her goal is to upset anyone that can help her find the monster who killed her daughter, and she brilliantly succeed at it when one after the other, they come to either 'ask nicely' to get rid of the billboards; openly scare-the-hell out of her at her workplace or simply threaten her as a tactical move to basically make the billboards disappear.
But as strong as a mother can be, she just carries on the promise she made to herself and to her too-soon departed girl; and do whatever it takes to get answers.The only trailer I've seen is full of sharply-written dialogue and outrageous one-off quotes, which fortunately the film is filled with all the way.
It doesn't feel long, nor short. All the secondary characters are developed and bring something to the story.

"Great, Unpredictable Story, But Poorly Paced","Engaging, interesting, deep, but poorly-paced. Those are the best words that come to mind after I finished re-watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.This was my first Martin McDonagh film and it encouraged me to check out his two, much better, previous films -- Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges. If you enjoyed the unpredictable storytelling of any one of his films, but have not watched them all, you will also enjoy his unpredictable, unique narrative structure of his other films, which particularly shines in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His characters are all well-developed, although some are more interesting and watchable than others. Three Billboards is no exception. The story is very smart and serious, even though the screenplay is as hilarious as the subject matter is dark.Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a woman grieving after the rape and murder of her daughter. After months of the local police doing nothing for her case, she takes justice into her own hands, first in the form of three billboards calling out the police chief, Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby. As the story unravels and the tension builds, the message becomes more and more clear, until it is finally spoken in simple, obvious terms that ruins the subtlety and intelligence of the screenplay. However, the characters are still deep, emotional, and well-developed throughout even when the screenplay falters.I particularly enjoyed the development and arc of Sam Rockwell's racist police officer, Dixon. At first, he is given the simple, one-dimensional characterization that causes viewers to dismiss him as the villain, or at least an obstacle in the way of the protagonist. Over halfway through, a realization dawns on viewers that sets the stage for the wonderful message: Maybe the hero seeking justice is just as bad as the racist cop. The theme of anger begetting anger is brilliantly told through the characters and their actions in the story.The setting is also just as important in this movie as many of the characters are. By naming the town fictionally, it is easier to understand how these characters with unrealistic traits and qualities would interact and live in a town like this. Although the characters seem unrealistic, their emotions are certainly real and relatable. McDonagh has a preference for naming his films literally and directly from what the story is about. Ebbing, Missouri is a place of receding hope and grief. In other words, the love, hope, and optimism in Ebbing, Missouri ebbs away as the film progresses and the characters act more and more. .The largest flaw I have with this film is the pacing of the third act. The first two acts were exceptionally well-made/paced and evoke strong reactions from the audience. Once the majority of the story has been told and the events laid out for us, the film comes screeching to halt, but doesn't end. After the climactic sequence, the story slowly (slower than you can imagine) crawls to its conclusion. As a result, the conclusion leaves viewers thinking, ""Finally!"" where it could have left us thinking that it was shorter than it actually is. To quote Roger Ebert in his A Clockwork Orange review, ""You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half,"" and those words have never applied to a film more than Three Billboards.While I still encourage you all to see this (in theaters if possible), it's also important that you know your tastes. If you prefer dark comedy and a subtle, smart story, this is definitely for you. If you hate comedy mixed with serious subject matters and prefer faster-paced films, maybe seek out Dunkirk or Wonder Woman. I also feel that I must admit this: After the Golden Globe awards, I felt highly unsatisfied that Three Billboards won in many major categories and that likely led to me thinking this film is slightly worse than it actually is. While it deserves many of the awards that it has gotten (and is likely to receive), The Shape of Water will always be my favorite of the year, no matter how unpredictable, refreshing, and memorable Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"The aftermath of a crime and how it transformed every single person in the city in a singular, sensitive and complex movie","Bittersweet films are by far the least preferred by a large part of the public. The fact that it has a more real feel, and that it disappoints expectations of happy endings, is a sign of frustration in the experience available to the common viewer. However, for their target audience, they are the best films, after all, writing a story that balances the happy and sad so well is something worthy of applause. And that's what Three Billboards for a Murder proposes, and brilliantly does.The film uses several attributes to maintain this style, moving between aggression towards women, violence, racism, homophobia, in an extremely natural way, which may shock the public, but nothing else represents what is really lived in some states. Of southern USA. And, despite so many important issues addressed, as said, they are treated in a natural way, which is a hit of the script, since that is the objective of the film and the way in which they are shown only helps in the result of it.Overcome by frustration and anger at the apparent inaction of the local police regarding the death of her daughter, who, before having her body charred, was raped while dying (the ""while"" makes the horrible even worse), Mildred decides to buy advertisements on billboards on a little-used road near the city, using them to publicly question the police - and in particular Chief Willoughby (Harrelson). A man of restrained ways, Willoughby is still shocked by Mildred's attitude - especially when he realizes that she already knew he has terminal pancreatic cancer. However, if the boss still remains reasonable, his subordinate, Dixon (Rockwell), can barely contain the impulse to resolve the issue with violence, since, in addition to being racist, he has an already explosive temper made worse by alcohol.Set in the small town of the original title, Ebbing, Three Advertisements does not hesitate to give the narrative an occasional western air - something that composer Carter Burwell highlights musically in several passages. The tension, by the way, is heightened not only by the fact that everyone has known each other forever (which makes every issue something personal in one way or another), but also because there is no way to avoid disaffection in such a tiny place. - and the proximity between the police station and the office of Red Welby (Jones), responsible for the billboards, is a complicating factor precisely because it does not allow someone like Dixon the time to control his impulses before acting.Martin McDonagh, by presenting provocations in dose, dealing with both the situational absurdity and the occasional triviality, ends up reminding us of the Coen Brothers, although the filmmaker has his signature and his own style. The most interesting thing, since, in many cases, the comic intertwines with the dramatic, is the non-annulment of any of the aspects. Both complement each other, reinforcing the joke, making it denser and meaningful, in addition to giving poignancy to the problems. McDonagh makes us laugh at the surreal, but he plays the necessary cards so that nothing is narratively gratuitous. A sequence shot in the middle of the projection, for example, sensationally executed, can make the audience laugh. The laughter, however, does not, at any moment, take away the weight of the scene and the meaning it has for the characters presented. The intention of the narrative construction is strengthened, showing nuances not previously presented, such as the size of the fury of a certain character in the face of a certain event. The tone cannot be qualified as perfect only because it fails in a single sequence, equally permeated by a playful musical sense, but distant from this one, without effectiveness. The substantial content of the moment is not fully absorbed by the viewer, although the turning element remains, and can be revisited under future optics to prove the functionality of the personal bows. The text, in another plan of approach, overflows, in this tragicomic mix, very sharp dialogues.The film's great differential lies in its inspired narrative choices, which move away from the commonplaces of crime films with tireless characters who seek justice. In McDonagh's script, tragedy does not inevitably lead to redemption, catharsis, and ultimate solutions. Here, tragedy is allied, in an unlikely but accurate way, to a caustic and foul-mouthed humor, coming from the ills and interiorities of a myriad of very interesting and Nietzschean characters; human, all too human.Anger may not be the most uplifting outlet, but it is often the most believable and dramatically interesting, something brilliantly explored through the obsession, pain and guilt of the rich character played by Frances McDormand in one of her best roles since Fargo (1996). Equally impactful are supporting characters such as Deputy Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), a reluctant Mildred ally who grapples with his own mortality while trying to see the best in his partner, racist police officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a ""comic"" antagonist with an unlikely - and controversial - dramatic arc.McDormand embraces the character with his usual vigor and wealth. Appearing on the scene for the first time in a reflection in the car's rearview mirror that exposes only her eyes, Mildred is already presented to the public almost as a mythical being - something that will be highlighted by the costume that changes little (reinforcing the iconic image) and by her presence. Spirit in the verbal duels he has with various opponents. In addition, the actress is not afraid to allow the protagonist to become unpleasant here and there, which can be seen in her interactions with James, who Peter Dinklage embodies as a man who constantly opens up to that woman even knowing he will get hurt. On the other hand - and McDormand's formidable talent is fundamental here - we soon realize how Mildred is capable of showing immense compassion, which suggests how her attitude towards the world was affected by the death of her daughter - and the scene in which the character goes from one expression of confrontation and defiance to another of pure pity as he converses with Willoughby at one point is testament to his brilliance.Of course, in this aspect, Woody Harrelson's charisma is also essential, leading the viewer to sympathize with the chief of police even knowing that, strictly speaking, he is the antagonist of our (anti-) heroine. Evoking dignity and sincerity even when arguing with Mildred, Willoughby is a fundamentally good man, which makes him also able to see kindness in the least expected places (as in Dixon, for example). Exhibiting surprisingly good humor in the face of impending death, the subject only allows his vulnerability and fear to surface when he is alone - and the entire sequence that culminates in a scene in the stable is deeply moving thanks to Harrelson's composition.Which brings us to Dixon: obviously racist and violent, he is without a shadow of a doubt a troubled man who should never carry a gun or a badge - and yet there is something about the character that prevents us from hating him as we would like. Part of this effect comes from Rockwell's characterization; part of its trajectory. Composed by the actor as an individual with often childish ways who constantly goes unresponsive to being laughed at by everyone around him, Dixon is a grown man who still lives with his mother, who seems unable to even discover his own badge and who has nausea as he goes along. See photos of a crime. Furthermore, his attitude towards Willoughby is almost one of adoration, as if he had projected into him the father figure he did not have and who was (barely) replaced by the mother (Martin, fantastic) who seems responsible for having made him prejudiced and violent, encouraging his worst traits and manipulating him into even more foolish actions (in Mrs. Dixon's defense, she seems to genuinely believe that she is acting for her son's good).The character's trajectory comes from the script, obviously, and is that of someone who realizes, even if thanks to constant beatings, he needs to improve as an individual - and it's no wonder that even when he sees the billboards for the first time, Dixon reads the ads in reverse, starting from the last to the first. It is not, however, a path of redemption, which is instrumental in discussing the feature: at the end (the rest of this text will contain spoilers), Dixon lost his ""father"", part of his face, his job and the certainty of his position in the world. World. This does not redeem or make you better; what we see in the epilogue is not a rehabilitated man, but a lost man who is trying to find ways to do what he thinks is right, but still clearly wrong (whether the duo will follow through with their plans is up to the viewer to decide). In other words, what Three Announcements does is suggest that we can change, not that we should face racists and other hate-mongers with love, compassion, or tolerance.Other movies would focus on how to solve the murder mystery and the killer's motivations, but the story, which was written by Martin McDonagh himself, isn't about that. It's about the aftermath of that crime and how it transformed every single person in the city. Because of this, we eventually manage to empathize with almost every character in one way or another and see the motivations behind every action. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, in short, thinks of pain as being treatable in a variety of ways. Just as a girl's life ended abruptly, without even having a chance to begin effectively, so many things in the world remain open.

A Masterpiece of the Blackest Comedy,"It isn't very often that you see a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbings, Missouri. Defying easy description, it treads a fine line between tragedy and the blackest of humor to tell a richly nuanced tale of mourning, vendettas, forgiveness, and small-town insanity.Most of the insanity comes from hard bitten single mother Mildred Hayes, who rents out the titular billboards to demand why the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her teenage daughter months after it occurred. This doesn't sit well with the local PD, or with the many townspeople who adore the long serving, easygoing Chief Willoughby. The tensions this generates drives the story, along with many ill thought out hijinks.
Our humble protagonist is not the most likeable of people. She's cynical, foul mouthed, possessed of an acidic wit, and not particularly concerned what anyone thinks of her. She's also never been the kind of woman to let decency, common, sense, or the law stop her from doing anything, which she demonstrates repeatedly. Yet on some level this is what makes her relatable. She's may be a complete B, but not an unfeeling one. And she has a very good reason for her pain and anger.When her anger fades and her dark wit fails her, we see that she is a woman deeply in mourning, with only the barest hope of closure. Particularly heartrending are the flashbacks to the bitter fights with her daughter, when she was still alive. It's amazing that she's able to carry on under the weight of such sorrow and guilt. She certainly hasn't chosen the healthiest outlets for her grief, but I suppose we all have our ways of coping. Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred is utterly brilliant, and I hope she takes all the awards she's been nominated for.Sam Rockwell is likewise a real firecracker as the drunken, brutally violent Officer Dixon, who is the closest thing this movie has to an antagonist. He is truly a sight to behold when he gets all riled up, his fists flying as he cusses up a storm. It's hard to believe that he hasn't ended up in his own jail long ago. But as with most people in this movie there may be more to him than first impressions would suggest.Woody Harrelson provides a sharp counterpoint to McDormand's acid wit and Rockwell's explosive violence as Chief Willoughby. Friendly and easy going even in tough times, his infectiously good-natured charm permeates the film long after his character has made his exit. His letters to Mildred and the other key players are filled with wisdom and humor, made funnier by the circumstances in which some of them are read. And oddly enough, they do more than anything else to drive personal growth and change in their recipients. It might even be enough to put Mildred on a slightly brighter path, though I wouldn't hold my breath.This is the kind of movie that frequently makes you laugh, then makes you feel bad for laughing. It's a testament to the director and writer's brilliance that the movie can find humor in material this bleak. Or it might say something about their mental state. Three Billboards is also the kind of movie that constantly subverts your expectations. Every time you think you know where the plot is going it suddenly reverses on you. Characters develop in ways you never would have imagined. The best bits of humor- and the deepest bits of pathos- frequently come without warning. And the ending is a stroke of genius. It's nothing you'd expect, but it's the perfect one for this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A gritty, engaging film with some moral intrigue","Humans are creatures that create value. One person may find throwing trash on the ground in a public place intolerable but have little problem treating an employee or co-worker as a means to their own advancement. Another may find fatherhood or motherhood their highest calling investing most of their life energy to the task but give little thought to being cruel to a server at a restaurant or a pet dog. Sometimes our values in one area of our lives seem entirely incongruous with the values we hold in another area and the incongruity can strike others as downright bizarre. This value incongruity is a theme in other writer/director Martin McDonagh's films but is a central focus in Three Billboards.The movie is about a distraught mother who works to ""focus the mind"" of what to her is a complacent police chief (played with vigor by Woody Harrelson) who has failed her. Mildred Hayes's (Frances McDormand) daughter has been raped and killed and after a year, no suspects have been arrested. In an act of desperation and anger, she pays to have two questions and a statement posted to three billboards near her home each implicating the Ebbing police department and it's chief of police in particular for inaction and perhaps incompetence. The billboards polarize the town and turn over rocks, as it were, causing all sorts of nefarious and violent things to crawl to the surface. McDonagh deals with themes of abuse, intolerance, bias, authority, revenge, and despair and while these certainly are present throughout the film, I never felt the film was really about these themes. Rather, these form the backdrop for a more dominant theme: the cognitive biases and dissonance we exhibit as humans that give our lives an incongruity about what we value and how we express those values.Mildred clearly is a mother experiencing despair and tremendous anger about her loss. And rightly so. A victim of an abusive husband who she divorced, Mildred works as a clerk in a trinket store trying to raise two kids on a meager wage. These circumstances certainly would be grounds for bitterness and anger though don't really explain the degree to which Mildred seems to possess them. Then in a single flashback we see Mildred's harshness and anger present in a conversation she has with her son and daughter ostensibly on the day her daughter is killed. ""I hope I get raped on the way!"" her daughter Angela (Kathryn Newton) screams after Mildred refuses to let her take the only family vehicle forcing her to walk to an undisclosed location. ""I hope you get raped on the way too!"" Mildred screams back as Angela walks out the door. This is not something we imagine even an angry mother would say on her worst day. She's vindictive, angry, and immature and yet at the same time, tough, determined and passionate. This is a woman we both deeply admire and pity. We want her to win yet we agonize over her loneliness and rage.(Incidentally, I asked an Irish friend of mine to give me feedback on this review. His comment after on the above paragraph is insightful. He said, ""Ireland is full of hard/harsh loving mothers. The mother is also the center of Irish society and we would all believe in the unlimited tenacity of these crazy, ragged characters."" This illustrated to me a deeper dichotomy in a character like Mildred than a simple caricature can and should portray and it's a helpful call out. The line between hard and tough or between obsessive and passionate can truly be thin and partly in the eye of the beholder.)McDonagh then presents a woman who values finding her daughter's killer at any cost. There is a shadow cast over her determination and mental and physical toughness: she thinks very little of being cruel to almost everyone, causing emotional and psychological harm to her son, endangering lives, damaging property, and becoming truly isolated even from those who wish to help and love her all for this single goal. Few have experienced loss of the type Mildred has experienced and while we might imagine the rage we would feel, it's not possible to know it truly. Mildred's dissonance is extreme and perhaps for good reason. But we all possess this type of incongruity. The result is the good that may come from upholding the single value becomes offset by the abuse of all other values.This is illustrated through the lives of principle characters in the film. Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) gives very little thought to physically assaulting a citizen or verbally assaulting people of a different color (or size) in his duty to protect and serve the population of Ebbing. In a state of despair over the loss of a somewhat noble colleague, he says to himself ""I know that the best thing, the only thing, to honor that man's memory right now, is to go to work; is to be a good cop. To walk in his shoes and do what he did every day of his life. Help people."" He says this just before he walks out of the police department, proceeds across the street to beat up a completely innocent citizen and throw him out of a two-story window in a rage. In the scene that follows, he is shown bragging to other officers of his act as if he believes the act itself was an example of ""being a good cop;"" of ""helping people."" He has an extreme form of cognitive dissonance where the singular value of destroying those who he deems unworthy of his colleague's memory comes at the cost of actually protecting and serving those he vowed to protect and serve. The incongruity is at the same time humorous, shocking, and bizarre and we're made to feel it.McDonagh, though born in England, is a child of blue-collar, Irish parents who left Ireland to look for work and gave birth to Martin shortly after the start of the recent 30-year clash that pitted the Nationalists against the Unionists. While McDonagh himself most likely would not have experienced the conflict in Ireland directly, he no doubt would have felt the effects of The Troubles through his parents and frequent visits to his home country. A dual citizen of Ireland and England, it seems his heart belongs to Ireland. Many of his plays are set in Ireland and it appears he even took an artistic stand related to the effects of the conflict (read more about this in his biography here). I raise this only because I suspect that McDonagh's focus in this movie may partially be influenced (consciously or unconsciously) by hostilities that occurred in his home country during his formative years. The ideas that fuel conflicts like these are supposedly focused on making life better for the people involved but, in the process, tear those same lives apart. The focus on achieving an end regardless of the cost runs the risk of destroying the people who would benefit from the outcome. This is incongruous-as incongruous as the behavior of the principle characters in Three Billboards. (Of course, McDonagh wouldn't have to return to his Irish roots to easily find such incongruity. The country in which he now lives and works exhibit similar pathologies.)A scene in the movie might lend credence to my suspicions. Mildred returns home one day to find a Catholic priest sitting at her kitchen table talking to her son. The priest tries to tell Mildred that while the town is with her in her desire to find her daughter's killer, they are against her posting the billboards. Mildred's response is indicative of this meta-narrative I'm claiming exists in the movie.The movie isn't perfect. Some things happen too quickly. Dixon is beyond doubt a cruel and bigoted man. These are not surface qualities but deep-seated, ingrained character flaws. Towards the end of the film he appears to become virtuous in an instant based on a single word from the chief. Granted, Dixon is portrayed as simple but even (especially?) in the simple, character flaws take time to undo and Dixon's transformation doesn't fit the general narrative the film is trying to get us to believe. Typical of modern films, there are no true heroes. But Three Billboards goes further. Ebbing Missouri is depicted as a town full of complacency and inaction. Severe violence happens in the open street at mid-day and no one steps in to help or even seems to care. This is a bit much even for those steeped in cynicism about red states.Despite these minor flaws, the film is well made. It grinds some axes but not to the point of excess. This is a film that takes no sides and so ends up being a mirror into which we all can look and find ourselves even among the excess (I'm reminded here of Flannery O'Connor's phrase, ""To the deaf you shout, and to the almost blind you draw large, startling figures.""). It has the texture of Cohen brother's film--particularly No Country for Old Men and while it may not have quite the technical excellence in terms of pacing and direction, it's close enough to warrant the accolades its received.A couple of people have asked me about the ending. I'm not quite sure what to say. It seems to run tangential to the rest of the film. We seem to be looking at a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" moment but then Mildred raises an ethical question that casts doubt that this is what we're actually witnessing. Perhaps this is McDonagh's final play at incongruity. Or maybe it's a lot simpler than that. Maybe it's just a sign of hope that things can be better if we just stop, think, and talk. Yes, let's go with that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An emotionally stirring masterpiece,"I have to get this out of the way first; Three Billboards was robbed of the best film Oscar.I watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri around the time it was released and it still sticks with me until this day. Frances McDormand electrifies every frame she's in, but that doesn't take away from the phenomenal performances of the rest of the cast. There isn't a dull moment throughout, and the film seamlessly has you laughing one moment and crying the next without ever feeling contrived. It's an emotional roller coaster for sure, but it's absolutely worth the ride.It's hard to explain why Three Billboards is such an amazing film, it has an incredible story to tell that's unique but touches on themes we can all understand and empathize with. It's also a very well made film; Martin McDonagh continues to improve with each of his entries, it's easy to make a film like this and not really try to hard to make it visually interesting and let the story do all the work, but there's enough style in Three Billboards for those who appreciate good filmmaking to understand the effort behind it, but it never gets distracting or goes over the top.Three Billboards is a modern masterpiece, it's storytelling at its finest, I guarantee it'll have you in tears, and that you'll never forget it when you're finished.

An amazing character study of grief in a small Mid-Western town,"My favorite film of 2008 was ""In Bruges"", the directing debut of Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, and now McDonagh furthers his art with his third film, ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"", a sort of dark comic crime film that is really a complex character study of a disgruntled mother upset at a town's failure to solve the murder of her teenage daughter to the point she rents three billboards outside the town to call attention to the unsolved murder. Frances McDormand plays the grieving divorced mother, Mildred Hayes, in a performance that might even surpass her Oscar-winning role in the Coen Brothers' 1996 ""Fargo"". She's cynical, angry at the core, street-smart while flawed, and her inner journey is rightly the film's main focus. But she isn't the only character sketch that fascinates in this film. Two other characters display important moral arcs: the town sheriff Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson, surprisingly the most likeable) and, most significantly, Officer Dixon (a career best performance by Sam Rockwell that seems the film's most memorable).The movie's brilliant wit and marvelous interactive dialogue is matched by McDonagh's handling of the actors and control of the visual style, while keeping the humanity of the characters at the forefront as he deftly manages to circumvent the clich√©s always found in these kind of movies. Highly recommended as a remarkably composed portrait of small town America, it sends viewers out of the theater to contemplate moral questions concerning justice, revenge, anger and forgiveness. It is one of the year's most entertaining movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Masterclass in acting that is only dragged down by underwhelming writing,"Anger has been a problem America has been dealing with the last couple of years. Whether it be political or social, everyone has felt angry about the current state of our nation. Here to shed more light on that topic is Martin McDonagh, writer, and director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh uses his Irish background and dark comedy writing skills to make a film that is both deadly serious and brutally funny. You may find yourself both laughing and crying in this tale of revenge and forgiveness.Just as you would expect, the film is set in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri. About a year ago, teenager Angela Hayes was raped and murdered. Her case has remained unsolved, much to the dismay of her mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Since none of her previous attempts have worked, Mildred decides the best way to call out the police and express her anger is to rent three billboards outside of town (get the title now?). This action quickly captures the attention of the beloved local police chief, Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). What starts out as a small squabble begins to explode into more violent and personal acts between Mildred and the rest of the town. Along for the ride as support are Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges, and Caleb Landry Jones.McDonagh's film boasts a mega-talented cast that is able to play both sides of the duality between good and evil. He gives all his characters range and memorable traits to keep them interesting to watch. He also perfectly balances the comedy and drama elements within his characters as well. We get to see their rage, but also their compassion. It's a fitting balance for a subject that doesn't have clear areas of right and wrong.The key part of McDonagh's script is how relatable it is to present day America. The anger each character has are like a symbol for each of us as we battle with the injustices going on in the real world. McDonagh doesn't give us an answer for how to cure our rage but gives us a story so we can see how violence makes everything worse.Surprisingly, one of the only weak parts of the film is McDonagh's script. It's a good script, but it also has some very clear problems throughout. One of those is some on-the-nose dialogue that feels out of place. He also lets the film get too out of hand and over the top by the end. Events escalate and occur almost too quickly and with little support to warrant their excessiveness.Cinematographer Ben Davis does a fine job working his camera through the small town of Ebbing. He gives us a city tour while also highlighting the characters that inhabit it. One expert sequence he pulls off is a continuous shot of Sam Rockwell's character breaking down a glass door, walking upstairs into an office, throwing a guy out the window, and then leaving the office while breaking another glass door.This film and The Shape of Water are in a tight race for the honor of being the best cast of 2017. Frances McDormand delivers an awards capturing performance as a tough mother that has been forced to go to extremes just so she can get the answers she deserves. It's her best role since Fargo and it perfectly plays to her strengths as an actress. She can mix vengeance, snarkiness, and compassion all in the same scene. It's a role only she could play.Sam Rockwell seriously steps us his game to deliver an amazing supporting performance as Dixon, the understudy to Willoughby. Dixon is not like most police officers, he's racist, misogynistic, and just plain mean. Rockwell masterfully blends his comedic skills with intense drama to make his character complex and compelling. He's largely been seen as ""that"" guy in most films, but after this film, people will know and appreciate the talents of Sam Rockwell.Woody Harrelson gives us his usual country charm with his character Willoughby. It's a character we've seen him play before, but it's a character he knows how to play.Rounding out the excellent supporting cast is Caleb Landry Jones, who is enjoying a marvelous 2017, and Lucas Hedges, who is also having a really good year. They both do well and aren't completely overshadowed by the leads in their limited roles.After watching the film, the main idea that makes this film work is the balance. Everybody uses it very well, whether it be McDonagh with his pretty good script or the actors with their masterful performances. As both an entertaining ride and eye-opening experience, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the better films to come out this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brilliant Francis McDormand all the way...,"As soon as Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri got the best picture and best actress Golden Globe I saw it.I had heard of the story line of the movie - A girl is raped and there are no arrests, the mother takes it in her own hands to do something about it.
I was expecting a usual rape revenge drama.But this gem is packed with much unexpected script delivered with unusual character developments and flow of events - ending in a climax that leaves us - what next?Francis McDarmond is one of my favorite actress of Hollywood. Strong, deep into the character and rarely misses a note of acting. She is brilliant as an eccentric mother and a lone ranger fighter. Her pesona reflects so much anger and grit that one feels that nothing will ever stop her.Within a town run by corrupt police to business as usual people, with eye-balling media awaiting a sensational news-story - this movie is packed with easy going overview of such events that unnerve and harass normal lives prevalent commonly in small towns all over the world.The director Martin McDonagh had seen bill-boards of unsolved crime on one of his trips that gave him the story idea and casting of Francis was kept in mind while writing this fictional story and script of the movie.There are small sub-plots in the movie with extremely well developed characters that are thrown at the audience unpredictably. Some you hate, some you love, and some of them makes you change your perspective from hate to like.A string of small anecdotal comic stream is added to bring relief in otherwise swearing overtones of abuses spoken throughout the movie.I would also point out that there are many obvious flaws and potholes in the narration, that can be overlooked.Francis McDormand brings to life a quirky character filled with remorse, tragedy with grit to fight every road-block she faces. Brilliantly portrayed.The background score of a few country tracks are very pleasing and ear-catching tunes.This movie has already collected more than 50 awards and nominated for more than 150 worldwide.

Fair story that lost it by going all liberal.,"How in the world did this get any Oscar attention??? The story line was so bland that the dry comedic effort of the writers was the only thing that made it worth watching all the way through. So the above board story line is that a mother is angry and distraught at the lack of effort being made towards finding the killer of her daughter. She pays for some billboards towards that effect. The billboards cause a lot of friction in the small town in southern Missouri where she lives. And around and around it swirls.... For nearly TWO HOURS!Now here is the story that Hollywood really wants to tell you. Everyone who lives in small town Midwestern towns is dumb, alcoholic, and incredibly dysfunctional. Well everyone is provided that their white. If you live in a small Midwestern town and you're black, well then you're a well balanced, hard working , decent person with good common sense.Of the 50 or so characters seen in the movie, I recall three were black. They were the only characters that exhibited any intelligence, decency and good common sense. Every single adult character that I recall otherwise was portrayed as having at least one version of a serious flaw in their character. They of course were white.I hear the lead actress got up on stage at the Oscars and went political. I find that funny given that her character was probably the most flawed in the movie. Her character was unreasonable, angry, violent, and generally unloving.

Martin McDonagh's direction here is outstanding and Oscar-worthy (tho he didn't get one). It's been a while since I watched a film where all the actors fit in so well on screen. You unwittingly put yourself in the character's shoes and try to make correct decisions for them. It doesn't feel like watching a film during my two-hour pleasant watching experience, it feels like I'm actually going through these events in real life. We truly care about what happened to these characters.""All this anger, man, it only begets greater anger."" When it comes to acting, few guys do better than Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Their portrayal of ""anger ""are sublimely phenomenal. You can clearly see the emotion in their eyes, in their facial expressions, in their dialogues. They totally deserve their Oscar awards. And don't forget the talented Woody Harrelson, he does a great job as well. I'm glad he got a nomination at least.Here's an interesting fact : both McDormand and Rockwell seems to be filled with anger inside their body, while Harrelson is the one with much less anger and appears to be more reasonable. However, Harrelson's character (Bill Willoughby) is the only guy that dies in the film (besides McDormand's daughter). Well, I find it very sarcastic.To sum up, this is a film where plenty of brilliance is demonstrated in every single minute. You can predict how the plot is going to develop.

Finally, now we have Mr McDonagh place that advertising vehicle on the front and centre, showing both its potency and frailty.Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred Hayes, a grieving mother of a rape-murder victim whose case has hit the doldrums, encapsulates what McDonagh wishes to express in his commentary and nails it right from the start where we see the mother's exasperation after having pulled over the side of the road and her contemplation upon seeing the unused, dilapidated billboard which leads her to the light-bulb moment that steamrolled over a sleepy town in Southern USA.

"Sadness, laughter and suprises","I summarise this film as a challenging black comedy that is well worth a watch with some excellent performances.
How did it make me feel? Surprised, sad and I chuckled a lot too. I felt very protective of my daughter afterwards and more empathetic towards people.
How strongly do I recommend this? A rewarding but not an easy watch. Nothing that makes me want to watch it twice.
In my opinion this is a great standout film as it is suitably different to many other films I like and stirred some emotions in me.

A Raw Tale of Anger and Redemption,"In Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Martin McDonagh crafts a tale where justice isn't served with a silver platter but is rather sought out amidst the ashes of grief and resentment. The film's narrative threads weave through the desolate landscapes of Ebbing, Missouri, painting a portrait of a community plagued by unresolved anger and festering wounds. Through the bold act of a grieving mother, Mildred Hayes, who erects three billboards questioning the inaction of the local police in her daughter's murder case, the film delves into the complexities of vengeance, redemption, and the blurred lines between right and wrong.The characters in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are as flawed and multifaceted as the shadows cast by those billboards. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse performance as Mildred, a grieving mother fueled by righteous anger. Her journey serves as a stark reminder of the lengths a person will go to in the pursuit of justice, even if it means sacrificing their own sanity. Woody Harrelson shines as Chief Willoughby, a man torn between his duty to uphold the law and his compassion for Mildred's plight. And then there's Sam Rockwell as Officer Dixon, a complex figure whose journey from bigotry to redemption is both harrowing and deeply moving.With McDonagh's keen eye for detail, the film's every frame is infused with rich symbolism and emotional depth. From the sprawling landscapes of rural Missouri to the cramped interiors of the police station, each setting serves as a reflection of the characters' inner turmoil and moral ambiguity. And the billboards themselves, with their bold, confrontational messages, serve as a powerful metaphor for the characters' quest for truth and accountability.In the end, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is more than just a film - it's a searing portrait of a community grappling with its own demons, a reminder that the road to redemption is often fraught with pain and uncertainty. With its powerful performances, gripping storytelling, and hauntingly beautiful imagery, it's a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, challenging us to confront the darkness within ourselves and strive for a better world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very honest and brutal,"In many ways, this film is about hate. But it's brutally honest, heartfelt and emotional.Francis McDormand and Sam Rockwell both nail this role. These are the roles they are both meant to play. Sam starts off playing a redneck hick police officer who doesn't hide his racist feelings in any way. But as time progresses, we see a change inside of him. Francis, on the hatred a mother feels towards the helplessness of the death of her child. What I really liked about this film is you never quite knew where this was going. It clearly steers you in various directions. While I love Peter Dinklage and he delivers a fine performance as always, I thought there were scenes such as the ""dinner scene"" that didn't really push the story forward and could have been edited out. But overall this film deserves all the praise it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An acting masterclass from a flawed script,"An acting masterclass from a flawed script.Like Blue Jasmine a few years ago (and as I correctly predicted then for that film in my imdb review), Three Billboards is an acting masterclass which deserves to win most of the acting Oscars soon in 2018.This film also once again illustrates the strange, improbable fact that - incredibly - the rarest contemporary commodity in Hollywood is the simplest and most basic one, you would think: a scripted story which makes a worthwhile statement and wraps up nicely and convincingly at the end.While we can go along with the proposed Dirty Harry Redneck philosophy up to a point, and enjoy the general redemption towards the end, the final scene crazily seems to have been adlibbed after the writer died suddenly before considering his options for it.It would behove anyone studying to be a contemporary scriptwriter to sit down and have a look at The Third Man and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to name just two masterpieces, to see how an ending is done.Pity one should have to point such obviousness out, when so much else in this film - and certainly the several principal performances - is so memorably good and they will land Oscars tonight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A dark drama with heavy feelings,"After 2-3 first scenes, I though the movie is simply a battle between 2 sides, the hopeless citizen versus the useless people of power. But it turned out to be so much more.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark drama on human's emotions and compassion. Through various bold plot points, it successfully tells the story and the entanglement of people's emotions as they seek to revenge, to exact justice, to win a divorce, to find love, to protect your loved ones, to demonstrate camaraderie, or simply just to do something good in life. Everyone has their own story, and most are not purely good or evil.Through the characters' problems, the movie delivers the message of compassion. The characters make a lot of misdeeds, but the intention is not for us to judge, but to understand and sympathise with their unresolved frustration. We can all see ourselves in some part of the struggle, and the movie makes us wonder:""What would I do if it happened to me?""Beside the strong plot, the message is achieved by excellent acting.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri Review,"When the police give up their investigation of the rape and murder of a young girl, her mother challenges the police by placing three billboards just outside of town calling for action.This is a film that I had never even remotely heard of until today, which is why I decided to watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find an amazing film.The two things that I love most about this film are the setting and the characters. This film takes place in a small town and for a film that was released in 2017 the dialogue consists of a lot of risky things, things that most people are scared to say. But that's whats so great about it, they go for it and don't hold back so you get these very open characters that don't care what they say and it makes for some extremely good scenes.The lead character Mildred played by Frances McDormand is this foul mouthed, broken but fearless mother, that doesn't take smack from anyone. Frances is phenomenal as this character and gives one of the best performances I've seen in a more modern film. Woodie Harrelson and Sam Rockwell are also extremely good in their respective roles. Although he wasn't in it much I enjoyed the scenes involving Peter Dinklages character, made for some hilarious moments.Martin McDonagh the writer and director is incredible, he sets up this town extremely well and gives us some great cinematography along with it.The film is also unpredictable, I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen next but was very surprised when what happened wasn't what I expected.If you are a legitimate movie fan you will enjoy this film. The way it dives into the setting and the characters is extremely well done and entertaining. If you are looking for more of a action filled fun ride I'd probably skip this one.My one gripe with the film is the ending. I was extremely invested in Mildred and when the film ended although I don't think it's a bad ending, I was hoping for something a little more neat. I wish they could've given us just one more scene to rap it up just a little better. But all in all an incredible film.9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Based on harsh reality,"This may come as a shock for some of you, but the world is a f'd up place. It makes sense that some characters weren't ""good people"" because that's the harsh truth of reality, its not all black and white, a small example being Woody Harrelson, as Chief Willoughby, brings depth and humanity to a character who initially appears to be an antagonist. Sam Rockwell, playing Officer Dixon, goes through a profound transformation throughout the film, and his portrayal of a deeply flawed man seeking redemption is both moving and memorable.Nobody's all good, nobody, but that doesn't mean you don't have a choice to make a change in your life and do the right thing and this film captures that perfectly.I'll finish by saying that ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is not a film that shies away from addressing difficult societal issues, including racism, violence, and the abuse of power. Instead, it confronts these issues head-on, challenging the audience to reflect on them long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great performances in a movie that could - and should - have been so much better.,"My obsession with Frances McDormand quite frankly knows no bounds. I first saw her in ""Raising Arizona"" and followed her through Coen Brothers (and other) movies - mostly terrific and some not-quite-so-good. My obsession with Sam Rockwell is equally obsessive. He is quite possibly my favorite 'not famous' actor working today. I saw the trailer for ""Three Billboards..."" many, many months ago, saw both names and faces and thought ""this is a film I MUST see."" But living in an area surrounded by 'Giving You Only the Latest Block-Buster"" Cineplexes, it came and went in literally one week and I never got the chance. After having seen McDormand AND Rockwell win Oscars for their roles last night I bought the DVD today, thinking ""I WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE."" But I can't say I did. The performances I did love - especially McDormand's. It ranged from explosive rage to intense sorrow, darkly funny sarcasm to obsessive neurosis, self-destructive insecurity to absolutely crippling guilt, tender, matronly moments to ""you gonna F with me??"" bravado . No spoilers, but she absolutely EARNED that Oscar last night. Rockwell did too. My only problem with the film as a whole is the writing. The story itself was gripping, moving, and (again, at times) darkly funny. Having said that, plot holes abound. Watch it, and you'll see what I mean. Also is my issue with the ""terrible characters ultimately very quickly reformed and redeemed without consequence."" IT'S A WORK OF FICTION, I keep telling myself. But the incredibly serious subject matter of the film doesn't really lend itself to that sort of suspension of disbelief one would take into, say, a Science Fiction movie or the latest Marvel blockbuster. In short, it's a good film featuring some incredible acting (a HUGE shout out to Woody Harrelson, showing range I've never seen from him in ANY movie) that has some serious yet, in hindsight, fixable plot holes and ""whaaaat?"" moments. Then again, it's ""just a movie."" But don't let my opinion sway you from watching it on cable.

"""Anger begets anger""","The first half-hour or so vacillates somewhat, going around in apparent circles, but TBOEM delivers quite well in the end. This film is everything a noir comedy should be. It's satirical of many things: love, marriage, family, small town life, small town cops and police-in-general, life and mortality, younger people, and older people. Though, like most noir films, TBOEM is VERY profane, gritty, and violent, a subtle compassion and a definite moral ultimately comes through, and it avoids the pitfall of simply being tasteless for the sake of being tasteless. Fine acting by just about the entire cast, with special kudos going to Frances McDormand and Caleb Jones. Fittingly ironic soundtrack too. The one or two brief scenes which digress from the steady dark humor of the rest of the film are well-done and effective, as is the beautiful scenery and cinematography. Finally, it's extremely gripping, always making you wonder what will happen next, with many surprises.Some of the more critical reviews have noted the various plot-holes in this film, which cannot be denied, but hey, it's comedy, which allows for more than the usual suspension of disbelief.

"2 Oscar winning worthy performances, writing completely flawed","I've been wanting to watch this movie for so long and finally watched it. Frances McDormand one of the best actresses in the history of Hollywood, Sam Rockwell is a gem of an actor as well as Woody Harrelson. So there's no way a film can go south with such a stellar castI've read some of the complaints and frustrations despite the good reviews and the outstanding performances. Actors did their best 10/10.The biggest problem for me was McDonagh's writing.It's just parts of the script that I think needed to be different. Like toning down the swearing to 50% less, its excessive, unnecessary and detracts from the films plot.Dixon should've been portrayed as a man with a good family who went through deep suffering that made him want to redeem himself(but completely different to the movie).Willoughby's story to a simple normal family man who's a Police Chief Officer and ends up moving to another city.Mildred's last words to her daughter and the whole interaction. The vulgarity towards the priest. Just a bit more of a caring person but that same tough personality.Things in the film end up being exaggerated, characters cartoonish, and just some things not being believable.This film could've easily been one of the best films ever made, waste of talent, waste of story. I'm disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Talented McDonagh almost gets the balance right,"It's already been a decade since Martin McDonagh established himself as one of the most talented crime writers in the movie business with the brilliant In Bruges. After crossing the Atlantic to make Seven Psychopaths in 2012, he now turns his attention to American small-town life for a scrutiny of vindictiveness and small-town idiocy, all bathed in McDonagh's recognizable black comedy. Frances McDormand plays a bereaved mother who, frustrated by the lack of progress in the investigation of her daughter's rape and murder, puts up three roadside billboards outside of town in order to voice her dissatisfaction. This is the starting point for the erratic and at times ill-focused but never boring story McDonagh has concocted here, filled with all sorts of characters bumping into each other in every thinkable way - and almost always with animosity as a result. McDonagh wants his film to work on both a dramatic and a comedic level, constantly spiced up by his social criticism of uneducated small-town America, and he almost gets that balance right. At its best, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is refreshingly sharp and creative. At its worst it feels like something Quentin Tarantino could have made during the peak of his revenge-fantasy phase. Sam Rockwell gives the best of many hilarious performances, most of which ridicule some very base human characteristics that we all can find ourselves in touch with from time to time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

This movie is dark, sad, and violent. Lots of profanity and prejudice in this hick town suffering from the violent murder of the local teen.

"Melancholic, nostalgic, dramatic and tense, this film was very well made and has high level actors, in a work of quality and merit.","This is an undoubtedly tense film, in which the story of an unsolved murder serves as the backdrop for a much deeper and more elaborate drama, in which the victim's inconsolable mother seeks, by all means, to force the police to seriously investigate what happened to his daughter. It's not the first film where the police are seen as villains, but it's far from being a lighthearted film, with friendly heroes and execrable villains. The film strives to create and highlight the nuances of the plot and each of the characters.I remember perfectly that this film was one of the heavyweights of the 2018 Oscars, and one of the great candidates for the Oscar for Best Picture. It didn't win the statuette, nor a good part of the nominations received, but it left the Dolby Theater with two awards in important categories: Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor. Personally, I believe that the film would also have been a fair deserving of the award for Best Original Screenplay, since the differential of the film, for me, is to give us a script with an elegant and well done story, with drama and depth, and in that each character deserved a close look and an interesting development. The biggest problem with this incredible script turns out to be, in fact, the open ending and the feeling that it doesn't give the audience the conclusion they expect to see. It's not about wanting a happy ending... it's just about wanting an end point and not just ellipses.In the wake of the story of the unsolved crime and the billboards, we observe the tense relationship and mutual misunderstandings between mother and daughter, and the way that mother feels remorse for the way she acted with her murdered daughter. We see how the police want to act, but they can't for lack of evidence, for being forced to follow the law and not being able to simply arrest everything and everyone or treat each one as a suspect. We see how honest and potentially good men can be lost if they do not have an opportunity to improve their conduct, and how there are indeed people who are committed to their work, despite the criticism they receive. And we see how, at times, the voice of the people can be more caustic and unfair than any other.Martin McDonagh is a new director, who many didn't know well before this film. I had seen one of his films before, ""Bruges"", and he really improved a lot, not only as a director, but even as a screenwriter. Frances McDormand presents us a complete, intense, committed and powerful performance, which holds us from beginning to the end. Needless to say, it was probably her life's greatest work, and that it would be an injustice of titanic proportions not to reward it fairly, as it did. But she doesn't carry the film alone: Woody Harrelson is also very good here, in a difficult character that gives the film an added density. He also gave us, in this film, the best of himself. But even more powerful and intense is the work of Sam Rockwell, an actor I've never seen work at this level, and who was truly impressive in the way he grabbed the character and gave it body and density. The film also has satisfactory collaborations with Peter Dinklage (an actor who was not always treated well in the films he was in, despite being very good at what he does) and Caleb Jones.Technically, the film is truly a quality parade. Let's start by looking at its elegant cinematography. With an exquisite work of filming and very well executed, the film has excellent colors, sharpness, framing and makes the best use of the beautiful filming locations where it was made. I especially enjoyed some shots at dusk, where the sunlight gives the scene a poignant nostalgia. The editing was equally well done, and the cuts are not even felt. The sets were very well done and are full of details, and I would highlight the police station or the store where Mildred works. Finally, we have to talk about the soundtrack, sad and introspective, signed by Carter Burwell, and the wise inclusion of the song ""Last Rose of Summer"" by the incredible voice of Renee Fleming, the icing on the cake in those opening scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Complex and Beautiful,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an absolutely fantastic film and is definitely worth viewing at least once. It's a movie that really simply defies any attempt to classify it by genre; it possesses elements of drama, dark comedy and tragedy, to say the least.Fundamentally, the film excels as a study of human emotional nuance; there are really no ""bad guys"" or ""good guys,"" at least not within the group of main characters that the film focuses on.Three Billboards asks more questions than it answers, but without passing judgement on the characters themselves as they struggle to find the path, and themselves, against the backdrop of small-town apathy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Nasty and Ugly,"If this movie is considered not only to be entertainment but a work of art worthy of cinematic awards and an endorsement of Hollywood's encouragement for more like it to be produced then it's a sad day for the industry. I found it to be nasty, ugly piece of work that sets out to portray men in the foulest light possible for no better reason than to play to the current drumbeat of every social movement wanting to distance itself from Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump.I can only guess the claim to being a 'comedy' albeit a black comedy, is to justify a certain degree of satire in stereotyping the white guys as racist, mysogenists on the defensive against the unexpected attack of the movie's downtrodden feminist principle character.The fact is, ordinary people do not act or talk the way these characters do. The dialog is devoted to extreme expletives raging on in hate for each other and proving and achieving nothing in the process. Ironically the result is extremely racially offensive and sexist and even manages to be debasing to dwarfs; and for this trash they award oscars?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A wild, mostly improbable but highly entertaining ride","Martin McDonagh's (""Seven Psychopaths"") Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a mix of black (and politically incorrect) comedy and heartfelt drama that takes us on a wild, mostly improbable but highly entertaining ride. Set in the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Frances McDormand (""Hail, Caesar!""), who carries the film in one of her best roles, is the recently-divorced Mildred Hayes, a feisty, angry, depressed, but very determined woman with a warrior mentality who lost her daughter Angela only seven months ago in a rape and murder that still has not been solved.To make things worse, her abusive husband Charlie (John Hawkes, ""Everest"") has left her for a dim nineteen-year-old zoo attendant, and her son Robbie (Lucas Hedges, ""Manchester by the Sea"") just wants to forget the past and get on with his life. Instead of carrying placards and marching in front of the police station the way many people might protest, Mildred catches sight of three dilapidated billboards along an old highway leading into town that have not been used since Superman peanut butter was all the rage. With the help of Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones, ""The Florida Project"") who runs the local advertising agency, she rents the billboards and plasters signs on them in flaming red that carry the messages: : ""Raped While Dying"", ""And Still No Arrests"", ""How Come Chief Willoughby?"" Her stated purpose is ""to concentrate the mind, some.""The Willoughby referred to is Ebbing's Police Chief played by Woody Harrelson (""War for the Planet of the Apes"") who masks a soft heart with a veneer of toughness. Willoughby, who suffers from advanced cancer, takes the opportunity to visit Mildred and take her through what has actually been done on the case. Bottom line, the police are doing everything they can but there are no suspects and nothing has been learned from the DNA evidence. The ensuing media circus, however, brings out the worst in people, many who come to the chief's defense, especially police deputy Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell, ""The Way Way Back""), an unabashed white racist who lives with his overbearing mother (Sandy Martin).Mildred behaves irrationally in her single-minded quest for justice/revenge, at one point tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station and kicking high schoolers in the groin (neither of which resulted in any punishment), yet Dixon's over-the-top antics top hers tenfold. In one scene, he leaves his desk to go to the ad agency across the street to exact vengeance on the unsuspecting Red. There is also tons of snarky dialogue and condescending put-downs, some clever, others not so much, but McDonagh can see the good in people and works to make that available to the viewer.At a key moment, the characters recognize each other, not as protagonists in the midst of battle, but as human beings and the film becomes more about the complexities of the human condition than the eccentricities of its colorful characters. Willoughby is as frustrated as Mildred by the lack of results in Angela's death but tries to camouflage it with reassuring talk. On her part, Mildred comforts Willoughby when he coughs up blood that splatters in her face, and the vengeance that is eating away at her is, at least momentarily, replaced by compassion.Even Dixon shows character growth after a violent outburst separates him from his job. While not much of what happens in the film can be confused with reality, what is real is the residue of decency present in even the most hard-edged characters. What is also real, unfortunately, is the not too startling revelation of how the prevailing police culture often results in violence against women going unpunished.

Plain simple : go see this brilliant movie !,"""Raped while Dying.
Still no arrests.
How come, chief Willoughby?""Those who read my writing attempts occasionally, know that I thoroughly hate everything that has the appearance of a serial or when prequels and sequels are being produced just to exploit the story even further. So, don't panic while reading the following statement. I hope they'll come up with a sequel to ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". A continuation of this brilliant story where we'll learn how Mildred (Frances McDormand) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) handle the case. I am sure that this film will be difficult to surpass in its genre. And not because of some amazing special effects or action-packed film sequences. But because of the ingenious story and the unparalleled acting. And even though the story is filled with ultra-serious issues such as discrimination, domestic violence, cancer, sexual abuse and murder, there's also a subtle comic layer that is saturated with blackened humor and finished with cynical and ironic elements. This is so up my alley.""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is about anger, rage and helplessness. The anger about an unsolved case with Angela, the daughter of Mildred, being raped and burned alive by one or more unknowns. And after several months Mildred has come up with the bright idea to denounce the failure of the judicial investigation. And this by unabashedly spreading the message about it, on three billboards with Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) as main target, solely because of his leading position as Chief. But it's not only anger and revenge you'll be witnessing in this magnificent film. Forgiveness is also included. Like the moment during a police interrogation in which Mildred feels genuinely concerned about Willoughby's health. I was also surprised when Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), the owner of the advertising billboards, offers Dixon a glass of orange juice. Two moments in which blind anger made room for compassion.Even though Woody's name is written on the billboard in huge letters, his contribution isn't really decisive. To my surprise, he also gets out of the picture halfway through the film. In the first place it's Frances McDormand who demands the most attention. And she does that in a stunning way. A bitter woman who's tired of waiting for an arrest. Mildred is under the assumption that no effort is made by the corps to follow any clue or performs real police work. In her eyes, the police officers are a group of racist dipshits who spend their days harassing Afro-American fellow citizens. She's a tough lady who firmly tackles those who get in her way, both verbally and physically. And she spares nobody. Whether it's a priest or a dentist. She isn't even afraid to kick some young students in their crotch. And even though she appears to be an unpleasant person with a sharp tongue, she manages to arouse your sympathy. The sometimes dry, humorous remarks take care of that. Frances McDormand may rightfully become the owner of the coveted statue during the Academy Awards in a few months' time.And such a golden statue can also be reserved for Sam Rockwell. His acting is simply magisterial. Dixon is an aggressive hillybilly who likes to beat up minorities and appears to be drunk constantly while doing his job as a policeman, knowing it's tolerated by his superior. A not so quite intellectual overweight man. And Dixon's stupidity sometimes creates comical situations. And finally there's Woody Harrelson. An actor after my own heart (whom had stolen it already because of his participation in the sitcom ""Cheers"") who always plays his roles with so much flexibility and professionalism. In contrast to the confused and sometimes cruel character from ""The Glass Castle"", Chief Willoughby is an honest person who's sincerely worried about the case of Mildred's daughter. All in all, these are three parts that are played in an excellent and marvelous way by these actors. This film is already commendable because of that.But it is also the intelligently written script that makes this film worthwhile. It's indeed a film full of heavy themes. The injustice in this world and how people deal with it. The processing of an immense grief. And there are also uncomfortable moments full of aggression and threats. And yet there is always a laconic undertone that is peppered with thoughtful, ambiguous humor. And these different moods alternate at breakneck speed. Some scenes change from aggressive and threatening, into humorous and emotional. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a gem of a film I've enjoyed tremendously. And believe me, I'm looking forward to seeing it once more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Maybe the Best Film of the Year,"This is a terrific film with great performances. There are twists along the way and although the ending may leave some people unsatisfied, I thought it was perfect. The feel of the movie was certainly one of depression and frustration, but at the same time it managed to show hope for the human spirit. No matter how bad things are and how awful someone may appear to be, there is always the chance that there is some redeeming quality and this film brings that out. Frances McDormand is nothing short of amazing. There is absolutely no way she can't win an Academy Award for Best Actress for this role if there is any justice at all out there. It is a great performance, one of the best any actress has ever given and despite the Academy's recent penchant for giving awards strictly based on political correctness (or simply nominating Meryl Streep for whatever drivel she's been in that year), they can't ignore it and not give her the award.

"Sophomoric and mindlessly vulgar film that falls flat as a ""dry"" murder mystery comedy","I went to see this ""film"" with my father since he heard about how good this ""film"" is, and I reclutantly went along on Saturday night before the Oscar telecast the following evening.I know who the writer/director is, and he's the Irish playwright behind the cult ""vulgar"" comedy classic In Bruges, which I liked in spite of its content.However, there is such an idiom as ""beating the dead horse,"" and this ""film"" is nonsense that tries too hard to be as clever as the Coen brothers in emulation with the familiar murder mystery like that of No Country for Old Men and Fargo.To make it even more grating, the ""film"" does not cease with the wall to wall vulgarity that includes the repeat use of the most vulgar slang in the English language, which would be tolerable if used once or twice, but abused to such the obnoxious degree that vulgarity detracts from the story of the ""film.""The director tries too hard to imitate Coen brothers -- including even the lead actress -- with the standard dry humor, but he uses the sledgehammer approach to using as much profanity as the filler, for some lame attempt at drama and comedy.I never chuckled once during the ""film,"" because the sheer amount of vulgarity in dialogues with attempt at some bawdy humor annoyed me. This ""film"" did prompt a few walkouts with them returning shortly to resume, during the intensely vulgar scenes.I enjoyed the classic films that are peppered with language and some vulgarities, such as Quentin Tarantino's earlier films. But with this ""film"" with such a long and bizarre title that lends to the mystery, it's long on vulgar ramblings for desperate attempt at cleverness and short on subtleties.Do not bother to see this ""film,"" simply because it's nothing new and revelationary, regardless of acting ensemble and sort-of originality, except essentially aping Coen brothers' theme and style. All that it does is pull some shock humor with vulgar phrasings and some violence for dramatic effects, with a rather lame and tense-less climax that definitely rips off Coen brothers' style by ending it on the abrupt note.If this ""film"" wins Best Screenplay Oscar, then it should prove that the voters have no taste, that prove them to be as much of a vulgarian as the vintage-Tarantino-wannabe director, who should stick to playwriting rather than make aggravatingly stupider ""films"" trying to be clever that overemphasizes absolute vulgarity with even less meaning and more irritation, with absolute no point to comprehend.A definitely overrated tripe, courtesy of the dishonest critics that pushed the rating on Rotten Tomatoes for nothing but a farcically pompous and vulgar piece that only test the limit of the audience's tolerance for perfect vulgarity that demonstrate the filmmaking body to be the irrelevant and deplorable.* 1/2",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"An inimitable, well written, superbly acted, thought provoking film.","A mother, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), tries to give the local police department a kick up the backside in her attempt to find the individual who murdered her daughter.With a title like 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and a cast including Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell, I had an idea of what to expect. And I was right, a film that touches parts of your brain that the standard Hollywood fare can't. Gritty and real, dark humour entangled with drama, plus some moments that are either poignant or unpleasant.Three Billboards' is essentially about pain, in particular about a mother's pain and guilt after the unsolved murder of her daughter, but also the pain of a number of other characters, most notably Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell). In Mildred's case, the emptiness of her life after her daughter's murder is unbearable, driving her to extremes in order to make important people sit up and take notice. The ultimate rule was broken when her daughter's life was taken so she no longer believes that rules apply to her.Additionally, her husband has left her for a stunning 19 year old as well as partially blaming her for the death of their daughter. Worst of all, the perennial weight of her own guilt and regret is gnawing away at her humanity.It's sometimes difficult to feel for Mildred when she is so cruel to others. We can understand why she behaves in such a way but it doesn't mean we condone her behaviour. The film tests how far we are prepared to accept a grieving mother actions before, or if at all, we lose sympathy.The language is fruity with the use of the 'c' word and there are some extremely difficult moments where the viewer has to face a character laying bare their real feelings, causing deep hurt for others. There's no reticence here and I'm sure many viewers' jaws hit the floor. 'Three Billboards' is certainly not afraid to make the audience squirm a little.Interestingly, the film ends on a juxtaposition where two of the main protagonists are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel at what is probably the darkest part of the film. Perhaps it is only when we get to our lowest point, where we can sink no lower, that we only start to look up.The acting is top quality from all concerned and the script is excellent. I never lost interest throughout the film and was only disappointed that its two hour running length wasn't considerably longer. That's when you know you've watched a genuinely good film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a new breed of playwright for the cinema,"Thought provoking seems to be a dirty idea for the film industry. Audiences are not accustomed to such a alien form of entertainment. Martin McDonagh style will not be everyone's cup-a, and thank the Gods it is not. Any great new art form is never realized by the masses. Three Billboards was my third taste of his for cinema. My first was a Broadway play, best and most original and violent piece I had ever seen on the stage.Seven Psychopaths was the best script that year but the film within a film within another film went over the heads of most.Three Billboards is not nearly as funny but oh so remarkable,People will undoubtedly compare his style to Quentin Tarantino but that would be a mistake. The main difference is Tarantino's DNA is all about being COOL.His total identity is to be COOL.McDonagh's is far more intriguing and human.I would love to see his take on the current ridiculous witch hunt in Hollywood as to who touched who, who grabbed what. Do they really expect people to take this seriously. The casting couch has been around since silent films. It comes with the territory if one wants to play. Yes there are Pigs that can take advantage of girls.Trust me they take advantage of men just as frequently, maybe more.Years ago I was asked by my best friend to be an extra in a Halloween Scene meant to be NYC. In that scene I was told to stand next to Salma Hayek when out of nowhere she grabbed my ass. I've been having nightmares ever since, and that was at least 20 years ago.SHOULD I SUE? LOL.Three billboards has so many scenes to be cherished, but the one which is in the only flashback, will send chills up your spine to alert you as to why the mother is so obsessed to find the one person responsible for raping,killing and burning her daughter.

Despite Martin McDonagh's magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns and the well written dialogues, it's the strength of the performances from Frances McDormand (whose expressive eyes show every thought and capture the depths of her pain), Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell that keeps ""Three Billboards"" up.

The bluntness and the intense emotion that are displayed by the lead actress (Frances McDormand) are really what carry the movie. Her agenda to wake people from her town and stand her ground against all odds is the true essence of this film. Watching her holding it together and staying strong just invokes emotions among the viewers. The bluntness and timing of the situations gives it some light comical moments.

"Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri (2017)","One minute into the film and I knew I was into something special. I really rate the work of Martin McDonagh. Both In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths are excellent. When I heard about this film and read the premise I felt like this could be something that would make award season waves. The film has got a stellar cast to both and does a wonderful mix of comedy and drama to drive home a piece of film that is one of the strongest of the year thus far.The film follows a lady who rents out three billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, which point fingers at the local officer Chief Willoughby, for not solving the death and rape of her teenage daughter. These ads become controversial as the chief is a beloved figure of the community and people start having mixed but strong reactions to the billboards. There is a scramble to figure out the results of the case, and the main characters all have life changing consequences of being involved.This has to be the strongest Frances McDormand performance I have ever seen. She's always great but this was a total embodiment of a determined and strong willed mother who perseveres, despite knowing most of the town can't stand her guts. Woody Harrelson is typically good and we once again get a great Sam Rockwell showing once again showing how underrated he is. You become engulfed into the film and wrapped into everything that occurs.The film has its funny moments but it also is heavy handed and deals with a devastating loss. The film remains somewhat unpredictable and while the end is a bit open ended and brings more questions than answers, it doesn't detract from a strong written work that was satisfying to see at the tail end of the year.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Stagy dark comedy with good acting,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highly spoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a great film, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, ""Three Billboards..."" falls into the later category, as director/writer Martin McDonagh (""Seven Psychopaths"" 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedy that ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes put together to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand (""Fargo""), Woody Harrelson (""The Hunger Games""), Sam Rockwell (""The Way Way Back""), Luca Hedges (""Manchester by the Sea""), Caleb Landrey (""Get Out""), Zeljko Ivanek (""Argo"") and Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones""), the acting is not the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing is lackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly move the story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film. Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landrey is initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent, however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim. ""Three Billboards"" is far from a clunker.

"An Effective, Dark, Dense Probe into the Heart of a Small-Town Controversy","A hard-nosed mother, at the end of her rope, rents a trio of billboards to remind local police that they still have no suspects in her daughter's seven-month-old rape and murder. Very Coen-esque, and not just in that it stars Frances McDormand, who's appeared in half a dozen of their films and is actually married to one of the brothers. Most notable is the way director/screenwriter Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) gets us familiar with dozens of rounded, colorful characters, fleshes them out and makes us care about how their paths intertwine. Or, in most cases, how they collide, break apart and ricochet into the next unsuspecting object. This really gets going in the second act, when a core character makes a profound decision that results in a solid hour of nonstop chain reactions. But it's not all dark gristle and angry monologues. Often, it works as an effective black comedy, which I realize is a tough thing to recognize after admitting it's about a rape investigation. Such tension-breakers are crucial, though, to keep us from getting too bogged down in the solemnity of it all, and to maintain a sense of momentum. Wonderfully shot, with plenty of time dedicated to exploring the beat-up small town at the center of all the drama, it's also expertly paced, brilliantly acted and continuously surprising.

The Most Unpredictable Film of the Year,"It's not that I like watching depressing films, but there's a strange appeal I have in watching films where people go through seriously tragic and heart-wrenching events. I think it's more of an appeal to go through emotions that you don't normally feel type of thing. And really, that's what movies are for in my opinion, to get a specific emotion out of the audience. Three Billboards was one of the most effective films of the year in that regard. I felt every emotion the film was trying to convey, and to the film's credit, that was a widespread range of emotions.Classified as a dark comedy, Three Billboards is about a mother still grieving over her daughters rape and murder 7 months ago, so she decides to put up messages on billboards directed at the town's police department, and their lack of effort towards arresting the perpetrator. A powerful synopsis at that, but the film never takes itself too far in one particular direction in emotion. There are a few laugh out loud scenes but I was never taken out of the film with misplaced humor. There were plenty of dark themed sequences and discussions had throughout the film, but they were far from being emotionally manipulative. In that sense, this is easily one of the most well-balanced films of the year.Let's talk about the cast for a second, because it almost sounds too good to be true. Frances McDorman plays the mother of a murdered child who is cynical and suppresses her emotions. Woody Harrelson plays a hardened cop who is well-respected around town. And Sam Rockwell is the lazy and vile cop who constantly doesn't live up to the expectations set by his peers. Those three alone are perfect casting, and that's not even mentioning the supporting cast. Director Martin McDonagh did a wonderful job of bringing Oscar caliber performances out of the three of them.He also manages to direct the film in an unconventional and unpredictable way. Several times I was stunned by some of the decisions these characters made, but then after sitting down and thinking it through, it's exactly what those people would have done in those particular situations. When a film can surprise you while never letting that surprise be manipulative, that's the sign of a great director. If he's not nominated for best director, I will be very disappointed.As I said up top, I want to be emotionally moved by every film I see. Whether that be laughing, crying, or on the edge my seat with overwhelming enjoyment, that's all I can really ask of a film. As Jim Valvano once said, there are three things you should do every day: laugh, think, and cry, and Three Billboards managed to put me through those three things several times in under 2 hours. That's one heck of a movie.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"An excellent tale of forgivenes, and how to accept those you don't agree with!","'THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI': Five Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed, multi-award winning, Oscar hopeful from Academy Award winning writer/director Martin McDonagh (who previously won an Oscar for writing 2008's 'IN BRUGES', which he also directed). The film is a dark comedy-drama about a grieving divorced mother, who puts up three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri) shaming the police for not making any progress in her daughter's brutal rape and murder case. It stars Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell (who also starred in McDonagh's 2012 hit 'SEVEN PSYCHPATHS'), Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish, John Hawkes and Samara Weaving. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's also won multiple prestigious awards as well (and been nominated for a bunch of others). It's expected to be nominated for multiple major Academy Awards too. I loved it.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is a single divorced mother, who's still grieving over the horrific rape and murder of her teenage daughter, seven months earlier. She is especially upset with the local police department for not making any progress in the case. So she puts up three billboards shaming them, especially Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Harrelson), who's dying from pancreatic cancer. Willoughby, and officer Jason Dixon (Rockwell), are extremely annoyed by her actions, as well as most of the rest of the town, and Mildred and her depressed teenage son, Robbie (Hedges), are harassed for it. Mildred still presses on though.The movie is especially impressive in how it presents such a diverse range of fully developed characters, that are all extremely flawed and yet still very relatable (as both likable and seemingly very real people). It's an excellent tale of forgiveness, in my opinion, and learning how to accept and tolerate those you don't agree with. The climax and ending of the movie are also both priceless. It's so emotionally charged and totally unpredictable, that the film just really leaves you thinking about it, long after it's over. McDormand and Rockwell are also both outstanding in their roles, and McDonagh proves himself as one of Hollywood's top directors to watch for. The film is definitely a must see!Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Gripping, outstanding film","I went in to this film with high expectations and they were exceeded almost instantly. Incredible performances from Sam Rockwell, Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson. My only niggle was I would have loved a different ending without spoiling anything a different ending would have been so much more satisfying if one of the principal characters' arch really extended to full redemption rather than where it went. Couldn't recommend this film more to film fans anywhere. Film and storytelling at its best put simply.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
No ending,"So the movie itself is actually good and had potential. There were some funny scenes, an overall depressing theme yet some humor within. The acting was very good, I appreciate the character development as well. But, without spoiling anything, this is a movie that does not have an ending. It's an ""open for interpretation"" ending, which I personally HATE. I wish I would've read a review that mentioned this because I hate watching a movie, enjoying it, then get mad at the end because there wasn't a clear ending. So if you don't like movies that don't have an ending, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Does every movie now need to be political?,"This movie was drawn out, boring and had poor dialogue but did have rare moments that made me laugh. Normally I would give it a 4 because it is a below average movie. But the far left political overtones throughout the movie infuriated me. They just wouldn't stop pushing left wing talking points, it was ridiculous. I don't want politics in my entertainment. Hollywood needs to realize this.

Horrible film,"I have walked out on two movies in my life; this is one of them. Is this supposed to be a portrayal of life in rural America?

a mother's enraged quest for justice at any cost,"If it were possible to name the dominant emotion swirling around the world today it would be anger. Its many causes include social inequality, political instability, and global brinkmanship, all of which create a collective sense of helplessness due to events and systems over which we have no control. Any film that gives expression to this anger is cathartic, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) hits this mark right from the outset.
Seven months after the rape and murder of Angela Hayes, her mother Mildred (Frances McDormand) is ready to explode. Local police investigations have stalled, she is not getting any updates, and she believes that much more could be done. She rents three neglected billboards and plasters three simple messages against blood-red backgrounds: ""Raped while dying""; ""And still no arrests""; and ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"". The shocked town is instantly divided into those sympathetic to Mildred's plight and those supportive of terminally ill Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Police are outraged, national media get involved, and Mildred's son and former husband try to talk her out of her protest. Events spiral out of control: there are outbursts of police racism, homophobia, bashings, arson, a suicide, as well as community outpouring of sympathy for Willoughby and blame for Mildred. Undeterred and hell bent on revenge, she sets a course into nihilism without regard for the consequences.
Not since Network (1978) when enraged Peter Finch screamed ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore"" has a film penetrated the global zeitgeist with such forensic accuracy. When Mildred lets loose, it feels good and right. McDormand's powerhouse feminist performance makes this her film: no other contemporary actress does cold anger like she can and still offer a warm vulnerability to make us care. Harrelson is a complex opposite: reasonable, wounded, and compassionate. His likeability is the film's greatest complication: while we share Mildred's anger we also want to quarantine Willoughby, especially when we meet his beautiful wife and daughters.
Three Billboards is telling us that to feel human we sometimes must do extreme things. Whether you accept that message or not, this film offers a safety valve for anyone who feels crushed by the system. Labelling it a 'black comedy' is a loose fit for a film full of surprises where most of the humour is found in lightning fast one-liners laced with multiple F-bombs. The blackness lies in the moral ambiguity of Mildred's behaviour: she is channelling eye-for-an-eye justice and it matters little if the wrong person pays. Whatever you make of it, this is a gripping film that you are unlikely to forget soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Completely Original,"I think what I like best about this movie is the sheer unconventionality and originality that went into crafting the story. I can safely say I have never before seen a film about a billboard dispute in a small town. Really, this is a film about a small town where everyone knows everybody, and everything about their business; the subtle character development and relationships changes are more important than the events that happen. It's also the characters that give this town such a rich feeling. The public's perception of Mildred also becomes a character (just like how mob mentality becomes a character in Fritz Lang's ""M""); we get glimpses of how the town feels from her interactions with her friend Denise (Amanda Warren, ""Mother!""), with her son (Lucas Hedges, ""Ben is Back""), the town midget (Peter Dinklage, ""Living in Oblivion"") and even Willoughby's wife Anne (Abbie Cornish, ""Sucker Punch""). Building up this town with its diverse populous gives us a town that feels wholly unique, and while not all the characters are given enough room to grow, I would say probably 90% of the characters in this film show some sort of growth over the course of this film. That, in my opinion, is quite impressive; to establish an entire town and, without going completely off the rails, change every character in that town in some way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Three Billboards Keeps You Guessing and Boasts a Sharp Darkly Comedic Wit,"I didn't fall in love with this movie immediately. I found it funny from the get go but I had to work my way into it. The biggest reason that this movie won me over was how daring and unpredictable the plot was. Every time I was getting settled in, it felt like the movie slapped me awake with some new twist. I mean this in the best possible way. Everyone complains when it comes to Hollywood, there's nothing new under the sun so if someone does something original, its only fair to heap praise upon them. Three Billboards is certainly its own thing, we go from extremely vulgar humour (cleverly written but vulgar) to a character committing murder in a heartbeat. This could have been jarring and it was, but the movie is written so well that I ended up appreciating it because it was different, and it worked far more often than it didn't.If you can't agree with my sentiments on the plot of Three Billboards, maybe we can find common ground over the deep and surprising character development the movie boasts. Three Billboards is one of those movies where there aren't defined heroes or villains (minus a supporting character that comes in late) and everyone operates in morally grey territory. You go in thinking you're going to be rooting for Mildred (Frances McDormand) going up against Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Dixon (Sam Rockwell) and the system to get justice for her daughter. Its not that simple and I think you'll be surprised how much your flipping your allegiances back and forth as the movie goes on. You have characters that are complete degenerates who find a soul and a will to be decent and others that seem to lose their humanity along the way. Again, you couple this with how shocking the story turns can be and you have a movie to stand up and take notice of.I think the cast of Three Billboards is good the whole way around. I would say you have one amazing performance, the rest of the cast is solid and then one that I didn't like as much. They should probably give Frances McDormand the Oscar for her work as Mildred right now. The character is interesting outside of her performance but McDormand makes Mildred a character you can't take your eyes off of. She performs amazingly, she has to convey every emotion and there were moments I was laughing and then the next instant I was almost ready to cry because of her performance. Harrelson hits the right balance as Willoughby. Mildred is such a force of nature that Harrelson probably had to dial it back a little but the interplay between the 2 of them is funny yet very heartfelt. Rockwell is always good at playing a dummy and he does a great job as Dixon. He has the most complete emotional arc to work with and he impresses with it. This is probably my favourite Caleb Landry Jones performance. I never thought he was a bad actor, I just hadn't really seen him standout yet, he accomplished that here. It was nice to see Peter Dinklage in a good supporting part and I liked John Hawkes and Zeljko Ivanek in their small roles. I feel bad because I liked her in other things but I thought Abbie Cornish was miscast. Her accent was all over the place and she just seemed off.I obviously really enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't be rating it a 9 otherwise. My only minor complaint is that the score bugged me. It was just random and I didn't think it meshed with the rest of the movie. I would caution too (even though I didn't mind it) that this movie is unrelentingly dark. I know that might seem like me nitpicking but there were 4 or 5 times where I audibly gasped because I couldn't believe how deep the movie waded into a dreary and uncomfortable place.This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but I really dug this movie for what it was. It does what it wants to do and doesn't care if it appeals across the movie going spectrum. I'm not very familiar with Martin McDonagh's past work but I'm paying attention now. If your sense of humour skews toward the dark and you want to see a fresh and well acted movie, go see Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri. I'd give this an 8.5/10 rounded up to a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I Think it's Great!,"Much credit goes to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Its analysis on a small town's skewed priorities on law and order feels inspired by the United States' many cultures, especially from the perspective of Mildred, played by Oscar winner Frances McDormand (Fargo). She never says a single kind word to anyone, but her true personality blooms once she routinely plants flowers in front of her blood-red billboards as if at the Vietnam memorial. Once there, she shares a melodic conversation with a deer beside the highway, keeping her human. The rest of Ebbing, Missouri also seems given up on America's growth, set instead to let desires run on dunking others beneath self-worth.Though be warned: the three steps to the feature's creation appears a tad too rushed. The pre-production process mentions the Catholic church of the town exactly once in the first act, missing out on its powerful potential to serve a stronger MacGuffin to the story beyond just its hindrance to society. The production process's cheap burn makeup effects look poor compared to the wounds put on Leonardo DiCaprio's bear wounds. The post-production process disrupts its own narrative flow by throwing a flashback into a moment when dialogue would have sufficed.Looking at the Oscar's past Best Picture winners, Spotlight and Moonlight, they both kept a consistent visual style, unlike Three Billboards. Primarily, the editor, Jon Gregory (Four Weddings and a Funeral, In Bruges) was a poor choice to put together the feature; a potential Oscar contender ought to require someone more experienced to present a population of human beings turned into thoughtless advertisements. Likewise, cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy) resorts to unnecessarily pointing the Steadicam upwards. If treated like a mockumentary similar to This Is Spinal Tap, then a greater impact could linger in this movie's legacy.Now with the problems out of the way, basically everything else in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri accomplishes its civic duty.Obviously, cops nowadays are no State Farm, so here their portrayal gets treated positively. Mildred's middle-class family home in particular takes no breather: her ex-husband continues to abuse her while her last shared memory with her murdered daughter reeks in high regret. Maybe the people here were born with it, maybe the pressure to advertise caused everyone to become whatever social message they always talk about. Its timelessness in leaving the precise year vague adds the extra snap, crackle, and pop to the core theme.My commemorations go to the finger lickin' good performances by the whole cast, every single one proves the power of an ensemble, particularly the underrated actor Caleb Landry Jones (Breaking Bad, Get Out). Yet Sam Rockwell in particular is after an Academy Award nomination, and understandably so: his performance turns agitated one minute and collapsing in silent tears the next.I appreciate how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri knew not to excessively milk its timeliness right after it calls the cops a ""N*gger Torturing Business,"" since they lack concentration on actual crimes. Although these cops prefer the equally undignified term ""Persons of Color;"" even they the authorities think Black people fall short against ""normal"" White people. This mouth-gaping social relevance soon turns ironic once a new Black police sheriff comes into town.Beyond the Blacks/Police conflict that challenges old stereotypes, jokes about people's weight and height keep going and going and going without crossing the line towards the offensive. The head of Ebbing's P.R. business even has the name Red, because everyone else around him sees red‚Äîboth literally and figuratively!It's a greatly clever style of writing which helps you to think different in a harsh way. We all want and need to preach about what makes us pound our fist on the table, and as depicted here, our abuse of our First Amendment rights turns us into our branding, erasing the definition between our wants and our needs. It really boils down to: Where do you want to go today?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

May be the best movie of 2017,"If you long for the brilliant depiction of the melancholy unity between humor and pathos, you'll love writer/director Martin McDonagh's darkly comic Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. In seeming homage to the Coen Brothers, especially their iconic Fargo and Raising Arizona, this film takes the rape/murder of Mildred Hayes's (Frances McDormand) daughter and weaves the dreary investigation with some scarily funny takes on small-town rednecks/crackers.Mildred spurs the investigation of her daughter's murder by placing three billboards that accuse the local police, especially Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), of slacking. However, this is just the MacGuffin that pales in the shadow of the town's bigotry and lassitude. The Chief, however, is not necessarily culpable as he claims to have tried but without physical proof such as DNA.Mildred, in Marge Gunderson mode, pursues the killer at the expense of local sympathy: ""It seems to me the police department is too busy torturing black folk to solve actual crimes."" Note the slams at languorous cops and racism, motifs played throughout.Catching the right dark tones between grief and hilarious ineptitude, this film knows justice is not easy and sometimes meted out by imbeciles. Yet, getting on with a goal and learning cooperation and compromise, especially in a small town, may lead to a comfort that goes beyond catching a murderer.The acting is incomparable. When Harrelson talks about the culture of racism, there's truth in his voice, sadness in his tone: ""If you got rid of all the cops with vaguely racist leanings, you'd have only have three cops left. And all of them would hate fags.""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
McDonagh's best film bar none.,"Frances McDormand plays a grieving mother who has had enough of the ineptitude of the local police in catching her daughter's rapists and murderers. She puts three billboards up near the town highlighting her feelings and the town's residences instantly takes a disliking to them. Things get steadily worse when it is revealed that Willoughby, the town's chief named in one of the billboards, has cancer.The movie has that amazing, rare ability to carefully balance humour and darkness at the same time. It weaves in various social issues through Mcdonagh's signature wit and political incorrectness. One minute I was tearing up at the sad predicament some of the characters were going through, the next, I was laughing my head off at their hilarious dialogue.It's a movie about female rage at the lack of interest in finding justice for sex crimes.

A Troubled Movie for Our Troubled Times,"The night before I saw ""Three Billboards..."", my wife and I were talking about how surprised we are that, with all of the hot button issues swirling around America's cultural conversation right now, very few of them are being addressed in movies. Then I watched Martin McDonagh's (who ironically isn't even American) angry, sad, and haunting film and feel like it, along with ""Get Out,"" also released this year, will be remembered as a film that captured a specific cultural moment better than many others playing in theaters at the same time.""Three Billboards..."" is I think a movie whose sum is better than any of its parts. It's problematic, primarily in the uneasy tone McDonagh tries only fitfully successfully to create. It feels too often like someone trying to impersonate the Coen brothers but not quite getting it. Early attempts at dark humor fall flat, and eventually the screenplay just gives up trying to be funny altogether, and that's when the movie is at its best. McDonagh also suffers from a lack of discipline, and issues are addressed, like black distrust of the police or religious hypocrisy, that don't feel completely integrated into the movie's themes. But overall this didn't bother me as much as it might otherwise have, because more than anything this movie is about that undefined anger that seems to be pervading our culture right now and makes its target whatever happens to be in front of us in the moment. The two main characters in this film are overcome with a sense of helpless rage, much of it legitimate and targeted, some of it not, and both are faced with the same decision -- do they continue to feed it, or do they let it go? The way they and the movie answer that question is disturbing in a way that sneaks up on you and gets in your head. I realized days later that I was still thinking about this movie.Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson are excellent. Sam Rockwell is good with what he's given to do, but one wishes his character had been better written. As it is he's a caricature up to a point, and then he does a complete turnabout that comes out of thin air and feels like a case of satisfying character development being sacrificed for the sake of plot mechanics.Like ""Get Out,"" time will tell how well ""Three Billboards..."" holds up, but for now it's one of the few movies that has its finger on the pulse of what's happening to America, and that's enough.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Twit and the Pendulum,"Between Bruges and Missouri, if being a writer/director weren't enough, Martin McDonagh could seemingly easily find an alternate calling as an unorthodox travel agent. Of course, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as much a straight- faced travelogue of the Midwestern United States as McDonagh's In Bruges is a gentle comedy of tourism - namely, not at all. McDonagh's films defy easy categorization with as much flamboyance and vitriolic wit as they subvert narrative expectation, with twists and inversions as wacky as they are devastatingly human. And Three Billboards may be his sharpest, most tenderly sadistic cross-section of human behaviour yet, exemplifying his customary deftness for unpacking the weird, terrible, and unexpectedly graceful decisions people make under intolerably extreme circumstances. Even more impressively: he fans the flames with a seasoning of searing sociopolitical urgency amidst the salty banter and unexpected bursts of extreme violence, before pulling the rug out from under us once again for something altogether more moving and raw.Taking its place with The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Square as 2017's (unintentional but perfectly pairing) tryptic of sordidly funny meditations on karma and retribution,* Three Billboards adopts an a grandiose, almost Biblical sensibility in its darkly comedic morality play. Characters gradually, painstakingly, learn to try turning the other cheek when running perilously low on vision due to all the 'eye for an eye's, as McDonagh's razor-sharp screenplay adopts a pendulum structure of 'action/reaction/escalation' that becomes increasingly poignant as things careen increasingly out of control. Initially, this ping-ponging of aggression lends the film an affably clumsy, episodic feel, but it's only retroactively clear how carefully-knit McDonagh's writing is, neatly baiting and subverting expectations with coy foreshadowing and red herrings aplenty, with the jaw-dropping spurts of extreme, unexpected violence upstaged only by the seismic power of quiet but instrumental character revelations that McDonagh airdrops in with equally gleeful whimsy.McDonagh is unmistakably a playwright, and his founding sensibilities root the film in an impressively tense, pressure-cooker claustrophobia. Granted, the snappiness of his viciously eloquent, don't-call-it-Tarantinoesque, dialogue is undercut ever so slightly by the proliferation of transitional establishing shots, buoyed by Carter Burwell's sumptuously sonorous musical score, that privilege elegiac pause over the film's otherwise breakneck, almost screwball comedy pacing. Still, these micro-pauses of deliberation are crucial for not having the audience fanned into a similar fury of indignation as the characters, allowing us a more dispassionate, if not unemotional, take on an increasingly incendiary allegory.Because here's the rub: amidst all of the bluster, banter, and hyperbolic escalation, Three Billboards is, at its core, a cutting rumination on the current combustible climate of police brutality being taken to task. McDonagh weighs in, appropriately scathingly, on the infuriating, seething impotence in the face of systemic corruption and toxic, discriminatory violence running so deep. At the same time, he vehemently insists on painting every wrinkle of every side with human error shades of grey, and resists the temptation to fully dive down the rabbit hole of larger-than-life fantasy escape into righteously indignant cathartic retribution, a-la Inglourious Basterds, with Frances McDormand's furiously grieving mother its surrogate Aldo Raine. Justice, McDonagh insists, is more than balance, and flecks of unexpected condemnation and redemption colour all sides and individuals, no matter what preconceived roles they slot into. In short, McDonagh's characters are all far too human not to err, but far too human not to understand and forgive in the midst of their doing so. And that, if anything, lends for a well-balanced, contemporary pseudo-Biblical morality parable, even if McDonagh customarily finds his scripture in swearing here.Frances McDormand is truly extraordinary, imbuing everything from a monologue to a fleeting glance with captivating magnetism and furious emotional weight. Inhabiting a woman carved down by fury and grief into an almost primal human flame of rage, McDormand's flinty composure only occasionally flickers to betray the cavernous guilt and sadness beneath. In spite of this, she's also savagely funny, and her diatribes shutting down a kindly priest and vacuous reporter as accountable for feeding into a broken system couldn't be more a more riotously cathartic mouthpiece for a year full of such infuriating real-life sociopolitical strife. Sam Rockwell similarly delivers some of the most dazzlingly funny and compellingly nuanced of his career, in a performance fuelled by as much misguided rage as by puppy-dog pathos. As Dixon, a small-town Midwestern cop reviled as racist and abusive, Rockwell takes a character we're hardwired to hate and dismiss, and works tirelessly to make us understand and confront the man within the stereotype, while being careful not problematically stray into the territory of misguided folk hero - he's far too brutally honest and sweepingly human for that. Woody Harrelson is equally exceptional, drawing up undercurrents of unexpected elegance and wry humour into a role that equally defies expectation, intriguingly sashaying from antagonist to protagonist scene-by-scene. Lucas Hedges, Abbie Cornish, John Hawks, and Caleb Landry Jones all find their beats of sardonic hilarity and gut-punching humanism with remarkable ease, while Samara Weaving is almost unspeakably funny in her few, fleeting moments, and Peter Dinklage is almost overpoweringly lovable as seemingly the film's only wholly redeemable character.Just like its titular signage, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri functions as a cultural object dropped in amongst an unsuspecting public, to fan flames, incite conversation and controversy, confront prejudices, and, hopefully, lead to life-changing revelations in perspective. It's an astonishingly intricate and fundamentally human think-piece, and the occasional wobbles in pacing and politics do little to mar its standing as one of the year's most unforgettable films. Still, I'll take Bruges over Missouri - in more ways than one.-9/10*There's an amusing poignancy in three of the year's most inevitable Oscar contenders involving extreme karmic consequences for loss.

Watching McDormand, the grieving & raging protagonist, challenge the local authorities & await the culprit behind her daughter's brutal death, is a mix of delicious dark humor & racial violence.So while you have McDormand as the bad-ass, there is also a strong supporting role, played by a wild Sam Rockwell. As the hillbilly cop, Rockwell is tempered, foul-mouthed, violent & unforgiving. He's the cop you wouldn't want to come across if you ever happen to be in Missouri. And that's exactly what makes 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' such a delightful mix of contrasting rage. Its the same emotion that the characters go through here, with the only difference being how they go about it. While the cop uses his hands and legs to break bones, the protagonist adds toughness to herself by putting up Billboards. As I mentioned earlier before, here's a film that uses anger as its energy & rage as its beating heart!McDonagh's Screenplay is top-notch. Its no-holds-barred & a depiction of an America, we don't usually explore in movies. Its power-packed stuff, with some delicious, unexpected twists & turns. McDonagh's Direction is brilliant, too. McDonagh has handled this dark-comedy/crime-drama with precision. Oscar Glory, seems possible! Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, merit a special mention. Carter Burwell's Score is soothing, as always. Costume Design & Make-Up are well-done, as well.And now to the performances! Frances McDormand is simply superb!

Its a sheer pleasure to watch McDormand take on the local tough boys & scream her rage with the Billboards. This is her finest performance in years.Also in terrific form is Woody Harrelson, as the cop who McDormand throws her righteous rage at. Harrelson's sheriff is a soft man, who understands the wrath of a grieving mother as well as accept his inability to catch the culprit. He also has a nice sub-plot with his family, with whom he shares his emotional connect. Harrelson delivers a restrained, controlled performance, proving us once again that he's versatile performer.Sam Rockwell plays it crazy & has a blast! His turn as the racially aggressive cop is hard to beat. Rockwell attacks the role full throttle. As Rockwell's outrageous mother, Sandy Martin is a hoot. Her performance comes close to stealing the entire film. Please give her some attention this awards season!Of the rest of the cast, Caleb Landry Jones, John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage & Lucas Hedges stand out with impressive supporting turns.On the whole, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a knockout!

"Funny, Emotional and Thought Provoking","After months without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents out three billboards (that are located outside Ebbing, Missouri) and puts up the message ""Raped while dying and still no arrests? How come, Chief Willoughby?"" This causes mass outrage from an entire town of colourful characters who adore chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) including a ""fat dentist"", a ""lady with the funny eye"" and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) a man who recently built a reputation for himself after beating up a black suspect. Or as Mildred colourfully puts it, Dixon has recently entered ""the n***er torturing business"".Is she in the right to put up the billboards? Is she helping draw attention on her daughter's murder case? Or is she just a rude woman who should stop fighting people she shouldn't consider her enemies? Who knows, but she's doing it anyway. And in a strange way when I watched her stand up against everyone in the entire town I was reminded a little of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Just like Atticus she knows she's fighting a losing battle and that no matter what she does she will never be able to bring her daughter back. She also knows that it's unlikely that her daughter's killer will ever be found. But none of that matters because this is just something that she believes is the right thing to do.McDonagh's previous films (Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges) have always been strong at balancing dark humour with thought provoking drama. But unlike his other work, the comedy for the most part is much more nuanced, with more subtle performances and a stronger focus on character development. Though it does still have his distinct language which constantly strives to challenge Goodfellas and South Park for the most swear words per minute of screen time. Plus he's assembled an incredible ensemble cast, all of whom know just how to deliver McDonaghs dialogue and are all memorable in their own way.But the two standouts in the cast are definitely McDormand and Rockwell. It's kind of surprising seeing McDormand play a role whose personality is so polar opposite to Margo in Fargo. Whenever she's on screen she's such a dominating figure and has a brashness to say whatever she wants, no matter how reckless it is or how much harm it causes. She's also brilliant at delivering McDonagh's language. At the end of it I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy watching an entire film of McDormand just going around town and swearing at people (which to be fair is kind of what I saw).This film might also be Rockwell's greatest performance yet. He's the image of the cop that Americans fear to see. The kind who thinks that his badge is an excuse to do whatever he wants and not have to face any consequences for it. He does so many hateful and despicable things in the film, but somehow Rockwell never lets you lose all hope for him. You always feel like he's going to do the right thing in the end, even if he's going to do a lot of wrong things first.At times hilarious, at others sorrowful and constantly thought provoking, Three Billboards is easily McDonagh's greatest work. It's a film that has a certain level of humanity and moral ambiguity that will continue to resonate long after you've watched it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Exposing the ugly underbelly of a small Midwestern town,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Mildred Hayes. As the movie opens, we see her driving by several unused dilapidated billboards near her house. She inquires with the Ebbing Advertising Agency (located across the street from the Police Department), and decides to put up three billboards. Combined, they read: Raped While Dying/And Still No Arrests""/How Come. Chief Willoughby? We learn that her daughter Angela was murdered 7 months ago, and that no suspects have been identified by the cops. OF course, this public shaming does not sit well with Chief Willoughby, and he decides to pay Mildred a visit (his first since the murder, Mildred remarks). At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Martin McDonagh, who previously gave us ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"". While those movies were over the top in many ways, here McDonagh goes a more subtle yet still hard-hitting way in looking at how one strong-willed woman upsets the fabric of a little Missouri town and along the way exposes its ugly underbelly. If you have seen the movie's trailer (and it was hard to escape that in recent weeks), one might expect something very similar, at least in style, to McDonagh's earlier movies, rip-roaring from start to finish. But that is not the case at all. Yes, of course there are those moments, but there there are also many other scenes in the movie that are reflective and outright touching. As hard-boiled as Mildred seems to be, the real hurt and grieving she displays on occasion says a lot more about her than when she kicks some school kids in a place where it hurts (yes, she really does). McDonagh brings out wonderful performances, none more so than the one-of-a- kind Frances McDormand as Mildred. McDormand must at this point surely be considered the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar early next year. But she gets plenty of help, including Sam Rockwell (as the sleazy and racist officer Dixon), and Woody Harrelson (as Chief Willoughby),""Three Billboards"" premiered this Fall to immediate critical acclaim, which for the most part is well deserved. (I personally felt a bit let down by the movie's concluding 15 min., which of course I will not spoil.) The Thanksgiving early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers FL, was attended nicely (about 15- 20 people) but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how the movie does at the box office as it gets a wider release in weeks to come. Martin McDonagh is certainly no ordinary writer- director and if you appreciate hiss off-kilter approach, you will welcome his latest. I encourage you to check out ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Mildly amusing at best,"THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI: I have mixed feelings about this one. Mildred Hayes' (Frances McDormand) daughter was brutally murdered seven months ago with no suspect in custody, so she rents three abandoned billboards with a message directed at the town's sheriff for failing to solve the crime. Woody Harrelson has been doing some wonderful work lately and he can add Three Billboards to the 'Excellent' column. He shines as the sheriff giving an in depth performance and stealing the picture from McDormand who's performance is pretty limited and comes off as the poster child for looking stoic. There are a lot of shots of her looking stoic. A lot. Her emotions run the gambit from A to C. The town's police department is a few pieces short of a full set. The premise is interesting - up to a point, and starts to drag and feels pretty long for the story it's telling. It tries to be humorous in places, but it's mildly amusing at best. I found the ending to be somewhat less than satisfying. I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Score: 6. Don't go. Meh",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Sizzling Pile of Poo,"It's exceedingly rare that I hand out 10s or 1s -- I reserve these for the perfect, and perfectly hideous, and neither is easy to come by. (I also elevate a score when something is of the ""so bad it's kind of great"" variety, like ""The Room"" or ""Oogieloves and the Big Balloon Adventure""). ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (which is one of the most awful titles in ages) is that rare find: something perfectly bad with zero redeeming qualities.The plot seems to hinge on a woman hellbent on finding the man who raped and killed her daughter -- ooh, a revenge mystery! Actually, this crime, like everything else in the film, is just a self-consciously writerly device to get people to bloviate in the same tone with each other on sundry topics that have nothing to do with the crime. There's a deep well of syrup and cornball below the acid river of misanthropic shit that flows through every scene. There isn't an ounce of sincerity in anyone's relation to another -- it's all pure manipulation, formulaic broad strokes that in every aspect have been done better 100 or 1000 times already. Lots of decent actors have ""big moment"" cries, but it's all empty, hollow-ringing verbiage.Had I but world enough and time, I'd gleefully dissect this abortive mess, and I concede this is more an ""F-U"" to the director/writer than a review, but I already feel my life wasting away minutes as I contemplate this execrable film past its due.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Best non-animated film of 2017,"This is among the most fun I have had at the movies in the last three years, and all without any other-worldly or superhero fanciful b**t. Yes, the story does have its dramatic twists and turns bordering on incredulous at times, but what's a good plot without some of those, and reality can be stranger than fiction. (Take any Shakespeare play for instance.)The screenplay is fraught with human emotion and serves as an excellent case study of human behavior. A word of caution about what to expect - akin to a lot of good art, the movie's objective is to raise questions and paint a grey picture of the trials of humanity such as regret, grief, anger, revenge, racism without actually providing any firm solution. I think that is what makes it so brilliant and real.And I have seen very few, if any, performances that are as good as McDormand's in this film. Every bit of muscle, every tiny line on her face appears capable of displaying an incremental change in emotion. It is phenomenal. The full cast is superb, but I particularly also loved Woody Harrelson's turn as Willoughby in a small but critical role.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to watch a movie about human nature and real-life issues.

Best film i've watched in a while,"A gritty, funny, and poignant crime, grieving and redemption story that contains several strong subplots and emotional themes. Superb performance by Frances McDormand, and strong backup from Woody H and Sam R. Some of the script is outstanding, with many quotable lines, (both dialogue and monologues).With the slightly exaggerated characterisation i thought it might be a Coen bros film, and i learnt afterwards that McDormand is in fact married to one of them.I'm not sure i learned anything, but several ""human condition"" themes are explored quite well here in the minor sub-plots: cancer, dying, grieving, anger, domestic violence, passion, unrequited love, discrimination etc. It is an ambitious film in that respect, but i dont think that detracts from the flow of the film at all. In addition its worth noting that the comic bits are genuinely laugh out loud moments, and the poignant parts are proper tearjerkers.One of my initial responses was that certain plot developments were not fully explained...for example Dixon's apparently sudden about face, and the seeming surprise amongst other characters that Mildred had become a foulmouthed badass. Ive read reviews saying these are plot 'holes'. But in hindsight, i think the director has assumed that we're an intelligent audience who know people can and do change according to extreme events in their lives, and we dont always need to be spoon fed emotional developments with flashbacks or in line by line chronological development. So for example one can assume that Dixon's time in hospital next to his victim was very reflective etc, and that Mildred had always been assertive but the loss of her daughter had taken it to a new level.The only reason it doesnt get a 10 (gave it 9 as cant do 9.5 lol) for me is the slightly twee ""thelma and louise"" style ending: I dont mind unresolved endings, but just felt it was slightly formulaic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Skates on thin ice at times, but overall, fantastic","Story time, kids.Some weeks ago, when I went to a screening of The Room that included an appearance from Tommy Wiseau himself, I got to the theater very early, because it was Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau and I wanted to make sure I was first in line to meet him.However, when I got there, there was already a massive line. I figured it could only be for one thing, the aforementioned Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau so I just got in the line. It wasn't for another 20 minutes of standing in this massive line that I realized it was for another film, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.I was dumbfounded. Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau was about to be in the building and meanwhile there was this massive line for a movie I never heard of. Needless to say it was on my radar since then. And I'm glad my memory didn't fail me for once because this is a heck of a film.The wonderful thing about this film is that it's so not what you think it is from the description alone. One would assume this will be a standard story about a powerless individual going against the big bad police force. A clear story about the good guy versus the bad guy.Instead, this movie has no good guys. This movie has no bad guys. This movie has people. People that all think they're doing the right thing; people with clear motivations and radical ideas on how to accomplish them, sometimes oblivious to the big picture ramifications.Frances McDormand plays one of these people, Mildred. Having had a daughter who passed away in terrible fashion, she is singularly focused on having her local police force get off what she perceives to be their lazy asses and figure out who did the terrible deed.Contrary to a more stereotypical movie dealing with this subject matter however, the cops aren't flat out evil here. There are cops that are genuinely trying to have the case solved, but simply can't due to a lack of leads. Frances' singular devotion to calling out the police in fact, has very human impact on good men that may not deserve the public humiliation she's offering. However as a woman that has lived through the hells of an abusive spouse and a slain child, she isn't seeing this side of the coin.It was a breath of fresh air that in this current political climate where they easily could have reached for the low hanging fruit and portrayed the police as singularly abusive and cruel, they didn't do that. Everyone here is a human. A flawed human, because all humans are flawed. There are for sure police that act in an abusive manner, but there are citizens that commit atrocious acts of violence here too. Some of the cops are racist or homophobic, some aren't. And same with the non-police characters.McDormand is magnificent here. She has an exterior as rough and solid as a cinder block. She is hyper focused, ballsy and doesn't accept anything less than what she wants. It's this attitude that moves the plot and supplies some decent comedy. It's also this attitude that makes her brief moments of vulnerability more unsettling. Her devotion to her ultimate goal of justice is admirable of course and the fierceness at which she fights for it is enjoyable, but the impact of her actions on those around her often gets lost to her. She never stops being sympathetic, but any notions of her being 100% in the right are dispelled before long.Equally maginificent, perhaps even moreso is Woody Harrelson, who only took a few months to surpass his amazing turn in War For The Planet of The Apes to deliver another belter. His character, Willoughby, is a decent man. He's well spoken, polite, kind, cares about public service and loves his family. Unfortunately, he is also the chief of police and therefore the greatest single object of Mildred's venom. Watching him trying to do the best for everyone and stay positive while being torn apart not only from the public assassination of his character, but also from a significant personal problem, is a believable and sympathetic story in it's own right.Having these two people, both with respectable opinions and motivations, clashing with each other is a brilliant catalyst and elevates this film beyond this same plot done with less care. Instead of having a definitive hero, you are left torn throughout the hour and 55 minute runtime, simultaneously rooting for everyone and no one.The single greatest character growth comes not from either of the aforementioned characters however and instead comes from Sam Rockwell's character, Dixon. At the beginning of the film he is Willoughby's simple minded, temperamental, and slavishly devoted underling. At the end of the movie he grows into a much more focused and understandable person, and this transition from someone you can't imagine loving to the opposite is often entertaining, but far more often, crushing. Rockwell is on my list now as another actor to be reckoned with.The film's only imperfections come in some of the dialogue. There are a couple (only a couple) times where the dialogue comes off as forced. There's the famous ""deer"" scene and while not the abomination some portray it to be, it definitely comes off as more hokey than sincere. Then there's a scene toward the end of the movie where a person visits her at her place of work that did not make a whole lot of logical sense. These moments are extremely minor and don't preclude the film from being an excellent tale told well.I've been having good luck with movies lately, and this was no exception. This film has laughs, it has tears and it has real emotion. I was enthralled near every second. There is no obvious hero, and no happy ending. Instead you have real humans going through a series of crushing moments, with all the believable actions and reactions that occur as a result. In less capable hands it could have been a preachy and by the numbers tale we see with the boringly romanticized nature of most ""based on a true story"" projects. Instead, this entirely fictional work is more real than most of them and I have to respect that.Oh and Tyrion Lannister and Mac's mom from Always Sunny are in the movie. If that doesn't sell you, go back to your home planet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Rating: A,"The movie with the biggest title of 2017 (I think?!) tells the story of how Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) handles her daughter's murder, which still does not have any suspect after several months. She pays for three billboards with a clear message to the chief of Ebbing's police, William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson).Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a violence-driven officer and close friend of William, join the fight against Mildred and a very dark comic drama unfolds.One of the films I am only now getting the chance to watch due to its late Portugal's release and it is also one of the few movies I still have some big expectations for it to be part of my list featuring the best films of 2017 ... Well, I can spoil you right away: it is definitely part of my top10! You can check my updated list here!I will start with what I think is the movie's strongest point: its screenplay. Martin McDonagh exceptionally elevates the story and flawlessly balances the film's several tones, from very dark mysterious drama to simple comedy. I mean, this movie really has everything: drama, comedy, mystery, extremely shocking scenes, suspenseful dialogues, incredible character development and plot twists that kept me constantly focused on the screen. It is superbly written, it has no crappy exposition scenes and it offers something to the viewer that films rarely do: doubt.I can't possibly count the moments where I switched in favor of a character instead of another. The storytelling is really thought-provoking and I both supported and repressed every single character's actions at some period during the movie. This film causes uncertainty in relation to who should I support? Who belongs to the ""good side"" and the ""bad side"" of this whole thing? Everyone's point of view has reasons to be more than understandable, every character is amazingly well-developed and every scene is filled with so much tension and suspense, but also with a lot of heartfelt and compelling moments.The story plays out like I never thought it would. There are so many minor plot twists, either related to a character or to the main script, that are utterly mind-blowing. They all make perfect sense, there is never a loose thread and every character's choices are justified with creative storytelling, which takes the movie to a whole other level. McDonagh also does a spectacular job as the director ...Fantastic one-take scenes that raise the tension up a notch, a brilliant use of the realistic cinematography and an excellent use of some unusual camera angles. The editing is seamless, the pacing is handled to perfection without a single dull moment or a misplaced scene and the score is genuinely addictive. Furthermore, the feeling of watching two different films is never present due to the wonderfully balanced tone and for a movie with so much shocking drama, I left the theater with so many great laughs because the tonal shifts are perfectly executed.Moving on to the cast, Frances McDormand, my God. How can someone be so badass? She is awesome! No wonder she is nominated for Best Actress at every award show, she clearly deserves it. A terrific performance with a range of expressions that go beyond most actors' capabilities, astonishingly well-balanced emotions (she goes through a lot of dramatic, comic and emotional scenes) that she nails in a McDormand-way.Mildred Hayes is one of the most strong and powerful characters of 2017, period. She has to deal with so much and she stands her ground vigorously. In a way, she is a role model for every single person out there: if you believe you are doing the right thing, then do it and do not let anyone stand in your way or change your mind ... Just don't do some more aggressive stuff that she does, I don't think you would get away from some good jail time.However, a few times she does become the ""villain"". She has no idea what other people are going through, but the movie always tries to justify her impulsive violent reactions with what she is suffering from. So, when the tables turn, she is also ""culpable"" (as she says in the film at some point) of both her and, for example, Bill Willoughby's actions, who is passionately interpreted by Woody Harrelson.Harrelson has one of his best heartfelt and emotional performances ever. Bill's personal issues are the most shocking subplot of the movie and Woody handles his character's grounded yet funny personality in such a compelling way. Bill's choices lead to consequences that converge in an unconventional path and it is truly something that ultimately drives the movie to the remarkable story that it possesses.Sam Rockwell is also receiving a bunch of nominations and he undoubtedly works for those. Jason Dixon is the character that goes through more personality changes due to all of the bizarre things that happen in the story and it is very hard for an actor to start as one character and basically end with a totally different one. Rockwell embodies Dixon and completely transforms this character. Once again, the scripts are phenomenal (for every character), but the cast takes them and turns them into something special.In case you are wondering, no. Peter Dinklage (James) is not in the film just to receive a pay-check. No one is. Every single character that is introduced into the story is very well-developed and they all have an important share of the runtime. Dinklage nails his performance, as well as Lucas Hedges (Robbie) and Caleb Landry Jones (Red Welby).I only have a couple of minor issues with the film. Every act is strong on its own, each having their jaw-dropping moments. However, the third act finishes with an ending that I don't appreciate that much. I can't be detailed, but I don't think McDonagh had just one ending in his mind, I am just a bit disappointed that he chose this one, which is still a great ending!My other issue has to do with the only character that simply does not fit in the movie's environment: Penelope (Samara Weaving). This character is not needed and it is so annoying. Her cliche stupid personality is the only element in the entire movie that simply does not make any sense. Fortunately, she is only on the screen for a few scenes. Weaving is not bad or good, she just suffers from the character she has to portray.All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as amazing as the length of its title. Martin McDonagh produces a multi-genre, thought-provoking screenplay with excellent pacing and tone control. He is also brilliant as the director, using long takes and the realistic setting to its advantage, making the movie even better and still counting with a memorable score. All-star performances from Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell take the movie to a whole other level, but with an ending that is not as great as it could be plus an annoying character (Penelope) that thankfully does not share much of the screentime.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The best of 2017?,"Three Billboards got plenty nominations in the main categories, especially two in Supporting Actor which is not so common. I must say, both earned without a doubt, however Rockwell stole the show completely. No wonder he received Golden Globe and I am counting on the Oscar for him as well. His Dixon is a complex stereotype. On one hand he's a little mentally challenged and very angry policeman, on the other - a person with principles. The way he is portrayed blew my mind. Sam makes it special and he steals every single minute. Woody on the other hand has more impact on the storyline, especially in the beginning. But his acting was so similar to what I've seen in True Detective, so it wasn't as impressive as it might be.Frances McDormand is the soul of the film. She gives it character and power. As a strong mother whose child died tragically, she is a woman so independent, she runs out of any scale. Title billboards are some sort of a symbol of not giving up and the whole story is basically about that. What I enjoyed the most is that the film is a chapter from the book of Ebbing, Missouri. But it's neither first nor the last one. More like a piece of a story that never ends. The story of the living. It began somewhere and it ends, too, but nothing really starts and finishes at the same time.Quite frankly, it was perfected in the smallest details. Even Tyrion Lannister (aka Peter Dinklage) and his heartbreakingly short role was just pure gold. And the dark humour is the one I enjoy.About music - it was more of a good background than playing first fiddle.

Not too bad but not worth the hype,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would suffice as a nice past time film that is good for a short while but forgettable. This film certainly has its moments and the lazy southern setting has its appeal. The acting is quite good, the cast deliver good performances. A number of people complained about the tone and how loathsome everyone is but that is the theme of this story. It hits the ground running with a blunt but grieving mother wanting some kind of retribution.While it has its positives it never really crosses the mark into a truly great or captivating film. Something more was needed to get it across the line, whether a surprising twist, conspiracy or revelation of sorts. It never quite gets there and has a number of plot holes, besides the three billboards it lacks symbolism and it never is really resolved in any form. I do not think the viewers have to interpret or 'read into' anything further but the director has left loose ends and incomplete story lines.This is not a bad film, I could an aspiring film maker winning the top art or film prize at a school or festival. Possibly even the Cannes film festival. However to take home the Oscar for best film would be a stretch. Then again the Oscars have lost credibility when it gave Best Picture to Moonlight last year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Killer Performances, confused story.","Some films are easy to review. You are, after all, just writing down your opinion on something and generally, your opinion is fairly set once the film is over. You were bored, enthralled, amused or repulsed. Your judgement may well differ from others, but at least you know your own. Then along comes a movie like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and I'm honestly not sure exactly how I feel about it.Let's start with the facts. The film stars Francis McDormand as Mildred, a bereaved mother whose daughter was raped and murdered seven months ago. Desperate to keep the case relevant, she rents three billboards near her house and uses them to accuse the local police department, and specifically the Chief, Willougby (Woody Harrelson) of forgetting about the case. The billboards stir up feelings across the town as the police chief is a popular figure. Particularly upset is Deputy Dixon, (Sam Rockwell) who starts to look for ways, inside and outside the law, to have the billboards taken down.The spine of the film is Francis McDormand's Oscar nominated performance. This is, for me, one of the films first real contradictions. Her performance is brave and unyielding, but it's also showy and obvious. It's feels like it's a role designed to win awards rather than an authentic portrayal of a real person. In fact, authenticity, is something that the movie struggles with across the board. There's an admirable idea related to almost all the characters in the film, that no one is an absolute. Chief Willougby is a good example. He's not ignoring Mildred's case but the evidence has come up with no leads, he's a good family man but tolerates a degree of racism from his officers.However, these character traits seem at odds with the lack of legitimacy in the beats of the story. There are several scenes of violent crimes being committed, and witnessed, without any genuine consequence, which seriously undercut any sense of realism. Some plot points seem half baked and disappear without any conclusion but the most egregious problem that the film has though is that it doesn't, in any way, earn the redemption of Sam Rockwell's Dixon. Openly and fairly unapologetically racist from the out, he ends the film as the nearest thing the film has to a ""hero"" despite never really repenting or undergoing any character growth. In light of the way the world is in early 2018, it feels horribly out of touch.The tone of the film is difficult to pin down. It's often funny, with some laugh out loud lines of dialogue but there are other scenes of suicide and menace that are difficult to watch. That said, the films is never less than watchable and none of the performances let the side down.To conclude, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a real Curates Egg of a film, but one worth exploring, if only as a character study.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cinematic Greatness,"When I first heard the title of this film I was thinking to myself 'what could this possibly be about'. When I finally got to see the film, I was blown away.From start to stop, this film delivers. The ensemble cast does it's job in conveying a story that is touching, funny at times and thought provoking throughout. It truly covers a wide range of emotions and completes the experience with a certain realism that makes you believe you are seeing the events unfold in front of your eyes.A solid 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Clean crisp scenes where actors are left to tell a brilliant story,"It's the story of a griveing mother desperate to get closure on the rape and murder of her teenage daughter. Played by Frances McDormand, Mildred Hayes tries to provoke the local police into action by erecting three billboards lambasting the local Police Chief. In this dark comedy she is what all of us wish we could be so often. RuthlessWoody Harrelson playing Chief Willoughby, shows the equally soul-destroying aftermath that a case of this nature leaves for not only the family, but the those charged with picking up the pieces. Desperately trying to make progress on a case that left nothing but hurt and misguided blame. His execution of this role brings this movie to an equilibrium of sadness, hope and peace.While Harrelson and McDormand show their experience on the set and their performances compliment each others' entirely, the stand out for here is Sam Rockwell. He plays a new cop on the force who is almost everything all at once. Terribly ignorant and corrupt but true and loyal to the end. His character is so off kilter it's spot on.Director Martin McDonagh stays true to his theatrical form delivering clean crisp scenes where actors are left to tell a brilliant story. Screenplay and editing also gets the thumbs up with a perfect run time and probably the most honest ending a film could have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An incredible concoction of the gritty real with exaggerated fiction,"As with Martin McDonagh's 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths', 3 Billboards is a film that that wears the crude and crass as a badge of honour. But McDonagh also adeptly weaves a story that is both surprising and easy to invest in.We see fantastically performed caricatures in the abhorrent Dixon (Sam Rockwell) and the well-meaning but traditional Police Chief (Woody Harrilson). These are well balanced by the more grounded and impressive performances of Frances McDormand, as the gritty and determined Mildred, and Get Out's Caleb Landry Jones. It's a strange, but enjoyable line to walk between the exaggerated and the gritty real.The themes of hope and hopelessness, redemption and damnation, prejudice and and love are all explored on the backdrop of a hyperbolic backwater USA and underpinned by western-esque guitar motifs from composer Carter Burwell of Fargo and True Grit.My only complaint for this film is the occasional misplaced attempt at humour and shock. I understood, and even mentally applauded, McDonaghs signature examination of truths we often shy away from, but also felt that sometimes it was shock for shock's sake. An example would be Peter Dinklage's inclusion as the character James, who seemed to only exist in the plot to present the ritual abuse of his height.Overall this is an incredible concoction of the gritty real with exaggerated fiction and features some stellar performances as a surprising plot unfolds. Some heavy handed shock humour doesn't get close to damaging my appreciation for this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers,"British filmmaker Martin McDonagh's third feature, TBOEM whisks audience off to an American whistle stop of an unspecified time, possibly in the 90s, since the last client of the titular billboards was from 1986 until our protagonist, a grief-driven Mildred Hayes (McDormand), rents them with texts ""Raped while dying"", ""And Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"" painted in crimson red, as a vehement remonstrance to the slow-in-progress investigation of her murdered 20-year-old daughter Angela (Newton).The recipient Police Chief Willoughby (Harrelson, the real top-form supporting player here to spew blood and blow heads), on the other hand, is ailed by the impending mortality in the form of cancer, who is not a slouch professionally speaking, on the contrary, he is beloved by the populace, and expresses his resolution to track down the murderer, unfortunately Angela's case is in paucity of both evidence and witness, teetering on the edge of becoming a cold one, and when he is unable to carry on the investigation, the baton is taken up by Jason Dixon (Rockwell), a racist cop who undergoes a major redemptive turnabout thanks to a letter written by Willoughby.In this bifurcating narrative, one centers on Mildred's militant reactions in the face of the inconsolable bereavement, the ramifications of her contentious advertisement, which bear on the tension between her and her son Robbie (Hedges), ex-husband Charlie (Hawkes, exuding a piercing layer of panache against a formidable McDormand). Scourged by guilt, anguish and grievance, Ms. McDormand reincarnates herself with a tour-de-force seethed with belligerence and compassion, and these two facets' dichotomous incongruence is ambidextrously sublimed into a completely believable persona, a woman who is troublingly reckless, deeply mired in her personal crisis, yet, spurns any throwaway commiserations and homily with razor-sharp astuteness and holds onto the flickering hope of justice in a heartbroken hankering. Oscar No. 2 beckons for this hard-nosed leading lady, a no-bullshitting force of character that quite swims with the topical tide of women's ME TOO movement.Jason's plot is in no way less salient than Mildred (I will defend that he is a co-leading role up to my deathbed), but this less pathbreaking male-white-trash-goes-good thread feels self-pleasing in the milieu albeit Rockwell nails the character to the hilt with his indissoluble commitment, Jason's transmogrification is thematically satisfactory (although his closeted homosexuality doesn't get a bigger canvas to play betrays the film's conservative-pampering disposition, a wasted opportunity for the up-and-coming Caleb Landry Jones as the unbelievably congenial Red Welby, the manager in the advertise company who is unwarrantedly subjected to Jason's heinous physical abuse, the latter's underlying sexual frustration is left only faintly hinted), it almost renders its contrived sensation (Jason obliviously reading the letter when Mildred tossing Molotov cocktails to the police station where he is) extraneous, because we need someone to track down the killer so badly.Therefore, in the end of the day, it is Martin McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling that becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers (this reviewer included), his script flouts conventionalism (yes, pesky kids do need a good kicking!), larded with eccentricity and humor, often when one is least expected (Charlie's 19-year-old new girlfriend Penelope is a hoot, of course, in second-guessing, it is a common tack to find excuse for men in those May-December pairings), and tones down violence but ups his antes in laying bare the complex tie-ins throbbing under the bracket of humanity and morality, warts and all. The truly astonishing but also whip-smart ploy is the open-ended coda, just when we think a climax is in the offing, the film brings down its curtain roundly, what else can top that? As either outcome of Mildred and Jason's vigilante act will look less impactful in the aftermath, a substantial closure may or may not attainable, life can be as misty as the film's opening shots, the cardinal message is that both have found the right path to move on, one has to hand it to Martin McDonagh for its resultant brimming gratification left in its spectator's mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
On Anger And Its Repetitive Consequences,"This crime drama, with more than a dash of McDonagh's trademark black wit, is a film about anger leading to anger and the unintended consequences thereof. It's a beautifully constructed script, character and plot beats paced out with subtle precision; and it looks subtly beautiful, cinematography, colour and lighting coalescing to haunting effects. It feels redundant to say that Frances McDormand is superb; at this point in her career, she's an actor whose excellence is guaranteed. It's also more than a little influenced by the crime dramas of the Coen brothers - in tone, plot and much else, it's easy to imagine this as one of theirs. All the characters in this film feel as if they're trapped in a situation they want out of but can't navigate the way, their solutions are always just out of reach. It's as melancholy as it is funny, and it's never short of compassionate human insight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pick a lane,"Meh. I got in the theatre, didn't expect to be blown away and I wasn't. The characters build-up isn't enough compare to their storyline, which make it less convincing. The movie got no real story to tell, most things happens just because of the right or wrong circumstances, and the whole movie seems kind of pointless in the end. The directors idea I think was to produce the same kind of atmosphere and bizarre humor as in ''In Bruges'' but instead of letting the story itself be the source of laughter much of the jokes are forced in place (some of it very funny though) I get the feeling that the movie think it's both better and funnier than it actually is.

McDonagh's experiment with dark wit and serious crime drama yield intriguing results,"After winning over theatre audiences in the '90s and early 2000s, Martin McDonagh moved into the filmmaking sphere and started racking up even more fans with ""In Bruges"" and the criminally underrated ""Seven Psychopaths,"" two sickly dark comedies lined start to finish with a brilliant albeit twisted humor and sharp dialogue. In ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" McDonagh takes those sensibilities and applies them to much heavier, timely subject matters: justice and police accountability.By infusing a rural crime drama with dark comedy and casting Frances McDormand in the lead role, ""Three Billboards"" will probably earn more than a few sly critics' labels of ""the best Coen Brothers film of the year."" Truthfully, even without McDormand, the comparison would be warranted. McDonagh and the Coens take extremely similar approaches to screenwriting and are drawn to stories about criminals of the unlikely variety.McDormand stars as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced woman in the titular town whose daughter was raped and killed several months back. Feeling as though the case has been completely neglected by the local police department, Mildred buys up the advertising space on three long-vacant billboards outside of town and covers them with a statement indicting Chief of Police Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for inaction. This causes tempers to flare, causing a chain reaction of consequences that go deeper than billboards.There could very easily be a purely dramatic and serious version of this story, but that's not McDonagh. Naturally he wants to bring in his livelier style (and Tarantino-like propensity for violence) to complement the slower, weightier sentimental elements of the story and it takes a little while for the two to gel. The best representation of this struggle comes in Carter Burwell's score, which drops its excellent Western-inspired folk instrumental motif for melodramatic, sappy piano and flute bits when the film slows down for more contemplative, character-driven moments.Gluing it all together is a cast loaded with talents that have bounced between comedy and drama before. In addition to Harrelson and McDormand, there's Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and others who sell both moments of wit and moments of authentic human response. Rockwell in particular as a boneheaded, racist police officer with a violent streak keeps his character believably intact as his pendulum swings in wildly different directions. His character arc will make the film for many and break it for others.Ultimately, McDonagh's writing is as sharp as ever (the two-toned/double-sided foul language is on point). In terms of storytelling, he does fill the plot with lots of contrivances and moments of happenstance, but they create interesting and meaningful situations that force us to think about anger and violence and justice - all the emotions that we experience when we're in pain - and the choices available to us in terms of how we respond.Given the way the story presents as this crime mystery about police accountability, it would be legitimate for anyone to feel there's been somewhat of a bait-and-switch in the direction and resolution of the story, if not a complete lack of sensitivity to those issues. That's because at its core, ""Three Billboards"" isn't really about these timely, socially relevant themes or the rape and murder case itself, but about what the case represents to the characters and how it informs their choices. The details don't matter to McDonagh because the film is about something bigger.In all honesty, that mindset suggests McDonagh's style should probably be reserved to stories that cover less trivial matters, but ""Three Billboards"" gives us enough good insights and performances to warrant the experiment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Three Billboards is Nasty and Vindictive and Only Funny to Those that Enjoy Cruelty,"Does having a daughter brutally murdered give you carte blanche to be rude and vicious to others? That is the question I walked away with after seeing Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The set up is clever, but the delivery is clumsy. And Frances McDormand, who I will always love for Fargo, has one gear in this film: pissed off. Even her grief is pissed off. Some variety in her expressions would have helped.During the film, Mildred (McDormand) lights things and people on fire, she punches people, she insults everyone, and we are supposed to laugh it off or at least forgive her since her daughter was horribly killed. Unfortunately for the writer and director of this film, the world doesn't work that way. The action in the film was forced and lacked credulity.Peter Dinklage's character is sympathetic in ways that the protagonist, Mildred, never is. He's charming in his own shy, bumbling way. And Mildred is just an asshole to him. Mildred's son looks confused and two dimensional. I thought McDormand was standing next to a cardboard cut out of him during some scenes. Woody Harrelson as Police Chief Willoughby is incompetent throughout, though the acting is not terrible. Willoughby has failed to find the killer of Mildred's daughter. Then he fails to prosecute Mildred and Police Officer Dixon for clearly breaking the law. It is not plausible. I will give Sam Rockwell props for a job mostly well done for playing the racist, ignorant sexist and making him multidimensional.Praise the film for being a look at a mother's grief, but don't cheer when she nearly kills someone and treats everyone poorly throughout the film. Rating: Rent it. There is nothing about the film, its music, its look, its staging, to recommend it for the big screen.Peace,

Ebbing away,"I'm not much of a fan of the whole Coen Brothers non-linear method of film making I have to say and identified quite early on that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be. I guess I should have known from the offbeat title and cast that things would go every which way but loose and so it proves.The initial idea of angry mother Frances McDormand broadcasting her frustration at her local police division by paying for three adjacent billboards to highlight their inaction over the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter some seven months previously might have worked in my view, not least as a whodunit, but was soon swamped by the introduction of several unusual characters and as many unlikely situations.So we're introduced soon enough to Woody Harrelson's terminally ill chief of police who McDormand's character names and shames on the billboards, Sam Rockwell as his mother-fixated, redneck deputy, with many more minor characters too numerous to mention, like the dwarf who alibis MacDormand at an important moment in the story, her abusive ex-husband now dating a 19 year old pretty bimbo and the new black chief of police who takes over Harrelson's job and whose first action is to overlook Rockwell's near-murder of the homosexual young owner of the billboard company with whom it's fair to say, he doesn't see eye to eye.The movie is a succession of tangential plot shifts and unbelievable coincidence. No doubt the writer - director was presenting us with themes of forgiveness, redemption and guilt set in the backward-thinking, crazy-quilt Deep South just to double underline these issues and make the viewer think deeply about all this serious existential stuff y'all.Sorry, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting didn't impress me much either, and that includes McDormand's Oscar-winning turn. In the end, for me, it was just another of those eccentric, eclectic films that tries to implant what it thinks are memorable images or extraordinary characters into the viewer's consciousness and by its exaggeration and distortion somehow mirror society in some profound way. All I got from it in the end was a mixed sense of manipulation, confusion and cynicism and how easy it is to put a movie like this together and call it art.Sorry, not for me and you can broadcast that on any billboard you care to mention.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Vidiot Reviews....,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriWithout roadside billboards out of control vehicles would just careen into an empty farmer's pasture.Luckily, the small-town in this drama has an excess of advertisement opportunity.Fuming over the fact that the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) still hasn't arrested any suspects in the rape/murder of her teenage daughter 7-months ago, Mildred (Frances McDormand) purchases ad space on three billboards and uses them to taunt the sheriff and his inept and racist deputy (Sam Rockwell).Messing with the authorities, however, only brings the hammer down harder on Mildred, her family and her friends. Fortunately, everyone else in Ebbing is as fed up with the law enforcement as her.In spite of its many strong performances and complex script that blends comedy with tragedy, this fictitious narrative comes off slightly unrealistic, malicious and almost laughable at the end.Besides, to really distract drivers from the road you need 3 digital billboards.

"A meditation on pain, anger and three billboards","British writer/director Martin McDonagh caused a sensation with the release of his explosively brilliant debut film In Bruges and while the underrated Seven Psychopaths flew under the radar a little, expectations were still high for his latest effort, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That title might appear a little clunky but it is those titular billboards that act as a catalyst for everything that happens within the film.Haunted by grief and fuelled by a dull rage, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) hires three billboards to express her disgust that the local police force have failed to catch her daughters murderer. Police Chief William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is the main source of her ire and the situation isn't helped by his right hand man Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a violent racist with psychopathic tendencies. The erecting of the billboards has a domino effect that takes this story to a myriad of surprising places. McDonagh is not afraid to rip up the rule book half way through and while this can be jarring, it means that Three Billboards is a film that demands your attention.The cast are quite simply a tour de force. McDormand is terrifying but vulnerable as Mildred and Sam Rockwell channels everything he has got to somehow make himself unlikable. No mean feat for one of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood. Woody Harrelson is more measured in his performance but just as effective and the three of them together share an electric chemistry.McDonagh has always demanded a suspension of disbelief in his films and the violence here threatens to stray into the category of cartoonish but he mostly succeeds in crafting a tale that takes the best of Tarantino and the Coen Brothers to produce something fresh and compelling. McDonagh showed on In Bruges that you can combine comedy with real drama if you have the skill to do so and while the comedic elements are toned down in Three Billboards, there were still moments that made me laugh out loud.Three Billboards is a film about blurred lines. Lines between sanity and loss of control, lines between good and bad, lines between life and death. Not everybody is all evil and not everybody is all good. By presenting a tableau of morally ambiguous characters coping with grief and pain, McDonagh has produced the best film of his career to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

After her daughter is raped and murdered and there have been no suspects arrested Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) takes the bold step of renting three billboards and publicly asking the police chief why! This film should have been depressing given the subject matter, and in parts it was sad, poignant and moving, but it was also a very funny film. This was due largely to Frances McDormand, who is very skilled in her craft, Woody Harrelson who brings good leadership and great compassion to the role of the Police Chief and Sam Rockwell who produced an amazing piece of acting to give us the character of Jason Dixon, a man who should never have graduated the Police Academy. I enjoyed this from the very moment it began until the very moment it finished and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone who wants to see some good film making, undertaken by good actors, performing a good story.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Excellent,Perfect performance in a great movie. She really deserved the Oscar win for this so I'm glad to see that she did win it. The movie is also very good and well written. The other actors do a good job as well. I'm surprised more people haven't seen this because it was very well done.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Almost perfect...I mean almost,"Well, this movie was totally a different Genre compare to all the CGI movies these day running's. Basically, after seeing all these so called comical movies, it's been a long time when a movie with real humans, with real human issues, real human tragedies to watch is a feast. I believe the major set back for this movie was, when the director decided to give it a black comedy genre. Basically, this could be as good as Francis McDormand Fargo, but I believe she still should win Oscar for her performance in this movie too. This movie shouldn't treat as black comedy. Everything about this movie, cinematography, direction, acting especially all the leading characters, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell and of course the very best Francis McDormand did an awesome job. Except with a few major flaws, first and foremost the comedy part of the movie, there isn't anything wrong in few dialogues, but labeling it black comedy for me took away the essence of this movie, this movie could be very, very tragic. Second, it could be possible that a racist cop could have a change of heart from a dead Supervisor letter, but practically not possible. So, if both characters allowed to grow and Woody character instead of just letter showed his love by his actions, could have made it more believable. Overall, the movie was really awesome and one of the best so far in 2017, especially amongst all those humans animated super hero movies. Before this I really like Jackie Chan The Foreginer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

if you don't understand that its an exaggerated/caricature example of small town america/ global short comings regarding serious crimes then dont make a review!! This filme is not for you...
if you want to see a top tier film that has all main and supporting characters shine like everyone in the real world does then give this a watch
if you enjoy great cinematography to give this a watch

A dark portrayal of a town and a woman seeking justice,"Outside of a small Missouri town, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), a local resident rents three billboards that she uses to criticise the popular town sheriff (Woody Harrelson) because there've been no arrests following the rape and murder of her daughter 7 months earlier. The sheriff himself is dying of cancer with this confrontation setting the town against Mildred.This moody and extraordinary black comedy is led by an outstanding performance by McDormand with her tight pursed expression telling us all that we need to know about her.Dysfunction runs through many of the characters in this film that is laid bare. Sam Rockwell is explosive as the sheriff's loyal, but unpredictable deputy whose character is stripped away as the film develops. The film portrays the locale in a dark, vivid and funny way in an ultimately very satisfying film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The sign of times,"The best movie of 2017! This movie is packed with dark humor, complex characters and terrific acting. It's better to know as little as possible before watching this movie. One hell of performance by Frances Mcdormand. There is a genius in the way she commands every scene. She is supported by admirable performances from Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson , Abbie Cornish, and Peter Dinklage. All of them give a fine performance but it's Rockwell's role as a tortured cop that leaves a lasting impression on you well after you are done with the movie. Martin Mcdonagh deserves all the credit for writing and directing with such finesse. This movie is one hell of a ride with it's twists and turns. Must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This is my favorite movie I have seen in the past five years,"I absolutely loved Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. This movie is incredibly provocative and includes gripping social commentary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unpredictability is something rarely found in films,"Three Billboards is wonderfully unique in the way that it could change my mind about characters and expectations of the plot multiple times during the film. The audience is always guessing, never sure of where it will go next. It is better to go into this film and know as little as possible about its story so its twists and turns can have their full surprising impact. So it's your choice as to whether to even bother reading on.Three billboards in short is the story of an angry bereaved mother who demands the attention of the local police through her provocative billboards. The story begins and wastes no time within the first ten minutes establishing Frances McDormand's character Mildred, the rape and murdered of her daughter and Mildred's outrage at local police's lack of action. Admittedly, I wondered how the next hour and forty-five minutes could be filled if it continued being so succinct. However, it morphs from black comedy, to emotional drama, to crime mystery so you're always wondering where the story will go next. Moreover, the film didn't stick to the perspective to one character adding to its unpredictability.There was brilliant complexity in each of the characters. Audiences are shown many aspects of each of their lives. This gives the characters you would in any other film hate more depth forcing you to empathise and change your first opinions of them. There was real humanity in each person no fake perfection everyone was morally ambiguous. It is incredibly well cast but the stand out has to be McDormand's performance and the way she delivers her acidic retorts to anyone questioning Mildred's behaviour. She brings mostly fiery anger but is equally successful in giving glimpses of Mildred's sensitivity and pain. Sam Rockwell (Dixon) and Woody Harrelson (Willoughby) also give great performances because as a viewer you want to dislike them but you are made to soften towards them the more you find out.It is astounding to me that this is only Martin McDonagh's third feature film he has directed himself. However, he was also the writer which I think was greatly beneficial as he knew best how to direct the cast with his own script resulting in artful performances. The dialogue in this movie can be angry, witty, clever and very human. Of course, any viewer would never forget Mildred's shocking but hilarious speech to a priest leaving him lost for words. A real highlight.To write any more would be to spoil such a rare example of an unpredictable film. My concluding thoughts on the film were the overarching messages. I felt what came through very clearly was the theme of anger and how no character's life was in any way improved through acts of anger. No character won or ended up in a better situation than any other. The whole film was entirely ambiguous and left open for the audience to ponder upon. Nothing was neatly tied up or resolved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another great movie from Martin McMcDonag,"Martin McDonagh despite having made very few films, just two before this (""7 psychopaths"" and ""Bruges""), with each of them has proved to be a great director, I'm sorry a little fot the fact that he worked ""little"", but better only three and excellent movies than thirty mediocre.
And even with this ""Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" McDonagh is able to do a good job, indeed in this case it could be promoted to extraordinary work; it is not in fact difficult to define it his best film.
A very powerful film, strong, even quite heavy but still engaging that manages to tell a truly incredible story in a very credible and human.
Human, powerful but at the same time also a bit 'cold and perhaps this is one of the few flaws that can be attributed, the director in fact, probably with the fear of exaggeration and finally realize a feel-good movie has tried as much as possible not push too much on emotion. As much as I appreciate this (the tearful films are not really my kind) I have to say that I would have preferred more attention on the feelings, do not get me wrong but in some moments I felt a certain distance / coldness of the director and due of which the film fails to completely displace the viewer or to make him excite as much as it could.
With all this I do not want to discredit the film, cause , it is a great movie, as I said in the first lines.
The direction, apart from that, is really remarkable, especially from the point of view more visual and technical, the shots are, in fact, extraordinary: extremely precise, clean, suggestive. Some of the images in the film are truly unforgettable.
The interpretation of the protagonist, Frances McDormand, is also unforgettable, an actress whom I particularly appreciate and who in this case has really given her best, has entered perfectly in her character and succeeds, thanks to her expressions and incredibly convincing looks, to be credible as few would have succeeded.
Also I was speechless to see a Sam Rockwell so good, has always been a difficult actor for me to appreciate mainly for his face that reeks of second best (although I have already appreciated him in ""The Way Way Back"" while I still have to see him in "" Moon""), but with this film I completely changed my mind, he really surprised me a lot.
While Woody Harrelson I have always thought totally the opposite and with this role is interpretation has only reconfirmed his skill.
A special mention goes to the truly extraordinary, captivating, mature, sharp and profound script.

"Brilliant, dark, and hilarious","This film follows the story of dedicated mother Mildred who longs to find the rapist and murderer of her daughter after police chief Willoughby discontinues the search. She purchases three billboards to bring the towns attention to the unfinished case. The witty, belligerent, cold-hearted woman you meet in the trailer is truly what you get, though Frances Mcdormand is not the only star of the show. Sam Rockwell (Dixon), Woody Harrelson (Chief Willoughby), and Caleb Landry Jones (Red) are not far behind. Already sporting some nice golden globes, I see Oscar noms (and possibly wins) in the near future for some of these roles. Needless to say, this was so unexpectedly good! I did enjoy Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" but not nearly as much as I enjoyed ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". This movie includes the same cold, dark humor, quick twists and unexpected turns but in a much more impactful way. ""Three Billboards..."" hits on both the abuse of authority in America and human and civil rights. It even does so in a way that doesn't smack you in the face so you can still enjoy the film and the story it tells.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Three swear words, I mean Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri","In reviewing this movie I feel the need to declare that I grew up in a very caring family. My inability to relate to the family dynamics in this story may mean that my judgement of the character's intentions is somewhat clouded. Having made this disclaimer let's get down to the movie itself.Having watched the trailer I imagined I would be watching a story about police incompetence and the justice sought by a grieving mother who had lost her daughter to a horrible crime. During the movie, that whole premise is turned on its head. Frances McDormand plays the victims mother, Mildred, who is frustrated that the local police have been unable to catch her daughters' killer. To stir up the community she has messages placed on three billboards near her home questioning why the police have not solved the crime. In the final message, she specifically mentions Chief Willoughby, Woody Harrelson, who is the respected Chief of Police. Coming to the defence of his boss is Deputy Dixon who comes across as red neck momma's boy played exceptionally by Sam Rockwell. This all leads to a lot of controversy and splits the community.As the movie progresses any endearment I had for Mildred fades as she shows that she is willing to take actions that hurt others to achieve her objective. A flashback scene makes you wonder if she is taking this stand to obtain justice for her daughter or to appease her own guilt. Other interactions with both a sick Chief Willoughby and her son have me questioning whether Mildred's resentment of the world was a result of dealing with her child's death or was she always like that. For McDormand to take a character that should have us feel sympathy for her and make me dislike her so much shows her wonderful acting ability.There are a number of unexpected twists and turns that allow Deputy Dixon to move on from his obnoxious small-town lawman role but don't expect miracles. Especially after you meet his disturbing mother, wonderfully played by Sandy Martin. The scene in the Dentist's surgery and Dixon's attack on Red Welby had me cringing in my seat and with the frequent use of every swear word that you can think of it is understandable why it has an MA rating. Just when you think that Mildred and Dixon may be on the road to redemption they make a decision that shows their true colours. While the film leaves you hanging, I am prepared to see the worst in these two characters and am sure they would have followed through.Writer and Director, Martin McDonagh, has made a number of black comedies with many of this cast also appearing in his movie Seven Psychopaths.I am giving this film 7 friends out of 10 due to its strong acting and the fact that there are a number of twists that keep you guessing about everyone's motives.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Really!,"I went to this movie expecting good things after it won several awards and was so highly praised. Frances McDormand succeeds in making a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered be completely unsympathetic. I have seen a few plays written by Martin McDonagh so I know he can be dark but come on..........do people in the movie business really think everyone in flyover country is a rube, hayseed, racist, wife beater? Do teenage boys regularly call their mother ""cunt"" to her face? On what planet do these people live? I have a suggestion for Hollywood film-makers who want to show how sophisticated and edgy they are. Make a movie about Harvey Weinstein and all his Hollywood cohorts who turned a blind eye to his antics.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Expected and unexpected, but worth seeing :)","The story is great and all characters in it. Everyone is briliant, especially Frances McDormand. She is good in every scene, in every word and in every reaction. Before watching the movie I had in my mind that my votes will go to W.Harrelson not to S.Rockwell, but after seeing it, it goes completely to Rockwell, although I am not his fan in any way. Why?! Because he is almost in every of his roles very negative from a bottom, but in here as a Dixon, he is everything in one and after all an honest guy. It is worth seeing, cause it is absolutely full of unexpected and expected things which can happen in someone's life and about the human reactions with which we have to find the way how to handle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Is somehow both enormous fun and utterly heart-wrenching,"Along an overgrown, disused highway somewhere outside Ebbing, Missouri, three formerly dilapidated billboards still bearing the torn remains of whatever advertisement was previously displayed there over a decade ago, have suddenly sprang back into life. Only the messages delivered aren't in the name of some big-name brand or local company, but they are the deliberately confrontational words of grieving, thoroughly pissed-off mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). The first billboard reads 'Raped While Dying', followed by 'And Still No Arrests', and finally 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?' The opening scenes of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which see Mildred negotiate a deal with businessman Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) and quickly install the provocative messages, set up a David-versus-Goliath story, in which a justice-seeking woman sets out to shame and spring into action the police department she feels has failed her following the brutal rape and murder of her daughter.Yet, this being a film written and directed by Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, the kind of story suggested in the trailer is only the tip of a far more engaging and complex iceberg, and one that isn't afraid to take you to some incredibly dark places and urge you to accept the redemption of a truly repulsive character. The police department, led by family man and all-round likeable pillar of the community Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), take the billboards as a declaration of war, but Willoughby, being a sensible officer of the law, pays a visit to Mildred for some one-on-one time in the hope of resolving the matter peacefully. They chat almost like old friends, or former lovers who have stayed on good terms, but Mildred is unmovable in her quest. Even the revelation that Willoughby has terminal cancer and is close to death isn't enough for Mildred to think twice about her actions, and it turns out that she was already privy to this information before renting the boards. ""They won't be as effective after you croak,"" she admits, almost like it's her way of apologising.The role of Mildred was written specifically with McDormand in mind, and the result is her best performance since 1996's Fargo and will surely bring her second Oscar win come March. The first time we lay eyes on her she is marching into town like a gunslinger seeking revenge, dressed in blue overalls and sporting a tightly-wound bandanna. Despite the pleas of her teenage son Robbie (Lucas Hedges), who is bullied in school because of his mother's antics and performance on the local news station, as well as threats from the drunken, racist Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), Mildred is unwavering in her strides for justice. Even her deplorable, wife-beating ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes) voices his disapproval, but it all falls of deaf ears. Yet despite her questionable methods and finger-pointing at a police department who seem to have genuinely run into a dead end with the case, you stay with her until the end. I can't think of any other actress working today who could pull of a feat with such conviction, especially when dealing with a character who spends most of the movie keeping her real emotions close to her chest, or channelling them into rage.McDonagh views small-town America as tightly-knit and full of big characters, a place where everybody knows everybody and gossip spreads like wildfire. In many ways, Three Billboards shares much in common with Calvary, the under-appreciated effort by the director's brother John Michael from 2014, and is structured almost like an ensemble piece. By bringing in a wealth of colourful supporting characters, played by the likes of Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish, Kerry Condon and Clarke Peters, as well as those already mentioned, McDonagh can explore themes of anger, bitterness, loss and loneliness on a far grander scale. While the wonderfully obscenity-laden script will keep you both laughing and wincing throughout the running-time, the film is at its most compelling when showing genuine compassion for the characters inhabiting the story. It refuses to judge anybody too harshly, even peeling back the layers of the most loathsome character in the story, the permanently hungover Dixon, who is played by a career-best Sam Rockwell. Three Billboards somehow manages to be both enormous fun and utterly heart-wrenching, and coming off the back of the underwhelming Seven Psychopaths, this is a huge stride in the right direction for the enormously talented McDonagh.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
another McDonagh classic,"Greetings again from the darkness. Once out of our teen years (though some take a bit longer), the vast majority of us accept the obvious truth to the adage ""life is not fair"". Despite this, we never outgrow our desire for justice when we feel wronged. Uber- talented playwright/screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh delivers a superb drama blended with a type of dark comedy that allows us to deal with some pretty heavy, and often unpleasant small town happenings.Oscar winner Frances McDormand plays Mildred, a grieving mother whose daughter was abducted and violently murdered. With the case having gone cold, Mildred is beyond frustrated and now desperate to prevent her daughter from being forgotten. To light the proverbial fire and motivate the local police department to show some urgency in solving her daughter's case, Mildred uses the titular billboards to make her point and target the Police Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson).The billboards cause quite the ruckus as the media brings extra attention, which in turn creates conflict between Mildred and the police department, the town citizens, and even her own son (Lucas Hedges). The film could have been titled 'The Wrath of Mildred' if not for so many other facets to the story and characters with their own layers. Her anger is certainly understandable, though some of her actions are impossible to defend. Things can never again be square in the life of a parent who has lost a child, yet vengeance is itself a lost cause.Mr. McDonagh's exceptional script utilizes twisted comedy to deal with the full spectrum of dark human emotions: managing the deepest grief, anger, guilt, and need for revenge. As in his Oscar winning script for the contemporary classic IN BRUGES (2008), his dialogue plays as a strange type of poetry, delivering some of the most harsh and profane lines in melodic fashion. In addition to his nonpareil wordsmithing, Mr. McDonagh and casting director Sarah Finn have done a remarkable job at matching many talented performers with the characters ‚Äì both large roles and small.Following up her Emmy winning performance in ""Olive Kitteridge"", Ms. McDormand is yet again a force of nature on screen. She would likely have dominated the film if not for the effectively understated portrayal by Mr. Harrelson, and especially the best supporting performance of the year courtesy of Sam Rockwell. His Officer Dixon is a racist with out-of-control anger issues who still lives with his mom (a brilliant Sandy Martin, who was also the grandma in NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE). Caleb Landry Jones once again shows his uncanny ability to turn a minor role into a character we can't take our eyes off (you'll remember his screen debut as one of the bike riding boys near the end of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Here he plays Red, the owner of the billboards with an inner desire to carry some clout. Rounding out the absurdly deep cast are Zeljko Ivanek, Kerry Condon, Lucas Hedges (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA), Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Abbie Cornish, and Clarke Peters (the epitome of a new Sheriff in town). Every actor has at least one moment (and monologue) to shine, and one of the best scenes (of the year) involves Nick Searcy as a Priest getting schooled on ""culpability"" by Mildred.Cinematographer Ben Davis has a nice blend of ""big"" movies (AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON) and small (TAMARA DREWE) in his career, and here he really captures the feel of the small town and interactions of the characters. Also adding to the film's excellence is the folksy, western score (with a touch of dueling gunfighters) by Carter Burwell. And keeping the streak alive ¬Ö it's yet another worth-watching film featuring a Townes Van Zandt song.Not many films dare tackle the list of topics and issues that are touched on here: church arrogance, police violence, racism, cancer, domestic violence, questioning the existence of God, parental grief with a desire for revenge, the weight of a guilty conscience, and the influence of parents in a rural setting. The film is superbly directed by Mr. McDonagh, who now has delivered two true classics in less than a decade. It's the uncomfortable laughs that make life in Ebbing tolerable, but it's the pain and emotions that stick with us long after the credits roll. Sometimes we need a reminder that fairness in the world should not be expected, and likely does not exist. If that's true, what do we do with our anger? McDonagh offers no easy answers, because there are none. But he does want us to carefully consider our responses.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Too Far Out!,"I'm giving this a decent grade because it kept my attention from beginning to end. The thing one shouldn't do is to think too much. McDormand's character actually gets away with murder (not in the literal sense). She does things to people, especially those who had nothing to be ashamed of, that are beyond the pale. I appreciated that Woody Harrelson's sheriff is not unsympathetic. He is a pretty good guy. He tried to solve the case, but he is right when it comes to finding no clues. By the way, is anyone reading this growing a little tired of the ""F"" word being used in every other syllable of speech. The cops, townspeople, McDormand, on and on, can't say three words without dropping one of these. Is no effort made to create realistic speech among characters? Almost every police movie or movie with tough guys bends over backward to throw as much profanity around. I'm no prude, but I believe most people go through their days without this heavy artillery. I went to a supermarket yesterday, filled with all kinds of people, and didn't hear the ""F"" word once. Outside of that, if one accepts the premise of this film, it's tragic to watch this woman in her state of rage and guilt. She is a victim, but has no qualms about inflicting venom on others, including children. The police are ineffectual and one, Dixon, is a caricature. He is a great caricature, but so over the top, it's hard to imagine someone like him existing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the best movies of 2017! (Spoiler free review),"I saw this movie because I knew of its Oscar buzz and I wanted to see if it's worth it. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tels the story of Mildred Hayes who 7 months after her daughter died and with the police not doing anything to try to catch the culprit, she posts three billboards to let anyone know how incompetent the police men are. From there the whole town jumps on her and we got ourselves a movie.This movie reminded me of other great movies that I saw, because the movie itself is very realistic and very original in its concept, you know the feeling when you watch too much garbage for too long and then a diamond like this movie comes along and reminds you that there can be great movies every year. It also takes you in directions that you never expected the movie to go (I mean literally, not like Star Wars The Last Jedi where there were no new directions) and pretty much reminded me of movies like The Dark Knight or Fight Club or Shawshank Redemption for instance. I was at times ""Wow, I was completely not expecting that and that is awesome!"" due to some unexpected twist and due to the fact that the story always had something new to offer and show to me. Another thing I'd like to point out are the performances which were all top-notch. Starting with Frances McDormand who was just awesome in this role and I understand why she got nominated for an oscar (which she'll probably win too), then Sam Rockwell who was just brilliant in his character which evolved throughout the movie, then Woody Harrelson too and not to forget to mention Peter Dinklage who for the amount of screen time he gets does a magnificent job with his performance. Another thing that I really appreciated in the movie was the vulgarity. Now hold your horses... I'm not saying that I like a movie more if it has language vulgarity I'm just saying I liked how and when it was used in this film. It wasn't like F-bomb here and there all the time to make the movie more bad-ass because it has vulgarity and not a good story but it was used with finese only when it should have been. I mean persons that had a motive for using it were using it or if the situation (like the trailer shows) needed vulgarity in order to get some things straight (unlike in Logan where it was used just to improve the movie while being never encountered in any Wolverine movie before). The score was also very good... and it was really nice to see a realistic movie having a great score, it really amplifies the overall value of the movie. If I had one problem with the movie, it might be the ending which for me was a little underwhelming but it didn't ruin the overall enjoyment I had with this movie.In conclusion, really great movie with great story, performances and music worthy of all the nominations it got and worthy of many wins also because this movie is along with Dunkirk my favorite movie of 2017. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Vengeance is mine,"Martin McDonagh has directed a clever crime drama with black humour which tips a wink to the Coen brothers. Although as a writer McDonagh's screenplay also has some holes which are difficult to gloss over.The Coen brothers link is maintained by a powerfully bitter performance from Frances McDormand. She plays Mildred whose teenage daughter was murdered almost a year earlier and the police have got nowhere with their investigations.Mildred takes matters into her own hands and creates a spark of incendiary dynamite, by hiring three billboards to shame the Ebbing chief of police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to action. Her action shocks and shames the small town, the local police do not take well to Mildred's action especially as Willoughby is dying of cancer.Hot headed police officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who got away with beating up a black suspect thinks he can bully Mildred. He certainly intimidates the man who rented out the billboards. However he finds that this grieving mother is too hard boiled for him.There is almost a freewheeling style to this film although if you are familiar with McDonagh's previous film, that a lot of it comes together at the end. Despite the bleak subject, there is a lot of humour here as well as tenderness.It is terrifically acted from the main leads, McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson all got Oscar nominations.You also get good performances from other actors in smaller roles such as Caleb Landry Jones as Red the advertising agent who rents the billboards out and gets thrown out of the window for his troubles. Also John Hawkes as Mildred's ex husband who left her for a teenage girl.However you also have outward display of brutality from a serving police officer.

"A film of sorrow and pain, yet thru outspoken challenge and determination comes hope.","So far this year out of all the dramas that I've watched ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" has to be the best. As the film is very dark for the way it shows human nature with plenty of sorrow and pain. On the other side the film is blended with dark outspoken black heart type comedy! The performances are near all pro as the on screen chemistry is top notch form with veterans Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, and Frances McDormand(perhaps her best role ever).Set in Ebbing, Missouri in this small town a brutal murder has just taken place that being of a young teenage girl and her mother Mildred(Frances)has chosen to take matters into her own hands by putting up three billboards right in the heart of town to show the locals and also to question authorities as to why the brutal murder and rape of her daughter is still unsolved, as most of all she calls out the local sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson).After this the whole town and media starts to take notice and Mildred will not back down as she puts up with county politics and the red tape from the corrupt and mostly white bread police department. Fun and a pleasure to watch is the conflict and coming to terms that Mildred has with deputy Dixon(in a real head turner from Sam Rockwell)who's a go against the grain local cop who's a little slow with smarts and grammar yet he does the job his way.Overall this is a film of pain and grief and it's a truth seeker, yet it's a stand up outspoken showcase that shows be blunt and outspoken as when answers are needed do it your way and you often have to go against the grain just like the Mildred character. Overall this is one of the better crime dramas I've seen in awhile as it searches for answers and seeks truth in an old fashioned outspoken and blunt kind of way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Heavy and Hilarious,"If Martin McDonagh wasn't already on your ""great new writers/directors"" list after In Bruges' steady increase in popularity (holy crap, that was nine years ago!? Does ""new"" still apply?), Three Billboards should cement him on it. I think this film will go down as one of the more underrated gems of the year, and slowly gain popularity as time goes on, similar to the aforementioned In Bruges and what I hope for last year's The Nice Guys.The movie is a dark comedy, through and through, and it supplies ample amounts of both. The movie does get heavy, but even in the darkest moments, keeps the audience smiling with the consistent off- beat, biting, witty remarks from its equally colorful characters. I keep bringing it up, but if you've seen In Bruges, you know the drill here. Tonally, Three Billboards is of course similar, but not at all a rehash. There's plenty of new content and characters to digest here.Speaking of the characters, the cast is perfect in this movie. Each of the headliners (McDormand, Harrelson, Rockwell) is three- dimensional, and they all get their share of comedic and dramatic scenes. All three are perfect. This is one of the best acted movies I've seen all year.There were a few points throughout the movie where some particularly abrupt drama/comedy tonal shifts felt a bit awkward, and as a result the intended comedic effect didn't land like it otherwise would have. For the most part, the film (and McDonagh's work as a whole) pulls this off adroitly-and let's be honest, it's a tough tactic to consistently pull off. All in all, the movie will make you sad, it will make you angry, and it will make you laugh, occasionally all at the same time. It also has something genuine to say about the dichotomy of anger and love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

a movie should be given the oscar,"I will be honest. I lived in US for over 20 years, but I cannot follow completely the dialog, the culture background and some logic in this movie. But felt whole heartedly why the characters in the movies act the way they act. This is the power of the movie, I think it goes beyond language.It seemed so to incomprehensible to a person with modern concept why they are so full of hatred, full of discrimination and always resort to violence to solve their problem. But to me, it is just a indication of how people feel so week inside wanted to be heard. A mom of a victim of crime, a cop with failed grade and low IQ, a midget, a gay agent... They stood their ground, defending their position helplessly and ridiculously, but yet they found (eventually) a peace inside from each other.The depth of emotion that reflects the human nature is so strong that you cannot ignore it.The oscar, as it turns out now that went to the shape of water, should, by comparison, have given to this one. And I think Woody deserves an oscar too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a flawed but entertaining drama,"Don't get fooled by the categorizations. This is not a crime thriller or a comedy. It's more like a classical greek drama, with violence, intrigue, pathos and comedy in equal parts.
Some of the parts are extremely well executed: the violence and comedy stand out, and Frances McDormand leads the way in both. As a grieving and p***ed-off mother who just lost her daughter to a rape/murder, she is emotional, forceful and displays the unhinged, seemingly calm, no-nonsense behavior of people who have nothing left to lose.
Other parts are less convincing: the intrigue is without an ending, and some of the pathos lacks believability. I was left wondering about the ending, and the late reconciliation between Mildred and Dixon did not convince me. 
The movie was helped along by good supporting cast appearances by Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage (whose character was under-developed) and Clarke Peters. 
Some themes of the movies touch on racism, exclusion, and male chauvinism, but the execution could have been more powerful.
Quite a few scenes stand out where Frances McDormand as Mildred tells her truth to the town (the police chief, the advertising guy, her ex, her son, and a few others) in a way that merges comedy and tragedy that was touching and funny at the same time. This for me was the memorable part of the movie.
Overall a watchable movie, but no masterpiece - and please forget the references about Fargo or other Coen brothers' movies: the tenor and perspective are different.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Entertaining, but a little forced in parts","Three Billboards sets up its protagonist's reputation as an unfearing ball-breaker right from the start; A hard-faced Frances McDormand swaggers into the office of an advertising agency, and with a wad of cash and a toilet-mouth, obtains three disused billboards with the plan to shame the police officers responsible for her daughter's murder case into action.The film is fast paced, dynamically shot and well acted, with a twisty plot and a cast of flawed, but likable characters who shift and challenge expectations. I mostly enjoyed it, but I couldn't shake some niggling problems with the screenplay.Much of the 'humour' relies on characters being needlessly acerbic to one another, flinging vulgar insults and random groin kicks around for a cheap laugh, which for the first 40 minutes of character set up, feels contrived, tedious and unrealistic. It doesn't take long to see a pattern emerge in these exchanges, which always show Mildred coming out on top, usually by just dropping an F-bomb and swaggering out of the room. You know, for example, as soon as the parish priest comes round for tea, that it won't be long before she makes some barb about buggering alter boys. The audience I watched it with laughed a lot at these moments, but I found myself barely making a smirk.What also bothered me was the blatant leftist social justice propaganda behind a lot of this. It's like Mildred sometimes just becomes a meme-megaphone for 'sticking it to the man', in this case the useless white cops who are presented as a bunch of dumb, redneck racists ""too busy torturing black people"" to do what's right. The director may as well have dressed her in a Black Lives Matter T-shirt (I suppose it's no coincidence Mildred, always clad in overalls, bears a resemblance to the ubiquitous ""We Can Do It"" poster).Those gripes aside, the second half of the film really opens up the character arcs with an unexpected turn that delivers more unexpected turns, higher stakes and the potential for redemption. Throughout the film, McDormand delivers a stellar performance that shows vulnerability beneath her hard exterior and the supporting actors do a terrific job. Recommended, but not a Best Picture winner for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Writer And Director Martin McDonagh (who's previous films were In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths) returns with his latest film ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and in all seriousness it is the best film he has done. It's no wonder why this film is getting awards left right and center.The plot is as good and simple as it can be: Mildred is depressed and grieving over the killing and rape of her daughter. She lives in a world of misery and in a world where she will never smile nor say anything nice to anybody. She is a grieving Mother who decides to challenge the authorities to find her daughter's killer by putting up Three Billboards. The local Sheriff(s) get really annoyed with this and start to take action.Frances McDormand plays Mildred and she takes on the role so so well! She could have played the whole movie in such a depressed way (which is exactly how her character is), but she decides to be a depressed, broken Mother making witty and crude jokes around every corner, and Frances McDormand does it so well! It's as if the role was written for her. Woody Harrelson plays Willoughby, a local Sheriff who is very tough, but at the same time can sympathize with Mildred. He plays his role so well and steals the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie lies in the hands of Sheriff Dixon (played by Sam Rockwell.) Dixon comes across as a cold blooded monster who does nothing but drink all day and live with his mother, but the more we get to know his character the more we start to realize he's not a little mummy's boy who is mean and drunk, it all starts showing just how good at his job he really is. Dixon is also a racist person, but as more stuff happens to him during the film we start to realize he opens up to reality and life a little more. Sam Rockwell is also another reason I believe they wrote this character for!All in all this will be my last review of this year. But the music is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful, the editing is astounding and like I said before the acting is amazing. Without spoiling the ending this movie has a strong message ""How far will you go for revenge?"" But Frances Mcdormand and Sam Rockwell totally deserve the Oscar for their roles.The movie could have been an all through drama, but Martin McDonagh decides instead of making us all focus on all the depression ad pain he decides to make us have a chuckle and laugh at least every minute or two! It's all thanks to the actors for making it all dramatic and comedic at the same time! Absolutely stunning film. I'm giving it 5/5 stars. If you haven't seen it go and see it. You will not be disappointed. I loved every second of it. Jay (one of The Autistic Reviewers).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"I honestly don't remember rating a movie 10/10. Most are not that close to ideal. ""Ebbing"" is.","Woah, didn't see that coming. I have stumbled across a perfect movie. I honestly can't remember the last time I gave 10 out of 10, because almost all of them could be better in some small but important regard.But this is one of those rarest of times when the perfect score seems only fitting. ""Ebbing"" is such a joy in more than one way, unexpected pleasure bomb of a movie, a magnificent achievement in every major aspect, that could not be better in any realistic way.I mean, theoretically everything could be better in some way, but I stress ""any realistic way"". The makers seem to have achieved everything they were aiming for, and they aimed for top marks.You could call it a black comedy and that's surely how the have promoted it, but like the best of what modern cinema and series have to offer, it doesn't really cling to any strict genre.There's comedy, mostly the sort of what many would call cruel, but funny and always razor sharp. There's some moving, authentic drama that will just break your silly little heart. And although there's not much action, there's also at least a hint of violence - the delicious, movie-style violence which will shock you at times but is eminently watchable all the same.And all that is built on irresistible cocktail of writer-director clearly on top of his game, knowing exactly what he has wants to show and say, and then letting it happen through story, dialogue and performances so precisely formed, striking, original and enjoyable that it makes most of the other movies seem kind of amateurish (2017 or any other year, take your pick).""Ebbing"" also has a helluva cast of thespians, including Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Zelijko Ivanek... Or movie lover's dream for short, every performer committed and on his/her usual top quality level.No point of waxing lyrical about all of their virtues, this is the best ensemble any moviemaker - or, indeed, viewer - could ask for. I will save you and myself some time and just say: they will make you glad that you are movie lover.It's not acting, it's the gates of heaven opening up and sending you your own personal Frances McDormand, one of the best actresses in the history of American movies, ready to insult and attack you (verbally) in myriad inventive ways. Supported by so many great performances by others that you wouldn't have enough fingers to count them all.McDonagh has not only added a lot of colorful characters - it's not an achievement in itself - but has also given attention to and found room for everybody, so they feel like a meaningful addition to what's happening on screen.Even the smaller roles by actors that I haven't even mentioned feel like they are justified to exist, they are not just helping to move the plot along. Everybody feels like a human being, not a character or plot device.And all this is done, somehow, with McDormand's character surely in the center, never losing sight from her story and importance of tying everything together. That's a masterclass in writing if there ever was one!Not to mention the dialogue which is always fresh, brutal in its honesty and always able to surprise you a little. The same goes to story itself, which finds a lot of ways to surprise, and not twist and turn as you would yould expect.All this yakking, and I haven't even mentioned that the story is deep too. This dimension is what gives the movie its true flavor, and at the same time makes it hard to stomach to many.On this deeper level, ""Ebbing"" is about the irrational rage that is eating the modern man, you, me and seemingly everybody.We have no natural enemies, many of us find no ways to spend the adrenaline that our bodies create, and very few of us have been taught from the childhood to understand our aggressive tendencies, or to deal with them.Even worse, the society actively encourages to push it down and act like it's not there. No wonder there's a lot of pent-up anger not obedient to reasoning, always looking for the safe target to shoot at and get at least a moment of relief.And being in the vicious circle of it, or personally inclined to attach to it and identify yourself through it, one can't hope for it to just go away. It's one of the biggest problem of the modern society, really, and high time someone showed that on screen.Writer-director Martin McDonagh has previously entertained us with 2008's ""In Bruges"" and 2012's ""Seven Psychopaths"", both mixing action, drama and comedy, both original and pretty, pretty good.But ""Ebbing"" is his magnum opus, which makes a lot of people wish a lot more of works from him, surely.I tend to write my reviews as soon as possible after watching a movie. Not so with ""Ebbing"". I just couldn't write it asap. I had to let it all set, and get used to the idea that my words will never meaningly convey how good it actually is.I also needed a bit of time to get used to the idea that 2017's best movie might not be neither the mighty ""Loveless"" nor near-perfect ""Call Me by Your Name"", both of which I love dearly, but this delicious little nut of a entertainment. All hail McDonagh and his awesome gang!""Ebbing"" has already gathered 164 movie award nominations including 75 wins.It recently got Golden Globes for best drama, screenplay, actress in drama (McDormand), and supporting actor (Rockwell). It's been also nominated for 7 Oscars, including movie, screenplay, McDormand as an actress, and two supporting actors (both Harrelson and Rockwell).I sincerely hope that come March, the Academy will not pussy out of awarding this magnificent, sensational, powerhouse of a movie at least for those five categories mentioned above.Yes, it has difficult, controversial topics, violence, and extremely dirty language, but who the hell cares if the result is so good?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The best drama of the last decade,"""Three Billboards"" is a funny, thrilling and heartfelt journey about life, understanding and forgiveness. Actually, very few movies can be funny, thrilling and heartfelt at the same time, and this is surely a great achievement by this movie.The screenplay, acting, directing, music score, soundtrack, cinematography, makeup and production design are undoubtedly perfect and top-notch. Frances McDormand has long established herself as one of the best actresses of all time, and in this movie, she exhibits incredible abilities in line deliveries, facial expressions and body movements. Sam Rockwell also shines throughout the movie by perfectly playing a retarded yet heartwarming cop, and shows a clear transition. The music score is sensational, especially when the three billboards gets burned. The cinematography sometimes mimics one's gaze and is amazing. The screenplay is genius in the sense that you never know what is going to happen next.There are several moments that are simply unforgettable and touching. For example, Red forgives about Dixon, who beats him up, and offers him a cup of orange juice. Also, Dixon forgives Mildred, who burns him, and says ""who else could it be"". Mildred forgives his ex- husband, who burns her billboards, and does not throw the bottles on him. James covers up Mildred's crime and makes a dating story. The worker offers to rebuild Mildred's billboards after they are burned. An interesting thing in the movie is the two letters of Willoughby, one to Dixon and one to Mildred. In fact, the letter to Dixon changes his personality, and it really shocks me that when he gets burned, he still thinks of protecting the case files of Angela Hayes.All in all, this is definitely the best film of 2017, and possibly the best of the last decade.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A country crime story NOT in Missouri,"A girl has been raped and murdered in a small town. After a few months there is still no suspect to be found. How comes? The desperate mother of the victim places exactly this question on 3 huge billboards just out of town.The reaction of the small town community and its authorities towards this provocation of the police is then in the center of the movie. The idea to use a crime as a means to unmask the hypocrisy and missing solidarity of a society put to test may not be completely new, but it can still be good entertainment if it is done in a decent way as it is the case in 3 billboards.The quality of acting is good. Otherwise the picturing of complex characters drawn from real life would not work out so fine. Most impressive to me was the acting performance of Sam Rockwell, which can be truly described as Oscar worthy. I was not quite as impressed by the part of Frances McDormand, who initially drew me into the movie, because I liked her so much in Fargo. Probably she did not have the opportunity to show a wide enough range of emotions in this rather ""Eastwoodian"" character.Sometimes I was quite surprised how far some of the protagonists could go in their aggressions without being sued or arrested. Be it, movie theatre does not necessarily mean real life.The movie is also good in tackling other disputable issues like e.g. today's role of the Church as a moral authority. Also the fact that American soldiers have committed shameful deeds in the Middle East is proposed.I also liked the film's sort of loose ending. To me, however, it is quite clear that the original purpose of the started trip will not be met.When watching the movie I was also quite puzzled that the fictional town called Ebbing, Missouri, was surrounded by such a hilly, almost mountainous landscape, whereas I thought that wide plains are predominant in the Mid-Western countries. It turns out that the film was actually shot in and around Ashville, North Carolina. What's the point of this? If a movie happens to play in a fictional place, why not give it a name where the landscape does correspond with the name of the movie. This may seem to be an unimportant fact but I got a feeling from this that the movie does not take the spectator all too serious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Three Billboards, five star execution.","This review of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is spoiler free***** (5/5)AFTER HIS OSCAR nominated debut In Bruges, British-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh has gained a knack for his distinctive sensibilities as a filmmaker, his brilliant third endeavour Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a spectacular combination of his vulgar, politically incorrect, stupidly funny and unfathomably dark sense of humour. He's never too far away from the shockingly elements which tend to lead to awards-upsets. Here he hits pretty much the same notes as his predecessor Seven Psychopaths, except in many ways his latest has a far better - more interesting narrative behind it - he reliably never really falls back - in either his storytelling or his comedy antics. And the result is his most accomplished film of all time, but also it's one of the best and darkest comedies ever, and makes for one of the best films of all time. 
 
Frances McDormand gives a terrifying powerhouse performance as Mildred Hayes, a grieving single mother who is unable to come to terms that the local police haven't done anything about the death of her only daughter, seven months earlier. Living now with her son Robbie (a fantastic Lucas Hedges), she has an idea to post a message on the three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri - of course), the messages that she intends to print are legal, but also to angrily highlight the ineptitude of the local police force, one member in particular, the named Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). In a hope to call them out for making no arrests. Some including friends share their sympathy to her for getting justice, but others feel that her message is solely irresponsible, blankly pointing out the adored Chief Willoughby in short of making him look like a monster. These accusations hurt him. Yet nobody is as hurt as racist cop, Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who with his vicious demeanour and anger as a weapon does what he can to get revenge on Mildred trying to make her life a misery. 
 
Like In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths there's a lot going here, as the film often touches on the modern-day Western genre with his storytelling, McDonagh zigs around this small American town eloquently forming three brilliantly written intertwined narratives of three very different people, and he successfully zags through the rising tension of the townspeople who just want Mildred's fighting to cease. But full praise goes to McDormand, severely clad in dungarees, a bandana (an obvious reference to The Deer Hunter), complete with steel-toed boots and a devilish look in her eye. McDonagh has essentially turned her into a weapon of destruction and to be fair destruction is in her mind, and like a fiery gut punch her terrifying, yet brilliant performance will make your eyebrows singe (in a good way). 
 
Though anger is not the only element that works its way through here. Those familiar with McDonagh's work will see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as just another time to bring his darkly funny sense of humour to life - and you'd be right. But you'll be surprised to see that the film comes polished with warm beating heart one that pumps sympathy for its lead star and the other characters at work one that's both robustly drawn out and richly written and may even bring a tear to your eye. Unlike his brother John Michael McDonagh's War on Everyone, Martin has clearly made a triumphant move to America filled and filled it brilliant, masterful filmmaking, so much so that every moment here entrants in the purely distinctive American town life and landscape. And his clever mix in dark comedy, heartfelt drama and the blend of characters is like a Coen Brothers' film - and really, there's no higher compliment.

Exeptional Performances For An One Dimentional Script,"'Three Billboards' had so much potential yet lacked the depth needed to meet up to that potential.It was obvious that the filmmaker was trying to make the sort of film that would garner award nominations; too obvious. Most everything about this film from the dialogue to the lighting was overly self-conscious suggesting that the production team was distracted away from the art of storytelling and more concerned with receiving immediate critical acclaim.The story was very character driven so it was a disappointment to see the lack of character development replaced by one dimensional abstractions of human personalities; especially with Dixon, the hot-headed and dim-witted local police officer. It was disappointing to not be given more context around the murder of Mildred Hayes daughter and the relationship she had with her family as well as disappointing to not be given more context about the inner workings of the small town police force.The lack of resolution at the end of the film would have been a good thing if more had been explained throughout the story. Instead, the ending raised more questions to answers that were never given about questions the filmmaker failed to ask.The performances were brilliant and the overall theme was very good subject material for a film but it fell short of being a great film and simply settled for ""good enough"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
We need more Martin McDonagh,"It usually takes about 4 years for Martin McDonagh to release another one of his films. We waited 5 years this time, and it was totally worth it.The positives include the performances, particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell, with John Hawkes and Woody Harrelson also standing out. As usually Martin McDonagh's writing is funny and boundary-pushing while never losing the heart of the film in his own jokes. The characters are also very well written, with Mildred not being the female powerhouse that the trailers suggested. The directing of Martin McDonagh has always been good but this film steps it up a notch, with the film capturing the feel of the town brilliantly in the early stages.The negatives only really include a slightly dodgy performance by Lucas Hedges and one or two scenes that used cheesy emotional music when it didn't really need to be there. These are very small things that just prevent this from being a 10/10 film.To conclude, Martin McDonagh proves himself to be one of the best writers around and Three Billboards out Ebbing Missouri probably being his best film yet.

One of the films of 2017,"If there's a certainty at this year's upcoming Oscar's, other than an abundance of black dresses and a Gary Oldman acceptance speech, it's going to be Frances McDormand collecting her second career Academy Award for Best Actress for her brilliant and captivating turn as grieving and fiery mother Mildred Hayes.The central figure of Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh's newest outing as writer/director, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDormand owns every part of her performance as Hayes, a mother who takes matters into her own hands after the brutal death of her teenage daughter and sets up 3 very prominent billboards questioning the police force's effort to catch her daughter's killer/s.The way in which McDormand delivers her lines or expresses so much emotion and humanity without even uttering a single word is as good as your going to see and her and McDonagh seem like a match made in movie making heaven as they collaborate together too make this heavy bleak drama/comedy a cut well above average.McDormand's performance is a huge reason why Three Billboard's is one of the year's must see films and one of recent times best reviewed features, but McDonagh's film is also noteworthy for its supporting turns from Woody Harrelson as police chief William Willoughby, who cops the major brunt of Hayes public call outs, while Sam Rockwell is the best he's been since Moon as loose cannon police officer Dixon.It's a hugely impressive ensemble McDonagh has rounded up and it's little wonder why, as McDonagh's witty, dark and most importantly emotionally strong writing is as good as a script gets, while it's great to see a growth in McDonagh's cinematic sensibilities as Three Billboards is the filmmakers most fully rounded yet, hauntingly picturesque, moodily scored by Coen Brothers usual music muse Carter Burwell and paced perfectly throughout.The way in which McDonagh is heading after this feature suggests that after his big breakthrough In Bruges in 2008 and the rather disappointing Seven Psychopaths from 2012, he's ready to make good on all of talent, and it wouldn't be wrong to compare him to the creativity and rare genius of a fellow director like Quentin Tarantino.Final say -Featuring a classic Frances McDormand turn and fabulous support from previous McDonagh cast members Harrelson and Rockwell, this sharply written dark comedy is a unique and memorable experience that's going to be a big player at the upcoming Oscar's.4 1/2 dental tools out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Very Creative And A Masterpiece,"Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is upset that the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her child, Angela, (Kathryn Newton) and she erects Three Billboards to let police Chief Willoghby (Woody Harrlson) know how she feels. This also tells her that the whole town is against her and she could care less. She is extremely frustrated and feels this is the only way to get the police to do their job as it's been too long since Angela's death.As far as I am concerned this is simply a masterpiece. The writing, dialogues, the acting and the story itself can be nothing less. It is perfect. And when you have Woody Harrelson in the story, give him the Oscar because he is that good. Well, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but didn't get it. Bummer. Sam Rockwell as Deputy Sheriff Dixon did win the Best Supporting Actor Award. Frances McDormand did win Best Actress for her portrayal of Mildred and she was going to be very deserving and a lock. Kudos. This movie was also nominated for Best Picture and got caught in a buss-saw: The Shape of Water Otherwise...............who knows?The story does take a few twists and turns that did surprise me. There is no suspense or tension in here, just good acting with good actors in a very good creative story. We will see some very deep emotions from the townspeople, the police and from Mildred too, however it doesn't go off the rails.Notables: Abbie Cornish as Anne, Chief Willoghby's wife; Peter Dinklage as James, a friend to Mildred; John Hawkes as Charlie, Mildred's ex-husband; Lucas Hedges as Robbie, Mildred's son; Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby, who sold Mildred space on the three billboards; Clark Peters as Sheriff Abercrombie; Zetjko Ivanek as the Desk Sergeant.Kudos must also be given to Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed this movie. And he should have been nominated for Best Director. The movie was nominated for Original Screenplay. That's something.Cast-wise, the real winner in here is McDormand's Mildred as she is a take no prisoners lady, and you will like and sympathize with her. You go, girl! (10/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Some very good lines in here. 
Language: Yes,, a lot and you will hear some words not often spewed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Grief. Tragedy. Justice. Superb.,"Here in the UK, you can tell when we're entering a new year in film when the films that are expected to be big hitters come awards season start being released week after week throughout January and February. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is certainly one of the aforementioned big hitters and deservedly so.Still feeling aggrieved and frustrated by the lack of police investigation going into the violent rape and murder of her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) hires out three billboards on a stretch of road to challenge the local police, polarising the local townsfolk in the process.Martin McDonagh made such an impression on me back in 2008 with In Bruges, a film that shook my funny bones to the core however, with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh has delivered a black comedy driven by an emotional complexity unlike any of his previous films.Grief, tragedy and justice are all key themes in Three Billboards and McDonagh incorporates them brilliantly into his film through both the narrative and the memorable characters he has written. I howled with laughter at In Bruges and, while Three Billboards is full of some devilish laughs, McDonagh's latest evoked far more emotion from me than I was expecting. The story takes a few turns that I didn't expect it to and I have to applaud McDonagh for that.As strong as the writing is, Three Billboards is really driven home by a phenomenal ensemble cast, led by an exceptional Frances McDormand as the mother seeking justice in her own way. McDormand is fantastic at showing both the hard exterior and emotionally driven interior to Mildred, akin to the character she portrayed so brilliantly in Fargo. The supporting performances given by are of the highest order too, Woody Harrelson as the police chief living with his own personal troubles and Sam Rockwell as the officer with a penchant for unlawful policing, the latter making himself a major contender for Best Supporting Actor awards in the process.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a profound piece of cinema that presents much more to its audience than any of the trailers suggest. If you're a fan of films with great dialogue and even better performances, this is a film you will not want to miss. What a start to 2018!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A roller coaster wave of emotion,A roller coaster wave of emotion for just over two hours. A black comedy which will keep your brain ticking while laughing and crying at the same time.

An epic in the guise of a dark comedy,"Epic films come in two flavours: one, the obvious, where the narrative tries to capture a breadth of events, where Greek heroes and hamartia abound, where the rise and fall of some epic entity is captured; the second, where the narrative itself is focused on a microcosm, but the content pushes conceptual abstractness, dealing with questions and issues of epic proportions. Three Billboards belongs firmly in the second category; epic in scope, this film presses every major aesthetic button, leading you on to catharses - yes, in the plural - of different kinds.While the film captures the admittedly unusual events in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, after a citizen decides to put up billboards criticizing the lack of action from their chief of police, the questions explored by the film are deeply philosophical. One can watch it just for the small-town narrative, and be amusingly piqued (or, like many other reviewers here, annoyed and offended), or one can hang on as the film takes you on a roller-coaster exploring notions of morality, duty, love, and justice that you had taken for granted. If you let the film penetrate you, you can expect to laugh, cry, think, and be deeply moved; and you might leave the hall as I did, disturbed, sad, angry, and yet, relieved, puzzled perhaps, and truly purged of emotions for a while.If not for anything else, watch it for one heck of a female lead, one of the best I've seen on English screens, in a stellar performance by Frances McDormand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Well, who the hell else would it have been?""","Excellent acting (the Oscars are quite deserved) and the cinematography, interesting, holds the attention throughout and leaves a strong emotional impression. But the story is so full of holes, illogicality and over-the-top moments, as if they have dropped in from some dark comedy, that they make the movie too surreal and make it impossible for us to get involved with the characters (except possibly Woody's) and take the story seriously, which is, at least for me, a serious deal-breaker for a movie that pretends to be a shattering drama.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Poor Portrayal of Culture,"First have to give this film some credit. Especially Frances McDormand as leading actress. As a general story maybe it wasn't bad for this American moment. But gotta stop there.As someone who grew up in Missouri, Ugh. Hard to swallow. Full of grotesque sterotypes and gratuitous violence. I couldn't figure out why it didn't feel at all like Missouri to me. Then saw that they filmed it in North Carolina near Asheville! Just gave everyone southern accents and affects, not necessarily Missouri accents, made every man but the advertiser a violent jerk. Everyone says fuck every third word. Not quite like the Missouri I know full of walmarts and fallen buildings and churches (NOT catholic). It is a billboard itself, one of east and west coast projections of the midwest.The mother of Oliver had some authenticity, but the ""people of color"" were completely and utterly urban and out of place. There are no restaurants with white tablecloths and wine in my town or anywhere near. What I guess bothers me about it is that there are so, so many projections on the American midwest now that no one really cares to go and see...you know what is really there. Even if they make a movie about the place they don't go three states away to film it there?! And that just doesn't feel right. Where is the picture of that very active grief?

Brilliantly sad,"Used to be, way back, billboards written and paid for by individuals might have read ""War is over, if you want it"" but these days these same billboards seem to yell ""We're lost and there's no hope"".The acting in Three Billboards is phenomenal. Worth seeing the movie again and again to marvel at the craft of the actors lead by Frances McDormand. Truly a tour de force performance that reveals more nuance and perfection every time you watch it. Mildred must surely get an Oscar to bookend Marge Gunderson.Photography is also very good, capturing the essence of the atmosphere. The Director seems inconsequential when the actors' craft and the photography reign above, making you forget you are watching a movie. Maybe that's my compliment to the Director.But what is actually going on? What is the story? In the later part of the second decade of the 21st century, a vacant statement of a Dark Ages for the mind, the heart and the soul, of a humanity that's lost direction, purpose hope and sense of beauty.Indeed, Mildred of Ebbing is Marge of Fargo, adjusted for a post 9-11 alienated and fearful society that aims for nothing, sees nothing and hopes for nothing to the point of drifting through life in a state of indecision and, well, clinical depression and disgust for other humans.A brilliantly acted sad statement on what humanity has become.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
mini review of #3Billboards,"Mini review of: 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing,MissouriA strong contender for the Oscar, recent multiple winner at the Golden Globe Awards, Martin McDonagh's (In Bruges) little film with a long, awkward title is proving to have some legs.
A few critics have noted that the film by McDonagh, an Englishman, is somewhat tone deaf when it comes to portraying race relations in little town America. I disagree with that assessment particularly in view of the myriad shootings of unarmed black men by cops which have occured recently in the U.S. in little towns similar to Ebbing and bigger towns as well. Many of these same cops have not suffered any consequences for their actions. The film sticks pretty close to reality in that respect. Although no black individuals come to harm there is plenty of brutal, unwarranted, unjustifiable violence at the hands of a cop played with just the right amount of righteous stupidity by Sam Rockwell. 
The story is one of revenge and retribution. Frances McDormand, excellent in the role of mother Mildred Hayes ,blows what's left of her money on 3 vacant billboards accusing the Sherrif's department of laxity and incompetence in solving the rape and death of her daughter which occurred over a year ago.
These accusations will lead to a closer look at the ugly underbelly of small town America rife with racism, rage, stupidity and violence. It's not a stretch to suggest that it hits close to home on all those targets.
Woody Harrelson is very good as the Sheriff, he's not without compassion, sensitivity or humor. He also has a big secret which apparently the whole town knows about. Peter Dinklage has a small but memorable role. I wanted more of him. His dinner out with Mildred is priceless. The character played by Rockwell has a bit of an epiphany at the end which is not totally believable given the propensity of the character to act impulsively and without thinking but it does serve to tie the ending in an almost neat bow. My grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very offbeat drama,"This topic and its development looks very like a TV series, it could have been made over several seasons. That's my first feeling about this film. It is surprising from the beginning to the end, no problem. No clich√©s here, if you think about it after a little while, despite the fact that we have already seen local deputies who get awry in small towns. But it would be wonderful if we could see more often this kind of features. Acting and directing are superb. I also think that the billboard could be the solution to many problems over the world. Not for everything but for many things. I also don't think that the ending is an open ending, as some other reviews told.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Five Stars for Three Billboards; Dark, Gritty, Funny, Thought-provoking","TL;DRAn instant classic-Bleak, depressing but always hilarious in only the way McDonagh can be
-Excellent script from McDonagh
-Relevant, engaging story told at a perfect pace
-Incredible performances from an A* cast
-One of cinema's greatest cliffhanger endings
----------------------------Take one look at the list of nominations this awards season and you'll see a long list of excellent films, but there's one with a strange title that stands out - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Not the sort of catchy title that studios often look out for, but writer-director Martin McDonagh is anything but ordinary, something this film certainly proves. In fact it's fortunate that the awards have picked this film up, since otherwise a film like this could have been lost. Instead, the awards buzz have given Three Billboards a certain hype. Combine that with the reputation McDonagh has gained from such excellent films as In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths (the former in particular being an all-time favourite of mine), does this film live up to the excitement? Absolutely yes. An incredible film with perfect performances and a first-class screenplay, McDonagh has given us a refreshing classic that's sure to be lauded over for years to come.Strange as the story may seem, it's oddly captivating and by no means ever boring. Despite Mildred being the protagonist, we don't necessarily just take her side as the story encompasses a range of characters in the town; we see as much of Mildred as we do aggressive cop Dixon. The story really succeeds in challenging the audience's perspective and expectations. It doesn't require a big, Hollywood-style plot; instead it's small and intimate and is all the stronger for it. This allows for a more thorough and detailed look at the characters and the effects the story has on them, making it the sort of film we need today, particularly with countless stories of sexual harassment and racial attacks we hear in the news. It's a film with a story that implicitly challenges us to question our society and helps us perhaps to see some things in a new light. Add to that the best cliffhanger ending since The Italian Job (1969) and you have a story which sticks firmly in your mind.Similar to In Bruges, another pro of its small story is that it allows the script to stand out, something very important in a McDonagh film. One of my favourite contemporary writers (his play The Pillowman is one of my absolute favourite plays), Three Billboards' script is perfectly exemplary of McDonagh's type of writing; bleak and depressing, but with plenty of dark humour peppered throughout, all the while thought provoking and challenging. More than this, his way of writing allows for strangely beautiful language, where profanity is just part of the poetry. The script is particularly good at balancing tension with constant comedy; you could be on the edge of your seat, waiting for something bad to happen, while laughing the entire time. It's a strange sense of unease that you bizarrely can't fail to enjoy.As big a fan as I am of McDonagh, however, he can't take all the credit. The casting is first-class and each cast member is excellent. Presumably McDonagh's got a thing for 'little people' since Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage takes over midget/dwarf duties, as opposed to Jordan Prentice's disgruntled actor in In Bruges. While not particularly important to the overall story, Dinklage's character's inclusion adds a nice bit of variety to the town's population and it's nice to see him play the opposite of Tyrion Lannister - mostly sober and a bit less successful with women. Still, he seemed a bit underused for such a successful actor at the moment. Abbie Cornish's Anne also doesn't seem to be given the screentime she deserves, but when her character's married to Harrelson's Willoughby, she's always going to be dwarfed by him. Harrelson is once again effortlessly likeable and 'cool' as the town's police chief, not becoming the antagonist you'd expect him to be. On the contrary, while you'd think we'd be on Mildred's side for the entire film, instead we find ourselves almost sympathising with Chief Willoughby more. Harrelson does an excellent job of balancing emotion and humour. Rockwell's Dixon is more arguably the 'antagonist' of the film if you need to apply the label somewhere, who again balances the humour in his character very well with his aggression and stupidity. He could easily have been a very detestable character, but Rockwell's portrayal is so charismatic and he progresses throughout the film's entirety to the point that our opinions and perceptions change. At the heart of the whole drama though, stony-faced and angry, is McDormand's Mildred. Playing fierce and fiery wonderfully, McDormand is the one who really sells the film and it's her character's personality that carries the film just as much as the script.If you liked In Bruges, you'd certainly like this. If you like any film with wit and comedy, you'd like this. If you like films set in a microcosm which question and reflect on our own society, you'd like this. The only problem is that there's a shame there weren't five billboards to make a five-star pun... McDonagh solidifies his talent with his third consecutive great film, this one being his best yet. With an incredible script and a perfect cast, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an instant classic, able to challenge an audience and make them laugh the whole time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Stunning acting for a strong dark picture,"This is a very lucid dark movie, where the initial plot becomes a kind of painful pretext to plumb the deepest contradictions and phobias , the fanaticism and sectarianism, the fundamentalism as well as the vulnerability of part of American society.
The subject matter and the overall tone of the picture are very strong: anger, hate, violence and grief dominate, and I honestly did not grasp that comic touch noticed by some criticism.
No doubt everything works inside the picture: screenplay and shooting reinforce each other, but they could not work at full, hadn't they been supported by the top-notch acting. Frances Macdormand offers an Oscar deserving performance, once again proving her unique talent in such difficult and unpleasant roles, and all the cast does a great job.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Anger and confrontation that sorta fizzles out,"This sets out to be a gritty, small town revenge drama but ends up wandering off into uncharted territory.

It is never totally convincing anyway, despite some fine performances from a big name cast, and good soundtrack music.

Three Billboards is something really really different,"Most movies fit into a genre and follow a formula. In my opinion ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" defies classification. If you are hungry for something which is 'from' Hollywood but not 'of' Hollywood, then go see this movie. Okay, there are some plot holes and few times when you might find yourself saying, ""Oh really !!"". But, man of man, this movie is entertaining. The story line is totally unpredictable. I understand Francis McDormand is married to one of the Coen brothers and the flavour of the movie makes me suspect her husband and brother-in-law were sending a few suggestion notes in through the back door.The production standards are good, much of the dialogue is brilliant, and the acting is fabulous (great soundtrack as well). Francis has to be one of Hollywood's top players and Sam Rockwell was simply brilliant. Don't be surprised if he gets nominated for his performance. He has been on my A list since I first noticed him in ""The Green Mile"" way back in 1999, and since then, with pieces like ""Matchstick Men"" and ""The Way Way Back"", he has never disappointed. Woody Harrelson has come a long way since ""Cheers"" and has matured into a great character actor.Some contributors here have slammed this movie, and I can see why - it is not without some faults, but ""Three Billboards"" really is something different. Do yourself a favour, go see it and make up your own mind. But, if you are going to get bent out of shape by questions of racism and political correctness, like some reviewers, then don't bother.I'm forgiving the plot holes and awarding a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Rich characterizations in this near-perfect black comedy,"Martin McDonagh's new film gives us a glorious Frances McDormand performance (I believe she is incapable of delivering a bad performance), a tight script that is funny and riveting from start to finish, and surprising character development. The film plays like a tribute to a Coen Brothers' film (change the location to a larger town in Missouri, and it could have easily been called ""Joplin""...)McDonagh, who is not an American, captured the look and feel of a depressed rural town in middle America perfectly (although filming in North Carolina instead of the Ozarks loses the authenticity a bit...) The characters played by McDormand, Sam Rockwell (another actor incapable of delivering a sub-par performance), Woody Harrelson, and John Hawkes initially come across as stereotypes (angry mother, unhinged deputy, righteous sheriff, abusive ex husband, respectively), but the arcs of their stories take unexpected turns. The most satisfying experience in the theater this year. And McDormand's lashing out at a local religious figure, calling out the utter hypocrisy of the Evangelicals in this country, is alone with the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A genuinely brilliant movie, with very few slipups.","Following my viewing of the Golden Globes, and more recently, the SAG awards, I decided that watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would most likely be a good idea. The film has performed exceptionally well so far this awards season, consistently winning many of the awards it was put up for. After being fortunate enough to see it, I can understand why.I feel it is worth quickly adding that, while watching this film, I was quite tired. I'd seen Coco earlier that same day, and I rarely go out for that long a period. The fact that the film still made such an impact on me in that state is impressive.Ordinarily, this isn't the sort of film I'd be attracted to. I didn't really recognise many of the actors going in, nor was it based on an existing property. To put it bluntly, it was a proper, standalone film. After seeing it, I was genuinely impressed.Ordinarily, I would list highlights of a film, then delve into the issues. Now, however, I'm perplexed; the film did everything well, at least to an extent. There was only a few things I found issue with. The CGI (which was used incredibly sparingly) was often rather jarring. It didn't fit with the rest of the gorgeously shot world. Though the locations are never astounding, Ben Davis makes even relatively mundane countryside look beautiful.The characters shown within this film are rather fascinating. The events leading up to the film could almost be a film in themselves. Despite what reading a synopsis may imply, however, this film isn't a murder mystery. The murder of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)'s daughter isn't the focal point of the film. Instead, the main focus of the film is how the event impacts various people, and how they go on to deal with it. Each main character is rather layered, and could arguably be the lead in their own film.Bringing these characters to life is a brilliantly talented cast. Frances McDormand deserves each award she receives. I feel the trailer actually does her character a disservice; after watching it, I felt that she was simply a vulgar, hateful woman taking her frustrations out on those around her. In reality, she's a far more sympathetic character, who isn't nearly as abrasive as the trailer makes her out to be. Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby was probably my favourite character of the film, who, despite playing the straight man in many scenes, is able to bring levity and humour to the dark situations in which he finds himself. Sam Rockwell's Dixon is also wonderful, though many people have taken issue with his character's arc. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly, though it's something to note.Many of the supporting characters are hit or miss. I feel Peter Dinklage was brilliantly funny, though some of the others failed to steal a chuckle from me. The rest of the audience seemed to enjoy them, however, so it's most likely a fault of my own.I was pleasantly surprised by how violent this film is; the trailer makes it seem that violence is a punchline to a joke, but at times, the movie is genuinely brutal. It's probably more violent than most modern horror films.The soundtrack was actually rather enjoyable. The original scoring was great, and fit the setting perfectly. The other songs added each served their purpose, oftentimes accentuating the comedy within a scene.For the most part, I found the writing great. The characters spoke like real (if dramatised) people, though occasionally there was some odd lines.To conclude the review, I feel this was a truly impressive film, and I understand why it's getting so many nominations. If you love film, I must recommend you give this one a watch. Thankfully, this isn't one you need to see in the cinema; I think it could work just as well on a smaller screen. If you need a concrete ending, however, you may need to steer clear; it's rather open ended. I feel Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri deserves a 9/10, and I look forward to seeing more films of a similar quality to this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Review","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film written and directed by Martin McDonagh. I hadn't seen a trailer for this film nor heard of the director. Seeing the Golden Globe nominations got this film to my notice. And I can say that this is one of the best films of this year.Plot: Mildred Hayes has three billboards outside the town much to many people's dismay.Story and direction: This film doesn't deal with the subject of rape but with the effects that a voice can have when it is displayed on a thing like a billboard. I liked the variation each of the main characters had. Lets start with Mildred. She always has a kind of rudeness which remains constant throughout the entire film. That can be because she has hardened up because of the incidents that have happened. She also breaks down at certain moments in the film which was the perfect way of her emoting her sadness. Now about Chief William; he is one of those who wants to abide by the law. That was very well written in the screenplay and how he is not able to do anything is very well shown. Now about Jason Dixon. He is one of those characters who just has about a problem in anything. But the sudden change in his character during the second half of the film was quite appreciated. The film has also very nicely interwoven the reactions and actions taken by people because of Mildred's action. The film is very beautifully shot, thanks to cinematographer Ben Davis. The colors which are transcended on screen look very real. An engaging background music by Carter Burwell also contributes to the greatness of this film. A fault that I felt, which may be me only, was towards the ending where I felt that it wasn't quite necessary.Performances: Frances McDormand was great in her role. The variations in her role were well emoted by her. Woody Harrelson was good in the role written for him. Sam Rockwell was the highlight of this film. The variations that his character had were like none. Lucas Hedges was a great addition to this cast. Abbie Cornish looked quite honest in her role. Clarke Peters too delivered an honest performance. Peter Dinklage will always be loved no matter how long the role.Favorite Scene: The very first scene where Mildred just goes to the ad agency and just says what has to be written on the three billboards. The dialogue delivery and mood created in that scene was great and that attracted me to this scene.Verdict: I would say that I was floored with this film. It is filled with Award worthy performances and one of the best 2017 had to offer.I am going with a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Identity problems,"Being a huge fan of both McDonough and McDormand's work, I was truly looking forward to this film. And I tried to like it. But the structure felt contrived and the logic nonexistent. Great performances but stylistically the film did not seem to know what it was. A bit all over the place and I found myself uninvested in the characters. The unnecessary scenes, strange dialogues and actions made the movie not easy to perceive, to understand.
Overall a decent effort but somewhat overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Entertaining but an absurd premise...,"The acting is top notch...hopefully the reason Three Billboards was up for several awards. This is really the only positive thing I can say about the film. I suspect the writer/director never stepped foot in Missouri. He didn't even film the movie there. He paints a picture of a town full of uneducated, ill-tempered, reactionary misfits who can't speak a sentence without saying ""ain't"" or ""f___"". There is the stereotypical corrupt, angry, super racist police officer and the whole department has racist leanings. The whole town is aware of this officer yet nothing seems to be done about it, which implies the whole town is full of racists. The main characters react, most often in a violent manner with no worry of consequences, rather than trying to communicate rationally. Hollywood reached a new low by having the main character's children call her names so disrespectful that they cannot be repeated without causing my review to be removed. The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because it does have entertainment value. Truthfully this film is an insult to those who live in middle America as well as those of us on the East and West Coast who know better. Come on Hollywood, you can do better than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An attempt at replicating a Cohen brothers movie,"When I entered the theater I had not checked the director and writer for this film in maybe a week, so I continually asked myself if it was a Cohen brothers film, which to me is bad when it's actually written/directed by someone else. I think that there is a difference between paying homage to artists and downright imitating them.The protagonist (who is played by Frances McDormand) is presented to us a likable person at first. But when she speaks to the police about her problems she seems quite nazi-esque. She wants to draw and test blood from every person who lives in her town to find a criminal. When the police chief informs her that such a thing is impossible because it would be a gross violation of people's civil rights, she doesn't care. He replies, ""he could have been a man who was just passing through the state."" ""Then let's take blood from everyone in the country."" Sure... She says it quite seriously. Repulsive.Woody Harrelson provides good acting, but there are multiple scenes in the movie when he does voice-over for comic relief that are mildly amusing at first but feel stale and forced rather quickly. There were many times when I just wanted to shut it off-- when someone is stretching irreverence out to the point of being unrealistic and absurd it's just bad writing. It's also bad form to have so much voice-over in any movie.In the early going, Sam Rockwell's cop character is the type of person who would strike me as reprehensible yet tolerable. When he pistol whips an innocent man and woman then beats the man to within an inch of his life he goes from tolerable to I-want-this-moron-to-die. As other people have noted, the police chief (who witnessed all of these things in person) wouldn't just fire such a person. He would be arrested and convicted for attempted murder. Instead, the chief fires him in an almost nonchalant manner.There is also an additional embarrassingly stupid scene in which Rockwell's character thinks that he is overhearing a violent criminal brag to his friend about his crimes. When the criminal confronts him... he scratches his face... then stares at him. Again, the Rockwell character is borderline retarded, but even the dumbest among us have a survival instinct. When I saw this scene play out I thought that it was part of a strategy or plan-- the Rockwell character wanted to get the guys arrested for assault so he could make his case to the police chief. Nope. Just more idiocy.It has a few solid comedic moments. But I would never watch this film again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Put this on a Billboard - ""YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM"".","If you are a movie fan this is the best time of year. It's awards season and all the best films are around so you can check out if the hype is justified. Three Billboards has been talked highly amongst the critics and in my opinion quite rightly so. It's the best film I have seen in quite a while.It's the story of a grieving mother who takes matters into her own hands as she searches for her daughter's murderer. An angry Mildred Hayes erects three provocative highway signs to catch the eye of the town's well liked Chief of Police Bill Willoughby. Hoping the billboards spur Willoughby's officer Dixon into action but all it does is ignites a storm in the community as the police force evades charges of racism and corruption.Sam Rockwell is an underrated actor. He's done some fantastic work in recent years .I'm not sure why he doesn't get bigger roles.
There is no denying Frances McDormand ability too ( who can forget Fargo?). These two actors are absolutely fantastic in this film and I hope they both win in their respective categories . 
This film has everything. It's funny , it's sad , it can make you angry and it can makes you cry. 
Martin McDonagh has made a film that will live long in the memory and if there is a better film nominated at this years Academy Awards I can't wait to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Why Martin McDonogh is a fantastic writer,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a very poignant and moving tale of justice, grief and redemption about a unstable little community opposing Frances McDomand's rough, and tough Mildred Hayes.From playwrite, director: Martin McDonagh creator of In Bruges (2008), and Seven Psychopaths (2012), and numerous plays such as The Beauty Queen of Leenane, brings us a remarkable new black comedy, led by a ruthless display compelling performances . With a mix of tension and laughs as per usual to McDonagh's previous work, Three Billboards thrives in its substance and characters, in a surprisingly sentimental story.Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) wages her own war against her town's police department by putting up three billboards with direct messages to the police, after no progress or effort has been shown after Hayes' daughter Angela was raped and murder. Protesting her acts, Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) tries to keep the town from tearing itself apart from the indecorous billboards. But Hayes' real battle is with despicable Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). As the billboards stir the pleasant towns folk, Hayes gradually earns herself more enemies attracting more hate to her and her son.Less thrill ride than Psychobaths but more dark passion as with In Bruges, McDonagh's latest achievement is a vigorous triumphant in story-telling. With a immense ensemble cast leading the way and a script as naturally articulated by the cast sets McDonagh's drama in its realist genuine setting.McDomand bringing an astonishingly fierce performance as the grieving mother, shows more grit than her more cheerful detective from Fargo (1996). Every moment with Hayes is an emotional presence of anguish but also sorrow. McDormand thrives forcefully in a rough kick performance of aggression, fuelling the drive of the film. Especially shot in intense close ups, our attention is drawn to the intensity and emotion.Sam Rockwell also finally receives the recognition he deserves as a fantastic supporting role as the sluggish, racist Dixon whose demented life style is just as abroken as Hayes. Rockwell's familiar drunk charm and quirkiness serve him best in his latest performance for the antagonist. Dixon's odyssey in the film manifests in a timeless journey of redemption.If you haven't learnt of McDonagh's genius as a writer, than Three Billboards is the hard cold evidence. One of the unique things that the trailer sadly misleads you on, is that although you may think this is quirky black comedy and it is, but still has really mournful heart in its centre subject matter. Continuing to tie in the accustomed biblical concepts and heaven and hell, Three Billboards is another formidable reflection of the soul.McDonagh triumphantly brings out real humanity in this twisted drama. Its the small moments McDormand crying towards the camera are really heart-melting. The transition that McDonagh constructs for his characters are a fabulous force of spirit, rather encouraging at this point in time. Carter Burwell's soundtrack furthermore is an appropriate background, guiding the tale from start to finish, contributing to petite moments of sadness.An exceptional mix of comedy, wow, and healing, Three Billboards is an unpredictable sorrowful story with an unforgettable presence of talent by the ensemble cast, but is maintained and victorious in its masterly story brought to life by McDonagh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"On the verge of depressing reciprocating , paves way for hope in connecting axioms","This one is possibly one of the best films of 2017, or even of the decade. Director Martin McDonagh has crafted a superb story surrounding the small-town folks of the now mythical Ebbing, Missouri. His structure of glib everyday life individuals that interconnect into a spiral of truths surrounding the death of a local girl (Kathryn Newton) makes it feel almost borderline hopeless, yet humorous in each character's contentious flaws. And for all its candor deep within such a mood-stricken story, opens the door for a more affable message about connection through pain and redirecting one's own hatred into a common goal.The acting is top tier, with the likes of Francis McDormand, who is the mourning widowed wife, caring for a son still in school, plays her character in a languid posture hiding conniption for local law enforcement for not finding her daughter's killer. That blame goes to always on point, Woody Harrelson, who plays the towns head honcho of police who he himself is suffering from complicating health reasons making the story carry a sense of burden that cannot be shaken. Sam Rockwell portrays an eccentric deputy and good friend of Harrelsons, who finds every opportunity to vicariously embarrass himself, yet by a certain point creates a parable in the likes of McDormands character.This movie could of toned down the overdone language, which I found excessive to the point of absurd even for small town American folks, but the elegy of these characters was worth the journey into finding that connection in others pain, that can bring a common goal even in the face of darkness.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"McDonagh's recent ""tour de force""","I must say, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" stroke by surprise the entire movie industry by earning the Best picture (Drama) recently at the 2018 Golden Globes Ceremony. This Coen-ish piece offers more than the soft dark comedy we are used too with McDonagh and it seems that he's being recognized for his ""homage"" to the famous Brothers.What begins as a simple drama about a mother who lost her daugther, quickly becomes a fluid, realistic though impredictable masterpiece who inspire genuine emotions from star actors Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. As passionnated and talented as each other, we must give credit to McDormand who plays the leading role as a grieving yet frustated mother. Seriously, what a bad-ass character! She litterally elevates McDonagh's movie with her authenticity and her intensity. It's really one of those movies who can make you laugh out loud and cry vigorously in a minute-intervall. Credit to Rockwell who offer almost a breakthrough performance for those who haven't seen ""Moon"" (2009) a couple years ago. In the same vein, Harrelson gives us a touch of his classic black-humour performance with his well-crafted character. S/O to the entertaining soundtrack which fits almost perfectly with scenes.I believe ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is going to be a strong contender for the 2018 Oscars, especially in acting and writing categories.A beautiful, well-acted though distorted piece you don't wanna miss this year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The pain underneath the rage,"No parent in this world deserve to loss a child by an unspeakable tragedy or a brutal crime but when they does, not every tragedy teaches us tolerance and not everyone can get to channel their grief & anger through an unorthodox way like Frances McDormand's Mildred did in this emotionally moving dramedy. And as we know the world is far more complex & unpleasant place than most celluloid projections but it takes a remarkable storyteller & filmmaker to convey that in a convincing manner and Martin McDonagh did this wonder in his latest and this year's one of the best films here. When the little town almost starts to forget about the vicious rape & murder of her young daughter, the aggrieved mother Mildred Hayes rents the three abandoned billboards near her home to protest over the lack of progress in the investigation. This leads to pressure on the townsfolk's favorite chief (beautifully played by our favorite Woody Harrelson), resulting anger from his loyal officers, and so on down the line. This is a darkly funny, yet a very profound film where most of the major characters were flawed by their decisions or actions, torn apart inside by grief or frustrations and that made it so grounded & compelling. Almost every actor in their assigned role did justice to the solid & neatly written scripts where the character developments turned out one of the most strongest elements of this movie. McDormand on the lead delivered clearly an Oscar worthy performance, she was so great with her character's internal language...time to time slowly revealing the pain underneath the rage was something so stunning & compelling to watch that I haven't seen in most of the acclaimed & major films of recent years. Sam Rockwell just nailed his supporting role of Dixon, a small town racist police officer, the development & along the way the changes in his character were another striking part of the film. Not just being a fan of McDonagh's IN BRUGES (2008), I think this is the best film of the year that really deserve some major recognition in coming award season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just too much foolishness,"Disappointed. After seeing an 8.5 star rating I was so excited to see this movie.....and I wanted to see it quickly before I heard or read too many spoilers. In my opinion, ratings that high are reserved for movies like Forrest Gump, Titanic, Shawshank and Good Fellas so I really went into this with high expectations. This movie did proceed along quickly with enough twists and humor to keep you interested but it is so far fetched that it becomes stupid. The police are portrayed like characters from The Dukes of Hazzard so you just roll your eyes every time they talk. Then they get away with criminal acts with no recourse much like detectives in Lethal Weapon. Shoot your gun, kill people, break the law.....do what you want, after all, you're the police....right? This is truly a 4 star movie. You may not hate watching it but it is in no way a must see. As mentioned in many reviews the acting by Frances and Woody is very, very good and you can't help but love the resolve of the main character who is willing to stand up for what she is trying to accomplish as well as the pain Woody is going through in his life. But again, you just can't ignore the foolish scenes that occur. Ever seen a western where a guy shoots his gun 45 times without reloading? Or better yet a movie where the hero shoots 6 times and kills 6 bad guys all who had automatic weapons and were firing back at him.....Need a fire extinguisher?....Her's a 50 gallon one in the front seat of my car. It's those kind of occurrences that happen throughout the movie that make you say ""oh come on"" about 7-8 times throughout the movie.

With so many greatly written characters, a story you care about and a believable world, this dark satiric drama comedy will make you think and feel.At moment reminding me of Fargo, a moment of ""No country for old men"" but all the time staying completely original. 
A strong cast going all the way from the Baltimore Wire, to the lands of Westeros, with a police chief who comes of here even stronger then in True Detectives, and all the way back to the Fargo again with the leading role in Frances McDormand, this chemistry can be felt all the way.In a day and time, where 2 dimensional movies like Shape of water get most nominations, and Plot-hole Wars Return of the Jedi gets 5, this is a move that deserves all the love it can get.Watch it without prejudice and enjoy the best drama of Oscar 2018.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Modern but Timeless Parable About Revenge,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is promoted as a ""black comedy crime film,"" but the truth is that it's a modern parable about revenge and the only thing funny about it is the sad irony of what can happen by giving in to this most basic of human inclinations, no matter how apparently justified.Martin McDonagh, who wrote, produced and directed the film, reportedly was inspired after seeing billboards about an unsolved crime while traveling ""somewhere down in the Georgia, Florida, Alabama corner.""The film is fictional, but the script and the performances ring as true and as realistic as something that might happen in today's world in any town in America.Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a bitterly divorced mother still aching over the unsolved rape and murder of her teenage daughter, Angela, seven months before.Furious over what she perceives as foot-dragging on the case, she empties her bank account to pay for three billboards just outside of town. They read, successively: ""RAPED WHILE DYING,"" ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS?"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?""Townspeople are upset over the billboards, but none as much as Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), whose profane good-old-boy manner belies a complex human being, a doting husband and father at home who is a savvy, tough-as-nails peace officer on the job. He's also dying of pancreatic cancer.Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's plight, explaining the legal constraints he is under, but she will have none of it and refuses to remove the signs. As a result, she and her son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges, so effective in ""Manchester By the Sea"") face all sorts of harassment by the townspeople, including that by Mildred's abusive ex-husband, Charlie (John Hawkes), an ex-cop living with a dim but well-meaning 19-year-old Penelope (Samara Weaving), who offers perhaps the most accurate summation of the story with a phrase that she said she read on a bookmark.In the midst of all of this is Deputy Sheriff Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an ignorant racist who never seems to understand exactly what is happening but overreacts in very much the wrong way to that which he does.To reveal any more would give away the many surprising twists both in plot and character development.The film is meticulously thought out and though timeless in its point, is particularly applicable to today's society in which all too many people act out their emotions in a violent way, horrible consequences notwithstanding.The casting and performances are nigh-on perfect, top to bottom, with McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell especially stunning.""Three Billboards"" is Oscar-worthy across the board, and would stack up against any best picture nominee, past or present.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Capsule Review: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","The humorous undertone in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri helps you bear the brutally honest picture of a crime and its aftermath that it paints so magnificently. Watching Frances McDormand play a rebellious mother of a woman who was raped while dying is satisfying to the extent that can only be disturbed by Sam Rockwell's performance as this fiery young policeman who boasts off his racism as his grandest weapon. If not the cliched story, there is enough bulbs of entertainment and social issue treatment to consume here that is topped with some of the most fabulous performances of the year. Woody Harrelson joins the talented cast as the police chief who is torn between the mother's rebellious stunt - iconic in the movie and for the next few decades - and a personal issue to drive the crisply-written film that mocks the law enforcement system and reinforces the theory that man is the biggest and most powerful killer. Other than few slips in Martin McDonagh's writing towards the end, there's not a dull moment in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MIssouri which, if not too cinematic, has some great billboard design and a ritzy ad agency office.

One of the cleverest and best written films of its genre in several years,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a black comedy murder mystery starring Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths), it is quite possibly one of the cleverest and best written films of its genre in several years.In the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, divorced mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) grieves over the murder of her daughter Angela several months earlier. Fed up with the way local authorities are handling the investigation, Mildred decides to take matters into her own hands and rent out three abandoned billboards near her home to try and find the culprit herself.Featuring well-balanced comedy and drama, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a highly entertaining and amusing film, which also serves as a commentary on police ineptitude and vigilantism. The film's screenplay crackles with wit and clever humour, which helps move the story along at a brisk pace. Frances McDormand is superb as Mildred Hayes, a character so well written it is practically impossible not to cheer for her whenever she is onscreen. This is easily her best role since Fargo, which this film feels like something of a spiritual sequel to, due to its Coen brothers-esque tone. Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson also gave great performances as the local police trying but failing to find who killed her daughter.

Bleak, isolated, and provocative drama from director Martin McDonagh is perfectly cast and completely unpredictable, with scintillating dialogue, tense character interactions, and a deep, believable examination of human nature in the most dire of circumstances.

"A brazen, no-holds-barred character study that's actually quite life-affirming in its own sardonic sort of way.","While it can feel a bit aimless thanks to its general narrative looseness and lack of persistent point-to-point plot, this brazenly tone-twisting tale takes no prisoners on its no-holds-barred bid to offend just about everyone it can while aiming to remind those same people that just because a character (not the film or its creators, I might add) thinks or even acts a certain way doesn't always mean they can't be redeemed. In this way, its overall messages are actually quite inspiring, optimistic and, dare I say, sort of hopeful, even if the feature is generally a rather downbeat and hopeless affair right until its final, suitably low-key frame. It's an experience that feels like it has something significant to say about grief, with the lasting impression being strangely life-affirming in its own uniquely sardonic kind of way, and the almost second-to-none character work on display is truly phenomenal on all sides, to the point where almost every inhabitant of the eponymous town felt like a breathing human being. That's really the main effect you get from the piece, allowing you to spend time with people you wouldn't really want to spend time with but in the process come to truly understand them, and it's rare for a work to accomplish such a connection - especially with characters whose ethics are as questionable as these. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

There's something fascinating about a cantankerous. outspoken kind of woman obsessing over an awful unsolved crime, and fighting the police on doing their job.Unfortunately, it ends up mixing the more occasional thoughtful, interesting moments with a ridiculously clich√©d portrayal of small- town police as redneck buffoons, absurd Saturday-morning-cartoon style logic, Tarantino-imitating dialogue (cutesy circular monologues where the speaker enjoys correcting themselves, overly witty for the character in question because what you're really hearing is a self-obsessed eager-to-impress screenwriter, a woman talking to herself via her slippers where every single line repetitively blurts 'm****rf****rs'), irritating un-pc humour (yeah we get it, rednecks endlessly throwing out 'n***er' and 'f***ot', child abuse, dwarfs, kicking girls in the crotch etc is so fearless and edgy!) and huge tonal shifts that ruin the moment before or after. An underlying message of the film (something about kindness being more curing than anger) gets compromised in a final scene which seems forced and against all character logic. A moment half- way through sends the core of the film in a different direction, where it could easily be retitled ""Three Letters from Ebbing, Missouri"".I haven't felt so frustrated before by the idea of less being better. If certain absolutely-unnecessary scenes, moments, lines, quips and slurs were edited out, it would be a much more efficient and powerful film.Its also awkward to see as a shared experience - audiences simply don't know how to react or respond to certain tonally uneven moments, so can't help but nervously laugh at anything they think is suggestive of humour (e.g. an innocent school girl getting needlessly kicked in the crotch by an adult woman). The protagonist is often entirely rude and ignorant in her attack monologues, but rather than sympathise with her mis-directed anger, audiences are more inclined towards 'go girl!' style moronic agreement. It just feels jarring. It Would be much better absorbed on the small screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A masterpiece that you will never forget,"I went into this movie with different expectations. I never thought I wouldn't enjoy it. I just thought I would be crying most of the way through, also knowing what each scene held due to a lot of movies having a similar plot. I laughed more than I cried at the unknown dark humour that most people would consider inappropriate. To me, it just showed how everyone doesn't deal with certain situations the same way. Every scene had a moment where I was in complete awe. I didn't want it to end. Take away the dark comedy, and you have a grieving mother and family who feel defeated with nothing to lose, you have employees of the law who have a case that finally made them snap. No matter who's side you're on in this movie, they all have an intriguing point of view that makes you understand why they have certain reactions and actions. Frances McDormand May rightfully so have a stand out performance, but it's Sam Rockwell who leaves you with mixed emotions and a ""WOW"" factor. An absolute must see.

A Small Town Becomes A Universal Message...Anger Begets Anger...Extraordinary!,"It's no stretch to say Three Billboards will be nominated for multiple Academy Awards. Here in one movie there's easily writing/directing, multiple performances, and cinematography that scream Oscar nominations. But, this is no art house or high film school concept piece. It's a grass roots reflection on how hate begets only more hate and how love, forgiveness, and tolerance is the only saving salvation. Yet as heavy as all of this is depicted it never beats the viewer over the head thus watering down that message. Quite the opposite as turns a soul stirring mirror expertly using darkly held prejudices and black comedy to do so.None of the above could be accomplished first without the superior story telling and directing of Martin McDonagh. He has created a masterpiece of a movie from which the expert casting propels. Previous Oscar nominee Frances McDormand turns in a performance of a lifetime in her portral of an anger-filled Mildred who has lost a teenage daughter to a horrendously brutal rape and murder. She raises the ire of locals and the police force in her small town as she boldly cries for justice. That sets up more hate on the other side which erupts in myriad related as well as unrelated ways. Sam Rockwell as a non-conventional, as well as non-law abiding racist deputy, almost steals McDormand's thunder. These two characters ride an arc of hate that brings them to a place neither could have achieved without the other. Wow! They are musts for awards if the Academy isn't out in left field because they really bring a meaningful story to life. Woody Harrelson is also in top form with a role he plays effortlessly adding to the quality here.If you see one movie in the next year this is one I think can speak to everyone as well as entertain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

life and anger in deep America,"'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is positioning itself as the main favourite of the Academy Awards season, and if it will win some of the statuettes in the major categories it will be by merit. It is quite interesting that an Irish - British director succeeded to make such a sharp film about the territory that we know so little especially out of the US - the deep America, the one far of the glamour of the big cities or the sparks of high-tech. We should not be amazed however, as Martin McDonagh is a very special kind of artist, a playwright of great talent who has gradually broadened the scope of his plays from the Irish history and political present to British realities, and later to more broader human topics. As a film director he started with a short film set in Ireland that won an Academy Award in 2006, while his next two feature films are set in Europe (In Bruges) and Hollywood (Seven Psychopaths). The story in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes place in the heart of America, I would almost say to the bleeding heart of the country, as the small city in Missouri can be seen as a micro-model of the complex realities of the US, with its prejudice and violence, but also with the humanity and power to heal of its people. The quality of the film making places it somewhere in-between or in the same league as the films of the Coen brothers and of Tarantino.Mildred ( Frances McDormand ) is a hard working woman, divorced and living from a gift shop in a place not many tourists come to visit. When her teen-aged daughter is attacked, raped and killed she feels guilt at the thoughts that she could have prevented her death and anger at what seems to be foot-dragging from the local police force led by sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). She turns her anger into action by posting bug announces on advertising billboards on a side road, but in short time her actions will put her in conflict with the rest of the community.There are many levels that the development of this story can be understood. People like Mildred (and not only her) are angry, and anger needs to be channeled into action. Does this action need to be violent? Does violence ever pay? Maybe this is one of the roots of the higher level of conflict and polarisation that we detect when we observe the American society in general and small communities like the one described in the movie in particular. Then, in true life, nobody is a perfect saint and nobody is pure evil either. The sheriff is terminally sick which makes the whole community to side with him in his conflict with Mildred, and maybe his inaction is only apparent, maybe there are crimes which cannot be really solved but by chance. Life is not as presented in the 'CSI' TV series (although a CSI element does appear in the story!). Mildred's actions seem all justified but do they have the effect that she desires, do they bring peace of mind, and especially do they bring closer the solution of the crime that took her daughter away? Can redemption be achieved by taking the law in your own hands or by punishing the committer of another crime?The script succeeds to bring to surface the characters and the environment they live in. Acting is superb. Frances McDormand makes us forget all those discussions about the lack of strong feminine lead roles in Hollywood and she may be on her way to a deserved second Academy Award. He words, her looks, her silences are just to the mark. I liked her performance here more that Meryl Streep's one in 'The Post'. Woody Harrelson provides another strong performance, but the real great surprise is Sam Rockwell whose nuanced interpretation of the role of Dixon (the sheriff's aid) was complex and subtle and succeeded to overcome one of the few weak points of the script, the change of perspective of his character.'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the best thing that I have seen until now in this pre-Academy Awards season. It makes the viewers immerse in the reality of the place it describes, it makes them think about the humanity that exists in each of us, about the need to act and the need to find peace of soul, about justice and vengeance and the difference between the two concepts. As with many good films its story and characters continue to be with us long time after the screening ends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""What price justice?""","""What price justice when justice was not served the first-time round?"" This is the question proposed and was explored by the movie through smart black humor and irony. Given we as species are both blessed and cursed with a sense of moral right and wrong and given our world is imperfect where crime do not necessarily meet with their just retributions, we as individuals take matters into our own hand. This is where things get complicated. For one, is there a pay forward system in retribution meaning it is transferrable if the crime fits a generic similarity? Or in the name of justice, equality puts crime of the same into a cesspool of the same where if the retribution is good for the goose, it will also be good for the gander. After all, the satisfaction from seeing justice can also be transferrable from one case to another. It is a question of whether retribution should be case specific, or it doesn't matter. This puts impartiality, the essence of the blindfold on Lady Justice into a new ""funny"" limelight. On irony, there is also the irony of polar difference in attitudes towards crime. The Willoughby's realistic pragmatism that is lined with a fuzzy human touch vs the Mildred Hayes's undaunting iron will and fist of wanting justice served. They are two sides of the same coin because and this may be a surprise for some for in my opinion, they are both pivotal characters showing the two different types of human nature and human nature is what gives rise to our moral awareness, the foundation of justice. The surprise for some lies in my opinion about Mildred Hayes. For though she took center stage in the movie, she is not the protagonist of the show. The real protagonist of the show is Dixon. The catharsis that came to him, which literally changed him through a ""baptism of fire"" is when his potential of being good is acknowledged by his best buddy and mentor, Mr. Willoughby in the letter that he wrote him. Of course, later, the orange juice from the mangled Red Welby also helped to seal a new-found faith in the good side of humanity for him. As to whether justice is transferrable or not, or whether the true culprit of the heinous rape crime against Mildred's daughter is apprehended or not is relatively immaterial for both Mildred and Dixon will have some time after the end of the movie to talk about these things on their way to Idaho.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A great and memorable addition to McDonagh's quirky filmography,"A grieving mother hires three disused billboards to berate the local police force into action regarding the brutal murder of her daughter much to the anger of some of the townsfolk.Martin McDonagh has done it again. Not content to leave well alone in the 'dark comedy in a serious situation' department following Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges, he's pulled together another masterpiece of this difficult genre. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (don't worry, it took me a few attempts to remember the full name too) shows McDonagh isn't done with it yet.The first shots in the film show the dilapidated, unused and unloved billboards in a haze of early morning mist. These establishing shots begin a trend of scenes being rarely framed poorly, or lit and filtered without careful consideration of mood. Likewise, there are scenes that linger for just the right amount of time for the audience to contemplate the consequences and next actions.Frances McDormand's portrayal of a mother hell-bent on getting justice for her murdered daughter and the personal pain she feels every day from the fractured relationship they endured when she was alive. The Best Actress Oscar she was rightly awarded was never in doubt given the clean sweep she enjoyed all through the awards season - it's certainly well-earned for her ability to carry a script that demands both dramatic and comedic moments, often in the same scene.Sam Rockwell earns his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor as the dim-witted and racist cop Dixon. It would've been so easy to play him exactly as he sounds - a bumbling idiotic caricature of violent cops seen all too often on the news in recent years, but Rockwell adds layers and hidden flaws to this fractured and troubled character.To talk about the multiple moments in which Woody Harrelson brings his embattled Chief Willoughby to vivid (and on occasion heart-breaking) life would be to reveal too much about particular moments in the film that are best left to the audience to uncover for themselves. Harrison was rightly nominated for the Best supporting Actor gong for is efforts, although Rockwell was always going to beat him to the top prize.It's a much darker film than you might expect from the trailer: there's detailed discussions of the rape and grizzly murder of a teenage girl, incredibly violent and graphic fight scenes (mostly very one-sided), and moments of such heavy emotional weight that the person next to me in the cinema started crying. The film ranks among McDonagh's most serious work yet, but the injection of his trademark humour (a 'blink and you'll miss it' line of dialogue or a subtle piece of physical comedy courtesy of Rockwell) makes it one of his funniest.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Fargo-minus the snow,"Frances McDormand seems to be the perfect cast for tough women with a mission, which goes both for Fargo and this one. Technically, when it comes to character, you could almost describe this as Fargo minus the snow. McDormand plays Mildred, an embittered woman on a quest to find her daughter's murderer. When the local police makes no progress, she decides to take things into her own hands and upsets everyone in the little town of Ebbing along the way, especially through the provocative red billboards asking questions that sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson) isn't really trying to solve the case at all. The movie turns into a gallery of colorful characters, from the man who rents Mildred the billboards, to James (Peter Dinklage), a midget who put Mildred into her place at a dinner date that wrong. Although it's Sam Rockwell's cop Dixon who a wins you over quite easily, it's his beer-drinking mother who is left the biggest impression on me as the archetype of white trash almost bordering on comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious and affecting,"So I watched Three Billboards earlier today. I really may start buying this film's chances as a true contender for Best Picture after all. Considering the incredibly enthusiastic response it got from the audience, it could very well be a consensus pic. For some reason I assumed it would be a ""harder"" film to love, but not at all. In terms of performances, these actors have really rarely been better. Frances McDormand could probably do this role in her sleep, but that's a testament to her abilities and less about it not being great work. Far from it. This role is a culmination of the many types of roles she's played in the past, and she of course delivers it perfectly. There is absolutely no other actress that I think would be able to give the work that she does. The same goes for Sam Rockwell. None of what he does here is too shocking or ""stand out"" because, just like McDormand, he's an actor who has shown traits of this role in some of his works in the past. Again, this is not a criticism but simply proof of what an accomplished and capable actor he's proved himself to be in the past. If the Oscar should come down to him or Willem Dafoe, I think it absolutely should be Rockwell's. Woody Harrelson and Caleb Landry Jones also deliver some strong, affecting work in their roles.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Ultimately uneven, despite superlative acting","THREE BILLBOARDS is a well-intentioned film that exposes social wounds and, above all, what individual anger and vindictiveness can do. The idea is great, putting up three large billboards to draw attention to a young girl's rape and murder, but the plot begins to falter quite rapidly, with far too many actors with individual problems and not enough drive to air them, let alone solve them.The script leaves much to be desired, with obvious credibility loopholes. It reminds me of FARGO, but with far less humor and a much greater foreboding that everybody stands to lose, regardless of what happens.Action sequences and photography are highly competent. The cherry on the cake is the acting. Mc Dormand is superb. Harrelson, in a much smaller part, sublime, functioning almost as the all-seeing eye and authority, even if he cannot catch the killer and is dying of cancer. Both deserve to be nominated for Oscars, at the very least.Although his is a highly engaging performance, I found Sam Rowell's part rather thankless, and his character repellent, as a cop who has his private set of rules and is not smart enough to realize that his anger will cost him. He seems to be changing into someone more thoughtful by movie's end, and that's perhaps one of the film's stronger messages - that revenge really gets you into more trouble than it helps.The film also includes a completely unnecessary, and malicious, attack on the Catholic Church, without any connection to any other part of the film. One can only wonder what Director McDonagh has against the Catholic Church but his hatred clearly runs very deep. His direction is less than inspired and ultimately uneven. With such a stellar cast, he should have invested in a better script, one that does not cop out on an open ending. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
FANTASTIC,"I love a good black comedy, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is precisely that. Humour is perhaps our most essential tool for discussing the dark issues we face in life, and this is a movie filled with Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's trademark dry wit and talent for combining scathing comedy with serious subject matter. Frances McDormand is a terrific lead, full of venom and thinly-veiled bitterness, scowling and sneering at those who wrong her. Her situation is understandable, as is her consternation at what she sees as a slack approach to it from her local police force, which she goes head-to-head with. Brilliant supporting roles are provided by Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell, who is the quintessential snivelling, ignorant bigot, who is given a chance to grow beyond his raw hatred and finally do some good with his life. The story itself seems to take too many digressions in the 3rd act, but I liked the uncertainty upon which it ended, and the questions it forces the audience to ask. I don't mind a perfectly happy ending it if feels right and fits the tone, and it certainly wouldn't have here. The jokes are, in keeping with the material, harsh and even cruel, but what's being presented is unpleasant, and the movie never tries to lampshade it. It never feels overlong and surprises keep popping out of nowhere. Being a huge fan of In Bruges, McDonagh's cinematic debut, I'm glad to see he is keeping the tradition of highly observant dark comedies alive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A message of misandry,"It was an okay movie. It has some tongue-in-cheek humor, plenty of drama, and an almost non-existent thriller aspect. It tells the story of an angry mother, frustrated with the local police of not seeing justice served. What's typical of this movie is the same with much of anything that gets made into a movie or television these days, which is the underlying message of misandry.The ex-husband is always an abusive asshole, the local, all-male, police are clueless, alcoholic, racist buffoons, and a red herring type of man from out of town is some evil, twisted guy that may be preying on innocent girls. We don't gte proof, but who needs proof in this current climate. Just listen, believe, and never verify. To top it off, there was a misandrist gem said by the lead character, Mildred: ""If it was me, I'd start up a database. Every male baby what's born, stick them on it, and as soon as he done something wrong, cross-reference it, make 100% certain it was a correct match, then kill him.""

Martin McDonagh is Tarantino with dramatic flair,"This movie with one of the weirdest title in recent memory is getting a lot of awards lately. It didn't win the Best Picture oscar but people were putting their money on this movie. The Shape of Water won the Best Picture that night. I wasn't the biggest fan of that movie though, I thought the movie was kind of hollow. This movie, however, was a damn dynamite.At its core, it was really about the concept of anger and hate. The main character of this movie is an aging lady, Mildred Hayes, who had her daughter murdered in a gruesome way. After the police seemed to give up on the case, she took it upon herself to use the billboard outside her house to write some things about her daughter's murder. This event led to consequences that not only affects the people around her, but also the whole town of Ebbing, Missouri.From beginning to end, I was constantly glued to the screen. The writing was perfect, the drama was very hard-hitting as well as the dark humor that was peppered throughout the movie. Writings, however, wouldn't mean a damn thing if not performed correctly. The performances in this movie was so affecting. Veteran actors such as Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson, all gave a very conflicted (and funny too, surprisingly) performances. Also, what I liked about this movie was that it touched on the subject of anger and eventually acceptance, but the movie never felt cheesy at all. It delivered the message while still keeping the cynicism that I think is the movie's strongest identity.I think this is a great movie. I thought it could've won the Original Screenplay Oscar, but that didn't happen too, 'Get Out' won that Oscar. That's okay, though, I like 'Get Out'.

Unpredictable and moving tale of grief.,"Employing black comedy to explore how a mother mourns for her viciously murdered daughter is not the way most filmmakers would tackle such a tough subject. But subversive UK writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) is not like most filmmakers. Taking the path less travelled at every opportunity, McDonagh confounds expectations by showing the uncomfortable, unfiltered actions of those trying to come to terms with such a heinous crime. There are no melodramatic, heart-string pulling moments of Hollywood sentimentality here, just pissed off people looking for answers wherever they can find them. The rawness doesn't always work, with a couple of otherwise affecting scenes stumbling due to awkward climactic gags; however, the dark humour (and stubborn aversion to anything resembling normality) successfully turns the film into something of a modern Greek tragedy, and it's compelling viewing. The cast are on point too. Frances McDormand will surely garner an Oscar nomination for her tour de force turn as Mildred, the deceased's mother who'll stop at nothing to get justice, while Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are captivating as two cops with different approaches to the job and their community. Visually it's solid without being overly memorable, but McDonagh and cinematographer Ben Davis do manage to construct an audaciously long and unbroken tracking shot that is breathtaking in its brutality, and an (extremely) early contender for sequence of the year. An unpredictable tale of grief that eschews mawkishness in favour of frankness, Three Billboards is an amusing look at how unfair and crappy life can occasionally be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Anger only begets more anger,"I just finished watching this film and good golly did it leave me confused, not only for the film's climax (or lack thereof) but also because it seemed to be hinting at something much larger in the grand scheme of things. When the film begins, you think you know who's the good guys, and who's the bad guys, then certain events occur and these events force you to alter your perception of the ""heroes"" and the ""villains"" in this dark, but moving story of grief and vengeance.Frances McDormand, perhaps better known for her role as pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson in the Coen Brother's ""Fargo"", is about as far from ""Minnesota Nice"" as you can get and still remain sympathetic towards. Grieving divorced mother Mildred Hayes is tough, relentless, and uncompromising, willing to do whatever it takes for justice to be served towards the person(s) responsible for the rape and brutal murder of her teenage daughter Angela.In supporting roles are Ebbing, Missouri police chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the latter in particular playing a deeply troubled man suffering from emotional trauma and instability. The film itself may be considered by some a tragicomedy, balancing a thin line between tragedy and comedy, but I rarely found the jokes all that funny, expect for a few instances, more often than that it came off as annoying or inappropriate considering the circumstances, but that isn't really the point.To many people who view this film they might come away from it angry and unsatisfied because it doesn't really give any clear answers about it's motives or messages, simply puts them out for the film's characters and we, the audience, to view and draw our own conclusions, much like the titular three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri.

A strong movie (with some unfortunate flaws),"The movie follows grieving mother (Frances McDormand) after the unsolved murder of her teenage daughter. As she becomes frustrated with the local police's lack of progress, she decides to rent three billboards on the outskirts of her hometown to send a personal message to the authorities... but what those billboards trigger is not what she expects. Great characters, great performances and great writing make movie memorable. McDormand is simply superb as the mother whose anger is just part of her problems in life. Movie is a hugely entertaining, no mater basically it's a drama. But, at times, the plot is lacking in direction and can come across as a little too sarcastic and even cartoonish at times, but overall, the writing is so strong and the acting is so on point. As a result, film is not for general viewing audiences but if you are a film buff, you should enjoy the film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Immoral to the Core,"This film is just horrible.We have a woman who is hateful. We are supposed to feel sympathy because her daughter was killed - but how can you? She is foul mouthed, treats her children terribly, makes wild accusations, belittles the town priest (very unnecessary), tortures the town dentist (and it is okay to physically harm someone because you are grieving?), kicks two kids in the groin in front of the high school (so child abuse is okay also if you are an uneducated foul mouth?), and it goes on and on. This movie basically says that if something bad happens to you that you have the right to urinate on the rest of the world with no consequences.Then we have to make the two dimensional cop who is racist and foul just to further create our movie of a ""hate culture"" and promote more hatred.The movie had one redeeming quality - Woody Harrelson. His character even explains that there is no DNA, no witnesses, no leads - which we know in reality makes a case hard to solve - but instead we have a horrible lead who does not care - does not care who's life she ruins, who she hurts, just as long as her hatred is fueled.This is the garbage that helps to set the immoral, vile, foul, hateful culture that permeates society.

Impervious story telling,"This is a great example of taking a simple concept and writing a fully fleshed out and just BANGIN story out of it. Everything just progresses so logically and tightly and cohesively it's just UGH. I just love how each piece was so thoughtfully crafted and selected and how events unfold and characters react. Zero loose strings whatsoever. Rich and powerful symbolism interspersed, but not too overpowering - the story always came first. The way it toys with expectations several times throughout the film on several different story elements. Really this movie should have won best original screenplay over The Shape of Water but oh well it's the Oscars what can you do? And not only all of that, it introduces some of the best and most loveable characters of 2017 - Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand - who won best actress, which I thought should have been given to Sally Hawkins for The Shape of Water but whatever, at least both films won something in some sense), William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell - who won best supporting actor), Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), and really the list goes on from here. And it walks perfectly the dark comedy line without ever straying down a road that's too sad or down a comedic part that doesn't forget the morbid overarching plot. The only other film that straddles this gap any better from this year is The Killing of a Sacred Deer - my favorite movie from 2017. The only real detractor from this movie I felt was the way that the characters interacted. It's funny how much inspiration this film takes from Flannery O'Connor - thematically and aesthetically. I love her short stories but I have always had a problem with the characters feeling that they were a little shallow or they knew what the next line someone would say before they said it, or perhaps the feeling they knew they were in a story. It's hard to explain, but her stories have a feel to them. I suppose I'm getting at the fact that this story is so deeply seated in reality, I think it's weird how characters talk like a Shakespearean play in that they aren't only talking to someone on stage, but projecting to the audience. This also contributes to the tone being a little wobbly throughout too. Either way, it's a minor nitpick and doesn't stop this movie from being one of my favorites of the year. Brilliant movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

McDonagh's American Commentary,"Martin McDonagh has his virtues and his flaws. His virtues are quirky, not entirely realistic but engaging characters, his talent for irony and surprises, and his ability to tap into the darkest recesses of human emotions. His flaws are his lack of ear for dialogue and his mommy issues. All are on display here.This movie is a good exploration of the rage that can be engendered by grief. Frances McDormand gives a gritty, powerful performance. I didn't find Sam Rockwell's character to be realistic, though, and some of the events stretched credulity.

"Part funny, part bleak, all quite well done.","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the third film from writer/director McDonagh (of 'In Bruges' & 'Seven Psychopaths' fame), and continues his themes of taking something quite bleak/violent (in this case the murder of a woman's daughter) and building situations with characters around it that can still be funny. Mildred (McDormand) is the focus here, and she rents three billboards from Red (Landry Jones) to call out the police for not finding her daughter's murderer, so Chief Willoughby (Harrelson) is put in a tight spot.Dixon (Rockwell) is one of his cops and has a great part as the dimwitted, slightly-bigoted younger cop. McDormand is exceptional as the ultra-focused and hard-nosed grieving mother, with a few layers. Harrelson is also good, but Cornish as his wife has the weirdest Australian/Southern accent mash-up I've ever heard! And the age-gap there is hard to comprehend... The only shame is Dinklage doesn't get more screen time, but still good seeing him.It's odd that it was all filmed in North Carolina, not Missouri, as there's some beautiful scenery shots that definitely don't look like St Louis! Also worth noting that Ebbing's not a real place. The mystery and investigation is handled quite well and realistically, but the attention here is on anger - misplaced or otherwise - and how it can consume people and create a destructive cycle.

'I, Tonya' is a black comedy. this is not. anyway, the plot of the film was good and your sympathy was with McDormand, which is more than i can say for a lot of movies this awards season ('lady bird' and 'the florida project' made me want to throw things) i know life isn't always fair but i had to take points away for things happening to the good guys that meant well. basically, not great, not horrible. watch if you're bored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Captivating Until The End,"This film did a fantastic job at keeping me intrigued and invested in the plot and the characters throughout the entirety of the run time, while keeping the plot fresh and unexpected. Many independent films similar to this film tend to distract the audience with unexpected plot twists and ill-fitting celebrities, but this film managed to avoid both tropes. Despite the film consisting of an award winning cast, the casting was superb and no character felt out of place. The plot was outstandingly unexpected, similar to that of a Quentin Tarantino script. As The Telegraph put it, ""Its characters continually defy your burnt-in expectations of what they'd do, and what might be done to them in turn, in a better-behaved, more formulaic script.""

What British screenwriters think rural Americans and cops are like,"Great performances--every acting Oscar was deserved. 
But as others here have mentioned, the characters and dialog are what a bigoted, Guardian-reading playwright would assume of Americans, and American cops.

Simple and Messy - but very beautiful,"'Three billboards' isn't what you think it will be. IMDb calls it a 'crime/drama' film. I went in expecting a story centering on how a vengeful and distraught mother exposes laziness and/or incompetence in the police force, spurs action from the authorities, and through the sheer absurdity of having erected billboards, manages to achieve her objectives.Unexpectedly, what I ended up seeing was an absolute masterpiece. It is something like this: Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) appears to be a resolute and stubborn character, that part was accurate. She lives in a small town in the 'heartland' of America. Her life and world are surrounded by broken, bumbling and childish characters, who react viciously and churlishly to her decisions throughout the movie. A chaos-infused series of events ensues (after the billboards are put up) and the movie is full of dark moments of humor. What happens in the end is not what you expect, but hopefully mid-way through the movie, you have realized that it isn't really a 'crime/drama' - it is much, much more than that and deserves to live outside of the traditional storytelling conventions.Woody Harrelson was enjoyable as the police chief. You are so prepared to hate and despise him at first that you don't know what to make of it when you see his helplessness and earnestness come through, suddenly and completely. Likewise, Sam Rockwell delivers a masterful performance as a dangerously empowered man-child with a deep-rooted racial bias. Others come and go - Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes (haven't seen him in anything meaningful since 'eastbound and down') and - surprise surprise, Peter Dinklage. All of these actors do justice and more to their roles, and you end up being hungry for more from each one of them.The highlight of course, is Frances McDormand herself and her portrayal of a hated woman. There is a particularly powerful scene at the end where she falls to her knees and breaks into tears. That is when you truly see her for what she is: a wounded and scarred woman, and a heartbroken mother acting out of sheer desperation. You badly want her to get justice, but after 1.5+ hours of 'Three Billboards outside...', you of course know by now that justice doesn't just get awarded to those who deserve it or appear to want it, or even need it. Justice is a meaningless term, and is most likely happenstance (as Woody Harrelson articulates well, in a surprising scene).There is a big message in the movie though. It is woven in very subtly, but hard to miss once you realize what is happening. And the message is that small-town America is a complex and messy world, that should be taken for what it is. For those trying to idyllically glorify it by using poetic and dramatic terms - please learn from these characters, and their broken lives and mental frameworks. There is deep-rooted bias of every kind that appears institutionalized and very very hard to remove, and permeates into almost all walks of life, as shown by some of the leads in the movie. At the same time, for those dismissing rural towns' inhabitants as simple or menial fools, the earnestness and realism of these characters should hopefully change your view. Their lives, dreams, troubles and hopes hit you hard, and hopefully we take away lessons of our own from them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Great Movie, Worth the Nominations","Three Billboards definitely deserves the Oscar buzz, but it is by no means great. The characters are average, and we tend to not care too much about them.

Three Billboards--by now you know it's a great film,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) was written and directed by Martin McDonagh. By now, most people have either seen the movie or heard quite a bit about it. It's strange to write the 641st review. However, here it is.If you want to see a great actor in a great movie, watch Frances McDormand in this film. Co-stars Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell do very well, but McDormand is perfect.Scriptwriter McDonagh has given McDormand the demanding role of a mother whose daughter has been raped and murdered. McDormand is angry, and she's also guilty. That is a powerful recipe for action. McDormand isn't a likable character, but you can understand her rage and her pain.This is a brilliant film and deserves all the positive reviews and awards that it has received.This is a movie that you don't want to miss.

"Brilliant, black comedy/drama","Anyone who thinks this is an homage (or ripoff) of a Coen Brothers movie is watching the movie very superficially. True, it's a black comedy/drama, starring Francis McDormand, but that's where the comparison begins and ends. Three Billboards has far more in common with the director's own ""In Bruges"" than any Coen Brothers movies.This movie challenges you to examine how your initial impression of people can be very wrong. Additionally, it shows that even the most despicable characters can be capable of redemption (or at least a partial redemption). Sam Rockwell is outstanding as a thuggish policeman who is ill equipped to handle the significant events unfolding around his life. Writer/Director Martin McDonough takes Officer Dixon (Rockwell) through some significant life-changing events without relying on a tired redemption arc. Rockwell handles this character development adroitly, and we see why he was a runaway winner for ""Best Supporting Actor"" at the 2018 Oscars.Francis McDormand's character Mildred is unrelentingly bitter, but considering the pain her character is enduring, the pain and anger is justified. Woody Harrelson is a standout as embattled Police Chief Willoughby. The relationship between Mildred and Chief Willoughby, like much of the movie, only seems one-dimensional, until we realize there's much more affection between the two than we've been led to believe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

RATING: 4.3/5The movie starts off at a good, steady pace, and then escalates little by little as it progresses. You're presented with this mother, who's daughter was raped and murdered, and the case has gone unsolved for months, so you think it's a murder mystery. As the movie goes on, you start to notice that you're following some pretty angry characters that don't know how to deal with the reality that has become of their lives. Yes, the murder is there in the background, but what you're really seeing is how this deep loss and anger affects the lead character and the people around her. Hell, she even drags some people down into her own anger as you watch them try to deal with situations in their own angry ways, and see how it ripples across the small town they're in. Once i realized that, the movie became pretty interesting to me, since their actions became more and more self destructive, and i wanted to see how far they'd take it.This is very much a character driven piece and there's a lot of great acting going around. I honestly can't think of a single bad performance. There are some black supporting characters in the background, but they're really only there to establish that the town is a little backwards with some racist undertones. There's no KKK and the movie isn't trying to preach to you about race, it's just trying to let you know more about the town itself. They're small scenes and pretty subtle for a movie like this, but i can see how someone might take offense at first by jumping to conclusions.I went into this movie cold and ended up leaving pleasantly surprised and a little disappointed at the way the whole thing ended. That's really the only negative thing i can say about it without nitpicking. The film ends on this ambiguous, typical indie style movie ending, and you just kinda feel cheated. You've been with these characters, seeing their anger and their actions grow and grow. You think it's all coming to a head, something that was looking to be a really satisfying ending. I was so onboard with what was about to go down and then the movie just ends. I was left sitting there thinking, ""Where the hell is my payoff???"" That's probably the films biggest mistake that stops it from being a great movie, and leaves it in ""really good"" territory. That being said, I think it's definitely worth a watch, for the great performances alone, if you get a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I think this is very much an example of what cinema was made for. Three Billboards is excellent.,"It's a film much like the, often focused on, tied back undercut of Frances McDormand's hair; it very much presents two diametrically opposed things at once, one on top, one underneath and it lets us feel the way we want about them. Frances' Mildred may very well have been crazy before her daughter was killed, we don't know as we're mercifully and brilliantly dropped in months into her grieving process. People don't generally write slice of life films like this unless they're true stories, which intensifies the proof of skill writer/director Martin McDonagh has with writing nuanced, balanced, flawed characters. He manages, from his background writing plays, to not waste a single scene, there is not one moment in this film that doesn't bleed into another at some point and every moment gives weight to the next in the kind of suspense, surprise and momentum that other films just dream of having. The film uses its small microcosm of Ebbing, Missouri, and it's small incomplete story, to subvert film cliches effortlessly. There's a moment where Woody Harrelson coughs blood in the middle of a tough interrogation scene and the artificiality of his demeanour and that moment is just killed dead; his face shocked like a little boy's, his subject actually instantly taking pity on him. I've seen this in real life, I've never seen a moment like this in film, a construct built on artificiality, to use that construct to break it, just to show how human these human-like artifices are, is as close to magic as cinema gets. What am I talking about? I mean, I know, do you? And if you do, can you explain it to the next guy, cos I can't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

With regards to the use of red in this film,"Colour symbolism in movies is something that I appreciate very much, whilst also realising it's something that can be overdone.I've awarded this film ten stars for many reasons, one of the primary reasons being how the colour red is used in this film. Spectacular. My mother didn't notice red played such a huge role, but that's when you know it's being done right. The use of red really reminds you throughout of the anger Mildred constantly feels the whole run time. With red finishes on her shop, a red sweater worn my Mildred on several occasions and flashes of red light throughout you're forced to deal with Mildred's inner emotions spilling out into the physical world. You're trapped in the anger of it all.Also huge HUGE credits to McDonagh for not shying away from the violence and language presented in this movie. It just makes everything feel less Hollywood and real. Why wouldn't you swear every other minuet after your daughter was raped and killed?

 Sam Rockwell's character was my favorite. And it's not by accident that Sam won the Oscar for BEST Supporting Actor. He was awesome.
 Lastly, this film was awesome and if someone is wanting to watch something that is very fulfilling - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the one to watch. I respect all of the ""haters'"" opinions but seriously - how on earth did you'll not get it???",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""How does a film so empty of emotional intelligence... sweep the board on prizes?"" -- Tim Parks in The New Yorker","When I put this one in our Netflix queue, I was expecting a gritty little yarn about a part of the country that's rarely seen onscreen (unless you happen to be watching ""Sharp Objects"" on HBO), something like ""Winter's Bone,"" only down toward the flatlands and a little bit further north. What with the reviews and awards and all, I must've lost sight of the fact that the film was W&D'd by Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, also the creator of splashy Tarantinian fantasies like ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths."" My bad!The overall shoddiness of the script, the stagy dialogue and the characters' loony behavior completely undercut the technical virtuosity on display, from the admittedly fine performances to the cinematography and soundtrack. TV and movies have taught us that small-town cops commit random acts of violence with impunity, especially in a vaguely Southern setting; in Ebbing, that privilege seems to be extended to civilians as well, which may be why the victims seem so understanding when, e.g., somebody tosses them out a window or firebombs a building they happen to be sitting in...Two characters--not portrayed as otherwise admirable in any way--who have been victims of brutal, irrational assaults make large or small gestures of forgiveness; one of them bonds with his attacker and sets off on an open-ended quest that brings the film to its baffling conclusion. I'm guessing that what McDonagh had in mind was some sort of action-packed parable about violence, repentance and forgiveness, but ""Crime and Punishment"" it's not.That being said, it looks like the critics have finally gotten it right--the last capsule review I saw (NYT) just read, ""Exhausting."" And I'm still trying to figure out how good ol' boy Sheriff Woody came by an Australian trophy wife (Samara Weaving of ""SMILF"") who makes naughty little jokes about Oscar Wilde...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Powerful,"What a fascinating and powerful drama! Without spoiling any details of the story, it was about a woman, based in a small town Ebbing, Missouri, who had lost her child owing to a hideous crime, and had decided to challenge the local authorities to investigate into the murder of her daughter.To prompt such investigation, she had rented three massive billboard asking a rather straightforward question: who is accountable for such grotesque crimes? This led a wave of fury amongst the local town people, who showed their support to the local sheriff, and questioned the motive of the mother. Laying it out there serves as a hotbed of back-and-forth drama (and ensuing mistrust) between the local police and the woman, in question.The star of the film, for me, was the cop played by Sam Rockwell, who is absolutely detestable to watch at the beginning of the film. Not because of his questionable practices (in one instance, he beats billboard owner for the reasons that have no bearing on a crime or an offence) but because of his redeeming qualities. His character represents one of those stubborn individuals who are so set in their ways that they cease to understand the world around them. They know that something is inherently wrong with their thinking but they continue to indulge in it anyway without any regard to the people or things around them. And as I said earlier, it was the redeeming quality - and its realisation of it - that made me love the character towards the second half of the film.The movie is peppered with black humour throughout, and evokes all sorts of emotions: empathy, rage, frustration, and finally, hope. For me it was the best film of the last year and it should have won the best picture at the Oscars.I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The characters are too unrealistic and cartoonish to take this movie seriously. And this is the main problem of this movie.,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, should be a good movie, but the fact that the characters are too cartoonish and consequently these same characters become too unrealistic to be taken seriously. Of course Frances McDormand, did a good job as a violent mother. But Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson just did a nice job. Martin McDonagh is trying to impress the audience with fierce mannerisms, showing violence only by showing, and as a result he is trying to impress the male audience (audience is only interested in violence, instead of seeing a good story). In other words, the director was more interesting to create a movie full of violence, instead of creating a real drama with real characters and real and interesting conflicts, and an interesting film to see.So, in the end, this movie is your typical movie to please a certain group, in this case police haters (that is to say), many movies are in the top of the IMDb, only because in the same movies there are scenes in which the characters can deceive the police or there are scenes in which a large number of policemen are killed - the scene of the mother setting fire to the police station, in this film will be a future classic, in the minds of many people, mark my words.We are not going to fool ourselves, a large number of the population hate the police and rightly so, many policemen abuse their position. But traumatized idiots, instead of getting over the traumas, they come here to give big scores to films like these, just to satisfy the vengeful wishes they have against the police.If this is not enough, director Martin McDonagh only puts scenes of violence just to generate more violence, and with that these scenes become unnecessary violence scenes, scenes of the dentist and the mother hitting teenagers in the genital organs. A police officer throws a citizen from the window of a building, the police chief sees this and only fires him. Seriously.What's the point of director Martin McDonagh? To prove that anger generates more anger, or violence generates more violence. At least he could put it in a more discreet way without the need for violent scenes. The effect he made was the opposite, because scenes of gratuitous violence only generate more violence in the streets. Amateur.Even, the humor element becomes too obvious that borders the ridiculous, the scene in which a police officer, talks to the violent mother after the accident at the dentist. The scenes of black comedy border on the stupid and tasteless aspect and completely misplaced. The midget scene is completely misplaced too and overly obvious (putting a black comedy scene between before a dramatic scene, really!!). And of course, the annoying monologue of Frances McDormand's character with the deer, about reincarnation. Predictable and too obvious. Or dog-shaped slippers scene is obviously, also annoying to see.Not to mention that the movie script is full of ridiculous situations, bordering on the absurd. The mother in principle hates the police, because (stupid reason) is taking too long to find the culprit of rape and death of the daughter, then the mother becomes friends with a police officer, after she has seen that the same police officer (the same idiot, who throws a citizen from the window) risked his live to go get the paper process of the daughter in the back of the police station that was burning (fire put by the mother herself). Stupid and juvenile.This is the typical movie that ends where it started. In the end, the culprit of the crime was not caught, the mother is still violent (the mother was always violent, just see in the flashbacks, the discussions she had with her daughter) and she embarks on a journey to go hunting down a ""supposed"" rapist, with the police officer than threw the man out the window. Idiot, I know.
I only give 2 stars, for the good performance of Frances McDormand, because she convinces me as a violent mother.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark and human story about grief, a superb character driven crime drama","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a crime drama film written, co-produced and directed by Martin McDonagh. Frances McDormand plays the lead as a Missouri woman who rents three roadside billboards to call attention to her daughter's unsolved rape and murder. Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Abbie Cornish, John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones and Clarke Peters appear in supporting roles.I actually saw this at the cinema back in 2017 and was blown away of the acting, the cinematography, the authenticity, the themes and just Martin McDonagh in general. There's so many memorable performances as are scenes that will stay with you for years to come, it did for me. But here I am, writing a review on this magnificent film that's completely flawless. But it's quite slow paced thus it isn't for the average viewer, but if you're looking for a crime drama that will exceed your anticipations then Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is for you. It's more about the characters than the story as the crime happened seven months before the events of the movie, it's about the characters in Ebbing and especially Mildred Hayes and her grief.Why did I exactly rewatch this film other than the superb writing and direction. It's the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell. McDormand and Rockwell won the Academy Award for Best leading actress and best supporting actor. They're delivering some of their best acting performances of their careers in this film, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri also won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Picture.

A lot of unnecessary bad language and violence but I suppose that is expected from a black comedy in 2018.
It doesn't paint a nice picture of mid town USA and it may have a political theme .
But overall I believe most will feel it worth viewing even if only to drive a bus through the script.

"Martin McDonagh strikes another hit with this quirky, off-beat drama","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the small, mid-western town of Ebbing, Missouri, the daughter of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has been raped and murdered, and months have passed without any suspect being caught. In an act of desperation, she hires three large billboards leading into the town to put up some messages to embarrass the town's cancer stricken chief of police Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) into action. However, Mildred's actions come to have a far higher effect on more people than merely Willoughby, not least the volatile Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and a host of others who prove less than sympathetic to her plight...Ten years on, and Martin McDonagh's Belgian set comedy thriller In Bruges still remains one of the most memorable films of the last decade or so, with its witty, sharp dialogue and excruciating political incorrectness. And yet since then, this film proves only the second directorial feature he's made, a steady drip stream of work that even Quentin Tarantino would struggle to topple. His name is far less likely to seep into the cultural consciousness as that man's did, but when he pens a quality script, he hits a zinger, as this very impressive piece of work is further prove of.McDonagh has selected a seasoned cast list of mature performers that are unlikely to appeal to the general target demographic of cinema goers, but will certainly whet the beaks of the more mature film-goers, and each one of them, including McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, is perfectly suited to their role and deliver fine performances. It's McDonagh's distinctive style that drives the film, though, able as he is to take such a dark, tragic plotline and give it such a darkly humorous edge, whilst never losing the emotionally charged dramatic under-current that keeps it all flowing.He's certainly quite a shy, occasional director, but if McDonagh can consistently produce this kind of quality work, it's a shame that he doesn't pop his head out more often. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Frances McDormand delivers one of the best performances we've seen in 2017.,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) is a film written and directed by Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) and takes place in small, rural, Ebbing Missouri and follows our lead actress Frances McDormand who plays Mildred, a mother who challenges the police department's competence by renting three billboards which take aim at their inability to solve the death of her daughter.Mildred (Frances McDormand) is a remarkably well rounded character. The narrative finds no problem telling us all we need to know about Mildred through spectacular show-not-tell storytelling and she wins over the audience within the first handful of minutes of being on screen. Mildred shows humanizing strengths and weaknesses which come off as gripping, inspiring, and at some points - heart wrenching.Dixon (Sam Rockwell) has a role in the story of a scummy, bigoted, racist cop who's morally despicable behavior leave the audience disgusted by his actions, but as the narrative goes forth and we learn about Dixon he becomes one of the most compelling characters we've seen in film in recent memory.Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) brings forth a charm, fun, charisma which serve as light and tension breaking warmth in some of the darker or more tense scenes in the film. Woody Harrelson completely brings Willoughby to life and his magnetic personality makes him a treat to watch anytime he's on screen.Besides those three main characters, we also see superb performances from some of the supporting characters - namely Caleb Landry Jones playing Red Welby, Kerry Condon playing Pamela, and Abbie Cornish playing Anne. The script along with the actors' dedication to their characters make for a certainly gripping cast of characters.While there's only one or two things about the story that prevent this movie from being a solid 10 in my eyes, there's still just so much to admire with the storytelling, cinematography, and direction with this film. It's a fully cohesive story which doesn't waste any time and definitely does not overstay it's welcome. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri makes for a great character study given the depth and the arcs we go through with the characters and this film is certainly one of the best of 2017, highly recommend checking this one out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

This movie somewhat reminds me of ""Out of the Furnace"" but not as dark and honestly not as good in the least. ""Out of the Furnace"" is an example of a masterpiece in the genre, ""Three Billboards"" is a close follower, though much less a thriller. Many have said the editing is ""flawless"" in this movie. As far as continuation of situations and scenes, it is. But, As a horror writer and director, what stood out to me IS some poor editing in other aspects. You know, muting some dialog or the second layer of sound but you can still clearly see peoples mouths moving.. I get the director tries to angle the shots so the mouths are slightly out of view but on many angles the wordless mouths are still seen. I know this happens in pretty much literally every movie but this is one of the ones where it stands out. Aside from that, we are treated with a homey down south feeling. This is not really a movie about finding the person(s) responsible, but rather the actions and consequences of ones actions to a devastating event. Its a story about hardened greif and making the right choices. Honestly, I don't understand why everyone is rating it so high but it still doesn't deserve a low rating either.

Frances McDormand,"I have not been very fond of earlier films by Martin McDonagh, but this movie has Frances McDormand in the lead role as a woman who puts up those three billboards. It's been a good many months since her daughter was raped while dying, then doused with kerosene and set afire, and she puts up those billboards asking sheriff Woody Harrelson why they haven't arrested anyone.With McDonagh's earlier movies, the performances have been all over the shop, as if some people are playing a scene for comedy and some for tragedy and no one is talking to anyone else. With McDormand at the center, saying what she is saying, the mood shifts in an instant from comedy to Harrelson's coughing his lungs out without anyone missing a beat. It's one of those instants in a movie that tells you that these actors are inhabiting these characters who have known each other for decades and draws me into the moment and the story far more than anything else could.I don't know if McDonagh has finally learned how to direct his own material; I suspect that he let McDormand have her own head. Several decades ago, her turn in FARGO had me convinced that Ethan Coen came in one day and said ""Joel, if you don't let Frances play this scene the way she wants, I'm going to be sleeping on the couch for a long time.""
I think she understands these characters and can show them, and McDonagh let her have her head. The proof is on the screen, if you go look at it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A must-see that must win many awards,"When so many movies are franchise works or sequels or remakes, it's such a pleasure to find a genuinely original film like ""Three Billboards"". The plotting is unconventional with unexpected developments and most of the characters are complex (unfortunately two young women are presented as stereotypically dumb and a black cop as overly honourable).This is a social drama in the vein of ""Manchester By The Sea"" where the central characters are suffering great pain and anguish but, unlike the earlier film, what starts with a sense of vengeance ends in a kind of redemption. Much of the credit for the movie's success has to go to the British Martin McDonagh who both wrote and directed, as he did in 2008 for ""In Bruges"", but he is well-deserved by an excellent cast.Frances McDormand, Academy Award winner for ""Fargo"", is simply brilliant as Mildred Hayes, the mother of a girl who - as the middle of the three billboards states uncompromisingly - was ""raped while dying"". Although she initially has the viewer's unqualified sympathy, we are soon treated to words and actions from her that make clear that this is a woman who will say or do almost anything to advance what she sees as a righteous cause.Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell give subtle performances as good cop and bad cop respectively in the Ebbing police station and, as the story develops, they - like Mildred - do not behave as you would expect. There is much physical and mental pain in this tale but also some black humour and unusual friendships. A real must-see.Note: There is no Ebbing in Missouri and the film was largely shot in Sylva in North Carolina. The film has echoes of a use of billboards in a similar fashion over a long period in a place called Vidor in Texas where the killer has still not been identified.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Great Script, Great Cast, But Not For Everyone","Films like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" are an interesting case study to me in that there is a lot of buzz around it as it has been making the rounds on the festival circuit for a bit now. However, given the subject matter of the script that was also directed by ""Seven Psychopaths"" writer/director Martin McDonagh, I will be interested to see how it is accepted by a mass audience. Submitted for your perusal:Mildred (Frances McDormand) lives in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, where she is mourning the brutal death of her daughter. Nine months have passed with no leads, no arrests, and no real questions answered. Her grief in this time has gotten more and more intense, and she decides to take matters in her own hands by bringing more awareness to her community in a grand matter, getting the attention of local sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his direct report Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and an entire community of people who take sides in a tale of the consequences of the choices we make as well as the consequences of those consequences.Like I alluded to earlier, this is definitely not for everyone. Listed on IMDb as a ""darkly comic drama,"" they ain't lyin'. There is subject matter in ""Three Billboards"" on multiple levels that could make the sensitive types a bit uneasy. The odd part here is that I cannot really get into all of them without leading you down the primrose path of spoilers, so you just need to kind of roll with me on this one. And to truly convey not only the subject matter but even McDonagh's script itself, it takes a special kind of cast, and he went out and got the right people here. McDormand (who is always on her ""A"" game) continues her streak of great performances here bringing what could easily be portrayed as a woman devoid of emotion and almost downright detestable and making her on some levels a sympathetic character. Mildred's anger fuels her, even in the wrong ways in some cases, but the maternal side of her reminds her that she still needs to be a role model to her surviving child in a son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges). Harrelson continues to wow me here as the lawman that really wants to do the right thing, even in facing adversity in both his professional and personal lives and works well with McDormand and Rockwell by understanding what the dynamics have to be dealing with both characters. And if you know me, you know what a fan or Rockwell's I am, and he also does not disappoint as the cop that knows that this is really his only course of career after growing up in the same small town he wants to protect if it wasn't for the fact that he just cannot seem to get out of his own way. Peter Dinklage also has a great turn here in less of a role, but his character of James becomes very important as the third act progresses, and it all comes together in a well-crafted story that takes some turns that even caught me off- guard in a way that was a bit shocking without being ""shock value"" and adds more layers to the story in the way that McDonagh has shown with his past work in films like ""In Bruges"" and ""Six Shooter"".I truly enjoyed ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" more than I expected to, even after being told by multiple colleagues and friends how much they enjoyed it. I would not be surprised if there is at least a small buzz for members of this cast when hardware starts becoming a factor in our consciousness here in a couple of months, and with the end-of-year push hitting full throttle ahead of us for the next one hundred and forty-four days, this film may be able to find its niche amongst them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"it's not injustice, it's just life","Intolerant, self-righteous and ruthless in lashing out against what she perceives as injustice - the failure by police to solve her daughter's murder - but which is actually just the way of the world: the Frances McDormouse character has suddenly become very, very relevant. Are we supposed to approve of her? Because I find her completely unlikeable and unsympathetic. And you can't have that kind moral ambiguity at the heart of a film which is all about morality.I do sort of like the way this avoids the usual, obvious ways of developing a story, and the way it manages to be alternative without being artsy or Bohemian; but on the other hand, there's a reason why the usual ways are usual. In the end this goes nowhere and fails to satisfy; but I suppose the sense of frustration with which it leaves you at least shows that it has raised some interesting questions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Tonally confused and cartoonish.,"""Anger begets greater anger."" says Penelope (Samara Weaving), Mildred's (Frances McDormand) ex-husband's totally non stereotypical nineteen year old new girlfriend, who delivers the film's theme in what is supposed to be another comedic moment where we are all supposed to laugh at this beautiful but shallow girl's attempt at sounding smart, and yet, it falls flat, like the vast majority of both dramatic and comedic moments.I just want to clarify before going any further that In Bruges, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut, is one of my absolute favorite films. One that navigates comedy and drama perfectly, brilliantly written and acted, I could go on for days on how perfect In Bruges is, in my humble opinion.Sadly, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri fails miserably where In Bruges succeeded. It constantly tries to navigate the difficult line between dark comedy and drama, and mostly, it falls flat on its head.The thematic thread may be to blame here. Without spoiling the plot, the setup is simple: Frances McDormand wants some form of justice for her daughter's brutal murder. She gets the local police department's attention by setting up three billboards complaining about their inability to solve the case. But her action only generates more conflict in town and while it does draw attention to her daughter's case, it leads to increasing tension between her and pretty much everyone else around her. Her anger literally begets more anger and, ultimately, solves nothing.This is a surprisingly simple moralistic viewpoint coming from the man whose first film was so morally complex and ambiguous and it results in the creation of equally shallow characters and a plot that desperately tries to make sense of its many pointless turns.To be fair, McDonagh attempts to humanize its more prominent characters: Mildred (McDormand), in spite of being a tough and wooden most of the time, shows deep vulnerability in an unfortunately insufferably cheesy monologue she gives to a deer. Meanwhile, Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the ""black torturer,"" displays humanity later in the movie and tries really hard to find redemption when he is shown the way.Unfortunately those attempts are so sudden and awkward or poorly executed that they lack believability and feel like they were artificially implemented to make these characters seem deeper than they really are.Throughout the film, it feels like the filmmaker is more interested in hammering his simplistic viewpoint and using small town America as a perfect setting for it - even though it never feels like he has actually ever spent time there - than to craft a story with a coherent through line and inhabited by humane, relatable characters.There was so much talent involved in the making of this film - and in spite of everything, Sam Rockwell delivers a stellar performance - that it is truly frustrating that the end result be so mediocre. Hopefully, McDonagh will course correct on his next film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

See this film as its own unique work of art,"I read through several reviews- many negative. I found that viewer/critics wanted to make sense of the film as if it was intended to be a close up of white-dominated town in Missouri. This movie is not about modern culture. This story and the players in it are displaying raw emotions that we all -whether we admit it or not -share. Don't look for solving a murder. Look at humans inside their cosmos. They all are struggling to face death by cancer, murder, bigotry, homophobia, growing up with effed-up parents, and changing times. Frances McDermott is always bringing her best game. Sam Rockwell as Dixon however is a tour de force. I was convinced he was an illiterate closet gay using anger to look like a man. He evolved (I could care less about his sexuality) and is that not worth a star or two? He played his part to perfection and then some.

The Best of the Year? Not Quite.,"Engaging, interesting, deep, but poorly-paced. Those are the best words that come to mind after I finished re-watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.This was my first Martin McDonagh film and it encouraged me to check out his two, much better, previous films -- Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges. If you enjoyed the unpredictable storytelling of any one of his films, but have not watched them all, you will also enjoy his unpredictable, unique narrative structure of his other films, which particularly shines in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His characters are all well-developed, although some are more interesting and watchable than others. Three Billboards is no exception. The story is very smart and serious, even though the screenplay is as hilarious as the subject matter is dark.Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a woman grieving after the rape and murder of her daughter. After months of the local police doing nothing for her case, she takes justice into her own hands, first in the form of three billboards calling out the police chief, Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby. As the story unravels and the tension builds, the message becomes more and more clear, until it is finally spoken in simple, obvious terms that ruins the subtlety and intelligence of the screenplay. However, the characters are still deep, emotional, and well-developed throughout even when the screenplay falters.I particularly enjoyed the development and arc of Sam Rockwell's racist police officer, Dixon. At first, he is given the simple, one-dimensional characterization that causes viewers to dismiss him as the villain, or at least an obstacle in the way of the protagonist. Over halfway through, a realization dawns on viewers that sets the stage for the wonderful message: Maybe the hero seeking justice is just as bad as the racist cop. The theme of anger begetting anger is brilliantly told through the characters and their actions in the story.The setting is also just as important in this movie as many of the characters are. By naming the town fictionally, it is easier to understand how these characters with unrealistic traits and qualities would interact and live in a town like this. Although the characters seem unrealistic, their emotions are certainly real and relatable. McDonagh has a preference for naming his films literally and directly from what the story is about. Ebbing, Missouri is a place of receding hope and grief. In other words, the love, hope, and optimism in Ebbing, Missouri ebbs away as the film progresses and the characters act more and more.The largest flaw I have with this film is the pacing of the third act. The first two acts were exceptionally well-made/paced and evoke strong reactions from the audience. Once the majority of the story has been told and the events laid out for us, the film comes screeching to halt, but doesn't end. After the climactic sequence, the story slowly (slower than you can imagine) crawls to its conclusion. As a result, the conclusion leaves viewers thinking, ""Finally!"" where it could have left us thinking that it was shorter than it actually is. To quote Roger Ebert in his A Clockwork Orange review, ""You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half,"" and those words have never applied to a film more than Three Billboards.While I still encourage you all to see this (in theaters if possible), it's also important that you know your tastes. If you prefer dark comedy and a subtle, smart story, this is definitely for you. If you hate comedy mixed with serious subject matters and prefer faster-paced films, maybe seek out Dunkirk or Wonder Woman. I happen to be a part of the former and enjoyed this film's mix of dark comedy and somber atmosphere. I also feel that I must admit this: After the Golden Globe awards, I felt highly unsatisfied that Three Billboards won in many major categories and that likely led to me thinking this film is slightly worse than it actually is. While it deserves many of the awards that it has gotten (and is likely to receive), The Shape of Water will always be my favorite of the year, no matter how unpredictable, refreshing, and memorable Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is.4/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri ****","A desperate grieving Mother (Francis McDormond) takes a drastic step in order to put pressure on the local Police Department investigating her Daughter's murder by renting three billboards and erecting messages that taunt the Chief of Police (Woody Harrelson) lack of progress.
What unfolds is a gripping black comedy Drama that mixes moments of humour with instant moments of such humanity and sadness it becomes a impossible not to be absorbed undeniable into it's story.
 
This is a film that portrays itself as a ""who done it"" but makes that a brave choice to become a rich character study of people just trying to people in amongst the wake of tragedy and circumstance.Doesn't sound a laugh a minute but honestly most of the time it is, establishing dark laugh out statements of pure angry and grief.Whether McDormand is berating a Vicar, reporter of the chief of Police the foul mouthed rants are wonderfully written and delivered with fire.
That's another beautifully crafted aspect of the film are the tiny moments of the film's balance between rage and humanity. Whether amongst McDormond's hate filled mission she takes time out to put a upside down bug back on it's feet to screaming at the Chief Of Police than instantly finding common humanity amongst tradegy.
A story of good people all reacting to circumstances that life has handed them and acting accordingly the only way they know how from their grass roots.It's truly a stand out out performance by Francis McDormand that has to earn her a Oscar Nomination she's frankly that good. Her face never stops working, when ever she's spoken to her face is still processing, expressing and captivating a woman in constant torment from the first shot to the end she's working 100%.
Woody Harrelson is on top form delivering a performance which like the film is comedic and sad with also one of the best character arks of the narrative along side Sam Rockwell as the racist child like deputy who does some growing up on the way.
This is storytelling unlike anything were normally used to from Hollywood. It's Bold, Engaging, Risk Taking Power House Drama that will surprise and leave you pondering long after it ends.
It won't be everyone's cup of tea but that is defiantly the point.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An anger begetting about culprits and cops in much needed revolutionary act.,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) :
Brief Review -An anger begetting about culprits and cops in much needed revolutionary act. The film depicts about an anger that only begets, but what to do about it if the Cops are not even trying to catch the culprits. The final chance you have left was may be outrageous and unfair but had to be taken in terms of bringing some revolution. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is about a mother's anger whose daughter has been raped while dying and her fight against sophisticated but irresponsible cops. From the first scene itself, the film takes a charge without losing any time in character introduction and background story or such stuff. The pace remains intact throughout and the climax leaves you stunned with a question of How about killing this some other rapist? I loved this part. I wouldn't have loved it if it had gone in typical way when they find the rapist and punish him. Instead, here, they tried to raise a question on not finding him, isn't it something out of the box? That's why i love it. The overall narrative doesn't particularly justify it though, and that's something what disappointed me. Frances McDormand carries the entire film on her shoulder and deserved the Oscar Doll. 2nd deserving Oscar winner act comes from Sam Rockwell who was fantastic in his brilliantly written role. Even the supporting actors like Woody Herrelson, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Peter Dinkage and rest were very good. Cinematography is notable for some awesome shots of city side. Martin McDonagh's direction is praiseworthy, the way he handled this important issue using abusing language needs guts and he had it. Overall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an amazing and very important film socially even though It has some neglectable issues cinematically.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A realistic, intense film with distinct characters and strong performances","I had planned to watch the film in question months ago, but then I delved into longer series and so I found time yesterday only... And I am fully satisfied.Above all, due to characters and performances. They are peculiar, yet, realistic, there is some evolvement, but basics remain, and the events not expected make them disclose their ""hidden"" values. It is one of the few films where even actors with smaller roles are catchy, starting with Harrelson and Dinklage; McDormand and Rockwell could show their versality again in full and their Academy Awards are well to the point.The story is leading-edge as well. There is limited ""action"", but so must be life in a small place, and, as the events progressed, you expected generally a different solution as you saw on the screen later. Tragic and comic moments are in good symbiosis and the ending is nicely ""open"" - probably not their cup of tea who are fond of usual crime stories - but not creating wtf! or hollow feelings. Simple things have sometimes complicated solutions, yet their depiction is far from simplicity and moralisation.All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a real gem amidst over-sophisticated and over-flashed films often based on comics (that is why I have moved on from films to series).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Piece of crap,"Between the non-stop absurdities of the story, the constant tonal shifts, and the epileptic screenplay there's not much good to say about this movie. Oh and Francis McDormand won a legacy and nepotism Oscar, apparently for having won an Oscar before and being married to a Cohen. Her performance was carried out competently enough, but the character was a cardboard cut out of an archetype that was stale in 1940, so... yeah, not sure how it beat the brilliance of both Margot Robbie and Saoirse Ronan. Then I remember how incestuous and meaningless the Oscars have become.

I can't stop thinking about this film,"It's been four weeks since I watched three Billboards and it just keeps popping back into my head.The story follows a woman's search for justice when her daughter is brutally murdered in the small community of Ebbing.The pain of unresolved grief carried by Mildred, her anger and impotent rage touches everyone she comes into contact with. As the story develops, grief and rage spreads like a virus, ultimately nearly destroying the people it infects.This film is profoundly moving. We, the viewer, are drawn into the lives of these imperfect people in an imperfect community, we want to see justice served and it's not until the arrival of a drifter, boasting of a rape he's committed, that we realise we have also been infected. I wanted to see the man get what he deserves.The sub plots that weave their way in and out of the story are like short films within themselves. It's a multi layered and intricate mesh that will emotionally pull you along and ultimately leave you with the same sense of unresolved anger experienced by the characters in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Superb Acting,"Oscar Nominations:Three Billboards is chock-ful of surprises. About the time you think you know what's next, it turns out you were dead wrong and something entirely different happens. It just isn't possible to guess where this movie is going. And that's clearly the fun with this movie.Although it doesn't really deal with a 'fun' topic. It's mostly about anger. At the beginning of the movie, Mildred Hayes (McDormand's character) has lost her daughter to tragic and disturbing circumstances. Although the local police department has apparently made some effort at solving the case, the DNA evidence leads nowhere and the cops are stymied both by the lack of leads and personal reasons. Mildred, angered by the lack of justice, vents on them.But anger is a dangerous emotion that often gets channeled in unexpected directions. We never have all the facts and the conclusions we reach, especially in anger, can turn around and bite in the most unforeseen ways. Sometimes the fallout can be funny, as it often is in this movie. But it can also turn tragic, and it does here too.A huge part of the success of this movie ascribes to Frances McDormand. She won the Leading Actress Oscar for her performance here and, although I haven't seen any of the other nominated performances yet, I can imagine she deserves it. But then, when does she not return a terrific performance? She is best known for playing supporting character roles and was nominated for Supporting Actress Oscars for North Country, Almost Famous, and Mississippi Burning. But probably her most famous role was as Marge Gunderson in Fargo where her understated performance constantly moved back and forth between comedy and drama. She won the Oscar for that performance and brings many of the same characterizations to this role, twenty-two years later.She does not operate in a vacuum. She has two wonderful supporting actors to play off in this film. Woody Harrelson plays, in his typically droll way, Willoughby, the small town sheriff. Willoughby is really trying hard to make a life for himself, his family, and his town, but is unable to make it due to problems entirely beyond his control. Harrelson has been remarkably active in the last few years, appearing in five other movies released this year, including an 'apocalyptic' role in War for the Planet of the Apes. He has received Oscar nominations for his performance in this movie, as well as in The Messenger, and The People vs. Larry Flynt. His career dates back to his role in 1985 in the TV series Cheers, and has starred in dozens of movies since then. His anger in Three Billboards is perhaps the most inconsolable and is resolved unexpectedly.Sam Rockwell plays the most troubled character, James Dixon, and the one with the most uncontrolled anger. His arises from deep psychological problems generated by a severely dysfunctional family. Dixon's role is pivotal and seems to provide the emotional energy that drives everyone else. Rockwell won the Oscar this year for Supporting Actor and this was his first nomination. Although he has appeared in dozens of movies, almost entirely in supporting roles, I can't say that I recognized him. After his performance here, and his Oscar win, I suspect we will be seeing more of him.To have three actors in one movie all receiving Oscar nominations (and two of them winning), is not very common. Last movie with ensemble recognition that I can remember would be American Hustle. But what that should tell you is that the acting is tremendous. And when you get three superior actors interacting in the same movie, the effects are enhanced and reinforced. They play off each other to best advantage, and result in a more powerful film. (Shape of Water, the Best Picture winner, also had three actors nominated.)But, importantly, this isn't just an acting vehicle. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the film, and received a writing nomination. He also received a Screenplay nomination for In Bruges which shares similar qualities with this movie in tone and story-line. Both films oscillate between comedy and drama, both films have an undercurrent of violence (maybe a tad stronger in the former movie), and both films leave you a little shocked at your own reaction. McDonaghs credits, as both writer and director, are a short list at this point, but he is still young enough that we will likely hear more from him. Although Three Billboards is a good movie, I don't think McDonagh has yet earned an Oscar.Finally, the movie received two more, below-the-line, nominations, although it did not win either. The Film Editing, by Jon Gregory (who also did In Bruges) was indeed tight, but I think Baby Driver was more successful. And Carter Burwell was nominated for his Original Score. He did the music for Fargo and appears to have some insight into McDormand's characters. He was also nominated for the music for Carol from two years ago. His music is quirky enough to fit the twists and turns of this film.This movie is far from perfect, as many critic and audience reviews point out. There are so many points in the movie that one could identify as unrealistic and improbable. If you require complete fidelity to the real world, then you are likely to be disappointed in Three Billboards. But if you want to experience a look into how people in today's world handle anger in all its manifestations, then the movie provides both funny and serious food for thought.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Awards candy,"Three billboards has already won a bunch of awards and seems certain to do well on Oscar night. I've been a big fan of Frances McDormand since the release of Fargo over 20 years ago. This film really gives her room to show off her talent and it is a spellbinding performance from start to end. She's very likely to bag the best actress award and it will be well deserved.The film tells the story of Mildrid (McDormand) who wants justice for the murder of her daughter several months ago. Frustrated at the lack of progress in the case she rents three billboards in an attempt to focus the mind of officer Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) back to the case. The film examines the tensions this causes within the family, the police department and the local community.This film is certainly not for the film goers who crave continuous action or a feelgood factor.

Martin Mcdonogh pulls a hat trick,"Irish writing/directing guru Martin McDonough has pulled a miraculous hat-trick with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, a pitch perfect follow up to his other two black dramedies, In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. He's an unbelievable talent who specializes in caustic, vigorously sharp dialogue and comic moments organically drawn from real life situations, not to mention a heap of earned emotional moments and narratives that, try as the viewer might, are impossible to predict. This is a near perfect bookend to the trilogy, with a late career encore turn from Frances Mcdormand, who cements an oddly Coen-esque vibe that's welcome. She plays Mildred Hays here, a fiery single mother whose frustration and rage at the rape and murder of her teen daughter is fuelled into the purchase of three advertising billboards on the outskirts of town, calling out the Sheriff (Woody Harrelson) and his department for their lack of arrests or convictions. Needless to say, this brazen act causes a hailstorm Of events both funny and sad, strange and mundane, but never boring. Harrelson is a blast of potent poignancy as Chief Willoughby, a stern family man who laconically protests the Billboards, but understands the poor woman's intentions. His arc is one that leaves you puzzled and tugs at the heartstrings unexpectedly, especially when it comes to his relationship with his beautiful wife (Abbie Cornish, most excellent). Sam Rockwell is the height of hilarity as Dixon, a certifiably nuts, volatile man-child of a deputy who violently takes matters into his own hands and exacerbates the whole deal wonderfully with his antics. Rockwell was a dynamo enough in Seven Psychos, and here he takes that loony persona into the stratosphere, a whirling dervish of bizarre, idiosyncratic wonderment. Other standouts include Peter Dinklage as a love-struck dwarf that everyone refers to as a midget, John Hawkes as Mildred's troubled ex husband, Lucas Hedges as her traumatized son and Caleb Landry Jones as an oddball local advertising mogul. McDonough's calling card is his defiant refusal to tell a story in Hollywood's glossy, surface level terms, deliberately punctuating his tales with vagueness, eccentricity and constant reminders that people, emotions, characters and narratives are complex, weird concepts which are seldom black and white or clear cut in any direction. The arcs here are broad, surprising and beautifully drawn, with the same deep set sadness he brought us In Bruges, accented by the acidic, dysfunctional and cheerfully profane writing that showed up in Seven Psychos. This is a film that ducks the pesky limbo bar of standards set by the Hollywood machine in favour of something more unique, a road less travelled when it comes to comedy dramas, but one that anyone seeking fresh, alive and different material would be much rewarded trekking down.

"Powerhouse film, serious themes, not for all","Mildred (Frances McDormand) has had a rough life. Her ex-husband was abusive but after the divorce, he still lives in the same town. More importantly, her beloved daughter was raped, burned, and murdered in cruel fashion. This was six months ago and there have been no arrests. The sheriff, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his erratic deputy, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) have done their investigations and there are few new options. Nevertheless, Mildred believes her daughter's case is being filed and forgotten. Therefore, when she drives down a little-traveled road near her town of Ebbing, Missouri, she spies three billboards ready for new ads. Plunking down a cool $5000 of her own money, she asks the advertising company to put up questions relating to her child's murder, goading the sheriff's office. No, Willoughby is not happy. For a spell, television crews come and focus on Mildred's cause. But, no leads emerge. Meanwhile, Willoughby is seriously ill with cancer , making some of the townfolk turn against Mildred. All this while Milllie's ex-husband is parading around with a 19 year old girlfriend, her son has difficulty at high school, the town's dwarf (Peter Dinklage) wants to date Millie, and Deputy Dixon has a love-hate relationship with his mother. Will a killer be brought to justice? This powerhouse film is strong and serious but is not for all. For one, the language is profane quite often and there is violence, too. Some viewers will not be comfortable with these two matters. On the other hand, the cast is superb, with McDormand and Rockwell leading the way but with all cast members contributing mightily.

I cried when Chief Willoughby killed himself, when I laughed that he sponsored for the second month of the three billboards. I cried when Mildred sadly talked with the deer, when I laughed that the midget hold the ladder. This happens throughout the movie and I really enjoyed how the director control the flow of the story and that sadness will always be mixed up with the joy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Probably the best movie of 2017,"This movie was really intense. I loved it. Granted, it goes to some dark places but it has an interesting story to tell. The only reason why I've initially put off watching the movie was the title; it sounded kind of boring (but wasn't). Yes, the billboards are an integral part of the story but later the movie evolves past them. So just keep that in mind if you're thinking about giving the movie a watch.Storytelling-wise the mysterious billboards were introduced in an interesting way. Instead of revealing them right away the billboards were initially obscured from the viewer. This leaves viewers with some time to speculate as to what it might have displayed to get the police officer so riled up. Really well done.The mother (Mildred) seems to be known by locals which makes sense; I myself grew up in a small town where word traveled fast. An ""everybody knows everybody"" type of affair. So it is authentic in its execution.The police officers in the movie are clearly corrupted (at least the majority of them). And when the billboards garner the attention of the media things get heated. It's a proverbial declaration of ""war"" so to speak. One dedicated mother against the local police department.At first Mildred seems irrational and unreasonable towards Willoughby. After all he seems like an OK guy. But as we later find out both are flawed characters with demons to slay. They just deal with their individual situations differently. The loss of Mildred's daughter has made her bitter. And I do get it somehow. She seems very confrontational even with the very people who try to support her in her quest. Willoughby on the other hand is faced with a hard decision because he kept a secret. A secret that literally changes everything.Dixon, the second protagonist, seems a little ""slow"" but that doesn't absolve him of his ""controversial"" past. He has a track record of ""racial discrimination"" and the locals are well aware of his racist past.On a side note:
The scene with the dentist was pretty hilarious. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. I don't want to spoil it for you. It was quite unexpected.There are some pretty interesting themes that are being explored during the movie. And storytelling-wise I liked that the characters were all multi-faceted.
There is a lot of peripety in the movie. Especially with the whole Willoughby situation. And then there's of course the whole thing with Dixon's redemption.
At heart it's a bittersweet story. It starts out rough around the edges but as the story progresses things become clearer and more refined.To conclude: It's ultimately a story about forgiveness.
Humbling experiences are the biggest catalyst for change; positive change that is. This in essence is the most prevalent theme of the movie and that's what I like about it. Too many contemporary movies go the traditional ""revenge"" route. And it is getting quite boring after a while. This movie is more profound. Yes, it is a story about revenge, initially, but then seamlessly morphs into something much bigger; a compelling story with strong characters. Even the characters with minor roles felt grand because they were authentic. No role was ""superfluous"". It was a perfect amalgam.I don't think the movie is for everybody. It does go to some dark places so I'd say that it's probably for people who have a certain level of ""emotional"" maturity. But overall it's a fantastic movie.Final verdict: highly recommended (don't let the lame title fool you)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It represent the reality,"I will not say that this movie is the best I've seen but I want to point out one particular aspect, this movie is realistic at 100%.Unlike most comedy or drama here is very difficult to understand where the film is going but it does so in a good way.Each character evolves during the movie and they are all actual people who have their good aspect and bad ones, no-one is perfect, as in reality.The finale is the cherry on the cake and it highlight agin the reality of this film.ATTENTION (little spoiler to make my point) because the in the finale as in life sometimes you don't know how things end and some cases will never be solved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
