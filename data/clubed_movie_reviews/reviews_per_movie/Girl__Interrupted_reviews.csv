Outstanding performances,"The absolute best thing about this film are the knockout performances by it's 2 main stars Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie though both characters (hence performances) are very different they stand out nonetheless.  It seems to me to be somewhat easier to play a psychotic than to play a regular neurotic, so who really has the better portrayal of the two?Brittany Murphy as ""Daisy"" shines in her scenes.  She is a force to reckon with in her future film career.James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil.  No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives.It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned!  And a very moving drama at that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Forgot how good this was.,"I found this film browsing through Netflix's deplorable movie catalogue, and couldn't figure out when did I watched it some time ago. Utterly enjoyable all the way through, I was delighted by Angelina Jolie's performance, I hadn't even remembered she won an Oscar for it, it wasn't until near the end that it hit me. Her performance is truly astounding, she composes her character with traits that perfectly define a person with her mental state. Her mannerisms, her volatile and somewhat unpredictable self makes her a bit frightening, which makes the viewer watch her performance uncomfortable and in awe at the same time.Winona Ryder is great as well, she portrays her different condition in a different manner as expected, perhaps more discreetly, but still effective nonetheless. Overall, most acting performances are on point, such as Clea DuVall, the late Brittany Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and Elisabeth Moss, they all deserved to be credited.If you want well-done drama with splendid performances, look no further, and enjoy yourself. Especially Angelina Jolie's phenomenal Oscar-winning performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie!,"The most striking and yet most frustrating part of `Girl, Interrupted' is that everybody that's been 19 years old can relate to Susanna, the main character.  Based on her memoir, the film portrays Susanna Kaysen's short stay in a famous mental hospital, supposedly to cure her `borderline personality disorder.'  Set in the late 1960's, Winona Ryder effectively portrays Kaysen.In a tradition reminiscent of Holden Caulfield, the audience knows there is nothing actually wrong with Kaysen, except that she is a typical teenager, and refuses to conform to the life her parents want for her.  However, after spending some time with her ward mates and numerous doctors, she starts to believe that she is insane, but can't understand why or what exactly is wrong with her.  At one point, she asks a sympathetic nurse (played by Whoopi Goldberg) how she is expected to be cured if she doesn't even understand her illness.  Throughout the film, writer James Mangold's exploration of Kaysen's changing emotions and attempts to understand her `illness' is captivating.However, even more fascinating than Kaysen herself were the supporting characters.   Perhaps the most striking of these characters though, is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie.  Jolie completely immerses herself in the role, and gives a moving, intriguing  and haunting performance as Susanna's best friend at the hospital.  Although Ryder does an excellent job portraying the earnestness and confusion of her character, Jolie is the true star of this movie.Adapted from  Kaysen's memoir, the film works well to bring Kaysen's' words to life.  The parts that were altered for the screenplay made sense, allowing the story to translate well to the screen.  Additionally, the length of the film allowed for more depth and details to be explored, which sometimes left out of Kaysen's short novel.  Thus, the film helped add onto and bring more understanding to characters which were introduced in the novel.",,Anonymous,Biography
Quite Likeable!,"In more ways than one, 'Girl Interrupted' is very similar to 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. To begin with both the films are set in mental institutions and chronicle life as it unfolds amidst those bland, white walls. Characters in both the film are acutely lifelike. But owing perhaps to it being a true story, 'Girl Interrupted' has characters that are much easier to identify with than McMurphy's brigade. Set in the 60's, the film is an account of the times spent in the Mental Institution by an eighteen year girl, Susanna Kaysen, a character portrayed with astonishing brilliance by the versatile Winona Ryder.Susanna is a victim of neurosis, great expectations, confusion, an uncertain future and the sundry other problems an average teenager's life are pounded with. For all her brilliance, Susanna has the undeniable gift of the cynic and the pessimist, who still hasn't made up her mind about life's meaning and is upset about it. She has the nagging feeling that her character is incomplete and gets caught in the depressing vortex of tendencies that earn her the title of, what we're later told, a border line personality. An almost successful but unintentional suicide attempt lands her in the footsteps of Claymoore, a mental instituition. In the confined borders of the instituition, Susanna is surprised to discover how well she identifies with the pain and flaws of fellow inmates. Here, the atmosphere is sans any prejudice or cliches. Here, everyone is a victim one way or the other. Far from the deplorable world outside the instituition, susanna feels that she's finally home. And it is this atmosphere that slowly gives way to the realisation of her actual needs, her character and her purpose.In the first half of the film, the director employs an interesting technique of fusing two different scenes and establishing a coherence that not only takes the story forward but at the same time tells us what is already past. Apart from Susanna and maybe Lisa, few characters are generously sketched. This, although, doesn't allow the loosening of the plot's grip on you. Furthermore, the institution is projected in a more agreeable light and the resultant sympathy for the characters ( unlike 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest') does not coincide with an abhorrence towards the angle of treatment. The movie does lead the viewer to understand the plight of the inmates, but not with the object of establishing the reasons that led to their condition. Rather it concentrates on the way these girls face their fate, day in and day out. It also highlights the way the girls identify with each others problems, hopes and desires in a fashion that alternates between being poignant and amusing.Perhaps the most distinct factor about the movie is the exemplary performances put up by a cast that mostly comprises of females. I haven't seen a film that could hold its own without a single male lead, as good as this movie does. Winona Ryder is very convincing as Susanna. Angelina Jolie delivers so well that I am having a hard time getting over the fact that she agreed to Lara Croft. Whoopi Goldberg is good but her role is regrettably restricted. Constrained performances by all the actresses make this film worthy of being watched. It is funny, sad, mischievous and optimistic all at the same time.Watch it if you can for it is very unlikely that you would get disappointed. Like I said it is quite likeable!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brief critique-- 9/10 Excellent drama and lyric insight,"I came to the film with low expectations.  I was simply stunned by how good it was.Angelina Jolie is an absolutely PHENOMENAL actress. Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike show-stoppers like Marissa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinnie,"" merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.The cinematography was innovative, but not distractingly so-- ""Girl Interupted"" shines primarily for its dramatic power, not as a mind-blowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that ""American Beauty"" might, but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world-- at least psychologically.Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her, and proved herself as more than a pretty-girl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna, a confused high-school graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.The movie takes place primarily in the women's ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa (Jolie's character) and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic, dynamic personality who cuts right to the ""truth"" of things. Her ""truth"" knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.This is not a depressing film. Rather, it is suprisingly life-affirming. Not cloying, not sacherine, but not inpenetrably dark, either.  Anyone seeking an angst-ridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.""This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience, the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.Performances by Whoppie Goldberg (in a serious and nuanced role) and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent, as expected.With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks, predictable cuts and music, this is a nearly flawless film. Dead-on dramatically, and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent true-story by Suzana Keisen, this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks, dark cynicism, or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Girl Interrupted is a delicious exercise in self-indulgence,"Anyone who has ever had an obsession, felt impulses to be drastic over something inconsequential, felt a bit out of place, or ever had in the back of their mind the sinking suspicion that they might be just a little bit crazy should see this film. Girl, Interrupted is rather self-indulgent, like watching children attack a bowl of Halloween candy, or witnessing family members playfully fighting over the last piece of pumpkin pie.Is Girl Interrupted really saying crazy people are different from normal people? I don't think so. Alleged crazy people are normal people. They're the ones who say yes to thoughts that other people say no to. Borderlines are people thinking maybe.Winona Ryder's character Susanna Kaysen (based on the author of the book) is the narrator of this story. It is her 'borderline' eyes that we are peering through. We learn that Susanna flushed a bottle of aspirin down with a bottle of vodka. This leads her parents into carefully goading her into locking herself up inside Claymoore: a mental hospital. She goes willingly but reluctantly, not really paying attention to anything because her mind is filled with echoes of the past, and she deludes herself into becoming delusional. Eventually she is diagnosed as a ""borderline personality disorder."" When compared to the other tenants on her ward in Claymoore however, the more appropriate phrase would be ""psycho wanna-be.""Susanna's roommate is a pathological liar who is obsessed with the Oz series of books. Across the hallway is a girl who set herself on fire because she loved her cat. Another refuses to eat because 75 pounds is her ideal weight. So what we witness is a scared teenage girl in the late sixties surrounded by scared girls all rapidly turning into confused young women. We witness Susanna interrupting her own life for a year and a half in order to see in them what she has been, what she is, and what she might become if she crosses the borderline.Then comes Lisa.While Winona Ryder plays the tossed raft of this story upon which we skittishly cling, Angelina Jolie appears on the scene like a powerful stormy sea ready to capsize us, blow us off course, or merely keep us company while we navigate the rough waters. Jolie steals the limelight from Ryder while simultaneously making her look good. Ryder holds the show well enough in the start (much like Henry Winkler in the 1982 movie Night Shift before Michael Keaton's entrance), but Jolie's performance of the sociopathic and charismatic Lisa gives this production a needed jumpstart. It also gives us a chance to examine the proceedings from another perspective: Susanna's only just arrived, but Lisa Rowe's been there half her life. While Susanna's borderline, Lisa's already rocked her own boat so far she's drowning, and builds temporary flotation devices by demeaning those around her, but it leaves her dead inside. Somehow Jolie is able to present this hateful person in such a way as to make you want to punch her and hug the stuffing out of her at the same time.Whoopi Goldberg is a steady rock. While the madness and childishness spreads and recedes like beached waves on an ebbing tide, Whoopi's performance of nurse Valerie lends us a consistent perspective of reason and duty. In one of the more powerful moments of the film, Valerie picks the drugged and lazy Susanna up out of bed and plops her down into a tub filled with cold water. Valerie then tells Susanna in no uncertain terms what we have already surmized by this point: Susanna doesn't belong here. She's not crazy now, but if she drops anchor in Claymoore, she eventually will be.Girl, Interrupted is a powerful and moving film about what it means to be sane, what it means to be a social animal, and inevitably what it means to be human. It does get bogged down at times in the messages it tries to convey. Still, the performances of the talent supercede the sometimes preachy dialogue, and move the action along even those times when it appears the story's just running in circles.The plot is not so much invented in a classic way. After all, this is based on real life, and Kaysen's book is a memoir - a diary. It's real. So there is no real beginning, middle and end. We're told basically why Susanna went in there, we experience some of the highs and lows of her stay, and she tries to show us why she got out. The first time I viewed the film, I found myself wondering towards the end when exactly was it going to end, and how. I was not personally satisfied with the rather ambiguous ending that was finally presented to me, but the slice of life presented to us is an ambiguous one, so ironically it seems fitting, if not satisfying by design. It's not some golden destination of sanity that this film focuses on, but the realization that being socially fit to function in society means to be a part of it, and so it is the journey that keeps us sane.The rare references to The Wizard of Oz are just enough to bring light to the metaphor: Susanna is like Dorothy. The people she meets along the way are like the scarecrow, lion and tinman; friends on the journey to getting back out. Claymoore hospital is in a way a land of Oz, either a daydream or a nightmare, depending on how you look at it. And perspective, for someone who believes themselves insane, is everything.Sanity is not a place, but a state of mind. And after seeing this movie, I was amused at myself: as if I need a film to tell me something that should be so incredibly obvious.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fine showcase for Ryder,"It's always tough in today's goal-obsessed society to be someone who isn't quite sure what they want, but woman and minorities especially have it tough, because they seem to be automatically assigned ""roles"" for them(if you're a woman, even today, people still ask you when you're going to get married; if you're black and look big, people ask if you're an athlete).  In the 60's, author Susanna Kaysen was in a similar position; she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life, but knew she didn't quite fit into the norm.  Because of that, and because of some legitimate problems(she tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin), she went into a mental hospital and was tagged with having ""borderline personality disorder,"" a catch-all phrase which meant whatever the doctors wanted it to mean.  From her experiences in the hospital, Kaysen wrote the book GIRL, INTERRUPTED(the title comes from a Vermeer painting), and now comes the movie version from James Mangold and Winona Ryder.Mangold's first two films, HEAVY and COPLAND, were both about main characters leading lives of quiet desperation; the pizza chef in HEAVY unable to express himself, and the partly sheriff in COPLAND who must learn to assume his responsibility with that position.  Susanna fits in with those two characters, and Mangold does just as good a job with her, except for some melodramatic scenes near the end.  There are some major themes going on here, like whether Susanna is really crazy, just spoiled, or conditioned to think something is wrong with her, the nature of what ""crazy"" is in the 60's, and of course being a woman at the time, but Mangold avoids making big statements for the most part, instead concentrating on Susanna's growth into being a little more sure of herself.As has been said before, Ryder brings a lot to the table, not just being a talented actress, but life research, having spent time in a hospital due to exhaustion(this is why she pulled out of GODFATHER PART III as well).  And instead of going for obvious drama, she too just makes Susanna's recovery a gradual and detailed journey, except for those melodramatic scenes.  The first third, which seems to be influence by SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, flashes back and forth through time, as if showing Susanna feeling lost and fragmented.  The rest of the movie is more linear, but Ryder doesn't make it boring.Some people have dismissed this as a chick ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, which is the usual knee-jerk response whenever a mostly female cast tackles what is normally done with a mostly male cast.  In truth, they're very different movies, primarily because in CUCKOO, we're meant to see the hospital staff, represented by Nurse Ratched, as evil, trying to break down the patients rather than build them up.  Here, on the other hand, while we're meant to see the system's shortcomings(in addition to what I said before, the different meanings of ""promiscuous"" when applied to men and women), the hospital staff is generally seen as trying to do the best they can.  The patients may make fun of the doctors(well-played by Jeffrey Tambor and Vanessa Redgrave) and occasionally challenge the nurses(head nurse Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance in a long time), but there's no real hatred here, except maybe from Lisa.Angelina Jolie certainly has a flashy role with Lisa, the resident sociopath, but makes her seem real, until the movie betrays her at the end. When she's pushing people's buttons, she's actually quite sly about it, which is a lot more multi-dimensional than some have made it out to be.  The rest of the cast playing patients is also good(it was a little heartbreaking seeing Elisabeth Moss playing a burn victim, especially when they show a picture of her as a young girl, where she looks like she did in IMAGINARY CRIMES).  But it's Ryder who is the main reason for seeing this fine movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Why, oh, why did they deviate so much from the book?!","Okay, okay...  so the movie is decent.  The actresses were fabulous.The screenplay...  well, it certainly left a lot to be desired.  Granted, anyone who has read Kaysen's autobiography would understand how it would be difficult--even impossible--to follow the book to the letter.  Only an art house film would have a chance, and a mainstream movie company would never even attempt it.Nonetheless, the movie lost a lot of the book's craziness and dark humor, and somehow led the audience off to NeverNeverLand in the end.I actually read Kaysen's book for the first time *after* watching the movie because, quite honestly, I thought they left something out or I missed something somewhere.  Surprise, surprise.  The book has the same premise, even the same character names, but precious little similarities.In short...  watch this movie for the acting.

Incredible performances and an enormously involving narrative. ***1/2 (out of four),"GIRL, INTERRUPTED / (1999) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:""Have you ever confused a dream with life? Or stolen something when you have the cash? Have you ever been blue? Or thought your train moving while sitting still? Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted.""Those are some of the most memorable lines from James Mangold's honest, heartfelt drama ""Girl Interrupted."" The speaker is Susanna Kaysen, played by Winona Ryder. The film is based on the memoir of Kaysen herself, re-encountering the experiences she actually spent in a mental institution after an attempted suicide. The book of the same name was published in 1993; it spent time on almost every best-seller list, including 11 weeks on the New York Times.It was in the 1980's when Kaysen began to revisit the most formative time in her life-20 years after the actual hospitalization. Memories of a nearly two-year stay at McLean Psychiatric Hospital, a private and exclusive institution near Cambridge, resurfaced while constructing her second book. She began writing vignettes of her experiences in the hospital, writing short stories about a time in her life she had not discussed for two decades.""The only thing that ever made me less loony was writing,"" remembers Cambridge, Massachusetts-based writer Susanna Kaysen, author of her memoir, ""Girl, Interrupted."" Set in the turbulent 60's, the film details the young Kaysen, who finds herself at a mental institution for disturbed young women. Susanna makes friends, including a seductive and dangerous regular named Lisa (Angelina Jolie).I have never read this book, but after watching ""Girl, Interrupted"" I am seriously considering it. The film is a powerful exploration into a depressing, bleak situation. When this movie was released theatrically in late 1999, I wondered how many people would want to see something about a young writer who tries to kill herself and then spends time in a nut-house. However, I was wrong to presume anything. ""Girl, Interrupted"" contains a vivid, convincing world for its characters, but never do we feel awkward while watching this film, but involved and concerned.Screen-adapters James Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anna Hamilton Phelan construct a central character that is both consistent and empathetic. As the movie opens, we never see Kaysen's suicide attempt-there is no need to show it. This is a film about the results, not the action. We gradually learn about Kaysen as the movie progresses, thus the lack of initial character development. Even with little introductory material to establish her character, Winona Ryder creates a soothing, intriguing sole for Kaysen. The audience cares about Susanna before we even understand why she was sent to the mental institution.The film's supporting cast, including Jared Leto, Clea Duvall, Elizabeth Moss, Jeffrey Tambor, Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave, and Angelina Jolie, who won an Academy Award for her performance, actually develops the mood of the film-an essential aspect of its overall impact. James Mangold (""Copland"") has a ambiguous style here, but it works extraordinarily well in this film. ""Girl, Interrupted"" should do wonders for Susanna Kaysen's book; after watching the film, it is hard not to want to read the memoir.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Director James Mangold hits a slight interruption of his own...,"After being touched by the sensitive film ""Heavy"", I couldn't wait to see what would happen with director James Mangold. This brash, barbed, insightful and touching drama is the result, and although it has problems, you end up caring about a lot of people you might otherwise try to avoid. Winona Ryder's performance as a young woman being treated for psychological problems in the all-girl wing of an institution in the late 1960s is very fine; she's mannered at times and a little coy, but she seems a sweet puppet with her wires cut, a bobbing head doll, and one never grows tired of her. Angelina Jolie won a Supporting Oscar as the lead troublemaker, and it is a ferocious bit of acting, but her character is an enigma--playful at times, then cruelly straightforward--and Jolie has to work extra hard to give her depth. I was perplexed by some of Mangold's touches (like having one character commit suicide while listening to the Skeeter Davis record ""The End of the World"", ha ha); but the sneaky trip away from the hospital that Ryder and Jolie take is an amazing section that works rough magic all on its own. Whoopi Goldberg isn't bad as the main nurse on the floor, but a complacent Goldberg is an automatic anticlimax and I don't understand Mangold's casting here. However, the film displays on occasion the work of someone wonderful breaking through, and there are many heartfelt sequences, quick and quirky editing techniques. For anyone bemoaning the obvious (""Not another institution movie!""), this should be a pleasant surprise. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"jaundiced beauty, and vaccine of the soul","How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless.Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be.Refreshingly unlike any of the myriad of fine 'expose' films detailing the darker side of madness (see Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion') or even those with a more poli-social agenda (see Milos Foreman's 'One Flew Over the Cookoo's nest'); 'Girl, Interrupted' achieves a very rare victory in modern film. It conjures enough unnerving insight to bring us scintilatingly close to its most macabre moments; while sewing atop this a spiritual safety net. One capable of the mental restoration that must bring us back to the security of our well cushioned theatre seat. All movement in between remains internal; a lingering memory of personal identification and cathartic resolution.One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Bad. Not Great.,"Angelina Jolie won a rightfully deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance alongside Winona Ryder in this drama which documents a period of time in which a young woman experiences life in an insane asylum.Winona is Sussana Kasan, based on the real life author who wrote her autobiography about her experiences at the institution. Winona is particularly good in her role and she showcases some of her better talents here than her showy performance in ""The Crucible"", another film she's mostly remembered for. When Sussana is locked away after an attempted suicide, she befriends the other girls, including sociopath Lisa (Jolie) and digs deep inside herself for answers.It's just a tad bit clichéd and the movie runs painfully long. Sussana's resolution is clear: she's not crazy, she just has to find her inner self. Ho hum.Angelina Jolie is really excellent as Lisa and she makes the movie, plus Whoopi Goldberg is entertaining in her side role as a warden with attitude. All of the performances and a deep, above average script make this film depressing and uplifting, and it truly does have some meaning, but overall it takes too long to get to the point.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing groundbreaking,"An alright movie to say the least, but a bit too drawn out. The pacing was lacking and the plot struggles to delve into why Susanna (Winona Ryder) is in the mental institution in the first place. Yes, she tried to commit suicide but all in all she's just a lazy teenager who needs a little guidance. Not trying to sound harsh, but Susanna came off as boring at certain times. The dynamic between her and Lisa (Angelina Jolie) is explored well with the strongest correlations, in my opinion, being showed at the house of Daisy (Brittany Murphy) where their reactions in the morning displayed their psyches and how the viewed people and the world. Susanna was normal while Lisa wasn't. This further developed the distance being created between the two characters as the movie went on, a great positive. Unique cuts and camera work along with a convincing resolution that left me satisfied for the most part, but the movie didn't know what it wanted to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
That Girl,"""Borderline personality disorder"" is one of those phrases that says more about the people who invented it than it does about the patient it's supposed to describe. When Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) the 18-year old heroine of ""Girl Interrupted"" enters Claymoore hospital, a psychiatric facility outside Boston, she is diagnosed with the syndrome - but in fact, all she's done is made a hapless suicide attempt and acted slack and mopey and lost in her sober daydreams. Her personality isn't borderline -- it's self-pitying and indulgent. Fortunately, the film understands this. Set in 1967, and adapted from Kaysen's memoir of her two-year experience as an adolescent in the throes of a middle-class crack up, ""Girl Interrupted"" is shrewd, tough and lively - a junior-league ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" that never makes the mistake of portraying its protagonist as a victim-naif. She's more like the original poster child for Prozac Nation: a girl who'd rather interrupt her own life, even if it means going a little crazy, than grow up.Susanna is thrown in with a turbulent gallery of disturbed young women. They range from a girl who tried to burn her own face off to one who won't eat anything but chicken from her father's deli (she stores the carcasses under the bed). Most of the patients are harmless, but Lisa (Angelina Jolie) a heartless, charismatic sociopath, delights in her destructive power. Jolie brings the kind of combustible sexuality to the screen that our movies, in the age of Meg Ryan have been missing for too long. As Susanna and Lisa become comrades, then enemies, Susanna becomes like a space cadet fighting a secret war with herself, and through Lisa she plays out that war. The film allows Ryder to trace Susanna's gradual emergence from her ""borderline"" state as she confronts the cruel truth of mental illness.Directed with satisfying authority by James Mangold, ""Girl Interrupted"" is really about the thorny neurotic underside of a contemporary young woman's struggle to leave childhood behind. By the end, you feel that Ryder, at long last, has done that as an actress.",,Anonymous,Biography
Serious cinema lovers: do not let the famous names put you off,"Having seen  or partially seen  a few of Whoopie Goldberg's attempts at light-hearted Saturday mid-day fare, I almost did not get settled down for this one. I might well have passed it over as another one of those films which are vulgarly called `chic-flics', seeing such illustrious names as Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie also in the cast. Maybe it was seeing Vanessa Redgrave's name that persuaded me into watching it; I do not know. But whatever I might have been presupposing, I was definitely rather mistaken.This is a pretty serious film: All the main actresses already named above, as well as Clea Duvall, Brittany Murphy and so on all down the list, turned in excellent performances, with both Ms. Ryder and Ms. Jolie standing out in the main roles.Based on Susanna Kaysen's book of true experiences in the sixties, James Mangold directed and adapted for screenplay this film, which, almost inevitably, makes us remember and almost obliges us into comparing it with `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', if only because this film is also focussed on life in a mental institution. However, the two films are considerably different. Mangold has worked well on this one, giving just the right angle on the subject matter, and focussing intelligently on characterisation, such that the resulting drama is greatly satisfying. The clashing and fusing of personalities on screen is highly aware and sensitive, which somewhat excludes any ideas of going over the top, though younger viewers  I say under about 30-35  might not agree. Careful analysis of personalities evidently went into the making up of the story-line, and in this respect, Mangold has done a really good job.I would definitely see this film again; as I have already said elsewhere, I like films which seem to have been adapted from a stage-play, with emphasis on characteriology and useful dialogues. In this, `Girl, Interrupted' scores well for me.                 A good drama to get your teeth into.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Watered Down Account of Kaysen,"The angsty memoir by Susanna Kaysen that poses the argument of whether or not radicalisation of a youngster's psyche could be symptoms of mental illness and the battle between illness and indifference. The memoir reads of the stay a young woman had at the same mental hospital that cared for Sylvia Plath and how she questions everything about herself, her life and her planet. Girl, Interrupted (the motion-picture) waters down a heck of a lot of the plot and replaces it with fictionalised and heavily dramatised events completely absent from the real story, however it benefits from an all-star cast and impressive performances from Angelina Jolie and the late Brittany Murphy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Act out at home, and it's bring on the Prozac.Winona Ryder was incredible as the teen who was really just being a rebellious teen, and got caught up in a system that won't let loose until you admit you are crazy, even if you aren't. She is joined by the best performance I have ever seen by Whoopi Goldberg.As good as these two were, it was Angelina that shined in this film. Jolie was absolutely incredible as the one who was really off the deep end. She was in so much pain, that she loved causing it to others. A super performance by a super actress.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brittany Murphy was better than the movie,"This movie had too many cliches in it - the characters, especially the scenery-chewing by Jolie, did not evoke any sympathy at all.  The best performance was by Brittany Murphy as Daisy - she got into my head and she was mesmerzing and I have not forgotten her since seeing this movie a month ago. It seems a shame that all this attention is being heaped on the wrong performance in this movie. Winona was okay, and I enjoyed Clea DuVall very much too. The movie itself was not that great, but I never tire of hearing Petula Clark sing ""Downtown"", so I will give it some credit for that.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"That was good, not great.","Girl, Interrupted (1999) was another first time watch for me and I liked it.Positives for Girl, Interrupted (1999):
Just based off the movie's premise, this was clearly going to be one of those Oscar type movies and it works for the most part. Winona Ryder does a fantastic job as Susanna Kaysen and she has a lot of weight carry in the movie as the main protagonist and she succeeded I that department. This was during that time when Winona Ryder was starting to gain a lot more recognition in her career before things in her personal life got in the way, but now she's back to begin a big star in the industry. Then, you have Angelina Jolie as Lisa Rowe who is also fantastic in the movie and actually won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. This was during that time when Jolie was still very young and a bit more wild before she toned it down and started being more serious in her career. Regardless of that, it was nice to see certain actors during the early stages of their careers. I also enjoyed the movie's supporting cast with Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy, Elisabeth Moss, Jared Leto, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa Redgrave and Whoopi Goldberg. There are moments in the movie that were very emotional and hard to watch and I mean that as a compliment. And finally, I loved the closing monologue from Winona Ryder as she leaving the psychiatric hospital where she apologized to certain people there and it pains me that she didn't even get nominated for an Oscar.Negatives for Girl, Interrupted (1999):
The movie is very slow with its pacing and I understand that was intentional, but it felt like the movie was dragging at certain points during the runtime. Also, the movie doesn't really lived up to the Oscar potential that it could've had, but something was missing in the movie. And finally, this is one of those movies that I don't see myself rewatching that often in the future.Overall, I did like Girl Interrupted (1999), I just wish I loved it. It had all the things that could've gotten me to love it, but it sadly failed. Regardless of that, I would still recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An acquired taste, apparently for a lot of people","I have met several people who list this film as one of their all time favourites. In this spirit, I decided to give it a go.Winona Ryder is pitch perfect in the role, and the remaining cast are also very good. However the first half of the film does very little to involve you in Ryder's experience, and the film ends up having to play catch up in what does turn out to be a more involving second half. However the pacing is an issue, and whilst the emotional catharsis at the end feels well deserved, it contained scenes which weren't nearly as thought provoking/engaging as they should have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cukoos Nest For the 1990's,This is definitely one of the best films to deal with life inside a mental institution.  This was the career maker for Angelina Jolie and it solidified Wynona Ryder's career.  The person I really enjoyed in this film was Britanny Murphy as Daisy.  She was a person who had a tough exterior but after you chipped away at that shell there was really a fragile little girl underneath.  This film is definitely something I would watch again.,,Anonymous,Biography
"not a great movie, not especially bad","I've never read the book but I've heard it's weird and meandering and impossible to film. well maybe so, but the screenplay is 1-2-3 easy to get on film with sentimentality running rampant all about the place.  The supposed edginess of this film is lost on me. where is it? in the fact that it feautures angelina jolie as an ultimate bad girl or that winnona ryder smokes he cigarettes down to the end before flicking the ashes?

"Girl, institutionalized","Winona Ryder is a ""Girl, Interrupted"" in this 1999 film also starring Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa Redgrave and Clea Duvall.Ryder is Susanna, a high school graduate from a good family who attempts suicide and is then institutionalized. The script, in fact, is based on Susanna Kaysen's real-life account of her time in a mental institution in the '60s.In denial about her condition, she observes the ""crazies"" around her, finally becoming friends with an 8-year resident, Lisa (Angelia Jolie) whose biting insights and bucking of authority keep the place lively and keep Susanna going.As Susanna recovers and comes face to face with a devastating tragedy, she realizes that Lisa's type of resistance is not the way to go and that she must involve herself in the therapeutic process so that she can go home.This is a very dramatic and emotional story that I admit right up front left me sobbing. Though dark and often sad, it is a very life-affirming movie.The acting is beyond superb. Jolie, in her Oscar-winning performance, has the tour de force role, and she's magnificent. Jolie is one of those people whose once bizarre personality traits and now humanitarian efforts and relationship with Brad Pitt occasionally obliterate the fact that she's a fabulous and versatile actress.Ryder is stunning as the confused and depressed Susanna. Unfortunately, one of her first lines in the film is, ""Did you ever steal something when you had the cash?"" - if people did a riff on that when she was arrested for shoplifting, I missed it.She's another one whose personal peccadilloes have overshadowed some wonderful acting.These two women are surrounded by a marvelous cast of pros, including Redgrave as a patient psychiatrist, Goldberg as a tough but kind RN on the ward, and Brittany Murphy as a deeply disturbed young woman. All of the women who play patients are excellent and will tear at your heart.""Girl, Interrupted"" is a brilliant film and probably an underrated one. It's possible that people who hadn't seen it when Jolie won the Oscar were put off by her strange appearance at the Oscars as well as the interviews she gave about being in love with her brother, rough sex, and her use of sharp instruments. Then Ryder had her day.I truly hope none of that kept people from renting this movie, because it - and they - are beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not bad,"Girl, Interrupted is a film adaptation of a memoir so it's difficult critique the story.The movie in itself was boring. I guess, the only thing that stood out was the stunning performance of the cast with special mention to Angelina Jolie. Her on screen charm was magnetic as she played a menacing sociopath. She delivered a believable and natural performance. She was responsible for making Lisa the most interesting character of the movie.Brittany Murphy and was also convincing in her role.Whoopi Goldberg was nothing short of amazing. The character she played wasn't as intense as that of the others but you can't look past her. She carried a strong presence on cam.Honestly, I find it bit starry-eyed how the film made a mental institution look like a place for misunderstood people. It's very unrealistic. Then again, it's based on a book and I haven't read it so, I can't tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Girl Interrupted - *****,"The dialogue in most movies seems to be an afterthought. Hollywood seems to be more focused on beauty, action, and sex. In Girl Interrupted, the dialogue takes the front seat and the results are amazing. Probably because it is based on a book taken from actual experience, the memorable lines in this movie are endless from start to finish. The 'crazy' people in this movie are full of witty banter and deep psychological feelings. You come out of this movie wishing that everyday 'sane' people were this interesting and multidimensional. Ryder, Jolie, Brittany, & even Goldberg are FANTASTIC. You can tell that this movie meant a lot to all involved - especially Winona. This isn't just a 'chick flick'. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes intelligent, thoughtful, and thoroughly interesting characters. Except for the confusing opening 30 second flashback scene, the movie is practically flawless. I wish all movies were this good.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
We're all a little crazy sometimes,"Directed by James Mangold (COPLAND, THE WOLVERINE) and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, GIRL INTERRUPTED is the adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir about her time spent in Claymoore for attempted suicide. While I do feel like it is a good film, if a little unspectacular or by-the-numbers, I've never liked Winona Ryder that much. She acquits herself nicely here, but her character is rather vanilla and bland, especially compared to the colorful cast of characters she meets while institutionalized. The most interesting (and most developed) of these is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. While she might be better known as a movie star than as a serious actress these days, this performance came before all of that and, in my opinion, is one of her best. In fact, she gives the best performance in the entire film. In terms of thematic content, there are a lot of things said about insanity and mental health. Also, given the time period of 1967-1968, one could infer commentary on the state of America's mental institutions, especially as they applied to women. There's also some subtle commentary on the Vietnam War, although not to a great extent since that wasn't the main focus of the story. Whatever thematic goals the film may have had, however, pale in comparison to the character work and ensemble cast. As a portrait of life in a mental institution during the late 60's, I thought it was very effective, humorous and occasionally poignant. Brittany Murphy also had a small role as a character who is involved with one of the film's more serious moments. There are a couple more things that I thought about while watching this, one of them amusing and the other quite tragic. The first is a part of the film when Lisa and Susanna escape with the intention of going to Florida and getting jobs at the newly established Disney World. Lisa wants to be Cinderella, which is kind of funny considering that just last year Angelina Jolie played Maleficent for Disney. Not quite the same, but still interesting. The other, and which is a bit of a spoiler, is that Brittany Murphy would eventually meet a tragic end like her character in this film. Anyway, this wasn't some brilliant expose of mental institutions but it did function especially well as a character study. Winona Ryder's character was a bit bland, but only because she was completely upstaged by everyone around her. Recommended, but mostly for Angelina Jolie's performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Girl, Interrupted","Girl, Interrupted is a engaging biography drama that emphasizes the human connection, empathy, and a unpredictable ride throughout. It held my attention through it's entire runtime, containing excellent performances, great music and a engaging story. That said it missed just that edge of really touching me, and getting to that core human condition, which it tries to at the end.Directing is well done, with some fantastic transitions and some creativity here and there. It's paced properly to fit the environment and never put me off. It only missed some characterization shots, some that just put a person out there and allow the viewer to observe them in that moment. Those strong observant moments missed a bit, though it was attempted. And I think it is also because noticeably the director stayed very close to it's characters, and really close to their eyes. Many of the shots focus on just the face, close and personal. Which had a great effect by making acting that much more impressive and impactful, because you are right in there. Like you are sitting there looking at them.As far as the hospital goes I can't really say if it is true to how things would go in a real one in the 60s. But I can say that it feels and looks authentic. With some liberties here and there. It didn't make it look like a bad place, nor a good place. The methods used are shortsighted, feel uninformed at times and the drug application seems barbarian most of the time, but there are people in there willing to genuinely help.Acting and characters are very strong, tough roles and also just great performances. Ryder is incredible. Jolie surprised me again, she's good. And Murphy was a standout too. Other side character just great as well.Music is lovely, it does indicate the movie, right from the beginning, to have a sentimental tone but not a dark and depressing tone. It's really nice and reflective.Story is good, it kept me on my toes somewhat, with the messy memories thing you start thinking up scenarios. But it ended up being nice.Writing though, I felt that we just needed a bit more of what was going in the that head of Susanna, we really just got the outer layer. I wish we delved deeper, especially during the sessions. And had more of a emotional breakthrough than what we got. I never really felt that 'switch' because her mindset needed more screentime. Instead it focuses more on the outside characters. Still fine. But I missed that bit of introspection.All said and done I was happy having seen this. It was comforting in a way. The music helped too. Due to how it focuses so much on the human element. You'd almost want to check yourself in to have the experience. And that's the thing the movie nails with it's finale, we can all end up there if we let ourselves spiral down.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping but....,"This film is undeniably well-directed and well-acted, which is no surprise given the powerhouse performances by Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.

A masterpiece in movie history!,"I loved this movie from on the first day I saw it. This story is so unique in its way showing the problems many people have to face when being young. The best thing about this movie is, that it's based upon the experience of the real Susanna Kaysen, which means that the story is not only real but also natural and not ""brightened up"" for entertainment. It shows reality as it is! The actors do a really great job and among other acting personalities we can find Whoopie Goldberg, Winona Ryder and Jared Leto which seem just perfect for the roles they embody. The story, which seems to me loving and cruel at the same time, is pictured by a wonderful musical score and great songs more or less known from those hard days known as the 60's. This movie is a MUST for everyone who is seeking for a deep, thoughtful and emotional film as well as great actors!",,Anonymous,Biography
"Winona's best since ""Mermaids""","Some actors are stage actors....and are born to perform on the stage... but Winona Ryder is the most perfectly natural Screen Actress in every sense of the word; she does not even need the theatrical outbursts of speech other actresses needed to demonstrate their acting skills. A bit of fire and tears in the eyes is all she needs ( and what eyes, too!! ) to make her ""speak"", the two alternating in varying degrees of intensity, sometimes simultaneously, and always meaningfully.""Girl, Interrupted"" is neither a work of genius nor a great piece of art by any means. There is more affected cinematic technique and style in it than can be over-looked; much of the montage and the editing is pseudo-'great director', with the names of all the great directors between the parentheses. But what saves it all is the scenario...it has life in it; for a film version of a singularly unfilmable subject, there is a surprising level of ""no-nonsense"" in the screen play.Susanna Kaysen is an eighteen-year-old who finds herself feeling out of harmony with the society she grew up in and has been part of all her life...depressed, sad and unwell, she takes too many aspirins for the good of either the head-ache or her health. The 'Powers That Be' decide she needs to get oriented back into normalcy in an asylum, where she meets enough disoriented people to give her not only a new vantage view-point of herself and her condition, but also feelings of attachment strong enough for her to cherish. The events that shape the lives of her co-occupants of the asylum and the experiences she shares with them, albeit in a slightly observant role (as befits an aspiring writer), are both purgatory for her and embalming...she comes out of it having obtained enough answers to determine which of the two worlds was more appropriate for her, the closed asylum or the 'stupid' outside world.The film works only because Winona Ryder could make us SEE every impression each incident made on her within the asylum, and how each occurrence was turning her mental compass to a semblance of normalcy, to the extent that any sane, passionate person could ever be 'normal' enough.My rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Favourite movie,"''Girl, interrupted'' is a 1999 American drama film directed by James Mangold. The film stars Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen, the protagonist, and Angelina Jolie as Lisa Rowe. The story follows a young woman who spends 18 months at a psychiatric hospital due to a suicide attempt.The films plot is incredibly heavy and serious, as it explores themes of mental illness and identity. I found it quite unpredictable considering the many plot twists. The film received diverse reviews but the actors were very exalted nevertheless. Susanna Kaysen, played by Winona Ryder, is a young woman in the 1960's who was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and sent to a psychiatric hospital named Claymoore. She is doubtful about her diagnosis, unsure if she's actually ill or just different. Lisa Rowe, played by Angelina Jolie, is a charming and manipulative sociopath who often tries to escape the hospital. Lisa is looked up to by the other patients and becomes a friend and an antagonist to Susanna. Daisy Randone, played by Brittany Murphy, is a sexually abused 18 year old girl with an obsessive-compulsive disorder who isolates herself from the other patients. I thought that the actors did a great job at representing what living with mental illness is like while giving an extraordinary performance. The cinematography in ''Girl, interrupted'' plays a crucial role in setting the tone of the film. I really like how the film uses color and lightning as well as symbolism through visuals. It helps in involving the viewers in the harsh and upsetting world of a psychiatric hospital. There are numerous themes in the film such as mental illness vs. Social deviance and self-discovery. The story explores how mental illness is often defined by society and how people who don't fit the norms are labeled as ''crazy''. In my opinion, the atmosphere is really apprehensive and sometimes unsettling which fits the mental hospital setting. There is also this tension that makes the atmosphere feel unpredictable. As for the pacing it's slow and deliberate, which I think works really well. The slower moments allow you to think about the characters struggles and I thought it gave the story more depth.Overall, ''Girl, interrupted'' is an intriguing and thought-provoking film that i would highly recommend to anyone who's interested in mental health issues. I would give it a rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Now this is what I call acting...,"Nice, introspective movie, with no action scenes or special effects for a change. Instead, with good dialog, character building and some great acting. What Angelina Jolie has done in this film is awesome. It is one of the best acting I have seen in years! Winona Ryder is convincing as Susanna, and I would also like to mention Elisabeth Moss (""The West Wing"") who did a good job in a difficult role as Polly. I was surprised how low key Whoopi Golberg's role was and how little she stands out in this motion picture.What ruins the overall judgment a little is the ending with it's typically 'Hollywoodian' basement scene climax which was totally unnecessary. Otherwise a very nice 'actors' film, definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Angelina Jolie inviolably dominates the movie and, although she is in supporting role, I think this was the role of her life. She deservedly took Academy Award and a dozen more first places on various film festivals. Winona is Winona, I was never able to form a coherent opinion about her. There are also Jared Leto, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Elisabeth Moss, Vanessa Redgrave...

Interesting time capsule...,"From the years 1800 to 1960, very little progress was made in the understanding or treatment of mental illness. Part of this stagnation had to do with the fact that religious repression of medical science was still being shaken off at the time, but the biggest culprit was the inability of society to wake up and realise that just because a fat suit behind a desk said all was well didn't necessarily make it so. Given that Australia calls itself the ""lucky country"" in spite of having the highest youth suicide rate in the entire world, it doesn't appear that we'll be getting over that hurdle any time soon.But the treatment of the mentally ill in the 1960s is a radically different beast to what it has been since the patenting of Prozac and Zoloft in the mid 1990s. In the 1960s, it was belived by medical staff of all walks that patients of any description had no real rights, and that they had better do what was ordered or look out. Nowadays, hospitals and doctors can be taken to court for trying to make a patient take pills without informing them of what the pills are meant to do. That's one area where progress has been made, and films like this are useful in this way as they provide a bit of information about how things used to be. Maybe in another thirty years, they will make a film about the treatment of mental patients in the 1990s. I'll probably get around to writing my own memoirs by then, so Hollywood can give me a call if they are interested. I have some stories that will make their ears bleed.That's the one flaw with this film. The results of the primitive and often excessive treatments given in this film are very much prettied-up for the Hollywood audience. The 1960s is a time when such things as Deep Sleep Therapy, a treatment where patients were put into drug-induced comas and given ECT, were thought of as a good idea. Many a patient was killed by this treatment, and to not have such barbarisms mentioned at all in a film that is almost entirely set in a mental hospital is a mistake.Winona Ryder in the lead role is a bit of a non-event. While it is true that she resembles a lot of archival photos of the real Susanna Kaysen, her flat-as-a-plank delivery makes her patently unconvincing. In a real mental hospital where patients are often climbing the walls, it is truly difficult to believe that this woman would be kept there for the entirety of a day. If anyone needs to know why Angelina Jolie is one of the most well-regarded actors of her generation despite some shocking script choices, this is the film to look at. She truly steals the show here, and absorbs every last bit of audience sympathy. She acts rings around the entire cast, including Whoopi Goldberg.All in all, I gave this film a seven out of ten. It is just too prettied-up to have any impact, but it does provide an interesting look at how far things have come (as well as remained the same) in around thirty or forty years.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One flew over the cuckoo's nest 2,"This movie takes place in a mental hospital, and offers a character study.

"""not a day goes by that my heart doesn't find them...""","the conclusion of this film ends with the line above, and once it is said a lifetime of memories can flash before you upon hearing it. this film is one of those rare movie-going experiences that makes a member of the audience leave with the characters and their actions still in mind. the film is, in a word, unforgettable and reminds its audience of the people that have touched their lives.  it doesn't do so perfectly, but well enough.there have been mixed feelings about this film, and many have complained about the cliche's. i've even heard someone say that at some points the film seems like it plays as a parody of itself. some things were unclear, and the script could have used work. and yes, i don't what the deal was with those chickens. but the direction (awesome montage scene) and the acting just make it work, it's that simple.winona ryder is just amazing as susanna. you could see it in her face. she's in so much pain, but all the while she's just a spoiled little girl with not enough in life. it was an understated performance. angelina jolie has won the oscar, which conflicts me because it's a clear case of scene stealing. her competition (catherine keener, chloe sevigny) were amazing, probably better, but not as flashy. still, she captures every side of lisa, from villainous and strong to every bit as vulnerable as susanna, and makes her a sexy character still worthy of our sympathy. her emotional scenes are breathtaking. and what about clea duvall? her character had a lot more to do with the plot in the book, which i can't wait to read. she does excellent with what she's got, but an actress of her caliber should have been given a lot more. moss, murphy, and whoopi are also excellent.these performances are the main reason this film works. because of them the situations are handled so realistically, enough for the audience's response to be the same as it would if these were real mental patients. look at the anorexic girl. watching her would make you want to almost bite your cheek for wanting to laugh when she acts funny, because you know she's in an extremely sad situation.this film has several scenes that burn in the memory, and it is because of the girls. two scenes that were incredible: when lisa first attacks susanna, and when lisa is locked up and her silent friend is breaking down outside. unbelievably affecting scenes. the emotional score also gets a few extra points. emotional, not mushy. this movie may sometimes stray from being great, but its raw power and humanity make it definitely worth a look.",,Anonymous,Biography
Jolie saved this movie,"Ah the 90's, ''twas a simpler time, and probably the last golden age of cinema.I gave it a 7 for Angelina Jolie's performance, she basically carried the movie all by herself.I think based on how much Winona Ryder's personal life was on a downward spiral after this serves as a cautionary tale to be mindful of what you think consume, and do in life.It has to be awful for her that this was basically her pet project and yet her character was flat, dull, and boring. I've just never been a fan of hers or understood what the hype was about, she's very pretty when she smiles, but that's about it.I didn't appreciate Angelina as an actress when this first came out, but during last nights rewatch I just couldn't take my eyes off of her.Her eyes shine with vibrant intelligence and confidence, she was really a joy to watch.Sorry, but I have to agree with others that this movie could've been so much better, and Ryder's character Susanna really does come off as just a self indulgent little brat.This was like watching a lifetime movie save for Angelina's brilliant and enigmatic depiction of Lisa, shoutout to Brittany Murphy & Whoopie Goldberg who I adore in everything they do.It's worth a watch for all of the supporting actresses here, who sadly all do a better job than Ryder.She literally only has about 3 different facial expressions in the entire film, and comes off as a contrived brat, I shudder to think the similarities I shared with her as a depressed teenager.Would've been nice to have shown the backdrop of the times with more emphasis on the turmoil of the real world.A perspective coming from a spoiled little rich girl being pampered in a nice hospital for a year doesn't cut it for me.Sadly, institutions like this no longer exist and people with real mental illness, not Susanna never get this type of help anymore, and are left to fend for themselves.Lastly, what was the deal with the docs and the institution being so ""terrible""? It really is a 4 star hotel with plenty of good psych drugs floating around.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Girl, Interrupted abruptly infiltrates mental conditions through a solid, albeit inconsistent, characterised plot.","There's only one film that truly tackles mental institutionalisation with enough heft and characterisation, that it remains the superior benchmark for all subsequent topical features. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Mangold's adaptation may not be in the same league as the aforementioned near-perfect drama, yet he serves up one of the most talented ensemble casts of the late 90s. Each performance turning in a level of emotional connectivity that, whilst subsequently diminished the darker tones, interrupted our thought process with genuine characters that emanated fragility and heart. A young girl's parents have their daughter institutionalised on the basis that she nearly tried to commit suicide, not aware that her mentality is actually intact, to which she finds herself enthralled by the other girls within the hospital.Mangold's intentions weren't necessarily to comment on the system's capitalisation of business over patient welfare, but to grant audiences a window into a splintered group of friends. Blossoming friendships in the confined spaces of an imprisoned environment. A minuscule community driven on the reliance of each other, despite the frantic and erratic schizophrenic behaviours of the patients. His screenplay mimics the close proximity of these patients by intrinsically focusing on their relationships with each other. Divulging into their tainted pasts and current daily routines. Like I said, it's never an examination of the system, but an insight into the patients' residence. It's all the better for it, and oozed so much characterisation that it's nearly impossible to resist.What aided in the emotional vulnerability of these girls, were the performances. Ryder gave a career best in a role that clearly meant something to her. The innocence, fragility and sharp tongue. The perfect lead character. A supporting cast comprising of Goldberg, Tambor, Moss, Leto and Murphy ensured high calibre performances, and they all delivered. Of course though, there's one performance that stole the spotlight. That one flickering light of excellence that made the film as memorable as it is today. Angelina Jolie. Her ferocity allowed her character to earn a commanding presence. A presence that chewed up every scene she was in. The alternative style clearly differing from her colleagues. The bitter lines of dialogue that made her unapproachable yet empathetic. No surprise that she won an onslaught of awards, it's one of her greatest performances.The narrative however falters on several occasions. There were frequent moments of darkness within this tale of hope, juxtaposing the lighter tone set in the first half of the film. These moments unfortunately had no staying power and heightened an unnecessary amount of melodrama. The bathroom suicide scene for example, and the rushed final night at the hospital. Exploration into borderline personality disorder was also lacking. These blinded scenes in tackling the darkness of mental illness had no conviction, and instead hurried the thinly plotted narrative along to its predictable conclusion. Which is a dire shame considering the intricate development of the characters. The bland score also attempted to enhance that acute sense of dramatic power, yet instead felt clinical. And finally the film is set in the 60s, yet strangely the wardrobe felt very modern and didn't necessarily suit the decade it was attempting to portray.Despite these reserved withdrawals, the performances and fleshed out character development alone were enough to prevent Girl from continually being Interrupted. Implanting solid foundations into a splintered narrative casually observing mental illness, producing emotional resonance during its conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is my thoughts about this movie,"It's a good movie for every thought daughter, I found comfort in characters, maybe because I can relate to some of them.I cried especially at the end of the movie, I hardly cry but this movie did something to me that I don't know how to explain it.I watched it two months ago, it's still has an effect on me.If you want a comforting movie this is not for you.On the other hand, the actors and actress were good, the quality of the movie, the soundtrack, the idea of it were good compared to other movies that were made in that year.Putting Winona and Angelina together was a great idea, they're both great actress.So at the end I liked the movie even though it made me cry.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A true delight.,"It's always a simple task to relegate a movie or piece of work to a niche in the wall, claiming that it borrows or steals from one thing or another.  In the case of ""Girl, Interrupted,"" it's very easy to say ""It's a 'Cuckoo's Nest' with girls.""  Looking at things on such a superficial level, one could argue that every story steals from all those before it.  But the truth of the matter is that certain ideas are so fundamental, so classical, that they have applied to us for as long as anybody can remember.  If basing a movie on a mental institution and its patients concocts triteness, then basing a movie on love is as much of a sin.""Girl, Interrupted"" places us in the eyes of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a teenage girl who suffers from depression and is signed into the custody of a psychiatric hospital after a failed attempt at suicide.  Like most young people who suffer from this state, Susanna is unable to acknowledge the disorder that affects her.  Seeing things from a practical point of view--believing in cause and effect--makes it difficult for her to understand what she suffers from when she doesn't understand what caused the condition to begin with.Enter Lisa, faultlessly played by Angelina Jolie.  Beautiful, savage, defiant, and extremely charismatic, she introduces Susanna to a new line of thought: it's the world that's screwed up, not them.  The world is afraid of aberrations such as themselves--people who create a dissonance in the perfect balance of their ideal society.  Thus, they lock them up in mental institutions, and rejoice once that the problem is taken up by the hands of others after the exchange of a sizable amount of cash.Susanna, needless to say, is enthralled by her new friend;  Lisa is somebody who knows the inner workings of the world, someone to latch onto.  And when one latches onto somebody else in such a manner, either individually or in a group, self-expression and individuality are more often than not sacrificed. Susanna, who was once overwhelmed by the number of choices that confronted her in life, is now ecstatic at the simplicity of her new life in the ward, revolting with Lisa against an unfair system, an unfair world.At the heart of this film, however, lies a much more fundamental, classical idea:  friendship--what causes it, how it can invigorate us in the worst of times, and its short and long-term effects.  With a beautiful poetic grace, the movie states that it's not the duration of a relationship that matters, but who it is that you befriend, and the place that they earn in your heart while it lasts.  Every relationship in our life is short-lived, as we're continually moving forward in our journey towards a fulfilled existence; time does not stand still, and the film makes a conscious effort to constantly accentuate this point.For a movie that was almost entirely shot in a hospital ward, the cinematography is exceptionally good.  While it's mostly a character-driven piece, there are a number of interesting shots and tricks that truly place us in the eyes of Susanna, and a few montages that are propelled by what I would consider a perfect soundtrack.  At the forefront, of course, are the actresses themselves, and no words could describe what they've accomplished here.  It's simply astounding.Though the light that ""Girl, Interrupted"" attempts to place on mentally unstable people is a little questionable at times, it does a nice, subtle job of exposing the puerile nature of a profession which we could nowadays consider an industry.  They're delicate subjects to touch upon, sure.  But in the end, the journey is definitely worth taking.  When I asked myself why I found the manner in which the story was handled so endearing, I recalled one of Winona's most insightful lines: ""Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret.  It's you or me...amplified.""9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Much more than a film about what happens inside a psychiatric hospital and the patients' heads, it is a film about freedom, to give voice to our feelings, our insanity","Based on Susanna Kaysen's autobiographical book, ""Girl, Interrupted"" stars a character with Borderline Personality Disorder, who is admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the 1960s. The work, far from denying the importance of medical treatment for neurodivergent conditions, leads us to question what ""madness"" is, a complex question for which there are no easy answers, and about the dangerous intersection between psychophobia and machismo. ""Girl, Interrupted"" turns out, however, to be much more than a drama about the protagonist's condition. It is a work about the nuances of human feeling and the advantages that self-knowledge can bring us. Filmmaker James Mangold is impeccable in the direction of the narrative and in the interpretations that he extracts from the first level cast.A film that navigates deep waters, without being afraid to bring lightness to such an abyssal zone. Perhaps this is one of the main features of Girl, Interrupted, a drama directed by James Mangold, based on the autobiographical book of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. With a script signed by the filmmaker, in a partnership with Anna Hamilton Phelan, the narrative addresses issues related to the psychological disorders of its characters, without necessarily presenting them as decrepit beings, as in many films of this style.As the protagonist we have Susanna (Winona Ryder), a young woman who needs to hurt herself in some way, in order to kill the pain and suffering inside. After an overdose of pills and vodka, she is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When she arrives at the scene, she soon befriends sociopath Lisa (Angelina Jolie). Manipulative but attractive because of her psychological games, Lisa exerts a huge catalytic force on the site, always under the supervision of nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a character who constantly contains the behaviors in continuous flux of change.This is how Susanna, initially introspective, gets to know other inmates better, strengthens bonds of friendship and gives new meaning to her trajectory. Among her new friends are Polly (Elisabeth Moss), a young woman who has suffered burns and is conflicted about her appearance; Georgina (Clea DuVall), and her anorexic problems, keep her encapsulated for a long time in the hospital; Daisy (Britanny Murphy), a girl who has suffered parental abuse throughout her life and due to some conflicts with Lisa, will find a tragic fate for her trajectory. There are still other girls who are less present than this supporting trio, but who, for the development of the story, have an important dramaturgical function.With constant attacks of self-destruction and a feeling of profound melancholy, Susanna often has her rages. She acts sarcastically and her report says she has promiscuous sexual behaviors. Always questioning, the character presents her dramatic needs and conflicts through many monologues, dialogues that prove her survival always on the ""limit"" of emotions. Faced with the uncertainties of the future, professional pressures and her difficulty in relating, Susanna is the result of an existence that suffers from a lack of understanding on the part of the people around her. In this way, the character is a being that accurately delineates the youth of many generations, but there is a ""what"" of the youth of the 1960s, bombarded by the cultural upheavals of the time.To reflect on all these themes is to travel through a minefield. Therefore, the film's stylistic approach and narrative choices opened up this reflection for a reason. In 1999, when it was released, there was an intense debate, held by some critics and viewers. Some were pertinent, others are just vague comments and without any reflexive force. But a discussion gained a lot of evidence. Some spectators and critics complained about the questions regarding the content of the drama, treated, according to the statements of the spectators in debate, too lightly and without the necessary seriousness for this type of story.Girl Interrupted is fiction, so the dense treatment of the issues does not necessarily need a production design loaded with dark spaces and objects with expressionist/surrealist symbology, nor a suffocating soundtrack. I bet that the interesting thing about the film is that it doesn't seek to traffic in the hand of stereotypes, something that would be very common and more obvious. Choosing a clean atmosphere and betting on the construction of dialogues was certainly a more effective strategy, in a possibility of exposing a complex theme without necessarily making the narrative hermetic. Playful, lyrical and delicate, the production is a gift for those passionate about discussions about family problems, freedom and its consequences.Part of the identification that the work provokes with the public is due to the brilliant interpretation of Winona Ryder in the main role. She is a young woman who, precisely because she has a neurodivergent brain in a society that was not made for someone who works in these standards, ends up having self-destructive behaviors. Susanna is much more than a diagnosis. She reveals herself to be an extremely perceptive, sensitive, intelligent and sensitive girl.Angelina Jolie, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this role, has the difficult mission of giving vigor and complexity to a character that requires great care in its composition. She deserved the statuette and manages to make the viewer see the spark of humanity behind a woman who, due to her particularities, has profoundly terrible attitudes. As cruel as Lisa can be, we can understand the affinity between her and Susanna. Their relationship with Brittany Murphy's character, another highlight of the production, is one of the work's many strengths.The film also provides us with this question: to what extent are we normal? To what extent do we let insanity out and take over? After all, what is normal? Kaysen discusses this question throughout the book and claims that there is a fine line between normal and abnormal. According to the society of the time, you should act and behave in a way that was often not what you wanted to do. The adults did not talk to the young people, who ended up getting confused about certain issues and acting as they pleased. Not much different from what happens these days.The work does not travel through stereotypes, the atmosphere is built through dialogues and their density. The narrative is lyrical, with a delicate look at the theme, the soundtrack complements this work with peculiarity. Girl Interrupted runs away from suffering, without electroshocks and sound therapy. Much more than a film about what happens inside a psychiatric hospital and the patients' heads, it is a film about freedom. Freedom to be able to give voice to our feelings, our insanity. It is a long and dense film that works and explores people's minds and makes us reflect on the influence that the people around us have on us.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
more than another person's story,"I had never heard of Susanna Kaysen when ""Girl, Interrupted"" came out, but this movie based on her memoirs was really something. It tells the story of when she was put in a mental institution in the late '60s. Winona Ryder, whose roles sometimes seem either silly or overdone, does a very good job as Susanna, showing her as a strong-willed young woman who just couldn't seem to express herself right. Believe it or not, Angelina Jolie - looking more haggard than usual - also does a really good job in the movie. She plays Lisa Rowe, whom Susanna befriends in the institution. Lisa can gravitate between affectionate and acerbic, and is truly the bane of the establishment.Maybe this movie on one level does show how events affected another person, but it really is more than that. It shows how the Vietnam War is affecting everyone, as Susanna's boyfriend Toby Jacobs (Jared Leto) might get sent to Vietnam. All in all, this is one of the many movies that my generation can remember fondly, just as my parents' generation fondly remembers ""The Graduate"".

However, unlike Winona hoped, Angelina stole the spotlight taking up all the attention for this movie in her role as Lisa Rowe (Susanna's best friend), a sociopath, who takes the movie to extreme limits.

"An extreme departure from the book, but an interesting study of actresses","I've read several opinions (here and in magazines) that the movie stuck quite closely to the book, and I'm wondering if I read the same book.  The movie seemed only to take shreds of the book, and add a lot of wild and outrageous adventures that seem to be attempting to make mental illness look like fun....which is odd, because it is not.  I was disappointed to see that the film offers the idea that Susanna is merely spoiled and self-indulgent and not actually mentally disturbed.  Had the film included some sections of the book (like when she claws through the skin on her hand because she's convinced that she has no bones), that theory would have been impossible. The staging and camerawork seemed bland and formulaic, as did the script, providing a fairly sugar coated view of mental illness, until the scene in the basement of the hospital, towards the end of the film.Angelina Jolie's performance, at first, seemed to fit the wild, free and easy depiction of mental illness, but in the last half of the movie, she began to make her character increasingly cruel, reminding the audience that she IS a sociopath, and not just a ""free spirit, unjustly imprisoned"".  I got the impression that Winona Ryder could have acted this part in her sleep, and did so, until the bathtub scene with Whoopi Goldberg, where she seemed to break out of the naive waif characterization, and finally show some signs of life.  The supporting actresses did well, as did Jeffrey Tambor in a role that is far from his usual comedy. Overall, this film can't be seen as a serious study of mental illness until close to the end, when things get intense, and you realize that these girls really are ill.  I do feel that if the movie had stuck more closely to the book, it may not have been as fun, but it certainly would have been more realistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Angelina Jolie...,"""Girl, Interrupted"" is a Biography - Drama movie which is based on the 18-month stay of Susanna Kaysen's at a mental hospital in the 1960s. Since she had many difficulties to cope with reality and all the difficulties that have to surpass in order to actually live on it she was hospitalized at a very well known mental hospital. There she met many other women and with some of those she considered them as friends. Especially with one of those she created a special bond which was very difficult to break and be able to continue her therapy.I liked this movie because it was based on a real-life story which I found very interesting. I believe that this period of life was remained in Susanna Kaysen's memory for a long time not to say in the whole duration of it because it was something very important for her since she learned more not only about other people but for herself too in combination with the reality of course. I liked the interpretations of Winona Ryder who played as Susanna Kaysen and she was very good at it and Angelina Jolie who played as Lisa and I believe it was her best performance so far (won the Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Supporting Role on 2000). Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Brittany Murphy's who played as Daisy and she was equally good. About the direction which was made by James Mangold I have to say that it was very interesting and he combined very well drama moments with funny ones but from the perspective of the unstable people, something very hard to succeed on it.Finally, I believe that ""Girl, Interrupted"" is an interesting movie to watch, with many good scenes, a great plot and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I believe that everyone has something to gain from it in a matter of understanding of how easy is to become one of those people and that is extremely close the one side of mental health to another where you are unstable or sick.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"My Evening, Interrupted","Addled, dull, mush-brained. Winona Ryder plays a spoiled, suicidal rich girl with what looks like a repetitive series of ticks and shakes---it's not so much a performance as an overwrought improv exercise in acting class, and not a very convincing one at that.What we get overall is about as edgy and exciting as an episode of ""Felicity"" set in an isolation ward.  Director James Mangold hamstrings an otherwise talented cast with a goopy, sentimental take on a all-girl's mental ward with a remarkably lax security staff (which lazily seems more to service the narrative than proving a point about the rebellious ingenuity of the gals in this perfectly groomed snake pit); breakouts seem a nightly event and after a point the setting feels more like a valium-drugged sorority than an emotionally tumultuous ward for the emotionally unravelled. For a film about mental illness, Mangold managed to flatline every moment in the film; every confrontation and revelation is staged in the dullest, enervated way possible.Consistently, every scene announces itself with a Declaration and just as consistently there's no payoff or genuine point; Susanna's final confrontation with Lisa is a laughable dud---for all the script's flailing about Lisa's ""sociopathic"" ability to cut to the quick about the tiresome and self-indulgent mental peccadilloes of the brats around her, it seems unlikely that she would be so undone by Susanna's single ""cutting"" comment, an observation made eons ago by the audience and which could be applied to the movie itself. As for Nurse Whoopie's comment, that Susanna's just ""a spoiled girl making herself crazy"", would that the script itself were so clear-headed---the movie's just as guilty of indulging its characters, so unwilling to take them to task for their neuroses real or imagined, that there's no dramatic investment in sticking around until the last reel.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ryder and Jolie anchor this genuinely interesting movie about 18 months in a mental institution.,"""Was I ever crazy? Maybe. Or maybe life is.""Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name, Girl, Interrupted is about a young woman in the 60's named Susanna (Winona Ryder) who is encouraged by her parents to enter a mental institution for a short time after she attempts to commit suicide. As the short stay ends up turning into a much longer one, Susanna has to make an actual attempt to deal with her issues, or risk becoming like the near-permanent residents of mental hospital she a patient in.Most of this non-linear movie revolves around Susanna's relationships with the women she meets during her stay, including the volatile and sociopathic Lisa (Angelina Jolie), anti-social Daisy (Brittany Murphy), with her odd fixations, and child-like Polly (Elisabeth Moss). I don't know how accurate each woman's behaviors were to their actual conditions, but it was interesting seeing that what Susanna says at one point during the movie was actually true; that the people in the hospital really did and wanted the same things that we all do, only to an extreme.I hope I'm not making Girl, Interrupted sound like some documentary on mental health, because that's not what it is at all. It's about one young woman and how her stay in this place with these women changed her and how she handled her own life. I thought it was pretty good. It portrays its subject matter frankly but respectfully, and the story doesn't drown in melodrama or sentimentality, as this kind of movie easily could have.

tender and intelligent,"I have not read the book, but the movie, I'm sure does justice to Susanne Kaysen, whose story it is.

"Moving, though unspectacular","Girl Interrupted was a very well made film that cast a harsh light on what the 60s were to some people. Although standard in its idea, the cinematography was very slick, with some brilliant cuts from flashback to real time. Winona Ryder was very good in the lead role, showcasing her versatility and considerable talent amidst a solid but unspectacular supporting cast. Jolie was good, but I don't think quite worthy of a Golden Globe. She only established her claim to the award in the last quarter of the film, which to me is not quite good enough. However, since Hollywood award voters give high kudos to any film with the words ""Based on a true story"" behind the title it is easy to see how she could win. Still, her performance as the maverick presence in the institution was good.

A brief lesson on how to steal a show as a supporting actress,"""Girl, Interrupted"" approaches the social revolution of the sixties from a very special viewpoint: a mental institute into which a young girl is sent because of a rather light excuse. The viewer is likely to find himself or herself from the girl and not from the medical staff or from other ""normal"" people. The girl doesn't seem to be mentally unstable at all if you compare her to the other patients at the institute.The storyline of ""Girl, Interrupted"" is excellent but that will soon become of only secondary importance because the moment you see Angelina Jolie as Lisa for the first time you'll realize who will steal the show. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Jolie you have to admit that the role was made for her. The sociopath Lisa always keeps something going on and the story will move forward as much as it is possible inside those walls.Surely you could look for social commentaries from this film but I think that analysis would only say that this is a boring movie, which it is not. You can just relax and forget the social issues, there will be a lot of life going on, and ironically the second best and the worst thing about the film is the very same thing this time: seeing Jolie, Ryder and Murphy as the patients kinda make you want to be in there too, but remember, it's only a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen is brilliant. She truly gives herself to the character. Angelina Jolie's performance as a sociopath, is exemplary. And without doubt, she deserved all the praises she got. Late Brittany Murphy & Clea DuVall are very good, while Whoopi Goldberg proves her status yet again.On the whole, 'Girl Interrupted' is complicated, at times boring, but the story of Susanna Kaysen surely needs to be watched. Despite it's glitches, I suggest you check this one out.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Book, Discarded","Not only a bad film, but perhaps a dangerous one, this movie betrays the serious and thoughtful book on which is was based in favour of asylum-as-summer-camp hijinx. The author's original critique of the system is replaced with a knuckle-under philosophy that plays into the hands of a system that the book shows may or may not have created some of the very diseases it claims to treat. Apart from a great performance by Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted has nothing to recommend it and much to its discredit.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
should have read the book instead,"i don't know how closely this film follows the book, but i'm willing to bet there was some hollywood license taken...they lost me early on when the doctor says things to susanna that no proper doctor would, and then she's put in a cab?  if this really happened, ok, but i just didn't buy it--who would put someone vulnerable like that ALONE in a cab with some creepy driver??  unbelievable, to the point of implausibility...there's virtually no security in this facility--the girls are running wild at night, and the most disturbed girl (jolie) has KEYS!?!?  PLEASE!  then the vanessa redgrave character says things to her that, again, no reputable doctor would ever say to a patient, even in the 60's (""are you sane or are you crazy?"")...overall, we don't learn anything about how susanna has come to this point in her life, we just see that her parents are idiots (aha!)...  her so-called progress is not demonstrated at all, we just see her observing and interacting with the other girls, and naturally, from being exposed to so many unstable people, she begins to become more unstable herself (probably the most realistic aspect of this film)... there are only 2 reasons to watch this film, the performances (almost make it worth it), and the editing...other than that this film for me was bleak and depressing (not to say that all movies have to have happy hollywood endings)--i could find nothing the least bit redeemable in it whatsoever, and i'm stunned at the glowing reviews here from other viewers--that in itself is a downer!",,Anonymous,Biography

Even if the people out are liars I'd prefer to be with them,"This film is a compelling cinematic exploration of mental health, friendship, and the complexities of the human mind. Directed by James Mangold, the film is anchored by an exceptional performance from Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen, a young woman institutionalized in the 1960s. Her portrayal beautifully captures the inner turmoil of someone struggling with a sense of identity and purpose.Angelina Jolie's Oscar-winning turn as Lisa, a charismatic yet deeply troubled fellow patient, adds depth to the narrative. The chemistry between Ryder and Jolie is electric and adds a layer of tension to the story.The film delves into themes of conformity, societal expectations, and the blurry line between sanity and madness. It raises thought-provoking questions about the treatment of mental illness and the importance of empathy in dealing with individuals facing such challenges.What makes ""Girl, Interrupted"" particularly impactful is its ability to portray the raw and often painful reality of mental illness while offering a glimmer of hope and resilience through the characters' journeys. The supporting cast, including Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall, and Vanessa Redgrave, delivers stellar performances that contribute to the film's emotional depth.The cinematography and period-appropriate soundtrack transport viewers to the 1960s, immersing them in the era's unique atmosphere. The film's pacing, while deliberate, keeps the audience engaged in the characters' evolving dynamics.""Girl, Interrupted"" reminds us that mental health is a vital part of our overall well-being and that understanding and support are crucial for those who are suffering. This film is a timeless exploration of the human condition, and its messages continue to resonate with audiences, making it a must-watch for anyone interested in powerful storytelling and exceptional performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A slight case of overacting is only knock on meaty script,"Susanna Kaysen's recollection of her experiences in a mental hospital at the close of the 1960s is adapted into a film that is both gritty and smart, reveling in its examination of the human psyche and how we as a society define insanity.The story centers on the relationship between Susanna and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a self-described sanitarium 'lifer' who is at once bombastic, bullying, and self-absorbed. You think you have problems? The young ladies at the elite institution have all sorts of mental maladies, some seemingly harmless and some bent on destruction. Is Susanna the only sane one? Even she isn't sure - she's the only one of her graduating high school class who didn't have collegiate plans, a fact that's drummed into her by each authority figure she comes into contact with. Finally, when Susanna chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka, her parents have her committed - for a 'rest.'This film appears to pull no punches when it comes to dealing with insanity and the people directly affected by it. While none of the secondary characters is really fleshed out, it's clear the emphasis is on Susanna and how she relates to the madness surrounding her. It's a staggeringly difficult dilemma - are you insane, or are you just struggling like everyone else? There are similarities in this movie to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and even to the comedic ""The Dream Team,"" but what sets this apart from the others in this genre are the performances, particularly by Ryder. It's never easy to play someone who's handicapped, despite all appearances to the contrary, but what Ryder needed to do was convey a character who may or may not be a borderline personality, not a clear-cut case. This is a task the actress tackles with gusto. While others in the role might tend to overstate their character's plight or actions, Ryder takes the subtle approach, reining in her actions and reactions enough to allow the viewer to empathize fully with her.The flip side of that approach is displayed by Jolie, who is so far over the top with her portrayal of Lisa that the viewer never gets a chance to root for her. In the face of tragedy and suffering, Lisa laughs sarcastically and generally makes people feel worse than ever. It's obvious from the start that this is a defense mechanism, but like Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining,"" because we never see Lisa in a favorable light - or, more importantly, in a sane one - we're never able to like her. There's hardly a likeable aspect to Lisa, who seems to become more destructive as the movie progresses (a statement on the healing power of our mental institutions? You be the judge). In other words, Jolie's character is so completely wacked out from the get-go that no one in the audience can really care about her much, only in how she affects Susanna. Only at the end of the movie do we get a glimpse of the depth of Jolie's character, but by then you might not care.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Interesting Journey for These Women,"Now this is an interesting movie. I originally saw it with an ex-girlfriend. My wife, Jaime, wanted to see this for time and I told her that I would rewatch with her. All I could remember was that this had heavy subject matter.We follow Susanna (Winona Ryder). She is dealing with something similar to myself when I was graduating college. She doesn't know what she's going to do with her life, but just wants to write. This is set in the past and is based somewhat on a real person. Susanna is committed to a mental hospital under the care of Dr. Potts (Jeffrey Tambor), Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave) and Valerie (Whoopie Goldberg), among others.Her time there she becomes friends with Lisa (Angela Jolie), Georgina (Clea DuVall), Polly (Elisabeth Moss) and other young women. Lisa is a bad influence and likes to rattle the cages of those in charge as well as her fellow patients. Dr. Wick points out how her destructive personality is holding back Susanna from getting better. This becomes an interesting enough journey of womanhood, how they should behave during this time period and figuring themselves out.What I should say is that we have an amazing cast here. I mentioned Ryder, Jolie, DuVall, Moss, Tambor, Redgrave and Goldberg, but I didn't bring up Brittany Murphy, Jared Leto and Angela Bettis. The performances across the board are great. I will also give credit to this for the time is it set. We are around the Vietnam War so Leto as Tobias Jacobs is convinced that he will be drafted. What he does there is interesting. This path of discovery and becoming an adult is something that I even connected with as a male. What they put them through here though was a bit heartbreaking at times. Making it feel like the past was great.This was a bit boring this time around, I did want to admit that. I'm not sure if it is intended for multiple viewings. I think there are things I picked up on this time, but it felt like it ran too long to be honest. This is Jaime's first watch and I think she said something similar as well. A solid movie to check out though, especially now with things happening in the world.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Number 1!,"This movie is awesome! It's really good, and I can almost recite every scene in my head. You can watch it over and over and never get bored of it. Brilliant acting By Wynonna and Angelina!

I got it for my birthday a few months later!.I'd watch it everyday if I had the time. All the acting is really good. The only characters I don't like are Toby (Suzanna'a boyfriend) and Dr. Melvin.

10/10,"A film I believe to be important would be Girl, Interrupted filmed in 1999 by James Mangold for many reasons. The film takes place during the late 1960s, which is based on a true story of Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who is checked into a mental institution to treat troubled young women after being diagnosed with depression. This woman finds herself having to choose between the world of the people who belong on the inside, such as her friend she meets in the institution named Lisa, or the difficult world of societal reality on the outside. Throughout the film, Lisa gains and loses control over Susanna and we are exposed to how much her mental illness affects her life when the lows are extremely low. How does Susanna find herself and her control again? This film does show a great example of how individuals in the 1960s and current time deals with mental health, abuse, self harm and suicide.The main reason I believe the quality of this film has such importance is this movie is a great example of showing how individuals deal with a variety of psychological and behavioral issues in a more realistic way from that time period. This film shows the importance of the patients feeling free from society in the hospital in ways such as being judged and dealing with the responsibilities in life while dealing with such deep rooted mental illnesses. This film also shows insight better than most films because it helps the audience picture mental health and the discrimination against those who are struggling with their own. This film was a huge hit and had a lot of positive feedback with its audience because it displayed a not so cliché film set up in a mental hospital and more a realistic story to the way the social science fields handled their clients. Lastly, I believe this movie is a great example of how the psychological field handled their clients in more of a ""build a bridge and get over it"" mindset during the time period it was written and filmed, compared to now where there is less judgment and more of a passionate approach for recovery.In conclusion, I would rate this movie on a scale from 1-10, with no hesitation a solid 10. I believe this film would be good for all audiences over the age of 17 and above, or with parental vision for the fact it is rated R and does involve a lot of intensity. I highly recommend this to anyone interested or in the mental health field such as psychology or social work. I highly enjoyed this film, the meaning and the importance of this, the way it was filmed and the whole thing overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"My Review - Girl, Interrupted","Though this film isn't for everyone, a combination of strong acting and elements of realism make it interesting at the very least. Though Girl, Interrupted isn't necesserily a ""new"" film, it is one I have only watched for the first time recently. Overall, I was pleased with what I saw though my feelings are mixed.As far as positive aspects are concerned; the acting is top notch and this is unsurprising judging from the actors involved. Both Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie present powerful performances with strong supporting actors ensuring the film never flakes in the acting department. As well as the acting, the atmosphere the film creates is successful in being unsettling and even disturbing at times. Often I found myself feeling I was watching more of a horror film which isn't a bad thing as a majority of the subject matter is dealt with realistically and with an intense approach.There is very little wrong with this film for what it is however what doesn't feel right unfortunately has a major impact on what I thought of the film as a whole. It feels good, like it should be a film I praise and give artistic applause however I had one major problem - the pacing. Pacing seems to give a film balance nowadays, making slow points in a story feel deep and necessary and, though none of the movie was particularly UNnecessary, it felt slow and I relied on the end for what the film should be - interesting and absorbing.That being said, I don't think the film would be what it is without all the build up - it's just that there's so much of it. I thankfully expected this after I was informed that it's based on a book and real events though this film appealed to my artist-film-maker side as opposed to my film-fan side. Overall, I would recommend this movie if you like psychological, character-driven films or feel like a thought-provoking feminist piece of cinema.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really Bad....,"I have no idea how this movie got such reviews.  I love all the actors, but I thought the movie really did an injustice to the book.  I also thought that the acting left a lot to be desired.  Winona Ryer was awful and the rest was so so.  Umm...I wouldn't ever see it a second time.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Girl, Climbing out...","Borderline Personality Disorder is an often used and abused psychiatric term given to young women(and sometimes young men)when their problems can't be clearly pinpointed by the usual battery of more specifically categorized disorders.  Popular in the '70's and '80's, a surprising number of individuals were labeled this way.What this film so graphically portrays, though, is that it is actually a ""hole"" that one falls into when adolescence, intelligence, and the real world (so different from the childhood one that can be influenced by imagination) intersect. Climbing out of that hole is the challenge, particularly because holes are dark and one can't see the obstacles that one has placed in the hole that can hinder the process. Sheer will, determination, and learning to trust others is often the light that can illuminate that darkness.Suzanna Kaysen says near the end of the film that she has wasted a year of her life, but in reality her life has become richer and deeper from spending that year in the way that she did.  Often when one is at the surface of the hole, one feels stupid for not having seen what was there, but when pain is deep the walls used to protect one from it can be high and wide.While Angelina Jolie's performance is astonishing and powerful, the main reason to see this film is not to see why she took home the Golden Globe. It is the fact that what you are looking at on the screen is world that no longer exists.  In the modern world of money grubbing HMOs, the journey to the rim of hole is hampered by the prohibited cost of health care and unwillingness of insurance companies to pay for it.  Today Suzanna would be mired in her hole and not on her way to being a well known writer.That complaint aside, Suzanna's story teaches us that the holes that we all dig for ourselves are escapable and as the old children's rhyme states ""can't go over it, can't go under it, can't go around it, gotta go through it.""  Otherwise, we will never reach the top.There are certainly a number of differences here from the original book and that is to be expected as the flow of the story was not exactly harmonious with a transfer to film.  However, the spirit of the book is still here, and that is the important thing.",,Anonymous,Biography
twisted youth,"Listen up idk why some people gave bad ratings at all.The film essentially presents the mental decline of a woman in the making trapped in different worlds where her personalities collide without knowing what kind of person to be.

Susanna had a stolen youth, coming to take part in controversial acts once she discovers a new side of herself. Watched for angelina and Winona s performances .

Very good drama,"This is a classic and I'll defend it. Life's pretty messy and it can be ugly, dealing with mental health issues is no walk in the park and this adaptation does its job. It discusses BPD, sociopathy, eating disorders, even suicide from a troubling perspective, makes you think about problems the average person doesn't really deal with throughout their lives. It's also a reunion of great actresses of the late 90s/early 2000s, which brings splendid acting to the table that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. It's overall a very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Imperfect, but interesting","""Girl, Interrupted"" does not cover a lot of new territory. You can call it a female version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as both films deal with the issue of mental insanity, and are shown from and insider's perspective of how it's really like, and the way society reacts towards people who are institutions. So, this is not a film that breaks new ground, but it is still an interesting one. Flawed, yes, mainly due to it's unfocused plot and lack of emphasis on some situations, but overall the film is worth watching. It's a candid look at the 60's, as people who did not know where they were going, or did not have a solid plan, would be deemed crazy. The protagonist, played well by Winona Ryder, is sort of like a lost adolescent who finds herself indifferent towards life, and ends up being locked up, only to realise that sometimes it's the world who causes people to lash out, not themselves. We are taken into her long journey inside a mental hospital, introducing us to a handful of ""loonies"" who are both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch. Angelina Jolie steals the show playing a wild sociopath who befriends Ryder during her stay, it's affecting to know that she was actually a real person. Brittany Murphy is also a standout, her character is profoundly tragic, I don't think she will get out her my head anytime soon. The story moves at a decent pace, and has many memorable moments, but for some reason, loses it's edge during the climax, resorting to melodrama in order to evoke emotions. But despite it's weaknesses, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is still a thoughtful study of a young woman's discovery of hope during a time of despair.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Feels like a story that has gone through the Hollywood machinery,"This was James Mangold's third feature, following his successful Cop Land in 1997. A psychological drama about life in a psychiatric hospital for young girls in the 1960, Girl, Interrupted was adapted from Susanna Kaysen's 1993 memoir and feels like the true account it purports to be. It also feels like a story that has gone through the Hollywood machinery, however, because it boasts some overly familiar plot and character developments and a disappointing unwillingness to really delve into the subject matter of mental illness and the hazards of institutionalisation. For all their flagrant flaws and troubles, these girls - not least Ryder and Jolie - always seem to be just one movie reconciliation away from complete recovery. That being said, the film is entertaining and well-made, with several fine performances by a talented cast, including Brittany Murphy as an abused daddy's girl and Elisabeth Moss as an immature burn victim.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Original novel much better than film,"The film is totally bland, silly, uninteresting, and going nowhere. I started yawning after 10 minutes. The original novel (by Susanna Kaysen) has always been my favorite book and this film version is just awful. I'm so disappointed, the film lacks the substance, maturity, and especially the dark humor displayed in the novel. And I don't really think Winona Ryder is the suitable person to play the heroine. The problem i see with Winona Ryder as an actress is that she's always 'Winona Ryder' no matter which film she appears in, she doesn't seem to me to be able to blend herself into the character. Angelina Jolie gives a much more powerful performance, but still, that doesn't help. THe film is just lame.

Superb acting in otherwise made-for-tv fare.,"Had Angelina Jolie not won the best supporting actress Oscar for GIRL, INTERRUPTED, this movie would most likely be forgotten within a few months of being transferred from the new releases shelf to the drama section at your local video store.  With Winona Ryder turning in yet another outstanding performance, and Jolie worthy of much of the praise that was bestowed upon her, I have to admit that the feel of this film was something akin to a made-for-tv flick that the networks might save for a sweeps month.Above average, but far from spectacular.  While the inevitable comparisons to CUCKOO'S NEST might intrigue otherwise uninterested parties to rent GIRL, INTERRUPTED, do not be encouraged. (TITANIC and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE both featured sinking ships, BUT...well, you get the idea.)For those individuals who were genuinely moved by this story, I would highly recommend reading the book upon which was it based.  If, like me, you were mildly disappointed, I would also recommend reading the book.

It's very well made, the cast is fantastic, the script is very real and I like everyday more and more because I have a borderline friend and there are days that I feel like I'm in the movie, with Susanna and Lisa. it's a movie that makes us think who are the REALLY insane ones: if those who are locked in there or if all of us, who think that are pretty normal with our perfect lives and all that? I have also read the book and, although the story is a bit different, I like the movie most. And I love the music playing when Lisa an Susanna find Daisy dead on the shower.

Good Story of a Disturbed Girl,"I thought this movie was based on a good and relatively touching story. Of course, it was difficult to identify oneself with the main characters, but it gave one a chance to concentrate on the psychology of the main characters, and hope that they would be explored further (which they weren't). I wouldn't watch this movie again, but as a one time experience, it was a decent flick. Ryder and Jolie gave excellent performances, Jolie being even better than Ryder.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good drama that tries a bit too hard in places,"This is a fine film. Entertaining, well-acted, but not flawless. It tries a bit too hard to be an Oscar contender when in all actuality it's not high-caliber material. Its 7.0/10 average on IMDb is closer to the score I'd give it than some of the critics who seemed to praise it when it came out. And although Angelina Jolie gives her best performance, it's still not Oscar-quality, and it's always going to be hard to buy an insane mental patient with huge fake lips and breasts. But oh well, that's Hollywood.Winona Ryder fits the part well. She's always given off dark vibes in all her films, ranging from ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and gives the impression that she's fascinated by death. So, a bit of wise casting there. I am not by any means a fan of Ryder's work (even here she is grating), but at least in ""Girl, Interrupted,"" that's sort of the point.Overall this is a good movie if you're looking for entertainment (based on) a true story. It's not a great movie and I don't think it deserved any Oscars but the acting is still rather good and it holds your interest.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Girl, Interrupted was excellent","This was a well-acted drama. It escaped the trap of becoming too melodramatic and causing the audience to feel uncomfortable by the ""acting out"" of emotions. The playfulness and the way the young women bond with one another is also excellent - the human spirit will prevail in any circumstances.I thought Brittany Murphy was the ""sleeper"" hit of the movie - her portrayal of a girl troubled by her incestuous relationship with her father and other elements of her terrible homelife while putting on a snobbish facade was amazing.I also became a fan of Clea DuVall (Georgina) through this movie. She portrayed a great balance of tough and vulnerable as well.It was haunting and heartbreaking, lovely, and disconcertingly familiar.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
More realistic than the average viewer might suppose,"Other reviews have described who plays whom, so I'll skip that. The patients Susanna encounters in this mental hospital ring true and the actresses portraying them do an excellent job. I'm speaking from experience here. The mental hospital environment created in this film is realistic for the era; I'm not sure how many are left that offer so much freedom as rewards for good behavior/improvement. I'm especially not sure a sociopath like Lisa would be housed in a ward where she could do so much psychological damage to patients who clearly are making some progress. In my experience, someone who is clearly unwilling to progress would've been in a more secure ward to protect the vulnerable patients. That's the bit that is unrealistic to me.Realism aside, I personally feel that Winona Ryder was robbed; she should have won the Oscar for her performance in this. Her character's confusion, intelligence, sensitivity and indecision, coming of age during a very turbulent era in America, was subtly and very honestly played. Susanna's main problem was confusion about her place in the world, and who she wants to be. Jolie has played over-the-top in so many roles that I found her more annoying than anything else here - just as Susanna did in her more lucid moments. I would've liked to see their roles reversed. I find Ryder capable of a broader acting range than Jolie, and she is very believable in this role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie,"Girl, Interrupted is a great movie. Angeliba Jolie has never been better. Winona Ryder, and Whoopi Goldberg are miscast.

Angela Bettis, Jared Leto, Vanessa Redgrave, Clea Duvall, Elisabeth Moss, Kurtwood Smith, and Joanna Kerns were great supporting actors. I think that Jessica Alba would have been a nice choice for Susanna; and Angela Bassett as Nurse Valerie. But, this movie was still great.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Passable,"OK movie based on a true story about a young woman who spent two years in an exclusive mental ward in MA. Sounds interesting and should be harrowing, but it isn't. All the characters are the same types we've seen in other movies like this in the past (The Bell Jar, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden). The plot makes escaping the ward laughably easy and makes a mental ward look kind of fun (and boring). All the characters talk in clichés and by the last hour of the movie I was ahead of the plot constantly. It gets dull when you know exactly what's going to happen. The acting is no help--Ryder used to be good. What's happened to her? She has basically one expression that she uses the whole movie. Whoppi Goldberg is VERY toned down and miserable (at least she looks it). Redgrave barely makes an impression as the head of the hospital. Only Jolie shows any spark of life. She's enjoying every second of her role and it shows. Unfortunately, she can't carry the whole movie. So it's OK but predictable. Worth a video rental (maybe). Great soundtrack though.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Good Chick Cuckoo's Nest,"Basically Angelina Jolie is the cool sociopath.  She has a lot of hurt inside of her and stuff and instead of dealing with it, she turns the women in Claymore's mental ward into a cool clique of girls.  The film portrays Winona Ryder's character sympathetically. She is borderline, thus she has casual sex and is depressed.  Everyone is trying to commit suicide in the film, and there are some scenes that are hard to watch. What is brilliant about the film is how it shows a mental asylum from the point of view of the patients.  Winona Ryder's eyes see the place as a College or University for the messed up.  But towards the end, she realizes she has problems and deals with them.  There are many good performances, even Whoopi is good.  This film should pick up some Oscar nominations, but no wins.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Flawed but still well-worth seeing,"I do agree with one reviewer about the fact that Lisa's sociopathic character would be very unlikely to break down at the end, but fortunately Angelina Jolie is so powerful and convincing that she makes us forget.  Her Oscar-winning performance is top-notch.  In fact, every one in the cast is superb, including the always brilliant and subtle Miss Redgrave.  Well worth seeing for the acting!

excellent!!!,"when I saw the trailer, I thought that it was a boring movie, but when I saw the movie, I think the it is one of the best movies I´ve seen. It´s original, it show you that sometimes the insane and crazy people is the most sane and sensible peoples.It´s and EXCELLENT movie!!!! and the performances are very very very good, in special Anjelina Jolie, her performance is excellent, one of the best I´ve seen, I think that she will win the Oscar.

"Girl, Interrupted","Winona Ryder is on great form here in this rather brutally frank look at a girl struggling with mental health issues. ""Susanna"" had been rushed to hospital by her worried parents after an apparent attempt at suicide. Diagnosed with a potential personality disorder, she is admitted to the ""Claymoore"" facility under the care of ""Dr. Wick"" (Vanessa Redgrave) and nurse ""Valerie"" (Whoopi Goldberg). As you'd expect, this place has a multitude of characters inside and she (and we) are introduced to a mixture ranging from the pathological liar to the anorexic, the sociopath to the schizophrenic. Some are friendlier to her, others ignore her altogether. It's ""Lisa"" (Angelina Jolie) whom she seems to relate to her best. She is a controlling character who swings between munificence and malevolence at the drop of an hat whilst giving the staff a constant stream of headaches. On the outside, her recently drafted boyfriend ""Tobias"" (Jared Leto) is trying to coax her to return to the outside world, but she seems to thrive on the institutionalised nature of her new life, addicted to it even. Gradually, though she begins to appreciate that ""Lisa"" is a toxic influence on her life - evidenced by a tragedy that really brings things home to her. The ensemble of patients - Clea Duvall, Brittany Murphy and Elizabeth Moss all work well with the sparingly appearing Goldberg and Redgrave to create a really affecting atmosphere here, but it's Jolie who delivers best with a career-defining effort as a creature that it's impossible to like but equally difficult not to feel sympathy for too. It's intensely scripted, occasionally funny and pretty perfectly paced and though not a easy watch, is certainly a powerful one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful!,"I was very impressed with this movie and I recommend that you all see it! Angelina Jolie was spectacular, I loved her almost careless attitude and how she mostly got her way out of fear.

self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy,"Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) ODs on aspirins and family friend Dr. Crumble convinces her to go to Claymoore Hospital. She's struggling to find herself as a writer and had a fling with her parents' married colleague. She's the only one in her '67 class not to go to college. She insists that she's didn't attempt suicide. Her roommate Georgina Tuskin (Clea DuVall) is a compulsive liar. Sweet Torch Clark (Elisabeth Moss) has burns on her face. Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) has food and daddy issues. The police returns escapee Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who is a whirlwind rebellious personality. Soon, Susanna realizes that this is not simply for a short rest. Her boyfriend Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto) gets drafted. Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) is the wise nurse in charge. Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) declares Susanna has borderline personality disorder. Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave) takes over her case with some big insights.Nurse Valerie calls Susanna ""a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy."" I disagree on the lazy part because she's trying very hard. However, much of the movie feels indulgent to me. Valerie tells Susanna that she's not really sick. The big surprise of the movie is that the mental hospital and its staff are not evil. They are mostly reasonable. Potts comes off a little clueless but Susanna is really just rebelling against her uptight parents and fighting against herself. That's not to say that this is an useless exercise. There are some good performances from the actresses. There is one great section with Ryder watching Jolie throw verbal bombs at Murphy. To me, that's the most impressive section of the movie. The final confrontation is a bit melodramatic. The movie should have wrapped up soon after the Jolie Murphy confrontations.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insanity Is No Rock 'n' Roll Fun,"This could have been a harmless feel - good girlie movie, had its makers not felt obliged to give serious issues such as mental health the Hollywood treatment -- hey, insanity isn't so bad, aren't we all a little crazy? And were not ""the Sixties"" just a time when parents were a little stern and long - haired hunks burnt their draft notes to a Jefferson Airplane soundtrack?If you believe that stuff, Girl, Interrupted is for you.

"Girls will like it, I guess","This chick-flick remake of One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest does not live up to the hype it is presented with.  It barely lives, but not completely.  It is supported by the two actresses- Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie (Jolie got an Oscar nod for her performance) who work great together as patients in a mental home in the late 60's.  Funny at points, dramatic (maybe too dramatic) and poignant, this film is good, but don't expect a Cukoo's nest. Why?  Because the main character Susanna (Ryder) doesn't hole the same embodyment and character that Jack Nicholson did.  Still, it isn't as bad a some people might make you think.  I'm sure guys who watch this film with their girlfriends will not be pleased by it, but their girls will be.  One of the best menatl home films ever, nevertheless.  A-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting 7 rated movie.,"The acting of Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder in this movie is fabulous!The story was just average. Not bad, but nothing special either. The acting is what made me give this movie a 7 rating.This movie also had a moment of racial propaganda to it that many modern films have. It was the moment when Martin Luther King's death is anounced on the television and all the white girls are setting there watching in sadness. It makes me cringe whenever the movie/media bosses use this ploy. They are obviously using the power of imagery to make me feel guilty or bad for being white. It did'nt work, and it never does!A solid 7 rated movie based on the performances of Jolie and Ryder.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Girl Interrupted flows uninterrupted!,Beautiful movie! one day i was thinking about making a movie in which mentally challenged people make a team and create synergy ...a few days later i happened to watch girl interrupted..it was similar to an extent to what i dreamed! Winona Ryder oozes warmth and shows why she is among the talented actress of her generation. i feel Winona Ryder has been under-utilized as an actor.Angelina Jolie gives her best performance till date and she can again do it if she gets a role where she doesn't overplay her sexuality. Performances by other actors is also commendable.The movie is enjoyable and scores heavily on the performances by the actors.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A strong, compelling drama, with a terrific cast","Not to generalize, but most books and movies that touch upon mental illness and psychiatric institutions fall under a single broad category of storytelling. The themes and ideas commonly explored are of how this field of medicine has been and is often weaponized as a tool of oppression against anyone (predominantly women and other marginalized groups) who in any way fails to conform to societal norms and values. People are and have been institutionalized as much to give them help as to hide them away and conceal the ""shame"" of heavily and wrongfully stigmatized conditions, to squash any manner of dissent, or to supposedly deter others from the same. While in this case these notions do somewhat serve as a foundation, juxtaposed with what is accepted as ""normal,"" it's noteworthy that 'Girl, interrupted' takes a different tack in its active narrative, largely focusing more on the bonds and community that form between patients. More to the point, this is a relatively infrequent example of such fare genuinely exploring mental illness and those who struggle with it, and that in itself helps the title to stand apart a little.I've been long overdue to see this, and have heard nothing but positive things all the while. Now that I've finally watched, I'm so very pleased with how good it is. The story is well balanced between weighty drama, underhanded commentary, and tinges of comedy, and deftly shifts between such moods in turn. I can't speak to Susanna Kaysen's memoir, being unfamiliar, but filmmaker James Mangold, and co-writers Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, have whipped up a rich, engaging, satisfying narrative. Characters are complicated, relatable, and sympathetic; dialogue is harsh and real, just as scenes of any given tone are vivid and engrossing even from one to the next. Content warnings are very necessary not just for the subject matter at large but for frank discussion or depiction of drug use, self-harm, suicide, and sexual abuse, not to mention ableism, bullying, and abject cruelty. These are part and parcel of the tale on hand, however, and for as ugly and heartbreaking as it gets, that completeness makes it all the more well-rounded and rewarding for those who are able to parlay with such material.The writing is the most crucial facet of the picture, but this is an utter joy as a viewer in so many other ways - not least the exceptional acting. It's truly an extraordinary cast that was assembled here, a veritable who's who of recognizable names and faces, and the cast give outstanding performances across the board. It's no wonder that Angelina Jolie received such acclaim for her supporting part, for this might actually be the best show of her skills we've gotten in her storied career. Yet she's easily matched by Winona Ryder, and I can only agree with the contemporary view that she got robbed of deserved awards. This is to say nothing of Clea DuVall, Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave, Angela Bettis, Elisabeth Moss, and many others who show so very much what they're capable of; how the ensemble didn't receive still more attention, I really don't know. Meanwhile, though Mangold has gone on to achieve significant esteem in his own right, especially with 2017's 'Logan,' here he also demonstrates tremendously mindful direction that always serves the great impact that any given shot or scene should carry. The precise orchestration of a moment, and shot composition, can make a big difference in how it comes off, and even this early in his career Mangold shows keen intelligence in this regard.And of course 'Girl, interrupted' is gratifyingly well done in every other regard, not least Kevin Tent's fine editing and the stirring complementary score of Mychael Danna. To be honest, if there are any particular faults to come to mind, I would argue that writing in the last act becomes slightly heavy-handed in a couple key scenes, and frankly a little gauche and maudlin for the fact of it. I'm no writer and I can't say how the matter could have been rectified, but it's noticeable in comparison to how the rest of the feature presents. Still, by every other measure this is terrific - absorbing, and fostering earnest emotional investment, and deeply meaningful. Whatever imperfections one may cite are quite outshine by the excellence the film otherwise represents; its reputation is well deserved. It bears repeating that there are difficult topics broached as part of the narrative, and one should be aware of these before watching. Provided this is no obstacle, however, ultimately this is so strong and worthy a movie that I'd have no qualms recommending it to just about anyone. More than twenty years later 'Girl, interrupted' continues to stand tall and hold up, and if one has the chance to watch, this is well worth one's time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sanity is a tenuous state,"Angelina Jolie does a tremendous job portraying an agressively mentally ill patient.  Her performance reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cucukoo's Nest. Wynona Rider is fragile enough to fall under the stronger girls domination, but when she learns to stand up to her the whole course of the movie changes. Not since the classic Snake Pit have a seen a movie that showed what its like to be inside a mental institution.Great movie- a little hard to watch when Jolie's character is browbeating the weaker girls.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The teen-bopper's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""","Renting this movie, I was expecting the typical nutcase/heart warmer and that about sums it up. Ryder has once again failed to take over the movie and keeps her name on my list of underachievers in Hollywood. Jolie takes over as psycho-Lisa and while the rest of the characters are believable, you don't really get to learn about any of them except Daisy, who is out of the joint before the halfway point. I still don't understand the relationship between Susanna(Ryder) and her parents. ""Don't worry mom/dad, I'll just forget that you led me to the nuthouse and didn't even drop me off, but paid a taxi"". For a self-rightous woman, Susanna gave in pretty easily into signing the papers getting her into the clinic. Overall, the movie was alright, but didn't seem to want to find an ending. Plus, the ending seems to be done quickly and actually becomes only the 2nd in what could be 3 different endings in the movie.

Interrupted?,"Interesting beginning, enjoyable movie to watch. At the beginning we get to know Susanna's past and problems. It was hard to separate fact from fiction. Then the action calms down, it can be boring at times, but all this diversifies the character of Lisa. Amazing Angelina Jolie's performance, she really nailed it. Interesting plot development and relationship development. A bond develops between Suzie and Lisa. I think they loved each other. I don't know how much or how, but it was love. They cared about each other. No special shots, but the movie is okay, It's a classic. The movie that girls in mental institutions are people too. It shows what they have to struggle with, shows the duplicity of their feelings and thoughts. How unpredictable these people can be, but also dangerous, despite being ""normal"".

"Tragic and funny, a great movie!","I just saw Girl, Interrupted in theaters a few days ago and was just completely taken by it. It was funny, depressing, and scary, but also managed to have a semi-good ending.The most interesting character was, of course, Lisa. I think Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job playing that part. One of the things I liked best about the movie was the ending where Susanna confronts Lisa. It shows Lisa may not be dead inside after all.The relationship between Susanna and Lisa is a very special one, a sacred one. Their friendship was also one of the things I really liked about the movie.I also liked the characters, Susanna, Nurse Valerie, and Dr. Wick. Georgina and Polly were especially sweet and I felt bad for them when they heard what Susanna wrote about them in her notebook. And Daisy was just... beyond the point of no return. I felt very sorry for her, but I don't think she could have been helped.This was an excellent movie and I would recommend it to all my friends and neighbors.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doubts...,"It's difficult to judge about films like this. First of all, because if you're child of 90's it's hard to totally feel what life was like in 60's. And then, it's necessary to read the origin-the book and i didn't. But anyway..This one deals with a lot of questions-social intentions and mental institutions, friendship and loneliness, suicide,absence of emotions and feelings and depression, life and death. It's rather close to me because someday I had feelings close to those that Susanna had. And still I'm not satisfied with the world around just like her. But I have the will to fight!In my teenage years I thought that this was the story about unhappy, depressed and lonely people belonging to the generation ""we are going nowhere"" who are seeking the way out of it all. Now I realize that they're no more than crazy ones who couldn't deal with their problems themselves. While watching the movie we're trying to identify the strong and the weak ones in the story but actually everyone is weak there. If mental institution becomes your home because you got nowhere to go-this is not your misfortune,it's your fault. The world is s**t and your life totally s***s-yeah, I got the point. But why do you have to go to the clinic to make it better? What for do they show the world their unhappiness? Just to increase their popularity?The explanation lies beneath-this is the story of the woman and about the women-just like the one in ""Virgin suicides"". That one is much darker because there the girls loved death more than everything. Here they don't love anything at all. The similarity is that in both movies the heroes are absolutely powerless against everything-and that is very,very strange.It's all only my opinion. Life differs, and people differ too. That is why I kinda enjoyed this one and watched it just to get an experience and to think over all the important things of our life..and death.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The only problem I have is Winona Ryder's speech at the end. Compared to the acting in the rest of the movie that section just seems so fake. I loved all the work done in this movie.

Not the first choice for a mental illness movie yet worth watching,"1999 movie based on a 1993 best-selling book with the same name written by Susanna Kaysen, This is an autobiography about her own experience with mental illness.This movie stars Winona Ryder known for other roles like Edward scissorhands and the well-known series stranger things. Co-star Angelina Jolie as Lisa Rowe and the handmaid's tale star Elisabeth moss as the role polly 'Torch' clark
This movie is filmed inside the mental institution for most of its scenes, its a mixture of drama/psychology that happens during the year 1967 about a girl who commits suicide and is admitted to claymore mental institution. This movie, not like any other movies that usually deals with the corruption inside the mental institutions, it reflects the feelings and the issues that happens to a girl who seems normal to any one of us but is on the edge of completely losing control of her personality. This is one of the very first movies that discussed Borderline personality disorder which was new at that time in the 60s and is still new now because it's the disease of the 'normal'. In med school we studied this disorder in psychiatry which is a deviation of everyday's personalities, in fact, we all can be diseased, this disorder is classified into three clusters, Cluster A as odd, eccentric, Cluster B as dramatic, overly emotional, and Cluster C as anxious, fearful etc..
One of the main flaws of this movie is that it never explained the disease which if you have never heard of it you would come out of the movie with zero addition. This movie discussed other characters with other disorders and yet none of them was explained. Another flaw is the poor lighting in the movie while during the movie you think its a movie made in the 70s due to the poor quality, this poor lighting could be a way to put you in the mood of the institution but still its not appealing.This movie for a whole two hours puts you in this emotional rollercoaster where you for half of the movie don't know whether to support admitting her into the institution or if the parents are just taking the easy way to try not to deal with their teenager troubles.This is the kind of movie thats going to make you cry and yet gives you hope for a change.This movie has been awarded quite a lot of nominations and won the joker prize academy awards for best supporting actress for the great performance of Angelina Jolie, she acted out the role quite surreal with almost no makeup. In my opinion, she always knew how to show how she is feeling even with no words, you can tell the struggle of a sociopath can feel and how she breaks when she loses control over the kingdom she built in the institution and the followers who she manipulated with her charisma, and thats one of the best demonstrations you will see. Yet I believe that Winona Ryder performed two of the best scenes ever that gave this movie its appeal, she was credited with the critics words but with no nominations, everyone's eyes were on Angelina Jolie.Apart from the actors and the story, in my personal opinion the best thing I liked about this movie is the starting and the ending, the opening instantly grabbed your attention and its the main thing that kept you going through the whole movie regarding it can bore you out for a while with the repeated scenes that brought no change until almost the time they escaped the institution.Directed by James mangold also known for Ford Vs Ferrari and Logan, an excellent director has a smooth way to walk you throughout the story which can be noted in most of his movies.This movie is rated for 7.3/10 which I believe can be quite good for only 6.8-7/10 as a personal opinion.If I'm recommending a movie that deals with mental illness I wouldn't recommend this as a first choice but its a movie worth watching since its a true story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clea Duval Brittney Murphy Elizabeth Moss are all brilliantly Believable in their roles.

Something Pretentious People Will Never Understand,"I have read the good reviews and the bad reviews. So far all the bad reviews reveal that people really don't understand anything about MI (Mental Illness).I think this movie is very successful in bringing out the reality of how difficult it is to live with a condition that so very few people understand. Just like the reviews the movie got, people who are different are being judged by these pretentious people who think they're better than everybody else.I have had my share of time in a similar place but in a smaller hospital. I have made friends there and I know what it's like to be going out and missing them but of course, who wants to stay in there? I know depression when I see it and I can smell it 500 miles away. This movie brought me to tears because the emotions are spot on. I feel like they've read my journal. Well of course, they've read Sussana's and she produced it. I don't have BPD, I have a different diagnosis but I can relate to this very well.Apparently, one person's attempt to make people understand what this is has not worked despite the great acting and the realism of it all. People are just blind I guess. Or perhaps it's true that unless you've experienced it, you will never understand. So try to walk even just a day in those shoes, then tell us what you think.The only thing that I'm not completely satisfied with is the ending. I mean, I know the title is Girl, Interrupted but it feels like they interrupted the ending as well. They didn't quite give any answers really and it's a little frustrating cause I expected it to give a little more light than just focusing on memoirs.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Fell over this Cuckoo's Nest.,"Girl, Interrupted:  Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) has the distinction of being the only student in her graduating class with no post secondary plans - unless of course you count her desire to be a writer.  Her middle-class-cocktail-party-throwing-parents are mortified with the shiftless abomination they've raised, and make no attempt to hide their contempt.  When Susanna tries to cure a headache by swallowing a bottle of aspirin chased with a bottle of Vodka, she is sent to think things over in a sanitarium.  While there she meets the requisite cast of miscreants, malcontents, and maladjusted mental patients found in every asylum (at least in film).Ryder is cast against type, stretching her talents to the limit in her portrayal as the dispossessed young woman whose bleak worldview is tempered only by her self-loathing.  It is a refreshing departure from her roles in such feel-good films as ""Heathers"" and ""Reality Bites"".  All kidding aside, this character was tailor-made for Ryder (she has a personal understanding of the subject matter having checked herself into a clinic at age 20 to deal with her anxiety), who was single-handedly responsible for bringing this story to the screen.  That is what makes her soulless, drawn, portrayal so disappointing. She spends the bulk of the film wandering about wide-eyed, confused, and virtually devoid of any emotion.  The film is not a complete waste however.Once again Angelina Jolie manages to rise above the material she has to work with (""Playing God"" notwithstanding).  As Lisa she is prone to wild mood swings whether drug induced or natural.  A talented manipulator, she gets what she wants, by whatever means necessary.  Though Lisa is crazy, she always manages to keep her dignity, and Jolie never lets her become a caricature.  My only complaint is Lisa's epiphany near the end of the film - it is too contrived (I blame that on the writers, not Jolie).Miss it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Audience, Bored","There are some people out there who might like Girl, Interrupted, the latest Winona Ryder movie.  Those people, most of them women, will identify with the soul-paralyzing apathy of the lead character, Susanna (Ryder).  Her descent into an emotionally barren life of empty drudgery is actually based on the autobiography of Susanna Kaysen; her book chronicles the days of her life in the 60's.  Being a true story, very little happens, as most real people lead brain-bleedingly dull lives.  Aside from some angst-ridden whining by Susanna, and her occasional ""adventurous"" tryst with bad-girl antagonist Lisa, this movie still has the same dull heartbeat as many of its doped-up and drooling extras.Add to the fact that Lisa, the crazy, wild, exhilarating rebel inmate, is played by Angelina ""inflate lips to 40 psi"" Jolie, who is not one of my favorite actresses, as some of you know.Ryder did a good job.  With a role as self-indulgent as any lead character is in a drama about an emotional journey to self-acceptance, Winona still managed to keep the character fresh without dabbling in any pandering. Jolie, though.  Let me tell you.Writers like to create crazy characters, by crazy I mean they do all the things we all want to do but don't, and so we don't think they're crazy, but cool and reckless and lonely and wild and sassy.  Hence, we are supposed to like the crazy character, learn a little bit about ourselves, and go home happy.  Jolie's portrayal fails on all three counts, despite fitting the Hollywood stereotype to a T.  Enacting out her cool, textbook version of insane, Jolie sucks all the life out of this film from the word go.  Not that there's much to begin with.The first quarter of the movie is interesting to watch, only insomuch as it seems to be highly derivative of Vonnegut.  Susanna seems to be ""unstuck in time"" as it were, and events in her life are depicted out of proper context. The suggestion is that Susanna is drifting back and forth between different events.  She's the new millennium's Billy Pilgrim, except this version is written by Nora Ephron.Well, not really, but that's what it seems like.The poignancy of the story, its heart and strength, is lost in dull, poetic self-absorption.  It's akin to reading a romantically jilted younger sister's diary; there's so much angst, so much pain, and you really do want to feel sorry for her.  But then you get to an original poem and the first line is ""Darkness fills my empty heart,"" and you guffaw out loud.  Admit it. You do.Of all the things going for this film--beautiful cinematography, some decent acting, rich subject matter, and even Whoopi Goldberg (turning in an excellent performance as Nurse Valerie)--it is anchored down by an immovable plot and mindless meandering.  It would make a good Lifetime original miniseries, but not much more.And plus there's ol' fish lips Jolie.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
This film suffers from borderline good-movie disorder.,"Nicely told yet unimpressive tale of Susanna, an 18-year-old who adapts to a new life in an all-girl mental institution after attempting suicide via aspirin/vodka (""I had a headache!"").  Angelina Jolie plays Lisa Rowe, the asylum's most infamous bigshot patient, and soon both her and the main character (Ryder) scheme to escape from the confines of the hospital. Although they are great actresses, far too much screen time was given to Ryder and Jolie.  So much so, that when something happens to the secondary characters we don't know enough about them to really care.  This was an OK film, but the book was probably much better.

Life Interrupted - Superb Acting,"The films shows how youth and teenagers could be really misunderstood winning a ""free ticket"" to a psychiatric hospital.Selfishness?, comfortableness? What is the role of the family and the society in these cases?The ghosts of the past and the quicksand of the shadows of a young girl, Susanna, evaluated with a ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" and obliged to be jailed in a very famous American rich-hospital for an undefined period of time. The effect is a big lack of self confidence together with major communication problems and relationship instability probably due to her environment: family, friends and plastic superficial life. Her life is very much detailed in several flashbacks that show the real ""sixties"" atmosphere.Is a sad and worrying film with a very little hope which reached the top when Susanna quits the Hospital and their colleagues stay in as well as when Susanna's diary is disclosed.James Mangold's direction hand is magical with an excellent editing.

A film that is beautifully feminine but also so embracing of life itself as a metaphor.,"What seems like a beautifully feminine film in the way that it gets into the head of the protagonist, ends up soon becoming a metaphor for life itself. For anyone who experiences very high highs and Low lows. For anyone termed crazy. It may be your film school that you never really want to leave, or being a writer to move onto a director because all you were taught was to write, it may be any club that you ideally shouldn't or don't really need to be a part of, this film shows you a way. A way of reentry into life. Gorgeous. One of my ten best films. Ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not bad movie to see it maybe one, but nothing more","Greetings from Lithuania.""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999) is not a ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in its quality, nor in anything. And that is the movie that i was constantly reminded when watching ""Girl, Interrupted"". What i also did not bought for a second when watching ""Girl"" is its time of setting, 60's. It never felt like it was 60's and i think that set design failed in this regards.Good thing about this movie was Angelina's performance which was a flashy one for a movie and it was pretty good, but even from here i saw way better performances later in her carrier for which she did not win Oscars. Also there are some touching scenes near the end, but it plays more like melodrama. Winona Ryder's performance also was nothing to write home about.Overall, i was expecting more from ""Girl, Interrupted"". Its not a bad movie by any means, its just that it does not set out to make something memorable, and at the end of the day you will forget about this melodrama very soon after seeing it. OK movie to see it once when there is nothing else to watch, but unfortunately nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"movie, interrupted but still good","I just saw Girl, Interrupted over its wide release opening weekend. I was going in expecting a good movie and that is just what I got. I'm not exactly sure how structurely good it is since it starts near the end, goes to the beginning, has multiple flashbacks for the first half hour and then stops and continues with a chronological narrative. However, other then that small annoyance, the film is a poignant, funny, sad, and memorable piece of film making. Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie are exceptional. Another stand out performance is by Brittany Murphy who plays Daisy, she does a great job. I highly recommend you see this very good movie that also happens to be based on a true story making it all the more touching.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Psychosis in young woman's mind,"In the midst of the complicated, messy, turmoil filled young woman's life, she has a hate for herself and her life unsure of who she is she begins to fall into a state of psychosis .

Winona fits this role so perfectly she captures the eccentric far-out lost feeling all young people have once felt at a cross roads of who they are supposed to be. I think that the reason I have so much love for this film is the cross road that Angelina Jollie portrays.

two outstanding actresses,"Girl, Interrupted is the engrossing true-life story of Susannsa Kaysen and her time in a mental hospital in the 60's. Winona Ryder, a very beautiful and talented lady, stars as Kaysen. This is probably the best role of her career, although Angelina Jolie has gotten most of the press for her Oscar win. Jolie is electrifying in this movie. She is a great actress and will likely win more Oscars in the future.It is thrilling to watch these 2 together on screen. They are probably the best actresses of their generation and have a nice chemistry in this film. I hope they work together again.

I am very disappointed.,"Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, strong actresses getting better.  A fantastic memoir by Susanna Kaysen.  Put them together for a movie, must be a great idea.  Unfortunately, the script writers butchered the book, twisting reality and dropping the symbolism that makes the original book so powerful.  Every place the movie strays from the book is a disaster, reducing the powerful issues involved to simplistic explanations and low-IQ analyses of mental illness.  What should have been an enthralling and moving tale of mental illness and a woman's struggle to find her identity in a world of turmoil becomes a dull, cliched retelling of people being locked in mental institutions.I wonder if voters who rate the movie highly have read the book.  Also, I wonder if any of them realize how cruelly the movie makers played with their emotions in cheap, simple ways without investing the movie with any significant depth and character.  I wish I had waited to rent it.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ryder shines.,"An outrageously flawless performance from the lovely Winona Ryder highlights this interesting, though sometimes tedious film. Some if it felt really out of place but for the most part it was a compelling story. Not entirely unique and with a load of cliché characters and scenes, it still found ways to keep drawing me in and focusing on the plot. As I said before, Ryder is phenomenal in one of my favorite female performances of the decade and is surely my win for the year. Her range and emotional intensity is flawless. I found that her character was extremely easy for me to relate to and that made her performance that much more emotional for me. Jolie was also great and deserved her win, though I give it to Bonham Carter.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie was very interesting. It covered a lot of topics on mental illness which most movies get wrong. Some parts of the movie were confusing, but it was an overall good watch.

In other words, the kind of movie that my better half likes.  Girl, Interrupted lived entirely up to my expectations. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest it ain't.  Introspective girl, tough girl, shy girl, lesbian girl, and molested girl were all represented.  The saving grace for me was that it was on videotape, so I wasn't trapped in a movie theater for almost two hours.  From the looks of most of the reviews for this movie, I can tell that I am in the minority.  I'm wondering if I saw a different version than everybody else.  What I halfway watched was no better than a boring tv movie of the week.  2/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Good drama,"Not having had any mental issues myself nor having had a close relationship with anyone suffering such issues, I can't speak for how realistic a presentation of such this movie is. I can, being a teenager and having had a few good friends who are also teenagers, confirm that many of us do think about suicide every now and again. I think this movie was a good idea. It's good that there are movies that can show people how mental issues are, and how it is to spend time at a hospital, supposedly being treated for them. Now, I still can't verify the level of truth involved in the story in this film, but as far as I understand, it's based on a book, and I've been told that it's a fairly good adaption, too. The plot is good, it moves back and forth between different situations and times, especially in the beginning, and I think this was a pretty good way to show how you see the world if you have a mental sickness, and, as far as I know, that's a very precise way to depict it. The acting is great, each of the cast members do a good, convincing job of portraying their respective characters. The characters are well-written, credible and real. They are all sufficiently different both in behavior and in which mental illness they suffer. A pretty good drama, that will most likely appeal to any teenager who's ever thought about or seriously considered suicide. I recommend this to fans of dramas, people who the subject appeals to, either on a personal or professional level, and every single teenager out there who feels they are alone in feeling bad. I can imagine that it will affect them greatly. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"small story, great acting",The only good reason to see this movie are its characters. (In fact this is a VERY good reason.) Mangold portrays a group of truly interesting women and his cast does an excellent job in bringing them to life. Jolie's Oscar was well deserved. Unfortunately the film lacks a consistent storyline which would have given its characters some room for development. What you see throughout the two hours feels more like the episodes of a - really good - TV show. But even with that flaw this is still a very recommendable movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I loved it:  One Giant Leap for Womankind,"Angelina Jolie was absolutely incredible.  She was so believable as Lisa. The rest of the cast did a phenomenal job as well.  As for Winona, I have a new-found respect for her.  What an excellent job.  I admire her not only for her wonderful acting, but for stepping back to play the role of Susanna rather than Lisa, because the role of Lisa seems to be a more appealing role for an actress.  Lisa is the focus, while the story is depicted from Susanna's point of view.  Winona has redeemed herself in my eyes with incredible work:  her acting, her taking the role of Susanna, for finally making a mostly-female casted movie, and for making it a must see.  We haven't seen a female-dominated movie since League of Their Own.  Well, well, well done, girls.  Every one of you has my utmost respect.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I used to love this,"So I grew up in the 90's and I used to LOVE this movie and aspire to be just as beautifully forlorn as Winona or as sorrowfully rebellious as Angie. Even as aggressively mysterious as Brittany Murphy (God rest her soul). Yes, I was a goth. Watched it again now, 20 years later, during which time I myself have been an inpatient at a mental hospital for some periods of time. And all I see now are just a couple of young women behaving like spoiled brats in a setting where other people are trying to deal with very real medical problems. It's so disrespectful and immature. It's absolutely fine to feel bad, have anxiety, feel depressed and even suicidal. Even running away is quite understandable if you're being held against your will. However it's not OK to be mean or rude to other patients or staff. Lisa is not cool. She's just a mean girl. Susanna is not cool. Her racist rant towards the head nurse is extremely off-putting. If someone on my ward would have acted like those girls I would have given them a good talking-to. I want to give it 1 star but getting 4 for nostalgic reasons. The book isn't much better either. Do not recommend.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Memorable performances,"This film is about a young girl's unforgettable acquaintances after she got put into a psychiatric hospital.This film is stunning on many levels. Angelina Jolie hits it perfect as an antisocial person. She really has that charisma of being a rebellious leader, and yet she does not do it over the top. The acting by many actors is superb. It shows that they really did research on their characters and the diseases they suffer from, and portray them convincingly.The plot is great because it really highlights the interpersonal relationships inside the mental hospital. There is love, hate, jealousy, envy, respect, anxiety, happiness and despair. Almost every emotion a human being can feel is portrayed.This is a good film that you will remember for months to come.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Outstanding acting, but story comes up a little short","Girl Interrupted' suffers from comparisons with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', perhaps a bit unfairly since they were different kinds of stories. Possibly the reason for this is that the story presented like Cuckoo Lite. This story begged for some character development, especially of Lisa.  It is essentially a slice of life film.  There was no real plot, just a succession of incidents at the institution.For a slice of life film to be successful, there must be character development or situations that are so unique and fascinating that they compensate for the story's lacking a plotline.  In Cuckoo's Nest' despite having little character development, the situations were intense and Jack Nicholson commanded our attention in every frame.  G.I. fell short in both areas.  It was unquestionably an interesting character study of both Suzanna (Winona Ryder) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), but the flashbacks of Suzanna's life were too sketchy to provide much insight into the problems with which she struggled, and Lisa's past was a total mystery.  Though Jolie's performance was truly outstanding, as was Ryder's, together they failed to create a performance strong enough to compensate for what the story lacked.Director James Mangold gets credit for a story sensitively told and his direction of the actors was excellent.  This was generally a very well acted film.  Angelina Jolie continues to impress in difficult and gutsy roles. She is a very gritty performer and is fantastic at pouring out raw emotion with no holds barred.  Hopefully this performance will help her emerge from the shadows of supporting actor to land the lead she deserves.Wynona Ryder delivered another mature and powerful performance.  She is quite accomplished at playing complex and tormented characters.  One day, I would love to see her in something that departs from her accustomed dour roles.  While watching the featurette included on the DVD, I noticed she actually does possess a genuinely happy smile.  It occurred to me at that moment that this was the first time I'd seen it.  The only smile she ever gets a chance to use in character is her wounded smile.I rated this film a 7/10.  Overall, this film gives us two great performances, but comes up a little short in the presentation of the story. It is not an overwhelming film, but it's definitely worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Demons mingle with memories that hide within.,"Not exposing. Not alarming. But a disturbing and well acted drama. This movie is based on the memoirs of an eighteen year old young woman confined to a psychiatric hospital in the mid 60s.Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, who was put in a mental ward, because her parents felt she was lifeless and had no aspirations. She would over dose on aspirin in hopes of dulling the headaches caused by not feeling part of any particular social loop.Ryder proves her talents in this role. Her expressions make up for the script that sometimes comes up laking. The movie though is stolen away from Miss Rider by co-star Angelina Jolie. Jolie plays a tough, raw and seductive psychotic mainstay in the asylum. The give and take relationship developing among a circle of patients is carefully recorded in Kaysen's journal. Kaysen manages to come to grips with reality and is deemed ready to join the outside 'normal' world.There are a few, brief comical moments; but the movie is big time depressing. It is interesting enough to make you want to pick up a copy of the book.Whoopi Goldberg actually surprised me. Her role as nurse Valerie was very good. This I feel is her best role to date, even beating out her part in GHOST. Also in the cast are Jeffrey Tambor and Joanna Kerns. Take the time to see this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Psychiatric Hospital Stay Without Shock Treatment!,"""Girl, Interrupted"" is the true story about Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder) and her time in Claymoore Psychiatric Hospital. It was the 60's, a lot was going on, and Susanna tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin chased by vodka. She was subsequently committed to Claymoore where she met a group of girls with varying problems.The first thing of note is that this isn't a scary movie nor is it a thriller. I say that because in scary movies and thrillers psychiatric hospitals are where people go to be mistreated by quacks and frequently injected with sedatives or given shock treatment as a matter of course. In such genres the doctors never care about their patients, they're just there to babysit or worse.I'm not a fan of Winona Ryder and this movie didn't make me one either. That's not to say the movie was bad, I just think it could've been a lot better without her.

IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY. You'll figure it out. Working on a better mental health is absolutely normal.,"The movie made me realise 2 important things.
1) Everybody tries to portray an image of themselves, but on the inside, the portrayal is just a mirror of their hidden wounds accumulated over time.
2) Unless you stand in front of the mirror and confront your inner self, the battle for a better mental health continues.The movie being based on the memoir written by the author during her stay at a mental institution, excels in bringing out the purest human emotions. After being sent to the institution for trying to end her life (which she denies initially saying that she took the bottle of aspirin to fight a headache), she is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (which I think everybody copes with to an extent).Beautiful characters, their struggle, the way people around then make them happy or sad, is all rawly captured. You definitely feel like you are witnessing their journey along with them. The music is captivating. The subtle acting by Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie keeps you wanting for more.Finally, it explains well that no matter the other's influence to change us, we need to make a genuine effort to change ourselves for the better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winona's best performance,"I find it hard to comment on this film, since it didn't leave any lasting impression on me. This true story has some good points about life and how to live it, but the movie is often pretty bland and not very engaging. Winona Ryder performs like she's never have before, though, and I for one think she outshines Jolie by several lux. I imagined the hospital to be a lot crueler and ""Cuckoo's Nest""-like, with a Ratched to act as villain, so I was surprised when it turned out actually pretty nice.

Faultless study of Mental Care in 60's America,"It is not often I feel I must give 10/10 for a movie, but this is one film I think anybody would be happy to make an exception for. It has gained much by its imaginative casting: Ryder as the new patient with Borderline depression; Jolie as a long time sufferer; Goldberg as the sympathetic but strict care home employee who tries to guide Ryder out of her psychosis.
Of course Jolie steals the show as a long time sufferer who bosses all the inmates including new girl Ryder, and she looks and acts like a true mad woman. Ryder is tempted to indulge her borderline psychosis until a terrible tragedy reshapes her perception of the care home and its inmates. What makes the movie ultimately so touching is the wonderful bond between all the girls who have very different mental health issues, and it many ways this film is completely relevant to the issues of today when mental health is becoming a huge worry for countries everywhere.
Pacing, camera work and scripting are all first rate with no weak links anywhere. No wonder it picked up so many well deserved awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Plot, Interrupted","Over the years I seem to have developed a certain suspicion of movies that advertise themselves as ""emotional"", ""touching"", etc.  The problem is that these movies are very phony; any semblance of human depth and true emotion only comes through in cliches and worn out plot devices.I immediately understood the direction that the film was going to take when a suicide is announced early in the film.  Unfortunately most of us have had some sort of experience with suicide at some point of our lives, it is a thing that scars us, or at least haunts us for some time.  In the film, however, little is revealed about the girl who killed herself; it's obvious the filmmakers are just looking for a quick emotion shot, throwing around a suicide just to create some sort of dreary, mental hospital atmosphere that is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the film.  On paper, it all looks very calculated and laid out, in the film, it just doesn't work.Spontaneity lacks, of course, when director and screenwriter allow plot to succumb to trick and tactic.  As the movie moves into the middle to last acts, it lags horribly, and to shake things up another suicide is presented, this time in much more gruesome fashion.  However, I found the dead girl's personality just too much of a cliche and lacking in any real depth to care for her.  Again the filmmakers insult the audience's intelligence.To top it off, the ending is a cartoon ending, where everyone stands around laughing.  Poor, poor, poor.  The plot goes nowhere, we learn nothing about the cardboard characters presented, and to my dismay I swear that a part of the soundtrack rips off from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (maybe I'm imagining it).Another failed ""chick-flick"".6 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Slightly sentimental towards the end but well controlled and involving,"After an apparent suicide attempt, Susanna meets with a physiatrist friend of the family who tells her she should go to the local mental institution. She signs herself in but soon after realises the enormity of what she has done  however she cannot leave until they let her go.  An outsider at first she soon befriends the aggressive Lisa and tries to come to terms with the institute around her.Despite being an Oscar winner I felt no great compulsion to check this film out at the time of it's release  I'm not sure why, perhaps I was put off by the (unfair) claim of it being a `female Cuckoo's Nest'.  However by and large it was my loss as much of this film is good.  The plot's central message that these people are just `normal' people exaggerated is OK and not too sentimentally delivered.  The film is not quite as moving as I felt it should be though  it went just where you expected it to and feel into too many clichéd moments and moments that do touch on the syrupy.  However it is interesting enough to overcome these obstacles and makes for a good watch.The cast is the main reason for watching.  Ryder is a little too wide eyed for my liking but still does a very good job (and her opening lines about stealing are very funny in retrospect!).  However the real scene-stealer is Jolie who brings a realistic energy to the film.  When she is off screen you really feel her loss as the film does dip a little into sentiment. Goldberg's character is the weak link as much of the sentimentality comes from her direction, she walks around with her assured smug air and you just know she's going to bond and hug with somebody.  Murphy, DuVall and Moss all do well in support (although I found Moss a little too sing-songy). Redgrave, Tamborand and Leto give small roles but good support as well.Overall this is not as good a film as Cuckoo's Nest but I think the comparisons are perhaps a little simplistic and unfair.  As it is this is a good film that only loses it a little at the end where it tips into a bit of preaching and sentimentality.  I think it bothered me more than it should because I know Mangold can control this aspect well as he did excellently in Heavy.  But these are minor complaints and it is involving and has a two strong performances in the lead.",,Anonymous,Biography

It's a surprisingly warm, human portrayal of psychiatric care as everyone including the staff are just doing their best, unlike other film portrayals that are more nightmarish. The crux of the film is while Susanna and the others have psychiatric disorders, they aren't really ""crazy"", they're just very affected by the world around them in a way that's relatable to us. They befriend each other as equals despite their quirks, though the film is realistic enough to show just how horrifying Lisa is, and it's not all idealistic about her character. However, the ending of the film was too melodramatic and wrapped up too neatly.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sometimes we just need clarity of vision.,"Girl Interrupted takes us on a journey into the lives of approximately 6 young women who are coping with differing mental illnesses in a mental facility.Their illnesses are magnified by the uncertain times of the 60's, which the film time-line is set in. The Vietnam war, the struggles of the gender wars of the times, along with so many other issues that the 60's brought about are focused upon as well. Susanna (Ryder) and Lisa (Jolie) our main characters, along with a small group of others make it easy for us to bond with, and have strong ideals of how we want their lives to turn out.Jolie has once again proved she sets herself apart from other actresses, as she takes hold of this character and nails it. She is a delicious sociopath. She uses and owns the ward. Ryder also does a good job with her character.I believe that Ryder was a very confused young woman, she took the 60's hard, her feelings ruled her. She had to find a purpose for her life in order to get past the block she was facing in her life. She is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.Although the group of women bonded, and they could help each other out by listening, they could not heal each other. Ryder soon learned that in order to heal and get out of the hospital was to work on herself. She needed to turn all her feelings into something constructive. She needed to stop hiding from what she fears. After a traumatic experience, and seeing Jolie for what she really was inside, she began to work on her recovery. She saw that Jolie was not the answer to getting out of the hospital.There are many great scenes in the movie, the movie did a good job of depicting a mental facility in the 60's. Well at least for those with money. The only real staff member that you meet and have feelings for one way or another is Goldberg (nurse Owens) who did a good job, I enjoyed the way she tried to help the young women in her own way.All in all I would say this movie was great. There was not a moment when I didn't identify with at least one or more of the characters. The actors kept you enticed.There were a lot of cut scenes, flashbacks, but I honestly didn't mind them, they were understandable and not confusing as so many films seem to be.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winona's Show All the Way,"Angelina Jolie took home best supporting actress for a showy role as a troublemaking sociopath in a late 1960s mental hospital, but it is Wynona Rider who turns in a great performance in the lead role.

"Maybe I was just crazy, maybe it was the 60's.","In ""Girl, Interrupted"" James Mangold, who evidently takes inspiration from the cult ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" by Forman, succeeds, telling the true story of Susanna Kaysen and her 18-month imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital, to describe in a more than accurate way a fresco of the society of the 60s, with all its prejudices and its social dynamics, as well as the growing need of young people to free themselves from these ones and trace their own path. All this is narrated through the filter of Susanna (W. Ryder), a depressed, lost soul , who cannot find comfort in anything or anyone until her hospitalization at the Claymoore institute, where she will establish bonds with the other hospitalized girls, first of all Lisa (A. Jolie), an enterprising young woman with sociopathic tendencies but with an innate ability to exert a strong influence on those around her.This social criticism, which lingers a lot on the concept of mental illness and on the vision one has of those affected by it, unfolds elegantly throughout the film, always being authentic and never forced, if not for a slight decrease in the thickness of the plot in the finale, scripted in my opinion more weakly than the rest of the film.Among the cast members, who all give a good interpretation on the whole, Jolie certainly stands out, capable of giving her character a wide range of nuances and perfectly transmitting the magnetism that characterizes her to the viewer, as well as a seventeen-year-old Elisabeth Moss , who plays a mild-tempered and innocent hospital patient, scarred in the face from severe burns.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"i have noticed some similarities with ""Girl"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"".......","when i first saw ""Girl,Interrrupted"" i was in an outpatient day psych program myself. the staff only showed the first half of the movie, but from that first half, i could tell it was going to be a good one. then the movie finally came on a cable station unedited and i finally saw it from beginning to end. the ""Susanna"" character played by Wynona Ryder was fascinating and at the same time elusive. Daisy, the fragile girl with the eating disorder, was very poignant and for some reason i sensed she would come to a tragic end - which she did - in the movie. Angelina Jolie's ""Lisa"" reminded me of a friend i knew who was reckless in everything she did not to mention insensitive to other people's feelings. she played ""Lisa"" very convincingly to me.i guess every movie has it's most remembered moments...and it was the saddest moment of the whole movie, and of course, when Daisy committed suicide while this old 60s song, ""The End of the World"" 45 record kept playing over and over. the night before ""Lisa"" had confronted Daisy about what had happened to her as a child, and when Daisy went upstairs somehow i knew she wasn't gonna see the next day. i cried when Susanna called for Daisy the next morning and that sad song was playing and Susanna went up the stairs to Daisy's room and all you saw were Daisy's feet dangling from where she'd hung herself. i was ticked off at Lisa's response ""what an idiot"" -- i felt was very callous and abrasive. but then again that was Lisa's personality -- much like that of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nests"" R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson.from other posts that i have read, that this movie is comparable to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" based on the book by Ken Kersey, i will admit there are some slight similarities...Angelina Jolie's brassy ""Lisa"" is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's ""R.P. McMurphy"" a swaggering loudmouthed cigarette-smoking rowdy who challenges the ""Big Nurse"" the evil ""Nurse Ratched"". In GI, there is also a head nurse who is the complete opposite of the evil Nurse Ratched, played by Whoopi Goldberg, who plays a more compassionate yet no-nonsense nurse. For those who have seen or have ""One Flew.."" there is also a tragedy in that film as well...after a night of carousing the ward, and Nurse Ratched walking in on all the chaotic aftermath, she goes and shames the one patient who is the most troubled of the group, Billy Bibbit, who eventually goes into the doctor's office and commits suicide by cutting his own throat. Again, a similarly tragic moment when Daisy (Brittney Murphy) hangs herself after an abrasive interaction with Jolie's 'Lisa'. in the ending of both movies, one actually does fly over the cuckoos nest -- the pseudo-deaf Indian, played by the late Will Sampson, and in ""Girl"" Susanna, played by Wynona Ryder. i think that both movies are excellent, with the exception that ""Cuckoo's Nest"" showed a much more gritty side of patient life in a psychiatric hospital, and the use of Etc (electro-convulsive therapy), back in the 60s, and the performing of unnecessary lobotomies. i think if i'm not mistaken, Lisa ends up receiving shock therapy and is put in leather restraints, looking haggard (correct me if i am wrong), but this film does not show the actual procedure taking place. ""GI"" diagnosis of Susanna's character as being ""borderline personality"" to me stands to be corrected...i think a more fitting description would have been major depression, i.e., her suicide attempt and melancholy mood and demeanor. i can say this because i am currently in recovery for depression and i can relate to the symptoms she presented with, and i too have been hospitalized...only my hospitalization was nothing like the ones portrayed in ""Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Girl"". at times i feel mental illness is not accurately portrayed in films, but then again, with today's everchanging times and better treatment of mentally ill patients and the newer meds, these movies (along with ""A Beautiful Mind"")kind of gives the viewer a thumbnail sketch of how serious mental illness can be. and as one of many people who suffer from mental illness, it is good that the movies are now being bold enough to tell these stories and thus raise awareness in the minds of viewers that yes, this can happen to you too.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't believe Kaysen's lies.,"I'm really frustrated with this film, because I want to know more about this woman, and I feel like I'm being lied to in a number of ways. I don't believe Susanna Kaysen tells the truth about herself, and she's admitted as much in interviews. Furthermore, she seems like the kind of person who easily believes her own lies. I also feel like I'm being lied to by her publishers and by feminists who seem to want to ""sanitize"" the details of her life.The film Girl, Interrupted was, in my opinion, not terrible, but certainly not great. Angelina Jolie acted like everyone's favorite stereotype of a mentally ill woman. I've never been in a posh hospital like McLean, but I have been in other hospitals, including a state hospital, teaching hospitals, and private hospitals. I've seen mentally ill women, and none of them have looked or acted like Angelina. I'm not talking about her purported ""beauty""; I'm just saying that a young woman like that would look way older than her years.None of the film rang true to me, and I don't want to read the book, because I don't think Kaysen is a reliable narrator. I simply can't suspend disbelief that easily.I agree with those who believe that Kaysen couldn't possibly have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, because it was just a theory until it became an official diagnosis in 1980 with the release of the DSM-III.I don't have a grudge against her, because I believe she is legitimately very ill. From what I've read in interviews, she is meanspirited, arrogant, and ungrateful. She tends to use crude language when it's not called for, and her witticisms are either disturbing or simply not funny. I'd just like to find some truth about this woman, and I've tried to find it, but I've come up empty. From what I've found, she's a feminist icon, a genius, and a great writer. I only agree that she's a feminist icon. I would think that someone like Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a more suitable role model, but what the hell do I know? I have a penis.I don't understand the reviewers who believe that there was nothing wrong with Susanna Kaysen. You've believed her lies. One thing I've learned about people with personality disorders is that they always lie more than the average person, and the average person lies a lot.Speaking of average people, whoever said that Susanna Kaysen was an average teenager was woefully misinformed. She was born into a family of wealthy and politically influential academics. Her father was an adviser to President Kennedy.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

A remarkable recovery,"The film's first half-hour plods along as it sloppily tries to set up and explain Susanna's (Ryder) current state. The use of flashback is no problem at first but there are about 4 or 5 flashbacks too many, telling the audience things they have already realised or don't really need to know anyway.However, after this terrible start, the film bounces back spectacularly once the flashbacks are put aside. This is thanks mainly to the characters in the mental hospital - the sensitive Georgina (DuVall), aggressive but fragile Daisy (Murphy), the childlike Polly (Moss) and, last but definitely not least, Jolie's volatile rebel Lisa.The film gets better and better as it goes on, the main interest point being the relationship between Lisa and Susanna, but there's a hugely effective subplot concerning Daisy's ordeal, which results in a fantastic and pivotal scene that sends the film into a great final act.The performances are great. Ryder is more than competent as the subdued Susanna, but DuVall and Murphy are better by perfectly capturing their characters drive (or lack of). It is Jolie that fares best, however, with her snarling, seductive and dominating performance. She makes you hate Lisa but still long for her return, and she deserves all the praise she received.Overall, the film is effective, at times funny, and a surprisingly good character study. 8/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
She's a Girl on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"If you are a prospective viewer or buyer of ""Girl, Interrupted"", don't be mislead by the many comparisons to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", other than the setting in a mental hospital there is little similarity. There is little similarity between the two hospitals and no reason to believe that the ""movie"" adaptation of Kesey's book influenced ""Susanna Kaysen's"" autobiographical story. If you are looking for a film to predict your reaction a much better choice would be ""Ordinary People"". It is fairly safe to say that if you enjoyed that film you will be entertained by ""Girl, Interrupted"".Although the film was inspired by Kaysen's actual experiences and is told from her point of view (her character is played by Winona Ryder), it is really more allegorical than real; with general themes about freedom, individualism, conformity, and expectations. Unlike ""Cuckoo's Nest"" the villain is not the system but our own internal demons; ""we have met the enemy and he is us"".This is an ensemble piece and in trying to be character inclusive the film must sacrifice a lot of character depth and development. A really good director would grasp this problem and invent ways to compensate; fleshing out characters with visual behaviors and filling the frame with faces and eyes, including extensive reaction shots. Unfortunately, director James Mangold is pretty much clueless and the absence of tight shots and subtle characterization distances the viewer from the characters and makes it hard to identify or connect.Still the story is compelling enough to engage most viewers and there are enough stereotypes to just fill in the blanks yourself about several characters. For example, the Julie (Angela Bettis) character, a thin ballerina with an eating disorder, needs little supplemental background information and Angela can just get on with things that move along the storyline.Kaysen's take on herself and her fellow patients is interesting. Everyone sees little purple men, but you only get locked up for it if you complain about it (insert not conforming here). Then like Dorothy in Oz you can always go home by pronouncing yourself willing to conform, since there was never anything wrong (at least relative to everyone else) in the first place. Diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder, Kaysen's real danger is becoming too comfortable in the sheltered environment of the institution to want to go home. Her thoughts of suicide seem rather silly to her after she is actually confronted with death.A borderline personality is appropriate for the theme of the story because apparently the psychological community is still uncertain about whether such a classification is even valid. The vague description is of a person born with a tendency to react more intensely to lower levels of stress than others and to take longer to recover; peaking emotionally on less provocation and taking longer coming down (which probably describes almost everyone that you know).The patients in her ward are messed up in a variety of ways, if the girls in my high school had been this interesting I probably would have married one. Most have found a home in the institution and have little desire to leave. One (Lisa-Angelina Jolie) is manipulatively dangerous with no conscience. She periodically escapes but always returns to sadistically pick on and push the buttons of her captive audience inside. Another (Brittney Murphy) is truly a psychological basket case, of course she is the first one to be released.Winona does a good job with this role but it does not offer her that much, as the nature of the story requires that Susanna be played in a very constrained way. She is a little too old for the role and her style of playing her characters realistically hurts your perception of her acting when everyone else is carrying on in a expressionistic overplay.Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg (she plays a perceptive RN) really shine. I'm puzzled by the amount of praise Jolie's performance has received. She is fine in the role but there is nothing difficult here, mostly she just plays herself and occasionally looks like she would enjoy pulling the wings off a few flies. Bettis and Murphy could have handled the role just as well while Jolie would have struggled with their parts.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Rider, Jolie did the best they could, but....","Girl Interrupted should have re-titled ""Girls Uninteresting"". The story is about a girl who get placed in an asylum set in the mid-60's. There, Winona Rider meets up with Angelina Jolie and from there the fun stops. Suffice it to say that Jolie as the ""Bad Girl"" of the movie was less than convincing. I mean, come on. ANYBODY can smoke cigarettes and say the ""F"" word forty times in the movies. If you don't believe me, see ""Casino"". It goes from boring, to twisted, to psychotic and finishes off at predictable. This movie keeps me guessing as to how Winona Rider ever got as big of a star as she did. She's been in some real stinkers in her career (i.e. ""Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Mermaids"", and now ""Girl, Interrupted"".) Rider could have ended her career at ""Beetlejuice"" and probably would have been better off.But, all is not lost. For out of the shadows of a painfully boring movie comes Whoopi Goldberg. This move also made me appreciate Goldberg more. She has this gift of taking weak, uninteresting scripts and making them somewhat tolerable. (i.e. ""Clara's Heart"", ""Sister Act II"", and ANY episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") Whoopi was the only thing that kept me from walking out being thankful that my friend paid for this movie and not me.Girl, Interrupted- *** 3 stars out of 10.

Mind you, this movie takes place in the 60's and they didn't have as much information on BPD 35 years ago, but they couldn't have been that wrong. Winona is almost the opposite of a BPD; she doesn't have mood swings, is not an alcoholic, she doesn't get angry much, and I could go on. If anything, she could simply be guilty of depression, and an unnatural attraction to death, which would only make her a goth, if the movie took place in modern day.I haven't read the book, but now I will look for it, since I want to know whether the movie took too many liberties with the writing.",,Anonymous,Biography

A definite must-see for anyone who's ever had doubts about their sanity, or anyone who wants to understand what it is to be a little crazy. I especially liked the accurate portrayals of the so-called disorders : Lisa is a true sociopath, Georgina's pathological lying is very accurate and the others are also truly portrayed, right down to Suzanna herself - borderline is ethereal at best and this is again accurately brought across.

Outside of a few flashbacks Winona Ryder (playing Susanna) has (which are all conveniently forgotten about within 20 minutes of the film), we get no background on anyone.  It's as if we're expected to believe each of these nuts were delivered by a stork, without reason, to the mental ward, never to be released again.  What drove these people to such a desolate place?  What drove James Mangold to write and direct such a meandering film?  I must confess that I have not read the novel, upon which this movie is based, and I'm guessing a lot of the questions I, and everyone I have talked to about the movie ""Girl, Interrupted"", have asked are answered between its pages.  Still, not one of us were advised that this movie was merely a companion piece to some depressed rich kid's desolate fantasy.  I feel this movie is a bleak, unwelcoming Cliffnote to something far more profound.

A terrific cast of young ladies makes magic,"James Mangold is a director who takes nothing but top shelf scripts and spins them into gold, and Girl Interrupted is a shining example of this. It's based on a book by Susannah Kayson in which she outlines an 18 month stay at a mental ward sometime during the 60's. Mangold adapts her book for the screen, gathers an excellent cast of talented gals and a couple guys, and makes a film that holds up today like it was still it's release week in 1999. Winona Ryder plays Susanna, a reckless girl who is labelled wayward and unstable by her parents, committed to a facility by her stern psychiatrist (Red Forman himself, Kurtwood Smith). She's a little rough around the edges, but one senses the innate sensibility to her that perhaps has been buried under turbulent behaviour not by anything within her, but by the constricting nature of the time period she has been born into. In any case, she finds herself thrown into an environment she didn't expect, with many other girls, some of which she clashes with, some of which she ends up befriending, and one that.. well, defies classification, really. The girl in question is Lisa, played by a fantastically fired up Angelina Jolie who nearly combusts upon herself in her furious performance. Lisa has been dubbed nearly unable to treat, yet simply has the kind of soul that doesn't fit into a box, let alone lend itself to scholarly dissection. Ice cool one moment, a raging typhoon the next, and holding a dense riot shield over any trace of her true emotions every second, she's an enigmatic, elemental wild card. It's the best work I've ever seen from Jolie, getting her a well earned Oscar nod. She teaches Susanna some lessons that only people on that side of the glass can comprehend, confounding the facility's head doctor (Vanessa Redgrave) and puzzling a kind orderly (Whoopi Goldberg), two rational people who simply can't understand the kind resolution and companionship that often comes out of irrational, unconventional interaction that almost always is seen as 'unstable'. Ryder is pitch perfect and carries her share of the load, but despite being the protagonist, it's Jolie's show all the way. She's unbelievably good and will break the heart of both first time viewers and veterans who put the DVD in every so often for a tearful revisit. The late Brittany Murphy is great as Daisy, another complicated girl, and Clea Duvall scores points as Georgina, the shy and reserved one. There's also work from Jared Leto Elizabeth Moss, Angela Bettis, Bruce Altman, Mary Kay Place, Kadee Strickland, Misha Collins and Jeffrey Tambor. Tender, patient and non judgmental are qualities which are essential in films of this subject matter, as well as empathy from both viewer and filmmaker, to take a look at these girls and even though we may not understand what is going on with them or their beaviour, to simply bear witness, and be there for them. Mangold knows this and acts accordingly, leading to a beautiful film of the highest order. Viewers are sure to do the same, completing the artistic ring full circle.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

10/10,"Girl Interrupted is the story of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) a young woman who is sent to a mental asylum, There she forms a bond with many of the patients in the asylum including Lisa ( Angelina Jolie ) a charismatic rebel who has been there for 8 years .

Winona Ryder delivers a very restrained performance the emotions on her face when she first arrives at the asylum initially completely represent what she is feeling . Angelina Jolie has a more dynamic and showy role and a much more complex character who is cold and truthful but really does not care much about other people's feelings and yet is emotionally broken from inside . Whoopi Goldberg stars as Valerie the head nurse at the asylum and is brilliant as the strong , strict disciplinarian who also has a caring , nurturing side towards her patients it could've been really easy for the movie to portray her as this over the top fascist official but no she is very real and grounded . All the other actresses who play the other patients at the asylum also deliver strong Performances but the movie is mostly about Susanna and her journey to recovery and the experience she has at the hospital and the one thing that I really left wondering was how do these people re- assimilate back into society after living in such conditions for long periods of time and the answer is some never fully recover some learn to gel with surroundings and some are the shell of the human they were before they entered the asylum .

Murphy's portrayal of Daisy is one of her better roles in my opinion.If you ever wondered what it was like to be an asylum, or if you just want to see a true to life story that shines a bright light on an emotionally charged environment, I would highly recommend this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Have you ever confused a dream with life?""","Girl Interrupted explores what goes on inside the minds of young confused girls within a 1960s Mental Institution. It stars Winona Rider and Angelina Jolie both of which give amazing performances in this underrated movie directed by James Mangold who would later go on to directed many other intelligent screenplays such as Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma.Set in a time when you could be placed away in a mental institution for being gay or having an eating disorder a young freshly graduated Susan (played by Rider) finds herself in such a place for an apparent suicide attempt.Unsure of what to do in life and having no real goals or achievements to her name (despite being quite intelligent) the young depressed Susanna soon finds herself thrown into the mix of some very disturbed and quite mentally ill patients. One of which is Lisa an apparent sociopath who cleverly manipulates everyone around her and is unable to feel any empathy.The two girls hit things off and a toxic friendship begins in which we see Lisa slowly drag Susanna into her bleak world.What make's this movie great is the incredibly well written young female characters which is so hard to come across, with each actress delivering an amazing performance giving this movie a sense of great realism.As Susanna sets upon the quest to discover her true self and find out if she is really sane we are forced to ask the question, Is it the institution that makes her crazy or did she have deep seeded problems she chose to lock away all along?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Girl Interrupted is a powerful true story, I highly recommend!","Set in the turbulent world of the late 60's, this is the searing true story of a young woman who finds herself prescribed a short rest at a renowned mental institution. Rebelling against the head nurse, the physchiatrist, Susan Kaysen chooses to befriend the resident loonies', a group of troubled women. But after almost year of both flirting and struggling with the thin line between normal and crazy, Susanna realizes that to win freedom she must faces the one thing that terrifies her the most - herself.What an unbelievable movie. It shows the audience how crazy the world can get for some people. The lead role by Winona Ryder, was probably the most powerful of her career, as she reenacts the life of Susanna Kaysen. We go on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Susanna from start to finish of the movie. The opening scene of the movie shows Sue with a therapist and he explains that she has a problem. `Four days ago you chased a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of Vodka' and then Sue denies it by saying `I had a headache'. She is then recommended to Claymoores, a mental institution for people with all sorts of problems. Here is where the movie does get entruging. We meet different patients, who Susanna befriends including, Georgina the uncontrollable Liar, Burn victim Polly and the loudest character in the house, Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. No wonder this role won her an academy award, it was truly brilliant. Lisa rebelled, with a nasty, evil and selfish way about her. While Susanna was the exact opposite of Lisa, even though Lisa somehow fascinated her at the sametime. All in all we live through what it is like to live with Crazy people' and how they handle various situations in life. The results can sometimes be happy and others can have lasting affects which hurt and scar you. Other characters to look out for include Whoopi Goldberg as the head nurse and chief psychiatrist played by Vanessa Redgrave.Rating: 5/5 Stars or 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty horrible,"The first hour or so of Girl, Interrupted is watchable, if more than a little flawed, but by the end it self-implodes quite spectacularly into an obvious and over sentimental end. It's major problem is that all the main characters are self obsessed rich girls. Very few of them seem to have any real mental illnesses, especially Winona Ryder's character. This would be acceptable if the movie showed that the doctors diagnosis was nothing more than psychobabble, but it doesn't. In fact, by the end of the movie, Ryder is 'cured' of a disease that she never even seemed to possess.Angelina Jolie's character is portrayed as the bad girl, although she's clearly the only one there who has any acceptance of the situation she's in. And at the end, all it takes is a few well chosen words from Winona Ryder to break down the defenses she's supposed to have built up over a lifetime, and she realises the error of her ways. And Ryder's own ending is just as sloppy - a nice, happy, farewell. All of this is at first set against a backdrop of the Vietnam War, which promises to show the contrast between those being drafted to fight and the pitiful, selfish girls in the mental hospital. But that suddenly gets dropped halfway through, and the war is hardly mentioned again. It's a shame that the story itself is so ideologically contemptible because the film looks nice and the acting is superb, but that's just the way it goes sometimes.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great movie, great actresses","Ryder and Jolie are outstanding in this movie, giving a realistic feel to the asylum life, small victories by the girls against ""the system"" and a peek into the lives of the psychotic. Jolie steals the spotlight, even though you feel both sorry for her and want to villify her. One of her best movies. Not Ryder's best, but she does a very good job as well. You're on her side throughout the movie, understanding she's really ""not one of the psychos"", yet dealing with mental chaos herself. Well worth watching, some of the scenes are hilarious, especially the one at the ice cream parlor. Whoopie Goldberg does an adequate job as the RN, and you empathize for her situation dealing with girls she desperately wants to help, yet realizes some will never be ready to leave. The scene with Goldberg watching Ryder shave her legs and the rebellious Ryder's comments make you see the teen angst side of a young girl's problems. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies other than those addicted to only action/adventure flicks.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I always wanted them to *feel* better. I wanted them to succeed and to be able to move on with their lives. I felt those girls could easily be my friends and I thought about what I could do to help them. It also made me think about my own struggles - - which made it both interesting and difficult to watch.I couldn't help to think it would be so easy to end up that way. I can see this happening to anyone - - it's such a thin line! Look at Lisa, (Angelina Jolie's character) for proof! (Weren't there times you thought she was really okay?)

Outstanding drama,"I consider it to be, one of the most educative, intelligent dramas ever created.The film, presents the story of the main character Susanna Kaysen, interpreted by Winnona Ryder, who spent 18 months at a mental hospital in the 1960's. She mets here a couple of very disturbed young woman, including Lisa Rowe, wonderful played by Angelina Jolie, the wildest woman out there.Step by step, she starts to feel part of the group and her interaction with these women, especially with Lisa, changes her perspective on what is really important in life. You may say, it's similar to ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"", and you may be right, still, it is a life lesson, everyone should watch it, at least once, because the message is strong, and extremely relevant, especially nowadays: Live your life, feel lucky you're healthy, because the are people out there who would do anything to be in your position.Maybe to realize that you need a push.It's the case of Susannam who didn't realize how luck she is, until she saw the sufferance and misery of others.If I could characterize this title in 4 words, I'd say it's: A wake up call, for everyone in delusion and denial.I liked it a lot, because it focused on the group, and brought up a realistic image of the life in a psychiatric institution. I rate ""Girl Interrupted"" a **** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Cast In A Very Average Movie,"Winona Ryder stars as Susanna Kaysen in this movie adapted from the real Kaysen's book about her stay in a psychiatric hospital in the late 1960's after a suicide attempt.Ryder puts on a generally good performance, but is outshone by Angelina Jolie, playing Lisa, Kaysen's sometimes friend and sometimes tormenter. Jolie's performance was powerful. Most of the supporting cast (who generally play the parts of other residents) is solid, but tend to fade into the background for the most part behind Ryder and Jolie. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was strangely cast in a rather limited role as the head nurse of the institution, who consistently challenges Kaysen to get better and get out of the place.In spite of the generally good performances, though, the story was a bit slow-moving. There were some very powerful scenes, but we seem to have to endure long stretches of relative boredom to get to them. The plodding storyline does move, however, to a strong climax. We just have to wait far too long to get there! Overall, I can't say this is any better than a very average movie, and I would rate it as a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lilith Fair meets Shock Corridor,"The Sylvia Plath wannabe sensibility gets a waify makeover as the producer-star Winona Ryder throws a pity party for herself. Based on Susanna Kaysen's spare memoir of a year-long stay in the bughouse, the movie suggests Sassy magazine on downers. Ryder is the tremulous heroine, an upper-middle-class daughter driven to the edge by status-crazed martini-sipping parents, and Angelina Jolie wears out her tomboy-cupcake vibe as the rebel hottie who flew over the cuckoo's nest. There are a handful of good scenes in the middle of the movie--in the best, Ryder and Jolie perform an impromptu version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown"" for a depressed patient. But when Whoopi Goldberg, the movie's designated mammy and head nurse, explodes, ""You are a lazy, self-indulgent girl driving yourself crazy!"" it's hard to suppress a standing cheer.The adaptor-director James Mangold gives the producer-star more adoring closeups since Falconetti played Joan of Arc. Why is it that everyone right now seems to think Mike Nichols is the model for film direction? Mangold's work combines the caricature of THE GRADUATE with the splinters of CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, and his use of sixties music makes FORREST GUMP feel inventive. (I never again want to see a movie where the characters stare openmouthed at a TV set as Fill-in-the-Blank has just been assassinated.) The movie teaches a sigh-inducing slate of girl-power lessons. In the most tiresome, Winona turns down her bohunk boyfriend Jared Leto when he asks her to go into exile with him in Canada; she has to get better with her girlfriends, you see.

"Fascinating, but depressing...","To my surprise, ""Girl, Interrupted"" was one of the better movies I've seen in 1999, but it's not exactly what you call a ""feel-good"" movie. When I left the theatre, I felt rather depressed, which shows that the film had an effect on me.Many critics have compared this film to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", while the only similarity in the two films is its setting. ""Girl"" takes a life of its own, and becomes a fascinating character study of a young woman trying to live life how she wants to live it. Winona Ryder gives one of her strongest performances as Susanna Kaysen, while Angelina Jolie is brilliant as the sociopath Lisa. Though Ryder and Jolie are the two central characters in the film (with the scene-chewing performances), there are several other supporting characters that we learn to sympathize with as the film progresses.Though there isn't much Oscar buzz for this one (except for Jolie's performance), I think that Ryder should at least get an Oscar nomination for her daring, original performance.

Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted"".Once upon a time, in a little American town, there lived a young girl named Susanna Kaysen... At the age of 18, Susanna's life wasn't quite what the life of a ""normal"" eighteen-year-old was supposed to be like. She wasn't a least bit interested about the conventional social behavior, fell asleep at the graduation, went to bed with her mother's friend's husband, liked to write and didn't show any particular interest for college.One night, due to an excruciating headache, Susanna swallowed a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of vodka to get it down. Bewildered by their daughter's gesture and eager to fulfill their duty as parents, the Kaysens delegated a psychiatrist, friend of the family, to submit her to a local mental institution.Once there, Susanna made new friends: Georgina, a pathological lier, Polly  a young woman with the intellect of a twelve-year-old, who had been badly scarred in a fire, Daisy  a secluded anorexic who had been sexually abused by her father and a rebellious captivating sociopath called Lisa.During the day, the girls would trick the nurses to avoid swallowing their pills, which they would afterward exchange among them like candy, while during the night they would force the entrance of the private offices, wonder on the corridors and play bowling in the basement of the mental hospital.Things were getting along fine, just like in the Land of Oz, where people were special, not different, it was strictly up to Dorothy to return to the real world, and all they ever wanted was at reach waiting for them to understand it. The characters were somehow different from the ones in the story, but that made little importance. There was Georgina, a Dorothy wannabe who would invent herself a new story every day, Polly, whose only wish was to be a child forever, Lisa, a professional Cinderella and Toby, Susanna's ex-fling, an untalented prince who failed to convince Susanna to run away with him. There was also Dr. Crumble, a fat scarecrow born without a brain, Dr. Wick, the almighty Wizzard who could send any of them home at the wink of an eye, nurse Valery, the bad witch who would afterward play the role of the Fairy Godmother without anyone knowing how or when the change took place. Susanna only couldn't quite figure out which was the character she played.At some point, reality interfered with their fantasy and the story of their lives began to unfold.

I wanted to write a small review on it now because not many people have commented on the great Brittany Murphy.  Yes, Angelina won the Oscar for this film and of course Ryder was great, but the greatest performance was by Murphy.  Murphy plays Daisy, a chicken obsessed, laxitive junkie who's father likes her a little bit too much.  Murphy brings such great depth and sympathy to her character, making the audience feel her pain.

Beautiful « period » drama.,"It was full of these ugly truths people deny themselves, or refuse to see. Winona Ryder carries it. And the rest of the cast, help her do that.

But how, with all the « requirements » of today's entertainment? I don't believe, it was made twenty one years ago. Late 90s movies don't age. And have this very distinctive aesthetic, and timeless charm. This movie is proof of that. Even set in the 60s, it's still very relevant. Through music, fashion and cinematography.

"A fabulous, challenging film with incredible depth","One-line summaries of this film often go something like this:""The story of a girl's mistaken confinement to a mental institution.""I would argue that such a description misses the motivation behind Susanna's story.  This film, fabulously acted, intricately directed, and taken from an intensely written memoir, is about the inner workings of a troubled mind - that of Susanna Kaysen.This troubled mind knows that something in it doesn't work right, and wants to fix it.  All levels of ""Girl, Interrupted"" speak to the us, the audience; it challenges us to search our own minds and discover the Susanna in us, challenges the very definition of sanity.  In the end, it asks us: to what lengths will you go to become a part of 'accepted' society - and are the 'normal' really any better than the crazy people?  To say that Susanna was mistakenly confined to a mental institution ignores the fact that every character at Claymoore was a true human being, whose story could have been told as effectively as Susanna's.  That Susanna left Claymoore testifies only that she was able and willing to be healed - not that she never belonged there in the first place.This is a challenging, dramatic, profoundly effective movie - the voice of the author cries out for understanding in a world driven by image and desperate for acceptance.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Her name is Angelina Jolie, and her performance crackles with the energy of Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  You cannot help but be taken in by her.  She sets the screen ablaze with her brash honesty, quick wit, and total and complete lack of conscience.  She is what you have always wanted to be but were to afraid to admit it, or so you think.  Until you realize along with the main character that she lacks any moral consideration of others there is only her in her world and what she needs because to her others do not matter.  She fears nothing, and so she cares about nothing which gives her license to do whatever she pleases, no consequences.  She's the very definition of dangerous.

When you do see this movie you will be able to put yourself into each and every scene. This is the mark of a fine film, and it was well worth the price of admission.. and then some. I must agree with the Golden Globes nominating committee for their terrific choice to select Angelina Jolie as a nominee for best supporting actress. It is certainly well deserved. I just can't help but wonder why Winona Ryder was over-looked.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pointless mess,"The movie seemed pointless.  Was the story about how sane people get railroaded into a mental institution? Was it about the incompetency of mental hospital staffs? Was the point that anyone who enters a mental institution should cooperate from the beginning even though they are sane?The plot became obvious leaving only a few questions as to how it gets from point to point. Everyone knows how it will end and it ends that way.The acting was atrocious. Angelina Jolie plays a sick bitch but that is easy for her to do because that is what she is in real life. Doesn't require any skill. Winona Ryder as the heroine is unconvincing in her role. While she should generate sympathy, she never does. She is a tramp and sometimes you believe that what she gets is what she deserves.I am glad I got to see this one free because I would have felt real bad if I had wasted money on this boring flick. And it did get so boring at times that I walked away from it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jolie Stuns in Solid Story,"Angelina Jolie makes you fall in love with, hate, and feel bad for Lisa all at the same time. I loved the scene right at the end where Susana was like ""What are you doing? Why are you doing this?"" and she goes, full of attitude, ""I'm just playin' the villain baby.. just like you want me to"".. It was like a nod to her future mega-celebrity self. Winona Ryder did a really good job too and this movie really reminded me of some people in my life who like to create or invent problems for themselves. It lets you know that yes there are some girls in that institution with legitimate problems, but then there are people like Susana who really don't belong there in the first place but try to make themselves believe that they actually are crazy. I think the movie as a whole was pretty good. B+/A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best movie of the year,"This is a great movie. It's the true story of Susana Kaysen, who had to spend almost 2 years in a mental institution. This beautiful, heart-breaking story is going to change everything you thought you knew about mental disorders and, why not, life! Also, Angelina Jolie's amazing performance doesn't hurt either!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a haunting movie,"It would be hard to say this is a story of a descent into hades like say SNAKE PIT or some of the mental hospital films of the 1940s or 50s. Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is not really insane nor is she truly suicidal. In reality she is just a little morose.Her unwillingness to go to college suggests to her upper middle class parents a serious psychological disorder. Since she comes from an upper middle class status conscious family which finds her late adolescent problems upsetting, the rule is where there's money there's treatment and a convenient label. In Susanna Kaysen's case the label becomes BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER.The hospital is a farce. It's borderline between being a holding pen for well connected young woman and a joy camp. The Doctor supposedly treating her sleeps during psycho-theraphy. There's kindly Val the nurse who's more of a Super-Mom babysitter for wealthy girls. Meanwhile at night the girls can have the run of the facility as soon as they drug up the night nurse and send her off to sleep. Notwithstanding locks and bars, little toughie Lisa Rowe can escape whenever she wants.Val is the first to tell Susanna to grow up.The characters on the ward are interesting: little toughie Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who bullies the other patients around, wishy-washy Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) whose insecurities toughie Lisa knows how to probe; Polly 'Torch' Clark (Elisabeth Moss) and assorted others who just don't want to grow up.Susanna Kaysen keeps a diary in which she's keeping book on her co-inmates. Can she survive to tell the tale or will the hospital destroy her.The film is interesting for its period: 1968. The girls are seen huddled around the TV listening to Chet Huntley announcing the grim news of the assassination of Dr Martin L King. Yet there are slight historical lapses: the draft lottery that caught Sussana's boyfriend wasn't started until 1970 or 1971 when Nixon was President. In 1968 LBJ still President that year was still playing catch as catch can with men eligible for the draft.Yet the film did catch some of the flavor of the 1960s, girls hair styles and clothes excepting Sussana's date from that period. Winona Ryder did exude that occasionally less than subtle upper-middle class racism when addressing Val the nurse.There is a poignant scene where Susanna meets up with life having passed her by while she was on ice in the looney bin. On a walkabout with the ward and nurse Val off grounds, Susanna meets a high school friend who went to Sara Lawrence University and then on to The Sorbonne.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Touching, realistic portrayal of the treatment process, if a little sketchy..","I work at a State Mental Health Institute and felt the treatment of the difficult times patients have was done with great honesty and gentleness. I worked at the same hospital in 1969 and came back to work there in 1992 and the changes were amazing and so were the things that were the same.A special blessing on Susanna Kaysen for her courage in telling her story and for the cast who brought her book to life.  Especially my favorite, Whoopi Goldberg.  Each and every cast member gave an important touch but anyone who has been hospitalized or who works in a mental hospital knows that each patient finds one or two people who make the difference when it counts.  Every staff member that cares hopes they will find a person that gives them hope and will to work toward health. It is harder than the movie made it look for most but the compassion was there and showed.Don't miss a chance to see this movie if you have doubts, fears or questions about suicide or mental illness treatment.  It is not 100% accurate for all facilities but it hit the nail on the head with the general process.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

For all Angelina Jolie fans, it is a must-see.Oh btw, be prepared to shed some tears.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A realistic drama,"Girl Interrupted is not another drama about interpersonal issues. It is a drama about intrapersonal issues. The main character Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) interacts with a perfectly portrayed cast while she experiences an inner journey that is catalysed through her interactions and observations of others. The naturalism of the film in terms of acting and cinematography allows the audience to be be drawn into Susanna's world. From looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD it is also clear that the director has worked hard to maintain the focus of the film and this is very clear when you watch the movie, there is hardly a moment where Winona is not on screen and this is very much deliberate.The enormous strengths of the film do however serve to contrast some of it's weaknesses. The cinematography, while exceedingly natural and smooth, is also quite utilitarian, having been subordinated to the purpose of plot development. The greatest flaw however is the predictability of the scripting and supporting characters. While the main character Susanna tends to defy any label other than 'human person' the other supporting characters tend to fall under far more genre-specific stereotypes. The excellent acting on the part of everyone in this film helps to overcome this weakness however. In terms of scripting the predictable elements are not so obvious as to prevent the film's dialogue to be both funny and truthful.For a film based on a true story (a book) Girl Interrupted manages to be gimmick-free much to its credit. The acting and directing is so smooth that even the frequent use of flashbacks seem entirely natural.A brilliant execution 4 out of 5 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good,"I saw this movie over the summer, and I have to admit it was a little disturbing, but very good. Wynona Rider and Angelina Jolie did terrific jobs as Susanna and Jamie. Brittany did a wonderful job as Daisy Randone. I thought this movie was a little screwed up. IF it had been even tried to be realeased any earlier than this time period, it would have been shot to pieces. The quality of the movie is good (sound, picture, ect. ect.) but what was disturbing that in reality suicide does exist and mental illnesses. I own the movie ""The Children's Hour"", and you know how some people believed that it was a little 'too much' for it's time? Well, I think the same goes here. It was a little too much for any time. It was sad, funny, and unbelieviably heart felt in some places. Over all, I gave this movie a 9. 1 star was off because of it's 'strong felt' issues.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The raw power these women display on the big screen is moving.  The entire move exists without a strong male lead and still maintains great quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heroic and redemptive,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)I tend to the sentimental, so the fact that I cried through most of the last twenty minutes of this touching and redemptive story of lost little women in the booby hatch doesn't mean much. This really isn't a tear-jerker as such, it's just that the material and the way it is handled made me feel such affection for those girls struggling so hard to be whole. Set in New England in the sixties with Vietnam in the background and free love in the streets, this is a fine film with an excellent cast that tells an original story without mawkish sentimentality or any pandering to the politically correct. The psychotherapeutic industry is not indicted, nor is society held over the coals. Everything is individual and the faults and failures are individual faults and failures, and the ultimate redemption or lack there of is also individual.Winona Ryder gives a striking performance as 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, writer to be who finds herself in a mental institution after a suicide attempt. Ryder, who has the expressive face of a silent film star, proves beyond any doubt that she is a gifted and tremendously hard working actress.Trickster Angelina Jolie is fascinating in her academy-award winning supporting role as a kind of femme bad boy. Whoopi Goldberg as a Nurse Ratched with a heart, anchors the film and brings strength and rationality to the lives of the girls. Vanessa Redgrave, elegant and wise as Dr. Wick, a shrink with compassion and intelligence, serves as a counterbalance to Jeffrey Tambor's incompetent Dr. Potts.Some have compared this to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but this is an entirely different kind of movie. It has neither the range nor the outrageous humor of that great film. Director James Mangold, whose much admired Heavy (1995) showed what he can do, wisely attempts less here as he concentrates on the personal journey Susanna Kaysen takes to the brink of institutionalized insanity and back. He emphasizes how people can bond and show affection under dysfunctional circumstances, and how we can triumph over the darker aspects of our nature. In the final analysis, this is a heroic film and a tribute to those who rise above the demons in their souls.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Think of me when you shave your legs,"Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in one movie?? Cool I thought, but then, maybe the movie would only be eye-candy. WRONG! Seriously wrong.What enfolds on screen is a journey into a young woman's troubled mind and world, her struggle to first define normality and then to get back to that definition.Obviously (as you learn in the credits) a film based on a book by Susanna Kaysen (played by Ryder in the movie), which really makes you remember the time when you were an adolescent, the torn feelings, the anger, the frustration, etc.Of course, Jolie has won the Oscar for her rendition of Lisa, the drop-out sociopath, but small glitters of acting brilliance shimmer all over the movie, down to the smallest parts. Winona, besides being beautiful as ever, gives credibility to the (existing) Susanna.A fine movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly.There was just one annoying scene (but maybe that's just me). Her boyfriend asks Susanna whether she wanted to escape to Canada with him...I couldn't concentrate on the dialogue...my mind screamed ""FAKE BEARD! FAKE BEARD! all over the place....) Go see it, you'll get my hint :-)I give it 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, intense movie","This movie was not funny, as the previews might lead one to believe, but much  more intense.  The acting was superb.  I do wish Vanessa Redgrave had a bit of a larger role, and that the movie would have gotten more into Susanna's thoughts and why she did what she did.  But overall, this was a very good movie that made me think about craziness and how I'd react in that situation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting,"The problem with ""Girl, Interrupted"" is that the main character Susanna (Winona Ryder) is rather boring. Actually, there are only two really interesting characters in the film: Angelina Jolie's sociopath and the girl played by Brittany Murphy. But even though Susanna is pretty boring, the film isn't. I think it's a rather interesting and entertaining film. Of course, it's too long (over two hours) and in the beginning it's too episodic, but overall I think it's an okay film. And brilliant acting by Ryder, Jolie (in particular) and Murphy, of course. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"An intimate, emotional and inspirational look at the struggles of mental health","Wow, the intro straight up feels like something out of a 60's or 70's movie, it gave me One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest vibes. They really nail the 60's aesthetic. A young Winona Ryder, wow, so pretty. I can see now why they casted her to play the crazy emotional lady, Joyce Byers, in Stranger Things lol. The movie's a psychological trip - the way it goes back and forth from Susanna's previous memories to the present and the way they transition into one another is actually quite clever and brilliant. They do a good job at depicting what it would be like as first timer in a psych ward. It's a more personal and intimate look than One Flew. Angelina Jolie is unhinged in this one lol, her performance is off the charts. The era this movie takes place in is an interesting one. It's during the late 60's when the Vietnam War was just starting and Robert F. Kennedy was running for President.The movie ended up being pretty darn funny at times. It actually has a really good sense of humor. Seeing the relationships grow between the girls was an enjoyable experience. You feel like you're hanging out with them, sharing their struggles as they go through it. It reminds me a lot of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The performances from everyone were top notch. The movie's quite a dramatic ride without being overly mushy or sentimental. It actually ended up being pretty inspirational in some instances. Overall, I thought it was a solid movie with some great performances, some standout funny moments and an inspirational story about the struggles of mental health.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretentious,"Girl, Interrupted(1999) had a fascinating premise but unfortuntely failed to produce any source of conviction from its story.  Angelina Jolie deservely got the Oscar for what is the top performance of the film.  Plays like a tame version of the the famous Jack Nicholson-Milos Forman film.  Not a daring film when it comes to the depiction of life around an asylum.  A film that fully captures the feeling and mood of a person being in an asylum is the masterful and superior Samuel Fuller film, Shock Corridor(1963).",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Growing up absurd in the 1960s,"Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is eighteen in 1968, the year the world went a little crazy ... or a lot. She can't relate to her parents, her school, her future. To cure a headache, she downs an entire bottle of aspirin with a whole bottle of vodka. She is packed off to a looney bin for wayward teens.The girls she meets there, her co-loonies, are in some ways more in touch with themselves than most of the ""normal"" folks walking around loose out there. They may have unfortunate habits, but how different does that make them? Her best friend Lisa (Angelina Jolie) is so refreshingly honest it's hard to bear in mind she's a sociopath.Again, these girls hurt. They hurt themselves, they hurt others. But so did we all back then, and today. Life is like that. This movie captures it meaningfully by showing us people we care about deeply, in spite of what they do and what they're like. They are just like the people we really knew, back in crazy 1968, and just like us today, underneath our brave faces and cynicism.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Angelina Jolie (Lisa) was incredible in this movie, like most people said, and was hilarious in all the right spots and Brittany Murphy (Daisy) was just as good and funny. Winona Ryder, though not really funny in the movie, was just as good. My two favorite scenes are the ones with the three of them. In Daisy's room at the hospital while trading pills and talking about her chickens and crashing at Daisy's apartment talking about her incest with her father, though disturbing, I couldn't help but laugh about the way Angelina Jolie was talking about it and her chickens again.

Very gray movie.,"The whole time I spent watching ""Girl, interrupter"" I was not even sure what thread was sent to the foreground. I felt like this piece of media tried to be everything at once so it became nothing.If the main purpose was to show how borderline personality disorder is I can with centrality say - it was a failure. This movie is barely touching the reality of living with such a difficult condition and itself does not understand how this illness works. Every trait of borderline I saw there was stereotypical and very shallow.I don't also think it was a story about friendship, love, character development or finding yourself. If it was and I'm wrong - once again, it is very shallow and nothing groundbreaking. At least nothing worth more than 2 stars for me.It is hard for me to see the good parts of this movie except for the cat. ""Girl, Interrupted"" was a long and unnecessary piece of media. I would not recommend, especially if you want to get the hang of what Borderline personality disorder really is.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
*RYDER AND JOLIE WERE KISSING!!!!!!!*,"I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!!! I fell in love with it instantly. Now it's my second favorite of all time! Winona is the BEST actress in Hollywood. She's way *hotter* than all of them, and that includes Jennifer Lopez!!!! This is probably her best role. It is based on the psychiatric memoirs of the writer Susana Kaysen of the same title (published in '93). Ads for the flick boast that it is based on a true story, though none of the things that happened in the movie were in the book. They even go as far as changing the hospital's name (it's not really Claymoore, it's McLean). It's a fascinating book that i highly recomend, but let's put that aside and look at the movie. Ryder plays a teen entering womanhood when she attempts suicide for no apparant reason. She lives in her head, is always day dreaming, very immature and childlike, and doesn't have female friends but has many boyfriends. Look closely at the first chapter. After the therapist talked to her for only what seems like less than an hour, he sentences her to a teenage girls' mental hospital. When Susana goes into the cab, she notices her luggage had already been packed and ready to go. And her mom is across the street in a car waving quietly (just the Mom, but how about the dad?). She doesn't even step out to hug her daughter good bye! How suspicious. The fun really starts when she gets to the hospital and meets all of the crazy chicks. Her roommate is a cute, nice girl named Georgina who reads THE WIZARD OF OZ all the time. And then we get our first impression of Jolie's character being dragged back to the isolation room after a two week escape attempt. Her name's Lisa, and she's the most prominant of the all patients. She seems to poccess all of the answers concerning the way the world works and how people think so she becomes Susana's idol. The first half of the movie goes deeper and deeper into Susana's mind, and then the second half becomes 'The adventures of Susana and Lisa', but i didn't mind. Their adventures were incredibly fun. At some point Susana doesnt wanna leave because for the first time in her life she has real friends. What you'll remember the most is the cast, they're the best collection of characters ever assembled!!!!!!!! Each one is perfectly played by loveable actresses like Brit Murphy and Clea Duvall. You'll also fall in love with the original score. But what's the point of this movie? Well, i think it was trying to show as a girl's unwilling passage into womenhood, and how her childishness earned her a one and a half year vacation from the real world. But at some point, she realizes that the vacation can't last forever because it would lead her life to a dead end. It's also about friendship.**I GAVE IT 10/10*.

Awesome movie.,"Being familiar with mental institutions, I just had to see this movie. I read the book which ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST was based on. The book which this film is based on sounds similar and I will start looking for it.

I was also happy to see Clea Duvall, Jared Leto, Angela Bettis, Jeffrey Tambor, Brittany Murphey and the great Whoopi Goldberg here. They all deliver fine performances as well.The film is powerful and I was greatly amused by it. It was sad, funny and touching.

Predictable and Overrated.,"This movie has popped up in recent discussions in the social criticism vanguard of late, as a masterful work on internal conflicts and trauma, so I thought I'd finally watch what I avoided in the late '99's, see what I missed due to my cynic's suspicion. This was Jolie's career launch vehicle, along with her performative zeitgeisty taboo relationships with brother and much older man. But it's got that formulaic, playing to an academy voter, emotional pitch that keeps on giving.It's exactly what I thought it would be, glossy safe, labeling theory pitch on mental illness and institutional oppression. Great ensemble cast that really doesn't get to do much. There's just no there there, and certainly not enough for an oscar for anyone, caricatures not character development, and a cheap rip on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for a women's audience.. The final confrontations between the main characters is incongruous, wretched melodramatic crap without anything to tether it to what we've just watched for a ponderous hour +. I'm sure the source material had lots to mine, but this film adaptation misses any kind of development of the subject it seems to portray. The last 2 minutes are literally the same ending as Mona Lisa's Smile or LA Confidential, the driving away from the scene of the film's source of oppression with the poetic voice over the gentle orchestral melodic fade to black. I think every thriller or drama from the '90's uses this same ploy. This is yet another movie that sells us the idea of our now more enlightened selves on the theme of the moment that the Hollywood star-maker machinery does so well. Especially made for the pat yourself on the back for understanding bipolar disorder after watching Silver Linings Playbook crowd that buys self help books at the airport or walks the red carpet during award season.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
My New Favorite Movie,"I had been anticipating the release of this film for as long as I can remember ... seeing it, left me longing to see it again.

The movie, to my surprise is actually better than the book, Logically, since it was my favorite book, has now become my favorite movie. As one of my favorite actresses, Angelina Jolie did such an incredible job, perhaps even better than her performance in ""Gia"" which is also a touching story. Winona Ryder really surprised me with her performance, maybe my lack of faith in her acting skills was simply because she had never been given a character to play which had more than a one dimension personality. The supporting roles are also good. The direction, set design, costumes, music, etc also live up to and exceed all of my expectations.

Performances by the whole cast (especially Jolie) are all amazing.,"Girl, Interrupted is a biographical drama starring Oscar Nominee Winona Ryder as writer Susanna Kaysen and Angelina Jolie from Playing by Heart and Gia. It was written and directed by James Mangold, director of Heavy, and based on Kaysen's autobiography. I loved this film. Both Ryder and Jolie (especially Jolie) give amazing performances, both impressing me greatly because I've never seen such powerful performances from either of them.Mangold shows us that you don't have to make a graphic film in order for it to still be intense. He shows us that a film can be made intense with just powerful acting and a powerful script that takes no prisoners. He geniusly does this throughout the whole film. Jolie is perfectly cast as Lisa, another woman in Susanna's ward. In the climax of the film (which I won't ruin) Jolie displays what acting is about when she finally confronts Susanna about her problems.In conclusion, it's an amazingly acted and directed film. I highly recommend this movie but remember that it's not for everyone so don't yell at me when you see it and dislike it. But if you're a Ryder or a Jolie fan you shouldn't have a problem, because this is literally the best I've seen them do.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

wow.,"this movie was more than i had imagined it being. i knew it was good; i had heard that much from my friends and sister. however, not 5 minutes into the movie i knew this was going to be my new favorite.the whole cast does an absolutely amazing job in their roles; Angelina Jolie as Lisa was brilliant.everything in this movie, however small or unnoticeable, was there for a reason and tied back into itself. this movie was one of, if not the, most realistic and down-to-earth movie i have seen about growing up. it was out there and amazing. this movie was just absolutely amazing. i loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fine performances mark a fine film.,"Well, I just saw ""Girl, Interrupted"" with a friend of mine in west Los Angeles in a theater full of college to middle-aged women. Honestly, folks, this is Winona Ryder's best performance to date, although it might not be immediately obvious because of the tremendous subtlety in her acting. Sure, Angelina Jolie is electrifying, but in obvious ways since her role was clearly the flashier of the two. Despite rumors that they didn't get along too well during the shoot, Ryder and Jolie work very well together onscreen, and the supporting cast is stellar, particularly Clea DuVall (Georgina) and Brittany Murphy (Daisy). There are a few scenes in this movie that present some of Ryder's very best acting of all of her films.Director James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land) did a fine job avoiding cheap sentimentality, and I was impressed with his fluid adaptation of a very disjointed and unconventional narrative work. My one complaint is that the film wasn't as gritty or as emotionally resonant as I would have liked, so I walked out of the theater feeling more impressed with the performances than impacted by the story. Still, for any Winona Ryder fan, this movie--with its 2 hours full of close-ups of Ryder's hauntingly beautiful face--is an absolute dream. Multiple layers of muted anguish are registered in Ryder's expressive eyes, and her most powerful acting in this film comes out through her subtle facial expressions rather than any spoken words. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is not a disappointment by any means. If anything, it has strengthened my respect for Winona Ryder as an actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A potentially interesting story but for me it lacked depth and was a bit shallow,"Based on a true story, Girl, Interrupted gives an account of Susanna Kaysen's 18 month stay at a mental hospital during the 1960's.I'll kick off with a disclaimer that I have not read Susanna Kaysen's book, but I can only presume, and hope, that the book doesn't have nearly as many shortcomings as the film.One major thing I did take exception to with this film is its lack of depth and development in terms of its characters. Angelina Jolie's character Lisa is a sociopath who is little more than a playground bully which truth be told is it a little one-note and becomes a bit tiresome after the novelty wears off. Jolie is quite good here and this film helped to showcase that she had some range, but I just wish that her character had been given more dimension and depth. In fairness, we do gain more of an understanding of her character at the end of the film, but this doesn't make up for the fact that Jolie had nothing to work with in the early stages of the film. The only other supporting character to get any sort of focus was Daisy (Brittany Murphy), but again her character isn't that well-written and her character, like Lisa, didn't really have enough depth to make me care.Even when looking at the main character Susanna the writers probably don't develop her as well as they should have done; it seemed with Susanna, like Lisa, that all of the interesting things about her character are lazily thrown in at the end and prior to this we witness numerous therapy sessions, flashbacks, and Susanna ingratiating herself with the sisterhood at Claymoore and sadly I didn't find any of these things particularly insightful.Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder put in good performances and some of the insights given at the end do give the film some weight, but I couldn't help but feel that the director's own indulgences got in the way far too often. Girl, Interrupted provides us with a lot of potentially interesting characters that sadly are never allowed to become interesting and a potentially interesting story that doesn't always focus its attention in the right areas. Inevitably, this film will probably be compared to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but by comparison, Girl, Interrupted falls short.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Impurities,"It is a look inside the core of the human body that keeps us all together, and tears some apart.  Little flaws that keep everyone from reaching wholeness.  Little impurities.

"Not feminist, Thank God","I'm sure by now (if it wasn't from the start) that this film has been appropriated as a feminist manifesto, but when it was made, to me, the emphasis seemed much more on the on mental health aspect of the story. Less 'The Bell Jar' and more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Bechdel Test aside though, it just might be the top dramatic performances for all three actresses starring in it: Winnoa Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Brittany Murphy. (Screw Elizabeth Moss, she's homely and sucks.) Also brace for a surprise appearance by Jared Leto in probably his most restrained role ever. I would recommend this flick as something to watch exactly one time. .",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderfully acted film!!,"This is a truly wonderful and well likable film. I thought Angelina Jolie was terrific as the sociopath Lisa and Winona Ryder was excellent as Susanna Kaysen. This film does have some funny moments as well as some dramatic ones, and it is the kind of movie that deserves to be seen again and again. Angelina surely deserved her Oscar for her role. Brittany Murphy was great as Daisy. I knew that Daisy was a real mess and thought it was quite sadistic about her relationship with her dad.

One for the Girls,"Be aware: the ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" comparison only goes so far. And never, ever, in a derogatory fashion. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is set in the female ward of a women's psychiatric hospital, in the 70's and details the Protagonist's, Susanna Kaysen, struggle to rid herself of the craziness which she feels haunts her.Ryder fits into her role with a comfort which you know is almost too close. However this is very much Jolie's movie. She gives a performance which, like Susanna, the audience are forced to fall in love with the Sociopath Lisa, and believe that it is a good thing. If viewers are not Jolie fans before watching this they certainly will be afterwards. Another lovely  performance is from the delightful (and, like Jolie and Ryder, scarily convincing in character) Brittany Murphy, whose chicken hoarding Daisy sparkles throughout the movie, however briefly. Mangold directs in an almost fairytale-like style which forces his audience to become completely enthralled in Claymore life, and encourages that between sane and insane there is a fine line which we all tread. The movie fills the gaps which are left in Kaysen's stirring memoir, making it  a startling adaptation, and awakening movie. Shifting between touching and gripping, funny and sad, Girl, Interrupted is a movie worth the praise it is given.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fairly interesting!,"""Girl, Interrupted"" is a fairly interesting movie, since it tells the story about some girls who are at claymore. Claymore is a private mental hospital. All of those girls have different kinds of personalities. Susan is quiet; Polly is very frustrated because she has been scarred by an accident caused by fire. Daisy is quiet and strange. Lisa (The Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie) is a rebellious girl who thinks she's right on everything she does.Angelina Jolie played her character quite well; she really envelops herself into the role; however Cloe Sevigni should have won the academy award for best actress in a supporting role instead. She truly deserved it. Anyway Angelina was amazing in portraying this complicated girl. Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder carry out their roles splendidly. But I keep wondering why Winona Ryder didn't get any awards for her performance.Suicide is an interesting topic for a movie, since it happens quite frequently everywhere. I also like the way all the girls show their true friendship. This is not a bad movie, but the direction and the cinematography could have been much better. 7/10",,Anonymous,Biography
"Girl Interrupted, a very educating film","Girl Interrupted Is a very educating film, that goes on to give a very strong image of what the 60's was all about in places like mental hospitals/clinics. The fact that this film is based on a true story by Suzanna Kaysen makes it even more interesting and reliable to the viewer and does make you think what a life she was living in at that period of time. Girl Interrupted is there to answer all your questions. The way that this film is directed, gives you the opportunity to really look into the head of the main actor and actually ""pull"" out all the information needed. This is possible, because the film does a lot of zooming in the eyes of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder)which directly creates a communication between her and the audience, as to how she sees things in the life she is living in the film. On the other hand, female actors like Anjelina Jolie and Winona Ryder are considered very talented in such films ; And lets not forget that Angelina Jolie got an Oscar as ""The best supporting female actor in the year 2000.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A  close second if you compare it to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""","I've always had a problem with movies that say to be based on a true story. Most of the time this means that you'll watch a mediocre TV-movie (at best) that should make you cry your eyes out because of all the misery that happened to this one unfortunate person. Let me put it in another way: when you see the label 'based on a true story', what you'll get is a typical housewife movie. Since I'm not a housewife (I'm a 26 year old male), this kind of movies doesn't appeal to me all that much. But I always like to make exceptions and ""Girl, Interrupted"" deserves better than being called mediocre.In fact it reminded me a bit of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", the ULTIMATE classic in this genre, with an outstanding Jack Nicholson. Both movies are situated in the seventies (""Girl, Interrupted"" in the sixties and seventies) and both tell the story about a person in a mental institution. The main difference is perhaps that this time it isn't about men, but about women.Since I'm talking about ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", I will probably have to say which one of the two is the best. Well, the choice wasn't easy to make, but I still prefer ""OFOTCN"". Why? Not because of the acting. In both movies, the acting is of a very high quality. Neither because of the directing or the script, but because of the time it was made in. ""OFOTCN"" was the first of the two to appear and shocked the entire world. It showed how these patients were treated (and sometimes still are, but that's something else). Girl Interrupted isn't that shocking anymore. We already know what it was like back than and it all has been done before, even though this is a real story (which adds a lot to the drama).However, don't think this movie isn't good. It is very good and shocking, especially when you haven't seen ""OFOTCN"" yet. Let me end by saying that this one is a very close second and that I give it an 8.5/10 (I gave OFOTCN the full 10/10).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is one of the most moving films I've seen.,"If you haven't seen 'Girl, Interrupted,' you really don't know what you're missing.  I haven't read the book (yet), but I can't imagine even the highest intellectuals being disappointed in this film.  Wynona Ryder is marvelous, but the true star of the film is Angelina Jolie.Jolie is one of the best actresses I've ever had the pleasure to watch onscreen.  She doesn't play roles; she becomes her character.  In 'Girl,' her performance is chillingly delightful.  You sit in the theater feeling compassion for this socio-path while at the same time fearing what she'll do next.  Looking into her eyes is madness.This is the first movie I've seen featuring Ryder that I enjoyed as much as her first really good, thought-provoking film 'Heathers.'  Wynona Ryder fully matures in this role as a young girl suffering from a borderline personality disorder.  She, along with Jolie, will go so many further places with the astonishment of such A+ performances.The film reminds me a lot of Sylvia Plath's autobiographical novel examining her own mental breakdown.  Both are equally compelling and moving in answering examining the questions: what exactly constitutes insanity?  how different does one deemed so operate from the ""normal"" individual?'Girl, Interrupted' will leave you breathless and begging for more.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

At first she is frightened until she begins to make friends, once you get into the movie you'll forget that these people are crazy and in a mental ward, or at least I did, I began to think they weren't so crazy after all. After Lisa (jolie) and Susanna (rider) become friends you begin to understand their relationship. the ending is the only part I don't like ever since I saw the ending I wanted to make a second movie and change it, but as i grew older and watch the movie more I guess maybe it all ended up for the best.

Should Have Been So Much Better,"The source material, Susanna Kaysen's memoirs are compelling material, but it was quite poorly adapted. The screenplay becomes bogged down by unnecessary cinematic gimmicks and tacked on scenes which are superfluous to the basic story.As much as Jolie's performance was praised by fans and critics, it was overblown. There is too much of the Lisa character in the film such that it detracted from Susanna's journey. Lisa's continual escapades and escapes are simply not believable. Why would an institution who's mission is to help these troubled young women continually let Lisa prey on the other patients? How does she escape from padded cells over and over again?Its gutless filmmaking. The final scene, on the night before Susanna's release is completely unneeded. Its reminds one of the tacked on final scenes in action/adventure movies where the supposedly dead monster has one last gasp. Its a cheap gimmick.Its a shame for Winona Ryder, who had loved the project for years. She was instrumental in seeing this film made. WInona's nuanced performance is bulldozed by an over exposed Jolie. Even Susanna Kaysen was a detractor of the film.

Go a little crazy,"18 year old Susanna (played by Academy Award Nominee Winona Ryder) is disillusioned with reality and so she overdoses. As a result, she is checked into a mental hospital for her disorder. However, she has trouble coping with that too, and things turn even more dramatic when she meets a crazy patient named Lisa (played by Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie).I have no idea why this got mixed reviews when it first came out because it is a great film! A lot of it is because of the performances. First off, let's start with Ryder. She is a very capable lead who is struggling not just to fit in with the patients of the mental institution, but also with herself and how to deal with the effects of her disorder. She portrays that struggle very well, showing us that Susanna was indeed a real person. The film also boasts an incredible supporting cast including Academy Award Winners Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave and Jared Leto, all of whom do fine work in what little screen time they have (okay, maybe not so much with Goldberg, but you get my drift). But the star of the show is without a doubt Angelina Jolie. I don't feel like her Oscar win was deserved (it should have gone to Toni Collette for The Sixth Sense), but she definitely is the one who deserved the nomination and all the recognition for this movie. She is the reason to watch this movie and, in this movie, she proves that the acting chops that her father had have indeed been passed down to her.In a nutshell, go and watch this movie!

Winona in the cuckoo's nest,"I couldn't avoid the comparison between the performance of the two leading actresses in this amazing movie. As I couldn't avoid the comparison with the brilliant ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" of 1975.  The latter was an unbeatable classic with Jack Nicholson earning the Oscar and with a plot close to perfection. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a more soft and realistic movie. The pace is slower, but it gives you time to appreciate the interpretation of the excellent cast, with Winona at her best playing Susanna Kaysen. Her sequences with Whoopi and Jolie are memorable and she deserved an Oscar nomination. As for Angelina, she has played a strong character with great talent. She plays every sequence naturally, and makes them look easy for her. However, I think Winona's character is deeper and more difficult to play than Angelinas's Lisa. Winona has clearly devoted herself to her character in this movie. She might not be as versatile as Angelina, but she is perfect for this kind of role. If you don't like Winona Ryder (is that possible?), you can still enjoy this movie because of the supporting cast (Elizabeth Moss is also awesome as Polly).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I saw this movie when it came on pay per view, watched it with my friends, and we loved the film. It was so well-done, all the characters touched me so much. Especially to know that this was based on a true story. Winona Ryder did a great job as Susanna, but the movie really did belong to Angelina Jolie.Angelina Jolie is the most gifted actress out there right now. Obviously, she is my Favorite Actress. In this movie she won an Academy Award, which she deserved, and her Third Golden Globe. Her character is Lisa, a seductively charismatic sociopath who teaches Susanna a-lot about life. This character also touched people who watched the film, especially me. I give Angelina's performance a straight up A+Other performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave, and Elisabeth Moss i give thumb up to. Winona Ryder also did an amazing job, she should have gotten something for that role and her performance. The directing is great, also. The scores to this movie made me cry, they are so touching and so sweet.Not everyone who saw or will see this movie will love it. I think he general audience for this film is women,which is me.

I have had a friend in a mental hospital, here in Texas, and this movie is so real about such situations, and the writer brought to life what should be known about such.It is a great movie, and if you have not seen it, rent it. Our world is full of people who are thought as people who are insane or crazy. What is normal? Good job writer and good movie.

Simply a tame female version of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,"I'm sorry you can't make a movie this close to another movie and not have them compared. I first want to say that this is a pretty good movie. However, it has major flaws and just for being so similar to such a classic and beloved movie it has to be extra good in all areas...and it's not.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is better for the following reasons: Jack Nicholson in his prime. (There is nothing better than Jack back when he cared about acting) Milos Forman-superior director. Manigold- heavy handed. More dramatic story. Violent loser gets thrown in Asylum. Triumph of the spirit? Girl Interrupted- Lazy upperclass girl gets pushed into a tame mental health resort. Triumph of psychotherapy?So basically it is of course a lesser movie. Watch Cuckoo's Nest again and you'll see why.Angelie Jolie is good but you don't like her. If that was the point then fine. However, I also didn't like Whine-ona Ryder. So who is left to like? I gotta like someone. Cause why watch a movie about unlikeable people. I liked the Cabbie. I like some of the other resort guests. Whoopie Goldberg was kinda good. Soooooooo. Not enough.

Great performances in an unsatisfying melodrama,"Although I haven't read the book, it's clear director Mangold's attempt to adapt it is sincere. Unfortunately the movie lacks spirit, is overly sentimental and relies far too heavily on the late-sixties setting to deliver its highly personal message. If indeed there IS a message, as for the most part it seems nothing more than a collection of fragmented ramblings from the diary of the main character, writer Susanna Kaysen (Ryder). Commentary on the deleted scenes on the DVD version include Mangold's admission that scenes from the novel simply don't translate well to the screen, a point that perhaps can be made to many scenes that didn't wind up on the cutting-room floor also.It's left to the principals to save the film, and fortunately they do so in good style. Jolie is mesmerising and catlike, shifting from a purr to a snarl in the blink of an eye. She's the perfect foil to Ryder's doe-eyed protagonist, and a great deal of enjoyment can be taken by simply seeing them together on screen. Jolie's destructive character Lisa threatens to drag down all those around her, in particular the vulnerable Kaysen. It's a career defining turn, easily deserving of the Oscar. Ryder is as accomplished as always, you just assume a great performance from her so she never appears to excel.The movie looks and sounds beautiful, particularly in the early scenes when Kaysen's mind is wandering. It's a shame the style settles in to nothing more than an unsatisfying melodrama, and ends with an embarrassingly weak confrontation between the two leads.",,Anonymous,Biography
Inner Demons,"Too few films today stick with us after the credits roll. Too few films show us a piece of ourselves, even if we are afraid to admit the similarities. Too few films ask us to be proactive and make the movie a catalyst to changing our lives. But films like Girl, Interrupted, What the Bleep, and RevoLOUtion give us enough credit to not just entertain us, but to teach us without condescension and expect us to get off our asses and become better people. Girl, Interrupted is great in that it examines both the positives and negatives of therapy, and while it is life-changing for some, others are just not able to heal by utilizing it. A new film called RevoLOUtion, shows us that some of us can fix ourselves. The character, Lou, has a terrible stutter, but the bigger idea is that we all have had a ""stutter"" moment in our lives and if we have the courage to relive it like Lou does, we can overcome it like Lou does. Most adult issues stem from childhood and if we can go back to that place and understand why it caused a chain reaction that shaped our lives, we can break that chain and move on. These films are important and need to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The film portrays Susanna Kaysen's short stay in a famous mental hospital, supposedly to cure her 'borderline personality disorder, after a failed suicide attempt. This movie really makes you focus on mental illness, so you can assume it to be a depressing one. Rather, it is surprisingly life-affirming
Mental Illness is always viewed with stigma and something scary, even today. The first thought that comes to our mind when we hear the term is the word ""mad."" It's an illness just like anything else. it's a journey and a very hard one. This film is completely relevant to today's issues when mental health is becoming a huge worry for countries everywhere.

Girls Trying to Tell Us Something,"This is my second viewing, having watched this film when it first came out. So...by now, the careers of Ryder, Jolie, Duvall, Moss, and the late Murphy have all processed through the Hollywood machine, and the only ones left standing are: Jolie, Duvall, and Moss. So this time when I watched this film, I saw something different in Ryder and Jolie. And what I saw was that they had been perfectly cast as themselves. Ryder looked overworked, underweight, and tired. Jolie appeared flippant about serious underlying rage, and slipped in and out of extreme emotions as she tore a path of destruction behind her with all those she vented onto.Somehow, this didn't seem to be a stretch for either of the actors because based on what I've read about Ryder, she was suffering from extreme fatigue and exhaustion; and Jolie spent several years in the tabloids proving how an angry teenager turns into a crazy young adult who likes to do shocking things for attention. Wow. And she received awards for this. Nonetheless, the cast was very good, and the general tone of the movie was captivating and realistic while maintaining its value as ENTERTAINMENT, for all those reviewers who believe art should imitate the true grit of life. No, please. That's why we like films. Because they give us something to look forward to next time; because they allow the viewer to escape for awhile.It's very difficult to put all the details of one person's descent into mental illness into a one-and-a-half-hour of time, as anyone knows who watched A Beautiful Mind. So good job to the screenwriter and the director. This film is cleverly written, acted, directed, and produced because it slowly, imperceptibly, and progressively makes the mental institution appear safer than the world outside; which is illustrated toward the end of the film when the kind nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg tells Ryder's character not to ""drop anchor"" there. And while some reviewers have remarked that Ryder's character seemed self-indulgent, spoiled, and simply struggling with non-conformity, Ryder's character articulated the grim reality of her own mental illness when she painfully admitted to Jared Leto's character that she tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of aspirin; which was a complete departure from the character's denial when she was first admitted to the institution. When confronted with the opportunity to be free, Susanna was also confronted with a choice to be honest or stay stuck in denial.My favorite scene was the scene where Susanna and her parents were having a conference with the doctor played by Jeffrey Tambor, and Susanna's mother couldn't stop crying, while Susanna's father was loudly demanding to know how long his daughter would be in ""this place?"" Then Susanna asked if her disease was genetic, and both parents halted their self-absorbed behaviors for 1 second to hear the answer before resuming their own brand of insanity. This scene told the viewer everything they needed to know about why Susanna felt depressed. Who would have anything to look forward to at 18 years of age when they had already realized how pretentious the adult world is? And what a kid has to become in order to ""fit in?""Oh yes, these girls were trying to tell us something, and here it is: children like to pretend, and as children grow up they're told by adults to stop pretending and face reality. So whose reality are they supposed to be facing, when they see that all the adults they should be able to trust are pretending? or plain lying? That realization could cause a girl (or a boy) to be interrupted in the transition from child to adult. Thus, the title and the ensuing madness.Jolie can emote, that's for certain. Ryder can look fragile without effort because she has the physicality for it. That said, she's a talented actress and I miss watching her. Murphy was awesome, bless her little soul. Would've liked to have seen more of Redgrave, but then, Redgrave is so much more interesting than the others, so her screen presence had to be limited. Goldberg played Goldberg. And that's not to diminish the energy that is called Whoopi. No matter the role, Whoopi Goldberg comes across as down to earth, honest, no pretext.A good film if you want to feel understood.",,Anonymous,Biography

Good Movie--But NOT the TRUE STORY. . .,"***SPOILER ALERT****""Girl, Interrupted"" is about a young woman who was hospitalized in the 1960's after a suicide attempt. The main character is well-played by Winona Ryder and features an excellent cast, including Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldburg and Brittany Murphy. They give some powerful performances.I found the movie to be funny, charming and entertaining in depicting the relationships of these women in a psychiatric ward. Basically, the story revolves around the young woman's journey back to ""sanity"" after her initial diagnosis of BPD--Borderline Personality Disorder. The best part about this movie is the emphasis on love and friendship that develop between the patients and staff.That being said, the movie should come with a warning that much of the story is a gross deviation from the true story, the book by the same name ""Girl, Interrupted"", written by the subject of it, Susanna Kaysen which is an account of her hospitalization experience. I've seen many user comments from people who haven't read the book referring to it as the ""true story"" not knowing that many scenes and events never occurred. There are various changes made in certain characters, some big, some small but the most major change is the character, Lisa Rowe, a sociopath (played by Anjelina Jolie). In the movie, she is enigmatic, somewhat cruel, sinister at times and indirectly causes the death of another patient through her cruelty. Eventually, she becomes homicidal and stalks Susanna through the tunnels underneath the hospital with a hypodermic needle loaded with who-knows-what. The thing is, the real-life Lisa never did any of those things which are significant alterations of a character and subsequently the storyline (not to mention slanderous). It bothers me because it reinforces Hollywood stereotypes of mental illness--some things being distorted in order to sensationalize--the butcher-knife wielding mental patient is always more interesting than the real thing to movie-makers. Actually, some of the things that the real Lisa did were more interesting to me, like toilet-papering the TV room and stealing all the light bulbs from the ward (when asked how, she said ""I have a long skinny arm."")Ultimately, it doesn't reflect the true story by Ms. Kaysen whose book is an endearing, honest, meaningful and insightful look at the real experience of mental illness. I would say that as a **fictional** story for entertainment value, it's a good movie and worth watching but if you want the **truth**, I highly recommend you check out the book from your local library.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Girl,Interrupted","when i thought of watching this film i had very low expectations because i drew upon the wrong idea that Angelina Jolie would spoil the film by continuously pouting.

Get's ya to go deep inside yourself...,"This movie was seriously one of the best movies I have ever seen. Just the whole pyscological factor being the main part of the movie made it awesome. Winonna's theory's in the movie are so twisted and cleverly done that she makes you think and realize that her theory's are actually quite true and really interesting to think about. This movie gave you a true sense of what some people actually go through in their lives. Like you never know whats going on in a crazy person's mind or how their thinking, and this movie lets you in on that, which is really cool.Also it was interesting to watch how Susanna got munipulated into believing that she was actually crazy and thus then trying to cure herself. And how Lisa was saying that when you confess your secrets your free or whatever and Susanna was asking what if you have no secret to confess and Lisa responds with ""then your a lifer like me"", that whole thing was really interesting in the way that even though Susanna thought she had nothing to confess, she just shared whatever was in her head as she had theorpy. That kinda got to me, cuz when you think about it, it's true, our thoughts in our head that we think about daily are our secrets cuz we dont share them we just think about them. So thus everyone has secrets that will make us free if we just get them out of us.There is so much that I got out of this movie, but I won't bore you with it don't worry, and to all those people who thought it sucked or boring, watch it again and see what they're actually saying, or how it might relate to you.

Better than the Book,"Honestly, the fictionalized/ dramatized version of Susanna Kaysen's life was more entertaining and relatable than the real one. Someone warned me that would be the case, but I didn't believe her until I read Kaysen's book for myself.As happy as I am that Kaysen succeeded and published her novel in real life, I think the movie script's characters had more depth and background than hers did. Maybe she had wanted to respect the privacy of real people's traumas & issues, even though she had changed the names, and Hollywood went wild with it in inventing their own? In any case, the cast is excellent, and the actors add their own depths and subtle mannerisms to the characters.As an avid bibliophile who prefers most novels over their cinematic interpretations, I rarely EVER say that the film was better than the book it was loosely based upon.

Capitalist Propaganda,"For decades I avoided this movie because of how bad Winona Ryder is at acting and how the movie is about the mental hospital and lesbian romanticism but I was in the mood for insane people as my current life is mostly about dealing with insane people.Winona Ryder didn't take the role seriously until halfway through the movie but the movie itself is very immersive and wasn't dramatic as much as you would expect from the mental hospital and mental illness theme which is a great plus since I especially dislike unnecessary drama and horror elements. I normally dislike romantic movies but the romantic aspect in this movie made sense and was necessary for the script due to the condition of Winona Ryder's character. Artistically I loved the vibe of the movie in any way. Everything about the movie is in great harmony.I was very immersed and time easily skipped while watching it which is rare for me. No wonder this movie was adapted from a book. Watching Angelina Jolie and her character was very fun because she is very good at acting and she did a great job at it in this movie as the character she played is very challenging, a rare person and she is insane. I liked the characters, the relationship dynamic between each other and how realistic they are. Even the dramatic aspect of their life was not actually unnecessarily toxic waste that put there for the illusion of story progression. I really liked the first message about insanity and why some people are insane and how there are lots of insane people out there but they are considered sane. But the way the movie ends ruined the whole movie for me.Winona Ryder's character wants to write book and whatnot which makes therapists and whatnot doctors think she is insane and therefore has to be locked in the mental hospital but it's sanity when she works at a grocery store or something instead of being an artist. What kind of capitalist BS is this? I understand the logic here but the way they conveyed the message is clearly capitalist BS. Also she is supposed to be insane because she having casual sex. The hell? I have no idea about the book but the movie is clearly some USA propaganda as how they use action movies and video games to make people enlist in the army so the USA can spread to the world like a virus therefore I reduced my 10/10 to 1/10.Also the ending is the funniest hero vs villain fight I ever saw in a media.

Very good performance,"I had no intent on seeing this at first, because when it came out I was more of the...romantic-comedy teen movies thing, since I was only about 12 or so when it came out. But, one night when my friend and I were looking for a movie to rent she pushed me into renting it and I don't regret that at all. In fact, I thank her for steering me away from the teen movies that don't really say anything and into the movies that have real, true meanings behind them all and storylines. I think there were great performances done by all in this movie, but my favorite was Brittany Murphy's. She expressed so much emotion, that it just was bursting out of my TV and into the space surronding me and I could just feel every thing she was feeling. But, she wasn't the only one who's performance had an effect on me. Jolie and Ryder and pretty much everyone in the movie did. Great casting, great story, great movie.",,Anonymous,Biography

"A thoughtful, touching and excellent film","A steadily paced but utterly absorbing story about a troubled 18 year Susanna Kaysen, subtlety played by Winona Ryder, whose experience at a psychiatric hospital l in the 1967 makes a real impression. While Ryder was also a producer on the film and worked very hard to get the film made, it plays as an involving ensemble piece with lot of actors getting a chance to shine, most notably Whoopi Goldberg as Nurse Valerie Owens, the late Brittany Murphy as the abused Daisy Randone and Angelina Jolie as sociopathic long time patient Lisa Rowe, for which she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.The film, while working from a strong script by Lisa Loomer, Anna Hamilton Phelan and director James Mangold, uses the experiences of the real-life Susanna Kaysen (who was also a producer on the film) from her novel. This film deals with the issue of mental health, and Mangold makes a brave decision to try and make the film as accessible as possible for a mainstream audience. While some critics have claimed that the film is overtly sanitised, it is very unlikely that a more gritty approach would led to the film being green lit on a $25-30 million budget.Performances are all understated but very real, with the notable exception of Jolie's character, who is very confrontational and direct. Kudos must go to all the cast including Goldberg, Murphy, DuVall, Moss, Tambor, and very effective cameos from Kurtwood Smith and Vanessa Redgrave. This is the real achievement of the film. The characters remain grounded and real within the context of the story, and the performers, under the expert and thoughtful guidance of director James Mangold generate warmth and interest that allows the viewer, providing you are patient (pun not intended), to invest in, and care for the characters. Jolie turns in a very charismatic and intense performance, and is one her best performances in my opinion, up there with her performance in Beyond Borders and the Changeling. However, Ryder is the ultimate anchor of the film, and in this regard she succeeds magnificently. One of her real strengths is her ability to tell a story non-verbally. At the start of the film, she clearly communicates to the audience her character being a lonely lost soul, who is initially horrified about going to psychiatric hospital, but nevertheless bonds with the fellow patients. Another strength is that Ryder's character begins to move in a direction which implies she is becoming dependant on the hospital, and her character develops rebellious tendencies, clearly inspired by the character's attraction to Jolie's Lisa. The conflict her character goes through with other characters as a result of this relationship works very well and leads to a satisfying and grounded climax that tries very hard to not be too sentimental or stereotypical.Technical credits are understated but impressive. Mangold's direction is spot on, and he makes clever use of match cuts to transition the story, but also to inform the audience of the lead character's disorientated psychological state. Design, costumes, photography and music are all very effective and contribute to a really polished and well-made film. The film captures the atmosphere of 1967/8 America very well, yet this does not dominate the story, which in many ways feels timeless and totally accessible for a modern audience.In summary, an excellent achievement that is a sensitive yet accessible film about an individual dealing with difficult but common real life problems.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

worse than Unsane (2018),"The only good thing in this movie is that we can see how the famous Angelina Jolie looked like when she was younger, or more specifically, when she was closer to my current age. Also bit teaching, realistic, scientific, emotional because it shows us how even the most sick or insane people still have their lives, stories, problems, and emotions. Also shows us how everybody can be compared to such people and end up in psych ward. But what I did not like is too much society, emotions, subjectivity, relationships. No final lesson or action or end. Simply too much negativity, talk, and drama. Too negative, boring, and useless to watch. The main character did not exit psych ward in any better condition compared to when she went in. She witnessed the same problems as outside of psych ward. Her problems did not leave her nor did she get any special motivation or perception. Just some random bit too sad experience. Can't be compared to better psych ward movies which have more action and less talk and drama like Unsane (2018). The most sad thing in this movie is witnessing how even such famous actress Angelina can end up in such low level state, just as anybody, which correlates with her real life situation and history.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie goes so well that I was only waiting for it to crumble... my surprise was that IT DIDN'T! The movie stays solid all the way, and the actresses and the direction make the movie even better! I believe that showing psychological problems like this is rare, since everyone still sees psychoanalysts and nurses as monsters ( ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""... ) or doesn't understand enough about it to make a decent movie. We see authentic human beings portrayed in ""Girl, Interrupted"". No evil character, no perfect person. Only people struggling to live their lives in the best way they can. It is a lesson for all ""suicidal"" teenagers without being moralist, it is passionate and modern. There are powerful dialogues and characters that stay in your mind. This movie is far better than ""The Sixth Sense""... I hated that movie! It is pointless, confusing, doesn't teach anything useful... the only thing that is ( a little ) good is its ending. Anyway, I prefer Fight Club's. I believe this movie is also better than ""The Green Mile"", that is  VERY predictable, has BAD and GOOD characters ( sounds like a child's tale... ), remains pointless and is way too long. I would rather have seen ""Girl, Interrupted"" in the Academy Awards than these movies listed above. I can truly give a 10 to this movie and put it on the top of my list, with American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Run Lola Run, Taxi Driver and some others.

Based upon the Autobiography of Susanna Kaysen,"In 1967, 18 year-old neurotic and volatile Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), who attempted to commit suicide by downing a bottle of vodka and a bottle of aspirin, is rushed to a local hospital. Not only is her family life an unhappy one (despite the family's influence), but also she is confused as what to do with her life. She is in denial about her motives, and is also promiscuous. After she has survived emergency medical care, she is sent to Claymoore, a psychiatric institution in Belmont, Massachusetts. As Susanna stays for one and one-half years, her outside life has become interrupted. (Actually the title emanates from Vermeer's 17th century painting.)The hospital staff is headed by an administrator who appears to be a caring and decent man, Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) and an intelligent but detached psychiatrist Dr. Sonia Wick (Vanessa Redgrave). The supervisor on the ward is hardened nurse Valerie Owens (Whoopi Goldberg). Valerie calls Susanna ""a lazy, self- indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy.""Placed in a women's ward, Susanna eventually receives her diagnosis: ""borderline personality disorder."" She is ambivalent and seems to deserve what she gets even though one knows that she does not really belong in Claymoore. When she tells boyfriend Toby (Jared Leto) that she has friends there, he replies, ""They are eating grapes off the wallpaper."" But Claymoore seems to give her the structure that she needs. Earlier, a nurse had warned her, ""Do not drop anchor here."" When tragedy ultimately strikes one of the inmates, Susanna seriously begins to self-examine herself and begins to cooperate with the therapists. Mentally she becomes less confused and healthier, and starts writing about her experiences. Although her book became the basis for the movie, the latter unfortunately takes many liberties. The movie, about behavior and character, is told dramatically via a series of episodes. These events include: female patient interactions; the girls breaking into the main office after hours and reading individual files; the Christmastime trip to the ice cream parlor; exercise classes; the attempt to escape; the final melodramatic confrontation in the basement. In reality, some of these events never really happened but were added in by Hollywood for dramatic effect.The other women Susanna meets at the hospital include: Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) – a rebel misfit, sociopath, and reckless; manipulative and cruel; doesn't care whom she hurts; becomes Susanna's friend. Georgina Tuskin (Clea Duwall) – a shy and withdrawn person; suffers from schizophrenia; lives in the Land of Oz; doesn't really want to leave Claymoore; diagnosed as ""pseudologica fantastica,"" a pathological liar; Susanna's roommate. Polly Clark (Elizabeth Moss) – a schizophrenic but kindly burn victim who is also depressed with her face; will never leave Claymoore; called ""Torch"" by Lisa. Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) – a deeply troubled individual with an anxiety disorder; harbors a dreadful secret. Janet Webber (Angela Bettis) – an anorexic ballerina; easily irritated; called ""Fatso"" by Lisa. Cynthia Crowley (Jillian Armenante) – a mentally-disturbed lesbian; severely depressed.Winona Ryder, who bears more than just a physical resemblance to the author of the book, is expressive and skillful at projecting mental states. She is always good. Angelina Jolie drives the movie and gives it life. Her demeaning of those around her left her a cold heart, dead inside. Jolie's haunting performance won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite some film flaws, there are the strong presentations by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses. Also, the script contains some sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent!,"A cool soundtrack is the first thing I noticed about this movie ... a haunting score contrasted with pumping 60s tunes like ""Downtown"" along with really gentle stuff like ""End of the World"" (which *has* to be the world's most depressing song, especially after the way it's used in this movie) ... Then there's the acting, and we all know how good Angelina Jolie is in everything, and in this - well, let me tell you that anything you've read about it (and her performance has been written about a lot!) is totally true, she's amazing in this movie. But that shouldn't be your only reason for seeing it. This movie has the best cast ever from the major roles to the minor roles like Vanessa Redgrave, Whoopi Goldberg (her best performance ever, in my opinion) and the *brilliant* performance of Angela Bettis as Janet (keep an eye out for her, she's the blonde who isn't in many scenes but is totally amazing).The movie is kind of depressing in a lot of ways - if you've had troubles in life (and haven't we all) you'll find this movie is a real downer at times, like when they're all talking about how 'wonderful' an escape suicide can be and stuff ... but if you stick with it, you find a real positive message too. And, believe me, you'll be humming ""Downtown"" on your way out.:)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
All who attempt to compare this film to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest please respond now,"Upon just having watched the film, Girl, Interrupted, I was not expecting anything great and thus was surprised at what I was given. So far of what I have seen in regard to films with Angelina Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg, Winona Ryder, and Brittany Murphy, who are the four actresses I found to be the most impressive, the roles they inhabited in this film were singularly sublime. When I think of these women, having not had the privilege of meeting them, and only their movies from which to observe them, I feel that their own personalities and characters are uncannily suited to the women they portray in the film itself. The casting director alone should be applauded for his or her efforts in assembling such an extraordinary group. In always choosing to keep my comments short and brief I will finish with a few points of good and bad commentary because those portions I found to be the most highlighting will give you, the viewer, an uncompromising outlook. The film, from what I could envision after having it ruminate in my mind for only a day, seemed to try to empower women, not through extreme political opposition or supposed enlightened ideologies, but through living out their lives as normal individuals. Goldberg's aggressive expression of psychology in a humanitarian wrapper as she responds to Ryder's character's pampered pouting after Lisa (Jolie) leaves the institution and Ryder is dropped into the bathtub, is the climactic turning point for this movie's righteous success, and a non-threatening addition to this movie's estrogen-charged atmosphere. Anyone who thinks this movie resembles One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest needs to have their eyes and ears checked because besides the fact that a majority of the story takes place in a mental institution it is absolutely and completely different in every imaginable aspect. I am just venting a little at this point, sorry if it is distracting in any way. If anyone tries to format any sort of a linear comparison of these two films, I will be forced to respond harshly to your criticisms with a command of my own. In terms of stars, 4 being the highest and none being the lowest, I give this film 3 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A must see,"I personally love this film and I have watched it multiple times. I have seen a lot of movies and I feel the acting from both the main character, Winona Ryder, and the supporting role, Angelina Jolie, were spot on. Angelina provides a performance that may surpass Winona's. However, both characters really embrace their characters and their ""crazy"" personalities.This movie shows truth about mental illness and how mental illness was perceived in the 60's. The insight into human flaws, mental illness, and profound social problems is amazing. This movie touches on so many important misconceptions of mental hospitals and the patients.Some reviews have said this movie is over acted and dramatic. However, this is a true story. Life is usually dramatic and unnecessary. This movie did not hold back. I would highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A disappointment,"As someone who copes with the emotional disorder that is supposed to be portrayed by the lead role, there was very little in this film to illustrate what it's like to live with the disorder and how it affects interpersonal relationships. It was even difficult to discern exactly what behavior was extreme enough to warrant the level of care the character underwent. I have yet to read the book, but I've been told the original story is a personal account and is quite good at portraying the condition. I haven't read it mainly because I don't want to be disappointed twice. As long as I ignored the premise of the film, I could enjoy the movie for the chemistry between Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, who I thought put forth solid performances. But to me it was simply a fair yarn about two coming-of-age girls -- how one matures and the other doesn't -- with a little bit of extra Hollywood drama thrown in for good measure and to keep it interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE VALIUM!,"When I first saw the trailer for GIRL INTERRUPTED attached to SLEEPY HOLLOW, I was ecstatic about it. It looked like a really appealing movie. I don't know if it was that catchy Sixpence None the Richer cover or my obsession with Angelina Jolie's stunning lips.  It just looked like a movie worth paying $ 8.00 for, for it seemed very high-profile and Winona Ryder seemed to be inspired enough by the Susanna Kaysen memoir to get it greenlighted. The early reviews I read on the Rotten Tomatoes site didn't seem too enthusiastic.  I knew they had to be wrong. The 30-seccond spots on TV with Angelina screaming "" I'll jam this in my aorta! "" seemed way too appealing for me not to like.  So I saw the movie last week, and I began to realize that Roger Ebert isn't always right. I absolutely loved the movie.  Though it was psychotically long, it remained interesting throughout. Winona Ryder perfectly reflects the emotions of her character, for she should win an Oscar just for Best Facial Expressions. Angelina Jolie is given a juicier role, and she's deliciously psycho in this movie and always keeps the audience on their toes. I'm glad Clea DuVall isn't in the Interchangable Kevin Williamson Teen Thriller club anymore and she is also good in this movie.  Brittany Murphy was also good, but her role in this movie and the way they play out her scenes seemed a little awkward.  I don't care what critics say, thinking their so intelligent when they emphasize how this movie is ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO's NEST meets THE BABYSITTER'S CLUB. So what, I love movies like this.",,Anonymous,Biography
Themes Involving Psychology Always Attract Me,"Most of us heard of the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"". In my opinion, Girl, Interrupted is almost as good as that movie in terms of the performances and the story. Both movies are biographies of people who suffer from psychological diseases.

Lisa is a hard psycho,uneducated kid.which after running several times,she have been arrested again.she is fully crazy and she does not take her pills.and for Susanna this new stage of life goes like hell.The chiefis a very kind woman and she tries to help Susanna.(Valerie Owens with outstanding performance of Whoopi Goldberg).after she ran out a few times she meets Dr Sonia Wick(Vanessa Redgrave) who is a experienced Council.and she tries to analyze her.though Susanna had an Ex-boyfriend Toby Jacobs(Jared Leto) which Susanna left him and now Toby returners to meet.meanwhile Susanna meets John,who works at the hospital and falls in love with John...There is a state of Grace,the last place of every human kind.and great little picture which tries to make us think about our lives. every one of us could be Susanna,or Lisa Or Daisy or... whatever it is,the whole performances are great,specially Angelina who gives a thrilling though heartbreaking performance.(although she is not my favorite)Winona Ryder is shining above all the sequences.her BEING THERE is enough for the picture.

Winona's angel face and Angelina's greatest performance,"It's great to see Winona Ryder in a starring role....it had been a while since I saw her playing the lead in a movie.  I really enjoyed this movie....it was slow at times, but still entertaining.  This movie is basically a showcase of two of the most interesting young actresses around: Winona, and Angelina she-looks-like-her-father Jolie.  Angelina is, without question, astonishing in this performance. She IS the best supporting actress of 1999.  The roles of the two girls are polar opposites.  Angelina has a flashy, flamboyant, in-your-face role.  It's a very dramatic role, yet it's not overdone at all--that's what makes her performance so remarkable. On the other hand, Winona's role is understated, but it's also a great performance.  Her performance is subtle, yet it's powerful.  Her facial expressions alone are mesmerizing.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her, with her delicate, porcelain doll looks.  I couldn't help but feel captivated by the range of emotions on her face.  I think that both she and Angelina were perfect for their roles.  Their wonderful performances make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable movies of the year.",,Anonymous,Biography

I Guess I (Everybody) Have The Same Thought With Susanna,"Psychological and biographical movie always be my interest. Maybe because sometimes I think the same thought as Susanna Kaysen. Not only when I was young, but until now when I have reached maturity. It's like being illuminated of the mind of people with mental illness. I can see their daily lives and how they interact with each other, and with normal people. But watching this movie, honestly I am a little bit confounded by the definition of normal and crazy people. It's seems superficial. Self-control is the key, I guess.I really all the casts in this movie, particularly Angelina Jolie. Her role is another version of Gia with a bolder and fearless personality, and a little touch of hidden vulnerability. Amazing. I don't know how she does those incredible actings. Winona Ryder also does a good job. I can see how confuse she is with her life. And she really looks like the real young Susanna Kaysen. This role is really perfect for her.Oh, in the opening, Sussana narrates this line: ""Or stolen something when you have the cash."" You know, it really brought back the memory of what has been done by Winona. No offense to Winona, but it just occurred to me. I couldn't resist it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hmm...Could This HAVE Been the Greatest Film of All Time?,"The answer is yes. But they screwed with it.I was only able to watch the first half hour or so. I was really delighted when I began the movie. It seemed very different. A dark but open drama about a normal girl living in a normal world. But there's a disturbance about. And you want to know what it is, and why what is happening to her is happening. She's the cool rebellious girl everyone wants to be. And then when you hear Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for the movie, and you think it might fit in well with the attitude of the movie so far. But it falls short.This movie is sort of a medical drama about disturbed people. But they're more normal than disturbed. Something about this movie is great. I didn't watch it all the way through, and possibly I will on some night in the future. But not anytime soon.I must say that Winona Ryder did an excellent job from what I saw.

I feel very guilty about loving this movie: A Subjective Review,"Fine, I admit, despite the fact that I am anti-psychiatry in a way that would even put Tom Cruise to shame, I adore the idea of the mental hospital and related concepts within a fiction realm. Despite the fact I would probably kill myself, if I were committed in real life, if I had a holodeck from Star Trek, you could only guess the scenarios I'd be creating for myself. Okay, so I am biased. Mental Hospitals give me great me pleasures, even when I just think of them. It's something about a person being considered non-accountable and not of sound psyche as well as being worthy of confinement for just their demeanor and attitudes that I think with me really just strikes bunches of chords.So, upon seeing a movie that did not only meet that but heterosexually fascination of women I immediately sought it out. However, such a non-sexual fetish as this is not something you would want to make public, so I naturally was very discrete in both how I reacted to this film and how I sought it out. I can't watch the movie without yelling at the characters, and I'm always afraid that someone at the library will wonder what a male like me is doing renting a movie like that with the amount of times I do.So, what is the movie itself? Well, it's a women's late 1960s half melodrama/half ""life passing as we adventure and experience the world"" drama. It's very well-acted but the material is at time's cringe-worthy. What really makes the film is just how effectively it emobdies its setting and attitudes of the characters. As for the former we really feel like we're in a mental hospital. This isn't raving lunatics and great horrors. It's a locked summer camp for sane young adults, who were bought down by the man. This is the type of place I would find myself lying on my couch imagining I was in. In terms of the latter, you could never accuse the film of not developing its characters, because one of the things it does amazingly masterpiece level way is make clear the way that all the characters view their lives and situations. We really understand why they all do what they do and feel what they feel as well why they are in the positions they are in. It's tragic and it sucks you into the story like few other films have by crafting a portrait of people who seem real, for they might as well be real people (whom they were based off) because our understanding of them is great. Even, though I can objectively say that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a better film, the characters don't have anything on this movie.This film has a lot that goes for it, but then again, it's just eaten up by me. There are so many ingredients for transcendent cinema here, and although I experience that because it is almost like a film made for me, I wouldn't know about that with other people. The thing is I couldn't possibly judge how a normal person would see this film. It's terribly manipulative and the ending is totally untrue. This is what they movies that are favorites but not best ofs.Actually, when I think of it, if it weren't for that untrue ending and manipulation, this could have been a experience I could truly consider to be great. The vibrancy of the characters had a ridiculous amount going for them, and I could only (and do in my spare time) imagine how great it really could have been had the characters stayed truer to their nature.

"A Fulfilling, Moving Experience.","Definitely not just a ""chick flick"", Girl, Interrupted is an underrated little gem. Perhaps the best mental-hospital movie since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.Winona Ryder is Susanna, a 60's sensitive type who commits herself to a mental institution after she takes a bottle of aspirin to cure a headache. We are then introduced to the inmates who will quickly form Susanna's clique: Daisy (Brittany Murphy), an anorexic daddy's girl; Polly (Elisabeth Moss), whose horrifically scarred face masks her innate sensitivity; and Lisa (Jolie), a free-spirited sociopath who has turned asylum escapes into an artform. Of course, the girls bond (though never in a sickly way), and have ""adventures"" (midnight bowling, sneaking a peek at their psychiatric reports); yet this is never as cute as you might think, director Mangold always injecting the proceedings with a slight, distinctly anti-Tinseltown edge.The performances are incredible, Winona Ryder is at her best, Britanny Murphy pulls off a strong, believeable appearance as Daisy and Whoopi Goldberg is typically great. But, here, Angelina Jolie is the real sparkle. Girl, Interrupted is HER movie, and it bought her into stardom, she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her moving, memorable performance as Lisa. Director James Mangold's direction is cruelly underrated, his effort is extremely impressive. The script is thought provoking and excellent, Mangold again is underrated, while his co-writers Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan aren't bad at all.Girl, Interrupted results as a must-see drama, well worth your time.I rate Girl, Interrupted 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is just brilliantly directed, acted, set, scripted ... I could go on. Every actor was credible. Every character was creatively weaved and complex.One thing we can't understand is why Winona didn't pick up awards for her performance, which in our opinion was faultless and 100% convincing throughout.

While there will be inevitable comparisons made to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", that's not fair. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a character study of the inhabitants of a mental institution.  ""Girl, Interrupted"" is more about inhabiting one, I think. Winona Ryder's lead character grows and changes, but generally stays in control.  Angelina Jolie has another amazing role to play with.

"Much more than a '""Cuckoo's Nest"" rip-off'","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****Sometimes movie critics are very mean with some films, just because of a single detail. That's what happened to ""Cruel Intentions"" (it was said to be a stupid, offensive version of ""Les Liaison Dangereuses""), ""Stigmata"" (not a masterpiece, but misunderstood) and ""Girl, Interrupted"". This movie received some not very exciting reviews, mostly because critics argued that it was a 'rip-off ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""'. But I think they were at least VERY unfair. The only similarity I can see is that both are placed at a mental institution, where a normal, not crazy person is sent for some reason. Only this and nothing more. While ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a deep and complex study of the human mind, ""Girl, Interrupted"" talks about how difficult adolescence is, with no pretension to be an instant classic. And guess what? I totally enjoyed it.""Girl, Interrupted"", directed by James Mangold, tells the (true) story of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young woman who tries to kill herself by drinking a bottle of vodka with a bottle of aspirin in the end of the '60s. Her parents believe that she has some mental problem, and send her to Claymoore, a mental institution where she will literally have her life changed. There she meets new and interesting people: Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a rather rigid nurse, Georgina (Clea DuVall), a pathological liar, Polly (Elizabeth Moss), a ingenuous girl with half of her face burned, Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a selfish girl who has a thing about chickens, among others. But one of them will be responsible for her change: Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a pretty, sexy, irresponsible sociopath who will build a relationship of mixed feelings with Susanna.The story is interesting, but would be nothing without a good screenplay. This aspect surprised me, because I thought this would be a sentimental, ingenuous film. In fact, the screenplay is almost the opposite. It is warm, human, clever, keeps the attention of the audience and- believe it or not - there is no big cliché. Well, we can predict the end, but we can't predict each scene, each quote and what will happen to each character. I really liked this detail.There are many qualities here (the soundtrack, for example, is excellent, amazing), but the biggest one is the acting. I had my doubts about Angelina Jolie's performance before watching the film. I knew she was a great actress, but did she deserve the Oscar as best supporting actress? Now that I saw the film I can say 'YES'. Even competing with Catherine Keener and Chloe Sevigny, she was quite superior. Her character is a mixture of 'mad girl' with 'sexy woman'. And Angelina plays Lisa with an amazing strength. But she doesn't own the film. We can't forget of the talented Winona Ryder, who was distant of screens for some time, since the terrible ""Alien Resurrection"". She does a great comeback.What I have to conclude is that ""Girl, Interrupted"" is not a copy of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". They are two different films with slightly similar themes. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is better, of course, but ""Girl, Interrupted"" has its qualities, which are not few. It's a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Greatness,"This movie had me interested as soon as I heard Angelina Jolie was in it she is an incredible actress. I was happily surprised though that Winona Ryder held her end up as well they both played off each other quite well. I think this might be some of Winona's best work, and that helped Angelina's Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Wanna Be A 'Girl Interupted!',"Using the turbulent sixties as a backdrop, and relying on the typical negative commentary about psychiatry, Girl Interupted is the story of one social misfit who, denied any say in the matter, commits herself into a mental hospital.Winona Ryder is Susanna, a sullen teenager fresh out of high school, who is battling depression and 'who knows what else'  She has had an affair with a married man and she recently swallowed a bottle of pills, chasing them down with a bottle of vodka.  She claimed she had a head ache.Once inside, she is subject to the wisdom of Whoopi Goldberg, and befriended by one rough house patient named Lisa (played by Angelina Joli).  Of course everyone goes on a bit of a journey into self discovery, and we learn that crazy people really aren't so bad.I had some serious problems with this movie, yet at the same time, I kind of liked it.  There is a story here, and it does move well.  Winona Ryder is actually very good in this role, and in fact this probably ranks up there as one of her best.  Angelina Joli, meanwhile, steals the show as an 'out of control' freak with a heart of gold.  Count this one as a milestone moment in a budding career.On the other hand, as a whole, this movie does not offer us anything new, and despite the bad language, this subject could have been handled just as well as a movie of the week.  I have heard comparisons to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but such a  classic cannot be touched by a film filled with a bunch of little tarts running around in their night gowns behaving like children.My biggest concern about Girl Interupted was not what it presented, but what it failed to present.  The girls here seem to have it made.  There is no real damage done to a bunch of sex starved chicks who hide their pills and then take them later on for the sake of getting high.  Girl Interupted presents a promising picture of patients of psychiatry, suggesting that a short visit will have you cured in no time and failing to mention that the stigma attached to these places, then and now, can be somewhat limiting indeed.",,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting. Simply riveting.,"Originally, I was going to proclaim Girl Interrupted as ""a modern day 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'"". Until I remembered that Girl takes place in the late 60's, and I believe that Cuckoo's Nest takes place in the 70's (although I could be wrong...) thus making the modern compliment a little confusing.Both films deal with asylums and mental illness, but while Nicholson's character slowly slides into madness, Winona Ryder's character (Suzanna) slowly pulls herself out of it. Not that she was totally crazy anyway. She was withdrawn, introspective, and dissatisfied with her lot in life. One botched attempt at a suicide, and the next thing she knows, she's being introduced to everybody at a mental ward. She eventually befriends the women staying there... Daisy, a girl whom only eats chickens from her father's deli, and stores the bones beneath her bed... Polly, a perpetually happy girl whom burned half of her face off as a child... Valerie, a nurse with a very patient demeanor played by Whoopi Goldberg... and then there's Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. Lisa is a rebel, and is constantly fighting with the doctors and nurses. At first this seems to be because she has everything figured out, and is too smart to be in a mental hospital. But as Suzanna and the audience later discover, that's not the case at all.Suzanna and Lisa develop an uneasy friendship, and at the times when Lisa turns on Suzanna, the movie takes on a bit of a horror feel, such as the underground scene near the end. It also creates some hilarious scenes, like Suzanna's confrontation with a mother of one of her former classmates in the ice cream shop.I wasn't aware that Girl Interrupted is actually based on the real life experience of writer Susanna Kaysen. This fact alone gives me even more respect for the film, as I imagine it may be quite difficult for her to revisit that time of her life.Don't be fooled into thinking this is a ""chick flick"". True, 90% of the main characters are women, but this is a hard hitting movie that everybody can watch and come away with a slightly different perspective on life. As the tagline says... Sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy. How true.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
the movie why I started to write my reviews on IMDB,"A few time ago I am diagnosed with the same condition with Suzanne, Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD). For the people who are stranger to this condition, let me try to explain. So when you have this condition you don't have any idea about it until a certain point, It doesn't even occur to you that you might be sick. Once you reailze that there might be a tiny problem then you are facing with the hardest part of the disease. Trying to get to know what your condition is. At that point a professional help might illuminate you. As we witnessed with Suzanne. I think I'll watch it later again several times which I do very rarely. Because I didn't only saw myself too many times through Suzanne but also explored some dark parts of my mind also. I think that as much as I know about Suzanne, I'll get to know myself better. The movie tells us sufferings of a person with BPD almost perfectly. If you also suffer from BPD I would suggest you to acknowledge yourself, your condition and learn a lesson from the movie. You can definitely be saved. But only saver that can save you is yourself. You must accept your condition and face with it.PS: All of my speakings come from my own experiences and ideas(and also some determinations of my psychotherapist. :) )",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angelina Jolie's best work,"Even though I think it's has too much craziness, I still enjoyed this movie. It shows the value and betrayal of friendship very much. And how two completely different people can become the best of friends and enimies.Wynonia has had a bumpy ride in her career. But this boosts her back up to the top. She's had a hard time choosing wonderful roles. I agreed with Edward Scissorhands, Dracula(1992), and Beetlejuice. And now Girl, Interupted has shown her true talent once again.Angelina Jolie added a lot of spice into her role and deserved her oscar. No one was more perfect for the role. You can tell how much fun she had making this film.Over all, it's a good film for a girl's night.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Been There, Seen That, Done It ""Girl"" Has Its Moments","Sitting through the new film, ""Girl, Interrupted"" one feels like you have been down this road before and mostly likely you have.  Hollywood has given the screen treatment to mental illness and the institutions that house those afflicted before, from 1948's harrowing, superb ""The Snake Pit"" to everyone's favorite 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"".  In fact ""Girl, Interrupted"" seems somewhat like a female version of that 1975 film.  That said, ""Girl"" is not a bad film, it has some very good moments, it's just not that fresh and is filled with the typical stock characters that populate this genre, though it does boast a couple of good performances, especially Winona Ryder as the lead character.""Girl, Interrupted"" is adapted from the1993 memoir of writer Susanna Kaysen's emotional breakdown as a teenager in the late 60's.  The film follows Susanna (the wonderful Winona Ryder) right after her suicide attempt, which lands her into a mental institution for women.  There she comes into contact with the regulars on the floor and ends up forming a bond with the seriously unstable and controlling Lisa (Angelina Jolie), who has already been a resident for eight years.  What happens throughout the film is the basic standard fare for this film genre.  Getting to know the patients and their eccentricities, patients versus staff, nightly escapades, breakouts, it has all been down before.  The film rises above itself when it focuses outside of the institution and the group residents; that is when the film becomes compelling.  Such scenes as Susanna slipping in and out of different parts of her life or her one on one sessions with various doctors lift the film from it's retread material and attempts to go beyond the typical fare.The saving grace of ""Girl, Interrupted"" which makes it worth seeing is the superb performance by Winona Ryder, giving one of her best performances in years.  Her subtle, focused and moving performance helps to ground the film into reality.  This is a young girl caught between the two worlds of normalcy and off-kilter and Ryder conveys this perfectly without going over the top.  Such though cannot be said about Angelina Jolie's performance of Lisa, the charismatic sociopath.  It can be seen why Jolie would be attracted to such a flashy, explosive character, but unfortunately she goes too far over the top and her theatrics drive the character completely off the map of believability, which ends up hurting the picture to a degree.  It is only towards the end when her performance is somewhat toned down, but by that time it is too late. The other actresses do okay in their standard stock roles, although Brittany Murphy is excellent as Daisy, a young emotionally disturbed girl with major problems.  Whoopie Goldberg does her best work in years as an intelligent and caring nurse and Vanessa Regrave is fine as the doctor of the institution.  In fact Goldberg and Regrave's scenes with Winona Ryder are some of the highlights of this film.""Girl, Interrupted"" starts off on a great note, but then becomes standard and somewhat predictable, with a few shining moments throughout.  Some reworking of this film could have made it much more than above average. Regardless, Winona Ryder's performance makes this film worth seeing, just as Jude Law did with the over rated ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".  A Marginal Recommendation. × × ×  out of 5",,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent film with two standout performances,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I like Winona Ryder and I adore Angelina Jolie. The two together make for a standout piece of movie making. I had not been recently impressed with Ms. Ryder's work but my faith has been restored with this performance. She is absolutely wonderful. So strong at one moment and so in need of sympathy at the next. She gives a multi layered take on her character that really portrays the turmoil she is in as so realistic. And what can I say about Angelina Jolie? Another knockout turn to be sure. The woman knows how to act plain and simple. The power she brings to the screen is incredible. I found that the scenes she was not in while very good to be sure, were calling out for her quick return. She has a very bright future ahead in Hollywood. The film itself blends both comedy and pathos. A wonderful combination that will have the viewer laughing and then frowning a moment later. The emotions flow freely and very quickly. Very few dull moments here. I highly recommend this film. It has a few depressing moments as would be expected from the subject matter, but the overall story is handled so deftly you must watch every moment of it and will be very eager to see how it all works out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyed it more than i thought i would!,"Ok, the premise of a story of someone living into a mental hospital for 18 months doesn't entice most to take a look at a film like this.I was partial skeptical what direction the film would take once inside i.e lack of care, beatings by staff etc thankfully this was not the case as it concentrates on the main characters illness and didn't take it in another direction other films have covered in the past.Another thing that keeps it being very watchable, is the general upbeat nature of the film despite the subject matter, had it been depressing all the way through it would have been a slog, but there are some happy, funny, joyful and of course sad moments, but with a great mixture throughout the screenwriter must be commended for the outcome.Quite how Winona Ryder did not even receive an Oscar nomination is beyond me, yes Angelina did a wonderful job in her role, but Winona in an understated character role clearly went under the radar for acting too well it seems!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I thought the story was a good one but the biggest asset to this film were the performances.  Jolie delivers a charismatic, involving performance of a confused and complex mentally disturbed young woman.  Ryder is excellent. She gives a highly moving, intelligent, and affective performance as Suzanne Caisson. She really allowed me to relate to her character. I'm sorry she didn't get an Oscar nod for that performance - she certainly deserved one. All of the supporting cast were outstanding as well - the girls, I mean - the two boys were a little disappointing. Whoopie Goldberg was also excellent and makes me wish she'd appear in films more often.Definitely a good way to spend an evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Angelina McMurphey?,"Yeah, I have to recall ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" for this one. Winona Ryder does her best acting that I have seen to date playing Susanna Kayson, a writer who learns compassion from a gaggle of misfits.  Ryder's voice over narration still sounds like ""Heathers,"" but her overall performance is somewhat better. Clearly, the film belongs to Jolie, who is superb (when is she not?) as Lisa, the possible sociopath who has a bad habit of helping out her fellow committed neighbors.  Her Academy Award winning performance rocks the screen with a no BS attitude.  Jolie is like a fine-tuned soprano singing her best aria; the film utilizes her charisma, her sensuality, and her amazing emotional range.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Best Drama I've Ever Seen.,"Girl, Interrupted is one of the the best drama films I have ever seen. It was probably the best movie of 1999. The movie had a spectacular cast: Winona Ryder as Susan Kaysen, Angelina Jolie as the crazy and witty Lisa, Clea DuVall as the Wizard of Oz-loving pathelogical liar, Whoopi Goldberg as Nurse Owens, Brittany Murphy as Daisy, Jared Leto as Toby Jacobs, and Jeffrey Tambor as the doctor for Susanna. This movie is about  Susanna Kaysen, who spends time in Claymoore Mental Hospital. This movie was really brilliant and James Mangold directed it brilliantly. And since the movie was based on a true story, that made it even better. The movie is sad at times, and seems very real when you are watching it. This is a movie that is very entertaining, which never keeps you bored. This is a highly recommended film. I give Girl, Interrupted a 10 out of 10!!!!!  :)",,Anonymous,Biography
Hard not to be won over,"Maybe it's time for me to take another look at ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" - I don't remember it being particularly good, certainly not as good as this.  Forman may be a better director than Mangold, but there's little evidence he can tell good material from bad.  (Sometimes he stumbles across good material by accident, and the result is an ""Amadeus"".)  ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a film that actually cares about making US care about the inmates.  I found myself growing very fond of Susanna and Lisa despite taking an intense initial dislike to both - how much more agreeable the company of the mad but intelligent is to that of the sane but stupid, I found myself thinking - and in no time at all I was hooked, and moved.  And unless my memory plays me false this is also a SMARTER film than ""Cuckoo"", as well as being a more touching one.Okay, Mangold does have his weaknesses.  Anyone who has to resort to a song montage might as well hold up a title card saying ""I don't know how to portray the passage of time""; the last fifteen minutes appears to consist of five consecutive endings (Forman ended HIS film cleanly, I'll give him that); and while we may have needed Susanna's first-person narration to lead us into the story, we certainly didn't need it to lead us out.  It's easy to forgive all of this.  Besides, Mangold has positive virtues to compensate: he knows how to pace, and, as I said before, he knows how to make us love the characters.I should mention few incidental pleasures.  One of them, surprisingly, is Whoopi Goldberg.  Who would have thought it, but she actually portrays a character that isn't her usual arch, smug one, in a role in which it would have been easy to lapse into arch smugness - and she does it well.  Also, you'll have to admit, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a great title.  How could anyone NOT bear good will to a film with a title like that?  Moreover, ""Downtown"" is a great song; I don't care who knows I think so.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good character driven plot. Great acting.,"If you like character driven plots, then this movie will pull you in. The story is good, although I could tell that it had been converted from a book. The character developments occasionally make jumps implying that something is missing. However, the skillful writing keeps these discontinuities minor, and they are easily overcome by the incredible acting. I gained new respect for Angelina Jolie, and Winona Ryder outshines even Angelina's performance. By the end of the movie, we feel we really know the characters, which is impressive considering how complex and dynamic they are.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie,"This is probably one of those nice movies which gives food for thought. I seriously wonder if being crazy is a bad thing. Does speaking your mind makes you be counted as a insane person.

One Life Interrupted,"Some outstanding performances (including one Oscar winner) highlight this story of a young woman who loses a year of her life incarcerated in a mental hospital, mainly due to society's penchant at the time for institutionalizing even the borderline mentally infirm.  `Girl, Interrupted,' directed by James Mangold, is the story (based on her autobiography) of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young aspiring writer suffering from depression.  After what may or may not have been a suicide attempt (she chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka), she is spirited off to a private mental hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a `borderline personality defect.'  Simply put, it means she is young, intelligent and having trouble coping with an era (the 60s) and a world in a state of flux, as well as the pressure from her parents and peers to attend an upscale university.  Susanna, however, wants only to live life and write, and though she knows her own mind in this regard, the forces that surround her are too great, and she is torn between what she wants, and what the `world' expects.  All of which leads her into some gray areas in which time and space as she knows it suddenly does not necessarily coincide with the continuum of reality.A powerful film that makes a statement about tolerance and the methods of treatment available for the mentally ill, it underscores the necessity for compassion and understanding of those unable to function on their own.  And it successfully illustrates that in dealing with people in need, there must be a humanistic approach, as  it is more involved than merely separating the wheat from the chaff.As Susanna, Winona Ryder gives a performance that is both affecting and intense; she readily conveys the angst of a young woman confused, yet determined, who has yet to learn one of life's most valuable lessons:  Make the decision.  Susanna has been walking a fence that gets narrower with each step she takes, until finally, her fall to either one side or the other was inevitable.  What she had yet to learn at that point, was that it is better to stop before you reach the end of the fence, so as to be able to decide for yourself which way you're going to fall.  That way, for better or worse, at least you know that `you've' made the decision that's going to affect your life, which makes it easier to live with.  Susanna could have saved herself a lot of misery had she stated unequivocally to her parents, and most importantly to herself, that after High School graduation `this' is what I am going to do.  A hard concept to grasp, however, when one is eighteen and being pulled in opposite directions at the same time.In her Oscar winning performance, Angelina Jolie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that, indeed, there is substance beneath the beauty.  As Lisa, the sociopath with an ice cube for a heart, she brings an enigmatic, intimidating presence to the screen.  A soulless miscreant, she thrives within the confines of the institution by bullying her way through every day of her life.  On the `outside,' however, she finds repeatedly that the bravura that works for her in confinement attracts only the kind of attention that gets her sent back again.  It's a dynamic, over-the-top, in-your-face performance for which she deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actress.  And, hopefully, after proving here what she is truly capable of, Jolie's career will successfully transcend her looks and that already famous pair of lips (though following this effort with the stagnating `Gone In 60 Seconds' does not bode well).The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall (Georgina), Brittany Murphy (Daisy), Elisabeth Moss (Polly), Jared Leto (Tobias), Jeffrey Tambor (Dr. Potts), Vanessa Redgrave (Dr. Wick), Whoopi Goldberg (Valerie), Mary Kay Place (Mrs. Gilcrest), Kurtwood Smith (Dr. Crumble) and Angela Bettis (Janet).  A somewhat disturbing film, `Girl, Interrupted' will affect you on any number of emotional levels and will command, not only your attention, but your involvement.  Simply put, this is riveting drama that refuses to let you off the hook for even a moment.  There's a message in here about the perspectives and significance of society as a whole, but more importantly, about the impact an individual can make on our world and the people around us, and of the importance of forging ahead and making a decision before it's too late.  I rate this one 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

music,"In the movie that is suppose to take place in 1961 a song is being placed as her memory goes back to before 1961. A song is being played at a party called ""time has come today"". That recording was released in 1967 so the people that made this movie were clueless about the music of the time. I suspect there were other recordings that were in error such as Downtown ""1964"" by Petula Clark, and others. Why did these idiots use songs released after 1961 for a move about 1961. Did juveniles make this film? Was there no one over 60 involved in the production? The recordings before 1966 or 1967 was very different than after 1967. Groups like Paul Revere and the raiders,the Monkeys, and Motown ruled the airwaves. The Beatles,the Stones. the British invasion and the hippy era did become mainstream until after 1961. Get off my cloud came out about 1963, Bob Dylan was after 1963. 1961 was very much like the 1950s.Dion and the Belmounts, Phil Spector's wall of sound, the Supremes,Marvin Gay,Motown.",,Anonymous,Biography
Performance of Angelina Jolie in this film,"I think that Angelina Jolie has been a very good performer and she has done a good job in Girl Interrupted.After seeing this film I started to see more films to see if I could considered her like a good actress, because is obvious that you can't summarize the career of an actress in only one film, you need to compare the trajectory since you start until the actuality...Well, right now I've got a certain idea of this film star and I think that in all her films she demonstrates she's got charisma when she acts.The great work of an act/or/ess is to transmit to the audience some kind of feeling, as well as the teachers need to transmit to their students, the painters, the writers...That is very nice in all arts and in theatre and cinema not all actors have that charisma that is necessary.In the films I've seen of Angelina Jolie including ""Inocencia interrumpida""( i like them almost all except tomb raider that is very commercial) she has force in the interpretation,she transmits sadness,happiness,crazyness...all the feelings in three seconds...it's incredible!",,Anonymous,Biography

Possibly the best film ever..........for me anyway.,"I had been waiting anxiously for this to  be released in Britain and then finally last week it was released and I got to see the finished product. Having read the book almost 6 months before watching the film, I had some idea of what to expect. Winona Ryder was already my fave actress a long time before this movie but watching this has only made me respect and admire her work even more. The film starts off great - with Winonas voice doing the narrative bit and her words really hit home. I myself have suffered from mental problems and so I could really relate to what she was saying. It is a little frustrating at times - I didnt like the way it kept showing you flashbacks and at times it got a bit confusing, but that only added to the overall feeling of the film. Clea Duvall is amazing as pathological liar Georgina, Brittany Murphy sensational as the chicken loving Daisy and Elizabeth Murphy wonderful as the little girl in so much distress that she set herself on fire. Even the small roles of MG and janet are played amazingly. However it is of course Winona and Angelina who steal the show as mad bad sociopath Lisa and vulnerable nervous little susanna. Angelina is truly fantastic and does indeed deserve all the recognition she is getting for her role. I was soooo pleased to see her win the oscar and she is an amazing actress and steals the show in every film I have ever seen her in, but I cant help but think that she has kind of stolen Winonas thunder slightly. The film is, primarily about Sussann - Winonas character and Winona does a great job. Her role does not have the edge that Angelinas has, but Winona plays her role just perfectly. Her facial expressions tell you so much - you know what shes thinking before shes even said it because of them and the bit where she has a go at Whoopis character was fantastic!!! I read where Winona has said that if you dont like her then you wont like the film , because most of the time the camera is just on her face, and I agree with that. I think anyone who doesnt like this film doesnt like Winona and thats the only reason why they dont like the film. It has some fantastic bits - my fave being where susanna and lisa sing Downtown to Polly - it was so sweet! and near the end when Sussanna paints Lisas finger nails. My only complaint is that there were bits in the film that were differant to the book and some bits in the film you wouldnt really understand unless you read the book. So for anyone who hasnt read the book - I would do so immediately. Of course although all the actresses were amazing and gave the perfomances of their lives there is one person whom people seem to be forgetting about completely - SUSSANNA KAYSEN. That woman is so emensly brave to have wrote her story and let it be made into a film for the world to see. Thanks to Sussanna Kaysen people are finally accepting mental illness for what it is - an illness and thanks to Winona this film got made because if she hadnt pushed for it to have been made it would never have happened. All the actresses in the film are going to go on to great things I know and I hope that Winona will continue to make such wonderful movies. Just one last thing .......Why on earth did she not get nominated as best actress for her role? A crime has most surely been committed there. Anyway along with SET IT OFF - this has to be my fave movie of all times. After all I am going to see it again tomorrow for the 5th time!!!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
Very true to life!,"This was an awesome movie! Jolie and Ryder both triumphed in their roles.Someone said this movie had too many clichés. Alot of it may have sounded like a bunch of clichés but trust me when I say that that is how things are in psych wards. . .the questions the therapists asked, the way the nurses reacted were representative of life in the psych ward.I give it a 10 and 2 big thumbs up. I want to buy this movie when it comes out on video!",,Anonymous,Biography
A bad case of the SPOILERS,"The trip to the café. Lisa was told that she would never be allowed out again and now I interpret that as a factual statement, maybe literal. A brick in the wall of an Edgar A Poe bricking in. Would Lisa also receive other chains that would be near impossible to break? If so they would not help her to be more sensible and politic, they would make such to be even more difficult for her.Her time off the ward after she drugged a nurse. She mentioned Etc and was on the run, to the sunny US retirement state, dreaming Disneyland professional Cinderella. I assume that she had just received further chains, of the permanent sort. Again, I do not think that they would help her towards a healthy approach. This escape had her robbing someone by way of fake prostitution, then conning an enemy to let her stay the night, which led to a suicide, ham fistedly crushing while also misunderstanding the truth? As she had been crushed by people who missed the point about her? The escape failed.I accept that this is fiction. I assume that the book will show Lisa getting additional chains in different ways. I like the film as it allows glimpses of a sympathetic view of Lisa to be found. If the hidden chainings were visible they might stand out as unreasonable and retrograde, instead it sounds unreasonable to say that they are there.Susanna did meet the real Lisa on the outside, after they had both been discharged. How deeply buried and chained was that Lisa? The real Susanna looks to be still chained. Hurt.*When Susanna returned she became immersed in diary writing as a central therapeutic activity. She also received an unusually large amount of help and supervision from the most qualified person there.After her diary was stolen she did not have a clue re facing the questions of ethics and values that Lisa and the others set her. They were messed up in various ways by the diary, she was sunk by their reactions.The fictional Harriet of Harriet The Spy 1996 faced a parallel challenge and H did even worst.When Susanna left she tried to appease Georgina  Clea, yet the way she did it was smelly. She showed that she still did not have a good understanding of the utility and ethics of journal therapy. She was reacting to the criticism in a way that said poor or chained understanding leading to poor mental health. Chained understanding?Mid teens I was inspired to want to write ""think things through"" notes. My ethics made me freeze instead. Hedgehog Ostrich, drifter. Susanna and Georgina froze at different stages. Lisa?I do not know how Susanna's book shows this aspect, but I would be surprised if it was not a real problem.I assume that the note making allowed Susanna a potential for examining her belief system disorders, my private language, even allowing scope for some change of her ways. Her past would have given her massive belief system disorders that I assume I would be able to relate to, I do want to read the book sometime.As well as the notes she needs more tools, even practical permissions to examine and modify her childhood understandings of appropriate good sense. She shows me that she had a shortfall in her toolkit, that the supervision had needed to help her get that more okay. At least she could have done worse.*Madonna. The 2001 video for What It Feels Like For A Girl.In the UK there is the possibility for transgendered with the right medical references to gain the legal rights and responsibilities of our acquired gender. I really had not considered it worthwhile for me to try to gather the appropriate references, as if basic civil rights was likely too expensive. Expensive in all sorts of ways. Health professionals have a much more advanced toolkit, in some ways, than a singer. Not that this Madonna is lacking.What we have in the UK is gender recognition for those who can face the hurdles. What one really needs might include acceptance and tolerance. Lisa and Susanna raise nice questions.*A story of personal relevance, but reading all the comments none covered what this is to me.Drafting a comment was not easy. I needed to simplify by just considering a few issues related to Susanna and Lisa, then a look at a parallel issue. This also links with my previous comments on Matilda 1996, 10-10-06, and Goblet Of Fire 2005, 7-9-06, and Fire On The Amazon 1991, 24-5-06, but they are as long as this. Things like the 'Can You Wag The Dog' aspects are hinted at there.I misuse the term spoiler.

I was disappointed,"I read all the critical acclaim that this film has received and was ulitmately disappointed upon seeing it. The main thing that bothered me was that the script, storyline situations, and dialogue were all very cliched, hokey, and predictable. I felt as if I was watching an ""ABC Afterschool Special"" with profanity added to it. Some of this dialogue made me laugh, it was so hokey! I also don't understand the character that Angelina Jolie played. Here she was supposed to be a sociopath and was successfully portrayed as such until the end of the movie. Then all of a sudden she is a crying mess because the others have hurt her feelings? Huh? Sociopaths don't feel psychological hurt or pain! And I also think Jolie's performance is overrated. Chloe Sevingy did so much better in her film and should of won the Oscar. It must be so nice and convenient to have a bloodline that pretty much guarantees you important awards. The only thing I liked about this movie was the acting. It was superb, every single actress just gave a dynamic peformance. I especially like Brittany Murphy. Even she did better than Jolie. Other than that, this movie blew!",,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing true story,"WELL .. I really believe that anyone could be diagnosed with a borderline personality at a certain period of their lives !! This movie is good because it's so real and it simply says the truth about stuff like the 60's, being young, and decisions in life !! Amazing performance by all actors .. I loved this movie .. It made me look at things differently!!! I'm 24 years old, and to be very honest i sometimes consider my self UN normal !! then again .. this movie made me realize that it is normal to feel out of place sometimes or not in the mood .. or even misplaced or disoriented !! Great movie ,, Suzana is a great writer .. i loved the book !!",,Anonymous,Biography
I read the book before I saw the movie,"Susanna Kaysen really did spend 18 months at a mental hospital but it was not called Claymoore. In her book, she describes all the girls, and her friendships with them, confrontations with others. I have been a fan of Angelina Jolie since Gia, which she was brilliant in, and have seen most of her films. She was deserving of her Oscar, although she is evil at times, by the end of the movie you end up hating her. Always a fan of Winona, I have seen all her films and still think that she is deserving of an Oscar. She should have been nominated for something in this movie, but a lot of times the supporting actors are the best. Every other girl in the film is great. As for the movie, I liked it, but I didn't think it was wonderful. But it is GOOD. American Beauty was my favorite film of 99, but this one is up there with the performances, not the actual story. Remember it for the acting, especially the scenes with just Jolie and Ryder. My memorable scene will be when Whoopi Goldberg is watching Winona shave her legs because she has to use a razor and well... you figure out why she has to be watched.",,Anonymous,Biography
Some mighty fine performances,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much heart and soul went into the acting performances. Winona Ryder was believable as the confused Susanna who gets sent to a mental hospital after a suicide attempt. Maybe because some of the situation was pretty true to her own life that she was able to adapt a serious rule like that.However the show stealer definitely came from Jolie, whose charasmatic sociopath Lisa deservedley won her an Oscar. It's because of her that made this film watchable for me. Oh yeah, Angie will go even further than she already has.",,Anonymous,Biography
Two of the best performances all year,"Winona Ryder is spectacular and Angelina Jolie shines in this awesome movie revolving around a girl who has been committed and learns the meaning of friendship.I enjoyed ""Girl, Interrupted"" because it is a film delves into a friendship that knows no bounds. The director did an excellent job at selecting just the right actresses to portray the two main characters. He did a superb job when he chose Ryder and Jolie because they have on screen chemistry that really lights up the screen.""Girl, Interrupted"" is a movie that takes the viewer places in the heart where no other films have gone before. It isn't my favorite film but it ranks in the top ten because it is a true and honest portrayal of what friendship really means.There really is that much more to say about this movie other than to say ""Watch it when you get a chance because it is one heck of a movie."" I really hope that everyone who heeds my advice will get as much enjoyment out of it as I did.",,Anonymous,Biography
Why won't this movie ever end?,"Having had some experience with madness, this godawful movie is the most pretentious disaster of a supposed expose of unhinged inwardness that 1: has ever been written and 2: has ever been filmed. Splendid acting is beside the point. What the hell is everyone so ""mad"" about? The entire movie is like a girl who didn't get something she wanted and so goes crazy and so justifies the entire mental health industry because, oh boo, what's the point of everything, and so forth... Oh I am so crazy. Histeronics ensue. Suicide, raving, telling the - oh the awful - truth about, you know, face up to your craziness or you are illegitimately crazy and, well, hang yourself. There. That wasn't crazy. you were just a pig.Was I ever crazy? Or maybe life is? Wait!!! Whoever was conned into spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on this was crazy. If you're like me, about 30 min into the movie you will not be able to comprehend why the movie lasts 1 more minute, and you'll wonder, and wonder and wonder until you wish this could turn into an action flick where Jolie turns into Salt and blows the entire institution into pieces.OMG. Ugh. Not one redeeming moment.",,Anonymous,Biography
not a female One Flew Over the Cukoo's nest,"Girl, Interrupted isn't a terrible movie but it tries so hard to be edgy. A beautiful and talanted actress like Winona Ryder hasnt had exposure for years because of her choice of movies like this. This might have been a labour of love for her but to me it was just a hokey movie. Ryder stars as a troubled girl with a personality disorder who goes to a mental institution. Inside she connects with the world of the inpatients and she forms a bond of friendship with  Angelina Jolie. Jolie- well the verdict is still out on her. She might have deserved her Oscar but I dont think she'll ever live up to it. She is more of a media skank the same way phony people are. The acting is OK and some of the scenes are OK but it's underworked. **",,Anonymous,Biography
Astounding!,"This would have to be the modern answer to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"". Though it is not really like this movie, it does ring a few bells.I really did feel for Winona Ryder, who seemed to be a lot like me and seemed to be troubled by exactly the same problems that brought myself to the point of self destruction... and imminent inclusion within the mental health system.Each and every individual within the ward was portrayed with such realism and beauty... some are mad, some are not, and some are just lost within themselves.This gets a much deserved 10 from me, and I'm not one to slap a 10 on any old movie I fancy. It has to work damn hard for it!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
A whole lotta emotin' (and smokin') goin' on,"""Girl, Interrupted"" (**1/2) seems to have been designed by Winona Ryder as an Oscar grabbing vehicle for herself.  Young woman recovering from an emotional breakdown in a posh mental hospital?  Can't miss.  She must have been royally miffed when Angelina Jolie ran off with the award instead (poor Winona wasn't even nominated).  Truth to tell, Miss Ryder is a little whiny and tiresome as a ""spoiled, self-indulgent little girl"" (as Whoopi Goldberg in her wise oracle mode describes her).  It's never quite clear what her problem is other than that she would rather write than go to college and that her mother doesn't appear to like her very much.  (She won't even accompany her daughter to the institution; she has to go over in a cab!) Miss Jolie has also been indulged by director James Mangold to showboat all over the place in a sort of female Jack Nicholson role as the toughest cookie in the place.  Now if someone had only known that all it took to break her was to tell her she was coldhearted and dead inside, she wouldn't have been in there for eight years!  Implausibilities abound:  Security appears to be largely non-existent and the girls seem to have the run of the place.  In one absurd sequence they adjourn to the basement for some bowling and then break into the head doctor's office to check out their files.  When Ryder wants to get a musical instrument out of the supply room after hours she simply asks Jolie for the keys!  Generally, the film is well made: director Mangold interweaves the flashbacks that dot the first half-hour in a very skillful manner; for once, I felt that I could even keep track of what was going on.  The film is absorbing in the manner of such flamboyant mental institution/prison melodramas of yore as ""The Snake Pit"", ""Caged, "" ""The Caretakers"" or ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.""  I just didn't buy most of it, the ultra-sentimental wrap-up least of all.",,Anonymous,Biography
The importance of friendship!,"Girl, Interrupted is one of the top ten best movies of 1999 (better than the highly overrated American Beauty and the tedious The Green Mile), an involving and interesting drama that catches your attention from start to finish without appealing to over-the-top and exaggerated dramatic scenes.It's a fresh, agile and often funny entertainment that leaves you by the end with a smile on the face .In my point of view, the main theme wasn't the question of ""what's sane and what's insane"", the real goal was to show how friendship is important for our lives and how it's imperative to keep a good-heart and be noble and human even at the most disgusting moments of life. In another director's hands, Girl, Interrupted could ended up being the typical Hollywood tear-jerker, but I have to give kudos for James Mangold (the guy responsible for the efficient and underrated Copland), who inspired terrific performances by a great cast (specially by Brittany Murphy, she is an actress you should keep an eye on - expect to hear a lot about this talented, beautiful and charming young woman on the years to come) and told the story in a realistic manner(what makes Girl, Interrupted seems a little bit hard in some parts), but also leaving a positive and upbeat felling in the audiences as the story develops the relationship between the characters. That's when we understand that a friend always makes a difference in our lives.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Not mad, just stupid","No subject has been worse treated in cinema than mental illness, and Girl, Interrupted comfortably lives down to the standard of films like The Snake Pit, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and the jaw-droppingly dreadful Dudley Moore comedy Crazy People. To be fair, it's bad in a mildly original way. Instead of following the ""mad people are really more sane than us"" line (a cruel and sentimental lie), the fantasy of mental health care as social repression (asylums as gulags of the soul), or the pop-Freudian approach popular in films of the 1940s and 1950s, it presents mental illness as a lifestyle option that marks out the really cool and interesting young person (and a great way of annoying your parents). This spark of originality, however, is what makes the film (and the book) so outstandingly detestable.Winona Ryder's character, like most of her fellow inmates, is not mentally ill by any clinical definition. She's just bored, neurotic, self-obsessed and given to acting out little psycho-dramas to attract attention - in other words, a western-world teenager of privileged background, only more extreme than most. In time she would grow up, quit reading Sylvia Plath, and realise that other people exist. In the meantime, all the treatment she needs is some basic Dr Spock behaviour management from her parents, and maybe a stint of voluntary work with a charity that helps people with real problems.The success of this film is a depressing comment on our narcissistic culture and an insult to the millions of mostly ordinary, unglamorous, and poor people who have to live in the miserable, frightening, and stigmatising world of mental illness.If you want to see a film that at least tries to deal honestly and humanely with this subject, try Family Life, by Ken Loach, or Samuel Fuller's slightly sensationalist but insightful Shock Corridor. David Mamet's House of Games, though it's not about mental illness, contains a short scene in a mental hospital, in which a patient utters a single line of script that says far more about the nature of madness than the whole of Girl, Interrupted. To commit the artistic crime of altering a Bob Dylan lyric (by switching the gender words from male to female), there are a couple of lines in Visions of Johanna that sum up this repulsive film perfectly: ""Little girl lost, she takes herself so seriously/ She brags of her misery, she likes to live dangerously ..."" But not too dangerously, of course. Just enough to be cool.",,Anonymous,Biography
A passionate and challenging portrayal of institutional insanity,"This is not a story of good guys and bad guys. A subtle, multi-layered portrait of mental disorder and reactions thereto. Intriguingly, it is eschews fashionable ""social constructivist"" approach to psychology: that psyches are merely ""constructs"" of their society/gender/class (take your pick). The heroine, Suzanna, begins by denying her suicidal tendency and signs herself into a psychiatric institute. She becomes acquainted with her inmates and her keepers. This drama, set in the 'Sixties, relays her relationship with the external institution from which she cannot escape and the personal strictures imposed upon herself to which she is bound. ""Escape"" and the conundrum of escaping oneself is a central remit of this character study. Picaresque in nature, the thematic substance is revealed in the subtle remarks and clamorous exchanges. Unlike ""Idioterne"", mental disorder is not portrayed as the sole rational reaction to society - that, in a world gone mad, ""being mad"" is the only authentic (truthful, even) response. This movie surpasses ""One Flew . . ."" in its depiction of mental illness. We cannot cheer the protagonist at the end, because this is not a cheer-leading exercise. Rather, this is a satisfying evocation of the Mental Health System and its stumbling attempts to prepare people for Normal Life.",,Anonymous,Biography
Reminded me of visiting a friend.,"My ex husband was a Schizophrenic....this movie was very realistic...the meds call....the isolation lockup....checks...all rang a bell and was genuine in the way it was done.  The only thing I thought was a bit much was the cat....would never have been allowed in a mental institution, and the underground bowling place...I don't think so...although it could have been possible. Jolie excels as Lisa Rowe...she was fun and oh so talented....I have to see her in other films now!!!!  Wynona Ryder was good.. I liked her better in Edward Scissorhands... Wynona was a bit weak....I do believe she has lost the spunk she had in other films....But Miss Jolie was marvelous....so charismatic and likeable. Yep, it felt like I was visiting a friend.

what's border-line?,"Initially, I must have mistaken its  meaning and therefore I don't like it. But  reflecting upon this movie I understand the reason for my irrational judgment.Probably Susanna 's psyche impressed me so much that her destiny was my destiny and, incredible to say, our destiny.Susanna was fallen into an infernal circle of sadness, rage, crazy, far from every ray of hope ... the magnetic compass of her mind was crazy ... she was not able to direct it. Susanna knows she must pass through the hell to arrive to the knowledge of herself but the way is not easy.Her way is the same way which we travel, every day.It is not important if the movie is good or bad but it is crucial  that it raises doubts.",,Anonymous,Biography

angelina steals this film,"angelina jolie totally blew me away in this film. probably the most charismatic and talented actor of recent times. overall this is a great watchable film but angelina steals the show as a sociopath that could charm the pants off you with her natural aplomb and charisma, she makes the screen come to life and you cant wait for the next scene with her in it. the supporting cast is great too and it just manages to avoid the hollywood shmalz. Winona Riders performance nearly crosses the line of being cheesy at times but generally she is good. this highlights a serious issue that has been dealt with before but stands out from the rest mainly because of the nearly all female cast and the humour. even though this is a drama there were a few laugh out loud moments for me. touching, funny, tragic and sad at times, great film.",,Anonymous,Biography
"not bad, but not really convincing","I found Girl, Interrupted fairly interesting but ultimately unconvincing and I put this largely down to one thing: the feeling that Winona Ryder's ""Susanna"" was an observer of the institution in which the film is set rather than a resident.The opening of the film is composed of an interesting array of incidents of Susanna's life thus far, and jumps around through time between them. As Susanna describes her experience of being ""unable to control time"" to her doctor, we are clearly supposed to gather that this non-linear progression represents Susanna's experience of her illness. (Although, frankly, I wasn't aware that many people could ""control time"". I'm sure I can't).But from this promising beginning nothing develops. After her first dream- (or hallucination-) filled night on the ward, there is no sign whatsoever of Susanna's illness. She spends her time getting to know, and in some cases helping, the other patients but gives the impression more of a journalist doing research than a patient receiving treatment. At one point she becomes depressed by the behaviour of Lisa (the excellent, and much more intriguing Angelina Jolie) and the death of a fellow patient, but even this manifests itself as nothing more than a reluctance to get out of bed. At no point do we get an insight into why she is still there or what she requires treatment for.Whilst I do grasp that part of the point of the movie is that she was never really all that ill, and was sent to the institution as much for her parent's convenience as for her own mental well-being, she clearly does consider herself to have been ill and to be ""better"" by the time she leaves. I simply never really noticed any symptoms during most of her stay, from which she could be said to need to recover.",,Anonymous,Biography
Electrifying Performance in a Moving Vehicle,"I rented this movie not knowing exactly what to expect. What I got was an absolutely electric performance from Oscar winner Angelina Jolie. I am not just some guy who thinks she's hot or anything, but I am your average 15 year-old girl, and I could identify with Winona Ryder's character. But Angelina Jolie in this film reminded me of a few friends of my own, and every time I watch this movie I am mesmerized by her acting. She's tough, but at the same time vulnerable, and despite all of her attitude, she tries to make people happy in the way she knows how. I would watch this movie a thousand times just to see her acting it it. I give her performance a 10 out of 10, and I know this performance is not just a fluke... for her short screen time in ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" she sure can keep a movie moving.",,Anonymous,Biography
A great movie about self-discovery,"""Girl, Interrupted"" is a fantastic movie. Although I can't say I'm a huge fan of the director James Mangold (""Heavy"", ""Copland"")'s other work, though. The ensemble of Winona Ryder (""Heathers"", ""Reality Bites""), Brittany Murphy (""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""Clueless""), Clea DuVall (""The Faculty"", ""The Astronaut's Wife""), Elizabeth Moss (""Mumford"", ""Anywhere But Here""), Jared Leto (""Urban Legend"", ""Fight Club""), Jeffrey Tambor (""There's Something About Mary"", ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle""), Vanessa Redgrave (""Mrs. Dalloway"", ""Cradle Will Rock""), Whoopi Goldberg (""Ghost"", ""Boys on the Side"") and Mary Kay Place (""The Big Chill"", ""Being John Malkovich"") is fantastic.

"Dumb, obvious","I don't know why I got sucked into this movie. From the first few minutes I knew the entire plot and ending. I also found Winona Ryder to be increasingly more irritating. She is not that talented and she isn't even cute any longer.The dramatic twists in this movie are so obvious you would have to be a complete moron to not see them coming.Mostly, Winona Ryder's character doesn't seem all that mentally sick. Maybe in the 60s being depressed and wanting to die were grounds for instituionalization. But today - hell, half the people I know are like Ryder's character Susanna. Who the hell is happy with their life? Susanna just isn't a convincing patient. She doesn't seem all that sick and her hospital doesn't seem all that horrible. Hell, that hospital looked downright plush. Who wouldn't want to stay there?Moreover, there is very little discussion of why Susanna is sick? Oh sure, she tried to kill herself - but so what. What about her parents, her life, her issues. All of this is glossed over so we can watch Angelina Jolie scream and say dirty words.However, I must admit, I was taken with Angelina Jolie's performance. I don't know if it was Oscar-worthy, but it was very good. She embodied that character very well. Although, as others have suggested, it isn't difficult for Angelina Jolie to play a bad girl. She obviously is a bit of a brat in real life.Its worth seeing for free or on a $1.50 rental. Don't pay full price for it.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Another ""scared to show reality"" mental health story","I was so excited for this movie to come out in the theatres because I had read the book. I was expecting this great, ""tell it like it is"" movie that would help show people what true mental illness was about. Instead, the movie never went in depth to any of the characters until the very end and even then, not very much. The only believable characters were Lisa and the lieing girl (can't remember her name) All the rest were just vague faces and personalities. Winona Ryder could have done a great job, but the lines she had to say made her character shallow. Jolie did a wonderful acting job as Lisa. She made Lisa seem like a real live person. The end when she was screaming (I won't give anything away) truly showed what a great actress Jolie is. Overall this movie set my hopes high and then sent them crashing down. I give this movie a very score of 5 and only that because of Jolie's acting.",,Anonymous,Biography
A new admiration for Jolie,"I love Wynona Ryder, she's one of my favorite actresses, but when I saw Angelina Jolie for the first time in a movie, this movie I was blown away. She was incredible as the likeable sociopath Lisa. I think if any other actress would have played this role I would have not really liked or cared for Lisa at all. But Jolie made her human and gave Lisa life underneath her devilish acts of terror and her hissably cool remarks that stung to the core. Of course beyond this remarkable performance by Jolie (who deservedly won an Academy award for her performance) was Ryder's character, Susanna who I could really identify with and still do. Depression is very real and the experiences she tells about are similar to what I have been through. I'm reading the book right now as well, and Susanna (more in the book) describes a parallel universe and the film displays this too along with other symptoms of depression even showing Susanna sleep a lot and certain noises, like a dog barking, bringing her back to certain places and her mind completely checking out of the present. This film is very thought provoking and well done and Ryder and Jolie are an amazing duo. Brittany Murphy was also powerful as Daisy. This film is a 9 out of 10. Excellent.",,Anonymous,Biography

Quite a disappointment,"Girl, Interrupted is a movie which attempts to relate the rocky, trauma-fraught teenage years of Susanna Kaysen. While I have not read the book, I was interested in the presentation of the subject matter, which has been covered successfully and not-so-successfully in a number of films, such as ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" and ""Lisa, Bright and Dark"".I was quite disappointed. The movie proved to be more of a caricature of the subject matter than any sort of revelation. Having studied the institutionalization period of mental illness treatment history (from the 40's to the 70's), I found the depiction of the psychiatric hospital and its staff to be shallow, one-dimensional, and just plain stupid. A justification could be made that the movie presented this depiction from Kaysen's perspective, but if I were Kaysen, I would be disappointed in the film.Cinematographer Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of ""The Bridges of Madison County"", helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but James Mangold, who did a good job with ""Copland"", strikes out as writer/director in this film. The subject matter provides a lot of freedom to improvise, but Mangold gives us predictability to the point of being hackneyed. The focus is more on the ""hey, man, look at me being crazy"" set of experiences than the true depths of dispair of the characters. Mangold simply doesn't fill out the characters well, missing out on the integrity and depth required from them to connect on an emotional level. He seems to use a story structural mechanism similar to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", where one prominent character (here named Lisa) helps to involve the other characters in the story as associates. However, Mangold misses the key connection in ""One"", that the other characters and their plight provide the motivation for McMurphy's acting-out. That sense of life-and-death for Lisa is not explored in this movie.Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of ""The Bridges of Madison County"", helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but focuses too much on Rather, we have to get sensationalized from the Lisa characterDespite the lack of integrity The acting is good despite the weak script. Wynona Ryder turns a believable, steady performance despite a sense that the script doesn't really explore the intricacies of the character. Angelina Jolie is certainly a fine actress who excels at over-the-top roles, but I didn't find this to be one of her more memorable efforts. I much prefer her in ""Gia"" and ""Foxfire"" than what seems to be a somewhat shrill effort here. I was a bit amazed that she won an Oscar for her work here when there were so many good supporting performances from which to choose. Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave provide familiar, reliable faces for supporting roles.One reviewer described the movie as "" The teen-bopper's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". I agree somewhat with that description, though ""One"" was far superior in almost every area, starting with the storyline. The film probably does succeed best as a vehicle to which troubled teenagers can relate. In a day and age where things move so fast and where so much is expected of children by their peer groups and parents, it's good to have something to which to relate.",,Anonymous,Biography
Thought-provoking,"Girl, Interrupted is such a thought-provoking movie! Based on the real-life experience of Susanna Kaysen, who was in a pyschiatric institution in the 1960s, you really do start to wonder if, in that environment, you would go crazy, the way Susanna almost did. The story itself keeps your interest all the way, and the characters are all very realistic, moving and at times, almost comical. This is not to make light of the very serious issues the film covers - but there are some moments that make you smile, like when the girls go bowling in the basement at night. There were two things that I thought were excellent about this film - the acting, which was top notch, especially Angelina Jolie's fantastic performance as sociopath Lisa and Whoopi Goldberg as the understated nurse Valerie. I also thought that the way the film captured the essence of feeling depressed and mixed up was brilliant - Susanna's flashbacks, and the way very small things had great significance. All in all, I would say Girl, Interrupted is a great movie, and one to watch for anyone who has ever suffered from depression or felt just a little 'crazy'!",,Anonymous,Biography
"The ""Cuckoo's Nest"" for the MTV Generation","""Girl, Interrupted"" is a suspect film that over-achieves due to dynamite performances and formulaic processes that have worked in Hollywood for decades. The film is based on author Susanna Kaysen's (Winona Ryder) 18-month stay in a mental asylum in the 1960s. Writer-director James Mangold goes for something like Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and somewhat succeeds. Instead of men though, the film focuses on women of an asylum. Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie carries the film much like Jack Nicholson did in the aforementioned film. She is an energizer bunny of enthusiasm that the film had to have. Winona Ryder does good work, as she usually does. Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave also do well in limited time. Overall the film is good, but nothing truly special. It lacks the heart and intelligence that made ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" so great in the mid-1970s. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A very good, and sometimes funny, mental health drama based on a true story.","Until I actually rented the DVD I didn't realize ""Girl, Interrupted"", is based on a real person, Susanna Kaysen, who based her book on experiences in 1967 and 1968 as a teenager in a mental institution. As with many, many teenagers, it turns out she is far from being ""crazy"", just lazy about addressing her hang-ups, and resisting ""growing up.""I rate this movie a solid 8 of 10. The acting is uniformly good, including Caryn Elaine Johnson as nurse Valerie. Of course Angeline Jolie won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Winona Ryder, who also produced the movie, has the lead role of Susanna Kaysen, and she does her usual superb job. In a brief role as Dr. Wick, Vanessa Redgrave I feel gave perhaps the most believable performance of all.Many older movies involving mental institutions exaggerate the conditions and happenings in them. This one did not. The portrayals were very realistic, the ""inmates"" as well as the staff. The film did a neat job of relating Dorothy's quest to get home in the ""Wizard of Oz"" to Susanna's quest to get out of the hospital and live a normal life. This worked well for this movie.The DVD has some interesting features, including an interview with the real Susanna Kaysen who is now about 50. In photos of her at 17 she looks remarkably like Winona Ryder's characterization. However, she has not ""aged very gracefully"", if you know what I mean!  :-) The deleted scenes were mostly to shorten the original cut of the film from over 3 hours to just over 2 hours. Parts of the film move a bit slowly and 3 hours would have been way too much. One of the deleted scenes relates the title of the movie to the painting, ""Girl, Interrupted.""Overall a good film, gets you thinking about life, and makes you glad you somehow survived your own teenage years.One more thing. Caryn Elaine Johnson is the real name of Whoopi Goldberg...",,Anonymous,Biography
A trip down memory lane...,"Ah, how accurate a description of a mental institution like in ""Girl, Interrupted"". This movie is (now) my second favorite movie in the past 2 years. Winona Ryder just sparkles in this movie. Angelina Jolie seems to be the attention getter. Clea Duvall as a pathological liar? Maybe, if they went into a bit more character development. Other than that, i give it **** out of ***** stars.",,Anonymous,Biography
It keeps me worm,"I've seen it twice and that is really a lot for me because I don't use to do that. It is worm, fresh -  filed of unusual emotions (and tears)... Angelina Jolie is great! I can even forgive her Tomb Rider! Ps. Oh - and of course Winona Rider... she is perfect as always...",,Anonymous,Biography
I was impressed,"I was not sure what to expect from this movie, and I certainly didn't expect to be touched by it.  All I can say is ""wow"".  I thought this movie would be ""dark"", not at all funny, and depressing.  It was at times sad, but for the most part was not ""heavy"".I was in awe of the acting by all characters, especially Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie (she really plays a bad a** b**** really good), but I think that once again the wonderful people at the academy must have had a pretty hard time deciding on Leading Actress....I have never felt so strongly for a group of characters since ""The Wizard of Oz"", wanting them to succeed, to reach their goal, break out.  Wanting each one to feel better.  Wanting them to be able to move on with their lives.  I felt as though I was with the girls, struggling to find out who I was.The movie moved along quite well, and at no time did I find myself wanting to get up.  It was not dragged out, and for once I did not know what was going to happen.  ""Girl, Interrupted"" didn't unfold all at once, with the majority of the movie dealing with characters trying to solve the problem, but rather everyone's story unfolded as the movie progressed.  From Daisy, to ""Torch""  to Lisa, giving the viewer insight into their inner workings.If you get a chance, see it on DVD, just for the extra features, such as deleted scenes (it is from one of the deleted scenes we get the Title)8 out of 10",,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting movie,"Girl Interrupted is a very good movie that I recommend everybody to watch. It reminded me in many ways of that Jack Nicholson´s movie ""One flight over a cuckoo´s nest"" which by the way I found pretty dull.  Angelina Jolie is great in her role and the same comment goes for Whoopy Goldberg and Wynona Rider.  I give it a 8 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Film!!! Jolie at her best!,"After I finished watching this movie, it left me thinking about it for days. It is such an amazing movie with an incredible cast.... Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Whoppi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, and Clea Duvall. Each character fits their part in the movie so well, and there is incredible character development, so good you feel like you know all the characters. Most people think that Winona's acting was a little mediocre... but I thought it was fantastic... no one else in hollywood could portray Suzanna Kaysen as well as Winona did. And Angelina speaks for herself, she won the golden globe and the oscar for her supporting role with no question. Hands down she was the heart and soul of this film. Jolie playing the charismatic and powerful Lisa Rowe who makes friends with the new girl in the ward, Ryder. Together they cause trouble, have fun, and even help some of their other friends at times. They make the best team I have ever seen on the silver screen! With fun music, great acting, great storyline, drama and comedy, this is the best film!!! I give it a 10 out of 10!!",,Anonymous,Biography
Cried my eyes out,"I have seen this movie a few times, but after having a nervous breakdown (psychotic break) in 2006, the movie touched home. It was so cathartic, that I cried the entire movie, at times hyperventilating. It allows you to question your own life and to see the lives of others who struggle with mental illness. There are points in the movie that allow the viewer to question his or her own thoughts on issues regarding life. Mental hospitals have not changed that much except better furniture, better meds that work and no bath tubs. They have showers, now. The humanity shown by some nurses and tech is genuine. Some people really do care when they work in that environment.",,Anonymous,Biography
Compelling,"Girl, Interrupted is a thought provoking, highly intriguing drama, with amazing and Oscar winning performances from Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Elizabeth Moss and Whoopi Goldberg.SOME SPOILERSThe film is set in the 60s when a confused young woman named Susannah Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is admitted to a Mental Hospital. The doctors decide that Susannah has a borderline personality and is Promiscuous. Susannah doesn't even understand her illness so how can she recover from it?Whilst in the Hospital Susannah befriends other inmates such as Polly the sweet, innocent burn victim (Elizabeth Moss), the quiet, shy pathological liar Georgina (Clea DuVall), the blonde confident anorexic girl Janet (Angela Bettis), the sexually abused girl with an eating disorder Daisy (Brittany Murphy) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the strong, confident Sociopath. During her stay Susannah and her friends provide the film with heart-warming, sad, humorous and psychological moments that truly capture what the book intended.Girl, Interrupted is a well shot, brilliantly acted and well structured film with an effective storyline, which captivates audiences. Angelina Jolie deserved her Oscar but wouldn't have achieved the success if it wasn't for those supporting her. Winona Ryder showcased one of her best performances for this film and no other actress could have fit the role of Susannah as well as she did.This film is fantastic and recommended to all.",,Anonymous,Biography
very good,this film was designed to boost winona ryder's film status and was meant to be her film. However it didn't turn out that way and Jolie( who is an incredible actress) ended up getting an oscar. Her performance was outstanding and even though she played a sociopath her cruel jokes were hilarious and you just wanted every scene to have her in. Despite a brilliant performance from angelina jolie and brittany murphy the film was not so clear on how certain things happen to the patients. For example lisa's arm has a wrist band on the elbow and i didn't actually know why that was there. That was until i brought the DVD and realised that the scene explaining that had been deleted.( she had burnt a shape of ruby( the cat) with her cigarette on her arm and the band was to cover it) all in all a very good film (with very catchy songs),,Anonymous,Biography

flawed but rewarding film,"The formula for `Girl, Interrupted' is to take the basic setting and plot situation of `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' strip them of their high-falutin' melodramatic elements and present a somewhat more realistic image of insanity hidden behind the walls of a mental institution.  The risk in such a move is that the film will, also, strip away much of the drama as well.  `Girl, Interrupted' takes the risk and, perhaps predictably, is not a completely satisfying effort as a result.  Long stretches of the film turn into drawn out gabfests in which the girls housed in this Massachusetts institution talk out their issues at frequently excessive length. However, thanks to strong performances by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses, as well as a script filled with occasionally sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness, the film ultimately yields a moving and rewarding cinematic experience for those with the patience to see it through to the end.The film is based on the true-life story of Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who, like many young people in the turbulent 1960's, felt disoriented in the face of great social upheaval and the redefining of traditional roles and came to question her own place in society as a result.  For a fumbled attempt at suicide, Susanna was ultimately consigned to a yearlong stay at a New England psychiatric hospital.  It is her experiences there - and the relationships she forged with other women in her ward - that form the backbone of the film.Several elements serve to undercut some of the credibility of the film. As overseen by an ever-sympathetic head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg), this ward seems woefully lax in its standards of both discipline and security.  The girls seem to run freely and wildly through the corridors at all times, popping in and out of each other's rooms, talking disrespectfully to the staff on hand, entertaining strange young men in their rooms under direct gaze of the people who work there and even bolting from the place entirely with astonishing frequency.  Moreover, the girls certainly do not seem to be kept very busy with either chores or therapy sessions and, as a result, we often wonder what exactly the therapeutic modus operandi of this hospital is.  In a weak echo of  `Cuckoo's Nest,' the girls are taken out into a public setting - an ice cream parlor - with predictably disastrous results. Even worse in that scene is the confrontation that occurs between Susanna and a friend of her parents who it seems has wised up to the fact that Susanna and her husband once had a sexual fling.  The incredibility is not in the confrontation per se, but in the fact that this mother would make such an embarrassingly public scene right in front of her own understandably chagrined daughter.On the whole, however, the film sports enough virtues of performances and writing to triumph over its flaws.  Winona Ryder, in what might well be her finest performance to date, conveys the combination of melancholic wistfulness and hard-edged cynicism essential to her essentially decent but deeply troubled character.  Neither the writers, Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, nor writer/director James Mangold ever allow us to bank on the extent of Susanna's madness.  Since she herself is never quite sure whether she is truly insane or just deeply depressed and emotionally confused, we are never given the opportunity to peg her with a pat diagnosis either.  The same goes for her fellow inmates, particularly Lisa, stunningly portrayed by Angelina Jolie, whose often-lethal combination of beguiling charm and cold-blooded ruthlessness, keeps us as off balance as it does Susanna.Certainly, mental illness is one of the most difficult conditions to render credible on the screen.  The risks lie in either overstating the mannerisms and actions into seeming absurdity or of providing resolutions that ring hollow in their upbeat simplicity.  `Girl, Interrupted' falls into both traps occasionally, but the fact that it is a work culled from a real person's personal experiences makes us more prone to accept it at face value.   At times the girls seem too facile in their respective natures - one is a pathological liar, one a repressed lesbian, one a deceitful sociopath, one a self-deluded incest victim etc. - yet each character also contains her personal element of truth and validity.  Only Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Nurse Ratched character rings untrue.  Perhaps Goldberg has simply gone once too often to this particular well - that of the overly sympathetic authority figure dripping heartfelt sincerity all over the miserable and the hurting.  As an actress, she has long ago lost her edge.Still, for all its weaknesses, `Girl, Interrupted' emerges as a genuinely poignant and moving study of a group of hurting individuals groping towards each other for hope and understanding.  For all the voices of reason shouting at us to question its authenticity, we find ourselves wanting desperately to believe in this unusual and thought-provoking tale",,Anonymous,Biography
"Worth it for Ryder, as always","Girl, InterruptedAfter a failed suicide attempt, a sad teenage woman named Susanna (Winona Ryder) is sent to Claymoore, a mental institution in suburban Boston. It is there that Susanna reluctantly tries to find the help that she needs. Ingratiating herself in the microcosm of the hospital, Susanna is confronted with true mental instability and tries to reach within her newfound friends and see why she has resisted life for so long.From the novel by Susanna Kaysen, GIRL, INTERRUPTED can be easily summed up as a female ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but that doesn't necessarily do justice to GIRL. Directed by James Mangold (COPLAND), GIRL is a very satisfying, moving drama with an arresting cast of twenty-somethings on the brink of stardom. Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy (CLUELESS), Clea Duvall (THE FACULTY), and Whoopi Goldberg head the cast with the aforementioned Ms. Ryder. There is a swimming pool full of talented people to gaze upon in this film, yet the raw talent of Ryder makes it worth the time. Angelina Jolie makes another misstep in her career (after BONE COLLECTOR) by playing her unstable character Lisa like the rebel wild child that mirrors Jolie in real life. This might be explained away as a character trait, but too many moments in GIRL showcase Jolie absurdly playing to the rafters. An actress of such uncontested power, Jolie suffers from trying to conquer the world with a performance that is often without subtlety. While the current rash of awards keeps the glow on Jolie, Ryder turns in one of her best performances. As the meek and confused Susanna, there isn't a false moment anytime Ryder is onscreen.The trouble with GIRL is the predictable - but needed - attempt to ground the somewhat lighthearted first half of the film into hard core drama. Like the schizophrenic personalities that inhabit Claymoore, GIRL, INTERRUPTED is like watching two completely different films at once. An experience that is positively frustrating. Trying hard to keep the focus steady, Mangold lets the film get away from him in the second act; with a climax that does little to resolve the story.It is Ryder and most of the cast that makes GIRL end up being a winner. You walk away from GIRL, INTERRUPTED with the nagging feeling that most of the details are missing, yet satisfied that the film gave us such a wealth of talent to behold.------- 7",,Anonymous,Biography
I really enjoyed this!,"Well when I saw this on imdb.com a long time ago I couldn't wait for this film to come out! I got so excited that I ran out and got the book and read it. I thought the book was amazing and was so nervous to see the movie and the movie was just as great as the book. I can definitely say that Winona Ryder has grown wonderfully in her acting career. I thought she played the role of Susanna Kaysen remarkably. I pictured Winona playing that part when I read the book. I thought the story line and how they wrote was fantastic and the acting was beyond amazing.......it was miraculous and I am very happy to be writing this review because everyone who made this movie should be very proud of themselves. Angelina Jolie was beautiful playing Lisa the way she did. She definitely deserved her Oscar for that! She was fantastic as the psycho Lisa and i am very impressed by her. I was impressed by her ever since watching GIA, she has such amazing talent and hope she never stops performing her gift. I give this film 10/10 stars!!",,Anonymous,Biography
Don't miss this one!,"One of the best movies of the year. Wynona Rider is as impressive as ever. Same for Angelina Jolie. The movie's kind of slow, but after you've watched it, leaves you with a lot of thoughts lingering here and there. The movie progresses in a very novel story style. Very emotional movie and it was actually Winona Ryder who actually steals the show. Angelina Jolie's performance was terrific, but the best thing about the movie was about the realities of life. And this is one movie which you won't forget for a long time...........",,Anonymous,Biography
