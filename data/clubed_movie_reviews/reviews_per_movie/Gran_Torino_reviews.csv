"Strong performance from the leading man, very good film.","After his wife dies, Korean Water veteran Walt Kowalski busies his life with small household jobs and snarling at his family, until his young neighbour tries to steal his car.It's a film you really do need to be in the mood for, as it is an intense watch, and could definitely be seen as heavy going. What I've always enjoyed about it, the touches of humour that pop up every now and then, I also think the film is very relatable.What stands out, is the superb direction, the powerful storyline, and the performance of the leading man.I think Clint Eastwood does a really fine job as Walt, he really is a tormented soul, you really do feel as though he's a man on the edge, totally disillusioned by life and everything around him, I'd seen it a great performance. I think Bee Vang is great as Thao too.When I first saw it, and still to this day, his spitting really does gross me out, although it fits the character, designed to make us feel strongly about him perhaps.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino,"Clint Eastwood is simply great both in front of and behind the camera.Eastwood is as great as Walt Kowalski, a man who, behind his rough exterior, deeply feels the world around him. Through humor and deep emotions, this film shows us that people are complicated and life is unpredictable.Such films are rare, and nowadays they are almost non-existent. The development of the main character and the depiction of his emotions and internal conflict are interesting, which is exactly the basis of the film.There is also a bit of humor in the film, located exactly where it should be and thus creates that necessary balance against the cruel reality.The script is brilliant, and Clint Eastwood turned it into a great film, managing to evoke tension and feelings, as well as the inner struggle of the characters.The film is superbly directed and easily guides the viewer through the story. The cinematography is excellent, as is the photography. The soundtrack fits perfectly into the atmosphere of the film.This is an old-fashioned drama with interesting characters that are not one-dimensional but complicated and layered. Unfortunately, the actor who plays the character of Thao is simply not a good actor, but the rest of the cast played their parts excellently.I was particularly impressed by Ahney Her in the role of Sue, and Clint Eastwood is equally excellent in the role of Walt Kowalski. Also, Christopher Carley excellently portrayed the character of Father Janovich, a young and somewhat naive priest, whose character is also interesting and develops throughout the film.A great, powerful and inspiring film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Would Have Made A Perfect Finish,"If Clint Eastwood had retired after Gran Torino, it might have been one of the most perfect endings to an iconic actor's career. Walt Kowalski is like Harry Callahan or number of Eastwood characters from his past only, like the vessel they're protrayed through, older. He's the crusty, cynical tough-guy who deep inside is a bit softer and has a warmer than you'd expect heart. Which is the truth we see revealed in Kowalski over the course of this movie as he befriends and helps the Hmong kid next door. There might be enough of these movies to constitute an entire subgenre of friendship films: one involving an older guy who learns a little about life while teaching a boy to be a man. It's a friendship story and even what you'd call a feel-good one despite the violence and negativity surrounding it. The film aims for authenticity though I think bits of it will be seen by posterity as dated, false hollywood depictions.Maybe the later movies kept him busy but this is where Eastwood's career as an actor should have (and in a sense did) end.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Laughed at the start. Cried at the end,"A modern day masterpiece. There is really no movie that is so funny, however, so moving at the same time. A true cultural masterpiece that puts political correctness to shame. We are all equal and Gran Torino does a fine job of letting us know. One of Clint Eastwood's greatest. Acting and directing.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Yet another Eastwood gem,"I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about ""Gran Torino"" based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be 'badass' again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. ""Gran Torino"" is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it's a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I'd go as far as saying that it's one of Eastwood's finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.I'm not going to argue that ""Gran Torino"" has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn't. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. It's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood's tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.Whether or not ""Gran Torino"" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood's beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood's image. I don't mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.It's a more intimate film than Eastwood's other film this year, ""Changeling"", and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it's just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of ""Gran Torino"" I had forgiven any flaws it might have, and was completely satisfied with the film, which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that ""Gran Torino"", which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a 'minor' Eastwood film by some), will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood's filmography.",,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood shows you why he still should be in FRONT of the camera,"With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing Film...Eastwood deserves an Oscar!!!,"I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An absolute cinematic gem!,"As Clint Eastwood reaches the end of his life, he presents us with yet another performance which is nothing short of legendary. Wishing to preserve the element of surprise, I will not reveal anything by trying to analyse this great work of art.I will say this. There are similar qualities to his previous work, but I would say that both his directing and acting have reached a level of maturity comparable to that of an excellent wine. The story was compelling and, mixed with the drama was a refined touch of humour; the perfect combination for a pleasant evening.I would like to finish by thanking Mr. Eastwood for sharing this touching moment with his audience at a time when most of the cinematic ""art"" produced in Hollywood consists of stunts and bad jokes.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint is the best director in Hollywood and still one of the great actors,"seeing the trailer for this film kinda made me expect id be watching Dirty Harry in the suburbs.What I saw was a bittersweet superbly written, well acted story of humanity and friendship,this film is something that we can all relate to in some way, and isn't Hollywooded up in anyway, the film tells it story without any un needed hidden undertones that so many mainstream directors do to films.Eastwood is excellent as the hard nosed war vet, and his direction is perfect as always, and supporting cast did there job just fine tooClint Eastwood was perfect for the role and as director, as he has the knack of taking a story and making a film for the audience to get sucked into the story, and not for critics to pick apart....great film making,",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Another top-notch, Clint Eastwood film that entertains and teaches.","Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him). He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect, so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And, trust must be earned.If this is Clint Eastwood's last film, I can only say that that his performance, in this stunning film, is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in ""Milk"" (Sean Penn), ""Australia"" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), ""Changeling"" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and ""The Dark Knight"" (a riveting performance by ""Brokeback Mountain's"" Heath Ledger). In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person, I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk, I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But, I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And, ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film, without saying that they haven't learned something, or without saying (just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing) 'there's no business (quite) like show business'. I rank ""Gran Torino"" (2008) a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact, his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in ""Nobody's Perfect"".",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unveiling of the Heart,"""Gran Torino,"" directed by Clint Eastwood, is a poignant and powerful exploration of redemption, cultural clash, and the complexities of human relationships. Eastwood not only directs but also stars in this gripping drama as Walt Kowalski, a cantankerous Korean War veteran grappling with the changing world around him.At its core, ""Gran Torino"" is a character study of Walt, a man hardened by his past traumas and prejudices, but whose humanity is gradually revealed through his interactions with his Hmong immigrant neighbors. Eastwood's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing as he navigates Walt's transformation from a bitter loner to a reluctant mentor and protector.Thematically, ""Gran Torino"" delves into issues of racism, xenophobia, and the search for redemption. Through Walt's reluctant friendship with his Hmong neighbors, the film confronts the stereotypes and misconceptions that divide communities and explores the possibility of reconciliation and understanding across cultural divides.The supporting cast, comprised largely of first-time actors from the Hmong community, deliver authentic and moving performances that add depth and authenticity to the film. In particular, Bee Vang and Ahney Her shine as Thao and Sue, Walt's young neighbors who challenge his prejudices and ultimately become his surrogate family.""Gran Torino"" is also notable for its gritty and realistic portrayal of urban decay and social alienation. Eastwood's direction captures the bleakness of Walt's surroundings, painting a stark portrait of a world in decline while also finding moments of beauty and humanity amidst the despair.In conclusion, ""Gran Torino"" is a masterful piece of cinema that resonates with emotional depth and authenticity. Through its powerful performances, thought-provoking themes, and unflinching portrayal of societal issues, it transcends its genre trappings to become a timeless exploration of the human condition. A film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, ""Gran Torino"" is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling to provoke thought, evoke emotion, and inspire change.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint Eastwood, the master of Hollywood","Clint Eastwood returns for another outstanding performance. Is this even his magnum opus?This year I began to watch Clint Eastwood movies. I started with Leone's dollar trilogy. Watched Leone's magnum opus, the best western ever made, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Then followed him creating his own productions, ""High Plains Drifter"", ""Hang em high"", the brilliant ""Escape from alcatraz"". Then I reached his first peek, the anti-western ""Unforgiven"", witnessed the end of the genre I love. But Eastwood did not stop there... In 2004 he released the great, emotional sport-drama ""Million Dollar Baby"" delivering not only as an actor but with directing qualities, the Spielberg's and Scorsese's cannot top. It was then, when I was saying: That's it, this was his last big title...Then I saw Gran TorinoFrom the first seconds on he had me. I knew that I was watching something huge.In the last days, weeks and months I have been watching a lot of so-called ""classics"", best picture winners and IMdB Top 250 movies. Let me tell you something: Most of them and I am speaking of about 80 percent of them are GARBAGE. You heard right, most of the movies that are critically acclaimed could not keep up to their hype. I could list countless of examples, man I could fill my own 250 list with those!!But let me tell you, that those other 20 percent are extraordinary, some of them could even change your life and the way you are seeing things. Gran Torino is one of these masterpieces.Starting with Clint Eastwood in his double role as leading actor and director. Never, NEVER have I seen acting as extraordinary as that of Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. He is funny, he is dangerous, he's the old war veteran, he's the grumpy grandpa, he's the nice old gentleman, etc., etc. You name it, he can play it.This combined with a picture perfect directing, I mean there are literally no flaws to identify, whether you speak of camera work or the choice of setting. EVERYTHING fits.And the story is written in the most extraordinary way. This movie is emotional, funny, serious and most important, it will change your view of life, at least it has changed mine. I do not want to spoiler anything, so I will not expand on that, but trust me this movie is special.So closing this review, I give you the ultimate recommendation, the green light. This is more than worth watching, it is, until today, Eastwood's last big title, and for me his MAGNUM OPUS.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mainly for Clint Eastwood fans,"Despite all the rave reviews, which I don't understand, I didn't think this movie was made very well. It was mainly the acting and the writing. CLint Eastwoods performance was great, but everybody else was bad. From the Young preacher to the main Hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before, which according to IMDb is mostly true.Right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. The Hmong actor during a climatic scene with Clint Eastwood seemed fake, forced and just not very good. Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor, so it was quite noticeable.The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies, usually low budget, with fresh new actors, and simple plot lines, with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River. Although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause I'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects, but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood excels at storytelling,"Gran Torino - They don't make them like they used to....Mr. Eastwood has a knack for storytelling. Instead of being preachy or having an all to obvious agenda, he lets his viewers make up their own minds. His characters don't have a message, they have a life and make no excuses for who they are. In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie, you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those ""life's important messages"", but rather with a movie saying ""Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you, but in the end it's your own life. However, you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don't want to see or experience!"". Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched, others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people ""get it"" and others ""don't"", but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.Eastwood's acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine, but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 10/10.Apart from that there is little to criticize. It's not an action movie, not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy (even though you get a few laughs out of this one). It's simply a good story about life.....and death.",,Anonymous,Drama
A very well done and powerful film,"I saw Gran Torino mainly as an admirer of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as director. And I was very impressed, there were parts that amused me and others that had me moved. Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sour Humour and Pure Badassery,"If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can't bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood's direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.Following the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him', but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt's life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
This unusual Eastwood drama turns out to be one of his very best films,"Once rumoured to be another film in the DIRTY HARRY saga, GRAN TORINO is actually much, much more than a crime film. It's not even an action film, or a thriller, despite containing elements from those genres: in actual fact, it's a solid human drama about human relationships, along with ruminations on plenty of issues affecting today's world: immigration, integration into society, crime, violence, friendship, life and death, regret. I can't imagine anyone but Clint Eastwood starring in this film. Eastwood plays his usual character, except older, more frail than more; perhaps the word I'm thinking of is 'more human'. Whatever, he's absolutely astounding in this film, giving a brilliant performance as Walt Kowalski, a foul-mouthed, irritable old racist who gradually uncovers his humanity as the story progresses.Eastwood surrounds himself with a cast of unknowns, and these actors are also triumphant. Bee Vang, as Thao, Eastwood's initial enemy and then friend, has to be singled out as giving one of the best turns, and he's matched by Ahney Her who plays his sister, Sue. I loved the performances of these two actors, who successfully manage to hold their own against Clint.GRAN TORINO is a film firmly rooted in reality, which is why there are no gung-ho heroics here, no scenes of grandeur. The ending is particularly true to life, a neat twist that defies audience expectations. The script is sparkling and witty, never losing focus of the main themes, and also particularly moving without being sentimental. It's a difficult line to walk, but this film manages it. In all, a delight and one of the best Eastwood movies I've watched. This one's a keeper.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great feel-good movie with both comedy and tragedy at the same time,"This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Gran Torino"" devastates the viewer and questions him about loyalty to family, the importance of beliefs and the changes that life can bring","Winner of two Oscars for best director, for The Unforgivables (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004), Clint Eastwood does not cease to surprise, to mess with the identity of the USA. In 2006, he revisited the Second World War with great lucidity and critical sense, in this case the American campaign in the Pacific, with The Conquest of Honor and Letters from Iwo Jima, shot in sequence. He also released The Case of Richard Jewell, about the Atlanta bombing during the Olympic Games.Gran Torino follows the life of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a retired worker and Korean War veteran who spends his days doing small home repairs and drinking beer. Widower, moody and with a totally troubled relationship with his children, Kowalski ends up approaching the young Asian Thao (Bee Vang) after he gets involved with a local gang and is forced to steal the grumpy old man's car. Despite his contempt for Asians, blacks and Latinos, Kowalski slowly develops an appreciation for the young man and his sister Sue (Ahney Her), realizing he has much more in common with their family than his own.Walt Kowalski, his character in Gran Torino, is certainly one of the most backward and obnoxious Eastwood has ever played. A staunch republican, conservative to the very last hair, we meet him for the first time during his wife's wake, probably his last contact with the civilized world. It's all up to him now, a being obviously unfits for social contact. He doesn't make a point of pleasing anyone, and he always has a complaint on the tip of his tongue - the granddaughter who doesn't dress properly, the children who are self-serving, the self-serving mother-in-law, the novice and inexperienced priest. Now, even worse for him is what has become his neighborhood. Once a suburban neighborhood typical of American families in the 1950s, with margarine commercials, today it has become a haven for illegal aliens and a haven for violence and abuse. But he's a survivor, and he's standing there. Where will he stay until he's knocked down?The plot begins when the boy next door, a teenager of Hmong origin (Southeast Asia, region between Laos and Vietnam), tries to break into the precious Gran Torino - a Ford model, full of style and more American impossible - as a test in a race test. Initiation into a gang. As the boy is caught, Kowalski kicks him out of his garage. But failure will have consequences, and when the other mobsters show up to take Thao (Bee Vang) to another challenge, it's the old neighbor who ends up saving his ass. Gradually, they develop a relationship of protégé and teacher, as does the boy's older sister, Sue (Ahney Her). But they don't live in a capsule, and the social tensions that surround them will soon send them into shock again. And it will be at this point that Kowalski will have to decide if he will follow the same path of a lifetime of ghosts and delusions or show that he is capable of change and sacrifices in the name of the greater good.Gran Torino is a film that delivers much more than it promises. From the trailer, at the time of its release, it can only be read as the story of the old-fashioned and prejudiced old man who, by his brute and rude ways, ends up coming into conflict with bandits very different from those he met in the war more than 50 years ago, while at the same time it becomes the guardian of an entire community. But, on the other hand, those who dedicate themselves will find an emblematic tale of power and surrender, of solidarity and multi-layered justice. There's a lot more to be discussed here than trying to guess who will be the protagonist's heir. The Gran Torino is more than a car, but a symbol of an era that, if it doesn't come back, needs to know how to adapt to a controversial and problematic world that takes shape every day.The director's intention is clear: to show that what we think we know is not always what it seems (the old maxim of not judging a book by its cover). Something even better, however, comes from Eastwood's honesty in not ""selling"" Kowalski or his worldview as better than others. It does just the opposite when the character slowly realizes that she has much more in common with the Asian family she so despised (due, for example, to the respect for traditions and elders perpetuated among them) than with her own family, making closer and closer to Thao, Sue and their families than he could ever have imagined. As if he also proposed to reflect on his convictions.Despite this interesting and efficient way of approaching different visions of the world in a totally honest way, not everything is rosy. Bee Vang and Ahney Her's performances are incredibly weak, even more so when placed next to someone like Clint Eastwood, who has been working in art for at least five decades. To be aware, even the actress' walk at certain times seems totally forced and artificial, as well as Vang's outbursts of rage when he was locked in the basement against her will (this scene even embarrasses others).The first half hour of the film makes it very clear that Walt is an ignorant. Slowly, there is a construction of a relationship between the surly neighbor with his Asian neighbors, and little by little, he comes to see that he has much in common with the ""Chinese"" than his own family. The feature not only allows seriousness and a vision of hate, but softens certain scenes, to relieve the viewer, with funny dialogues. The film doesn't want to be stuck only with the open prejudice of a character, who regrets and sees that not everything is as it seems.Directing, Eastwood skillfully manages to reflect in the film the toughness of its protagonist. In this sense, it does not resort to appealing drama scenes. Indeed, at the funeral that opens the story, Walt seems angrier than sad about his wife's death. And the funeral that closes the film, and Walt's terminal cycle, does not come as a surprise, as Clint anticipates this outcome in preceding scenes, such as the purchase of a tailored suit.Even the film's editing seems influenced by the main character's characteristics. In fact, dry cuts predominate, even when linking scenes that take place with a long time gap between them. That is, there are no frills, the direction remains hidden. Still, it builds the perceptions that its history claims. For example, notice how Father Janovich looks older when he talks to Walt right after Sue's assault, compared to their meeting at Walt's wife's funeral.However, we can point out moments in the film in which Clint chose to please the audience. One of them results from Walt's sacrifice in the last scenes of the film. At the end, his body is on the ground with his arms outstretched in a cross, in a clear allusion to the sacrifice of Christ. The other of these moments is the reading of the will, which brings that opportunity for the viewer to wash his soul against the protagonist's horrible family. Finally, it is still worth comparing Walt with the vigilante police officer Harry Callahan, who Clint embodied in the Dirty Harry franchise. However, it would be a mature version of him, regretful for past atrocities, just as Walt feels about what he did in the Korean War.Although it is not a complete work of one of the most competent filmmakers in Hollywood for sinning in nonsense, ""Gran Torino"" devastates the viewer and questions him about loyalty to family, the importance of beliefs and the changes that life can bring. The feature is, above all, about the (lack of) hope for a less prejudiced and aggressive world. What and how do we value life and all that is given to us? Are we ready to change? Do we really live in the 21st century? A film to reflect on.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great Clint Eastwood, and that's about it.","The 4 stars are solely for Eastwood's performance, which was top notch as usual. He is like a fine wine, he only gets better.... As for the rest of the movie, a couple of other reviewers have nailed it, but the multitude of people that gave it anywhere from 9 to 10 stars saw a different movie from me. The rest of the acting in the movie is honestly the worst I can remember seeing in a movie. There are times when there is maybe one actor in a movie who is not very polished, but in this movie, there are actor after actor, scene after scene, where aside, from Clint, I thought I was watching a middle school production. And it wasn't ONLY the acting. The dialogue for a large part of the movie was also very forced, unrealistic, and staged. Not great writing here folks. There are a few rewarding moments, and again, Clint's acting and character are superb, but that is not enough to recommend this amateurish, predictable, and pretty unrealistic movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino was quick to identify and portray the losers of globalization,"Wit a little fantasy the oeuvre of Clint Eastwood as an actor is reflected in the oeuvre of Clint Eastwood as a director. Looking at his oeuvre in this was the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone (1964 - 1966) are reflected in ""Unforgiven"" (1992) while ""Dirty Harry"" (1971, Don Siegel) is (partly) reflected in ""Gran Torino"" (2008).Using our fantasy a little longer it is also possible to see ""Million dollar baby"" (2004, Clint Eastwood) and ""Gran Torino"" (2008, Clint Eastwood) as twin films.In both films Eastwood plays a man that has weak familie ties. His son and daughter in law have little time for him and would prefer him moving into a nursing home. To compensate for this Walt Kowalski (the lead character played by Eastwood) develops pseudo familie ties with the boy next door. He becomes a sort of grandchild for him, just as his pupil in ""Million dollar baby"" becomes a sort of daughter for boxing trainer Frank Dunn.There are also differences between the two films. In ""Million dollar baby"" the feelings of Frank Dunn grow from neutral (he just don't want to be a boxing trainer anymore) to sympathy. In ""Gran Torino"" the feelings of Walt Kowalski grow from hatred (the boy has tried to steal his car) to sympathy.In ""Million dollar baby"" Frank Dunn tries to help his pupil to fulfill her ambitions. In ""Gran Torino"" Walt Kowalski tries to prevent that his boy next door is recruited by a criminal gang.At the beginning of the film Walt Kowalski does not only hate his boy next door because he has tried to steal his car, but also because he is a foreigner. When he came to his neighbourhood it was predominantly white. Over the years this has changed, and Walt doesn't like it.One can condemn Walt for his undeniable racist tendencies (from the beginning of the movie) but one could also look at him as a victim of globalization.Walt Kowalksi had a job in the American car industry and did build the Ford Torino, a model that was produced between 1968 and 1976. In the film he still drives his Torino 72 that is perfectly maintained and is his love and pride.The fact that his son does not make American cars but sells Japanese ones is very painfull for Walt and influences both his relationship with his son and with his Asian neighbors.For a long time globalization was seen as a good thing, enhancing productivity and welfare. Only after the financial crisis of 2008 was discovered that it didn't enhance welfare for everybody and that there were also victims of globalization. Bringing back industrial jobs became a major item in the 2016 American presidential elections. ""Gran Torino"" was quick to identify Walt as one of the losers of globalization.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Impressive character-driven drama with a memorable ending,"If there's any Clint Eastwood film that sums up his 'jack of all trades' reputation, then this one has got to be it. There's nothing that the guy doesn't do, and this peculiar yet powerful character study is the perfect example of that. 'Gran Torino' is a very smart and hugely enjoyable drama film with a brilliant ending that tops off what is a truly great story.It is a story built on characters and friendship where you would least expect to find it. The character development is excellent, and rarely will you find such a convincing and diverse bunch of characters that work so well together. The film's strength is definitely in its simplicity, with the stripped back, raw approach complementing the storyline perfectly.

Clint Eastwood Closes Out His Career With A Bang,"My expectations coming in to see Gran Torino were very high and it certainly did not disappoint. Of course Clint Eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as a director but this time it his performance that leads the way.Clint Eastwood had if not the best performance, one of the best performances this year. His performance was vivid and magical to watch. Vivid may seem like a head scratcher of a word to use but his way of displaying his maliciousness, antisocial and cynical attitude to the many people around him including his family. Yet over the course of the movie his attitude changes towards a Hmong family who are his neighbors. When one of the boys (Thao) from the neighbors' attempts to rob him of his Gran Torino, the family sends him to work for Walt (Clint Eastwood) as punishment. While Thao works for Walt, Walt begins to form a protective fatherly type bond over Thao. In this way as well Eastwood's performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into a very warm selfless demeanor towards one family.Gran Torino was also written and directed very well. Especially since a relatively unknown cast played to beyond anyone could have expected. Some how Clint Eastwood manages to continue to maximize the potential of the material he is given.This was a very heart-warming film in my mind throughout. The ending of the film is probably more of an ending to Eastwood's career as an actor rather than that of the movie itself. It does not leave him in the place he is looked at as a vigilante but rather in the place of the man that stands up for his morals and for the people he is loyal to.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
I'm sorry - this movie is not good,"I'm sorry to all those people who think this movie is so great, but I strongly disagree. Here are the reasons this movie is horrible. I gave it a 6, because it has a cool car & good production value.REASON #1 THE ACTING - the acting in this film is horrible & melodramatic - yes even Clint.REASON #2 - CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, as in what character development? I found it difficult to care about any of the main characters or what happened to them.REASON #3 THE PLOT, cmon I already saw the Karate Kid - you can't fool me.REASON #4 IS THAT CLINT EASTWOOD SINGING? I'm not sure but during the end credits I swear it is Clint Eastwood singing, BTW He can't sing.REASON #5 RACIAL SLURS - I can take a racial slur or 2 in a movie, hell I could take 10 or 20, but the number of racial slurs used in this movie is so high it made me slightly uncomfortable (I even learned a new one).REASON #6 CLINT ON CLINT ACTION - This movie (Produced, Directed, and Staring Clint Eastwood) was like watching Clint Eastwood stroke himself, his ego that is. His very Dirty Harry character & his big guns? A Senior Citizen able to take on all the evils of the world? There is even a scene where he is clearly a Christ Figure - if you watch this film see if you can spot it - trust me it's not hard. Well at least he drinks PBR.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfect Film,"I don't throw out ""perfect"" often or hardly at all so listen up! This here is a total gem. A real piece of Americana. Clint Eastwood will easily go on the Mount Rushmore of Film Making. ""Gran Torino"" is perfect in every way.Casting is key here. The relatively unknown Asian gang are believable enough throughout to allow Clint to work his magic. The onscreen relationships blossom naturally and beautifully from start to finish. This film was truly robbed of Oscars but that's okay because those awards hardly mean anything these days.This story of life, death, and Loyalty really hits home. Stewardship, Sacrifice, growing up, sharing, and learning are all displayed flawlessly. I truly believe every high school in America should show this film on what it means to be a ""man.""In a perfect world this would be more praised than it is but unfortunately in this messed up world all we can do is appreciate it for what it is and just wish we could enjoy a ride in that truly beautiful Gran Torino.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Teaching The Work Ethic,"At the ripe old age of 78 Clint Eastwood is starting on a whole new career of playing tough old timers who are way past the day when they get the girl in their movies. Except as surrogate daughters which he's done in his past two films, four years apart though they be.In Million Dollar Baby Eastwood plays the gruff very blue collar fight manager Frank Dunn who takes on female prize fighter Hilary Swank and she becomes a surrogate daughter to him. In Gran Torino the process is somewhat reversed, Eastwood is a recently widowed retired auto worker Walt Kowalski, still living in the family home in Detroit in a rapidly changing neighborhood. In fact that neighborhood's been changing for decades, the latest influx being Asians.Despite his gruffness, his outright racism, Eastwood almost in spite of himself gets drawn into an Asian family of Hmong people and develops a father/children relationship with a brother and sister, Bee Vang and Ahney Her. He becomes closer to them than he is with his own children whom he feels have forgotten the American work ethic.Actor Clint Eastwood a veteran of over 50 years in film and television is a man who knows himself and knows the limits and changes that age and infirmity have placed upon him. As his most famous screen character so aptly remarked a man has to know his limitations.Director Clint Eastwood is nothing short of a genius in the performances he got from the two young Asian kids, both of whom were making their screen debuts and in fact from the rest of his Asian cast members, most of whom were new. Both the boy and the girl were just fabulous and so real as kids, not at all like Hollywood teen player types.And both kids face some very typical choices that all youngsters face today, especially those growing up in areas at or below the poverty line. Especially the boy who's being pressured to join a gang. Clint himself is facing old age issues, but he still mentors the kids and in the end does what a man's got to do.It took four years for actor Eastwood to reappear on the screen again. But it was worth the wait. With two back to back hits like Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, I just hope I don't have to wait another four years for Clint to reappear.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
absolutely alluring,"A masterful, moving, must watch movie. Where a Korean war veteran has to adapt to the space surrounding him and the arrival of the Hmong family to the neighborhood.I have to admit that there were parts with excessive fatalism, as many parts of the film were pretty predictable. And, (leaving aside the redeeming performance of Clint EastWood as Walt) some of the actors did not have the most memorable performance I have ever seen.The old veteran is bittersweet and not the most pleasant person to be around with, and as a shaman tells him during the movie ""he is not at peace and worried about his life"", but results to be someone you can rely on even in life-and-death situations (literally). What amused me was the wonderful showcase of this transformation of the gray-haired veteran in a detailed and interesting way, and his uncanny friendship with two asian teenagers, Thao and Sue. The film achieves a balanced game of oxymoron mixing drama with humor. And it shows how war can really affect someone, leaving him with negative side effects, because as the movie unfolds, we realize that the veteran is clearly out of his mind.Personally, I would even rewatch it up to five times more. It has a suspenseful and enticing ending that makes it even more worthy of watching. I would 100% recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

About as good as Hollywood gets,"The current average rating of this film is a joke. Top 100 of all time? Wow... I have to say IMDb ratings are usually quite alright. Even if they may be dead wrong in placing films in the top list, they do give a decent indication of whether the film is lousy or good. But when a film like Gran Torino get's 8.4, it just reminds you how the merely good Shawshank Redemption is supposed to be the best film of all time according to the voters.GT is not a bad film. It's juts mediocre. It's really promising at the start, but once you realize where it's going, with Walt and Tao, the Asian kid, well... It won't disappoint you. It does exactly what you'd expect from a mediocre Hollywood flick and thereby it's very predictable. Clint's acting is not terrible at first, but becomes very clichéd... The storyline itself isn't very believable as it develops. But I suppose it could have been a lot worse.And by the way, it's pretty funny how every other person of polish descent in Hollywood is a ""Kowalski"".

Films don't often get to me like this did, but i had something in my eye at numerous points in the proceedings.Seeing Clint taking care of business one last time was just superb and although the ending may be jarring to long time Clint fans, with a bit of thought it all makes sense.Clint's character is an unapologetic racist and thats that, i fully understand that some people just cannot accept this, but the film doesn't apologise for it and neither should it. You either accept this aspect of the character and in doing so accept that he's not supposed to be a hero, so why is he talking like that ?Or realise that in real life people like this exist, who can be good and bad in the same day, but are not solely defined by either behaviour.There is plenty of warmth in this film and humour, but at its centre is an actor and director who has enjoyed critical and commercial success for nearly 40 years, has redefined genres and broken new ground and has brought me more pleasure than i could have ever thought possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood proves phenomenal once again and triumphs,"Clint Eastwood is now 87 years old as I write this and every bit still the man's man. From his grit your teeth spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry, to Unforgiven Eastwood has shown us WHAT movies are supposed to be. The steely eyed gaze, gruff groveled voice full of growls, grunts and innuendos serves the story of the film right to a tee. Not only does Eastwood serve as Director and Producer he gives a powerful and driven performance as a Korean War vet who for a better lack of words is stuck in those times. He believes in being a soldier, the flag and hates foreigners.The story is great, powerfully delivered of a man who is stuck but learns along the way to forgive and open his eyes and heart. The film delivers a sequence of teachings about friendship, mentoring, bullying, love/hate, gangs and sacrifice.

It seems that he doesn't put much effort in his interpretation of his role, but he still manages to be spot on, even with a small wrinkle or grunt, he can convey more than some other actors could, in a couple of minutes/sentences.

Love Your Neighbor as Yourself ...,"""Gran Torino"" is the prize that Walt Kowalski received, a recognition for his forty-something years as an autoworker in the Ford company. It's big, bad-ass, virile, and 100% made in America  and so is Walt Kowalski.Walt Kowalski is pure Clint Eastwood, with his deadly stances, recurring growls and unique ability to look mean and mean business when he points his shotgun on you. Indeed, when Walt Kowalski utters his ""Get off my lawn"" catchphrase, you can see the heart of Dirty Harry fiercely burning in his eyes, you understand he would defend his property as zealously as Harry for San Francisco's citizens, and that his shotgun is no less menacing than a certain legendary Magnum. This is the Eastwood way, and it's a remarkable credit to his talent that he was able to create such an unforgettable character after Dirty Harry, The Man With No Name, William Munny, to name a few.But the film needed a less bigger-than-life, more ordinary character, if that word could ever been used to describe Eastwood (which man wouldn't dream of looking like him at his late 70's?). The principal issue tackled by ""Gran Torino"" is the innate loneliness of a man lost in his era, the product of a generation born with a certain idea of America, life, men and women. Walt is the typical macho conservative; he enjoys beer, sitting in his balcony with his dog and hanging out with buddies to exchange some crude, racist and homophobic jokes. He's grumpy by nature but the loss of his wife made things even worse and widened the gap between him and his family. The movie opens with his wife's funeral and you can tell how disgusted he is by his grandchildren's playful and insolent behavior. Yet his anger is only an expression of lucidity; he knows he's just a senile old fool for both adults and kids and a promising heritage  with four wheels.And it's important that we share this lucidity because racism in movies is the least likely trait to inspire sympathy yet Eastwood makes it work. Indeed, in the specific case of Walt, if we don't empathize, at least we understand that the man is not viscerally racist but just distant from whatever underlines a difference: his own family is different, let alone strangers. And Walt is so alienated that he can't perceive difference among the others and therefore display an equal level of hostility toward everyone. He fought Koreans in the 50's and like many others narrow-minded bigots, he doesn't make any difference between Japanese, Chinese or Koreans, and although Sue, the sensitive neighbor who felt there was something good inside Walt's heart, insisted that the Hmong are a mountain people from Laos, Walt couldn't care less. They all are 'gooks' or 'chinks', or in the best case 'strangers'.Sue plays a pivotal role as an open-minded girl who understands that Walt's heart is not such an unreachable wall of stones. In the beginning, when the Hmong settle, a simple look at Walt's face gives us an idea about his thought, and the movie flirts with comedy by creating a sort of tacit rivalry between him and the Hmong grandma, when she spitted on the ground, the audience cheered in the theater as if Walt found his match. People genuinely loved Walt not for what he was but despite what he showed to be. He exuded a virile charisma so magnetic that all the meanness was pardonable. Only Eastwood could embody this mix of macho toughness and poignant loneliness. And ironically, this loneliness would eventually cement the friendship with Thao, Sue's younger brother, a calm and studious adolescent and an easy target for his delinquent cousins.Thao represents the total opposition with Walt in every single aspect: culture, generation, personality, they couldn't be more different. But they have one thing in common: they are loners, not by necessity, it's in them. Walt is a stranger for his own Family, as is Thao, surrounded by women and a domineering sister. His manipulability leads him to Walt when he's ordered to steal the Gran Torino for his cousins. Walt forgives but in the Hmong's tradition, it would take more to redeem Thao's action: he must work for Walt. The insistence of the Family wins over Walt's reluctance, and seals the beginning of a bond that would become more and more palpable, even if it's never explicitly expressed. And through the Hmong, Walt discovers a part of himself that was probably repressed for a long time and that put the whole meaning of strangers into perspective as he embraces the curious traditions of his neighbors. And the characterization and interaction featured in the second act are a remarkable example of great film-making as Eastwood found the perfect dosage between sweetness and drama in the mentor/tutorship relationship with Thao.Of course, Eastwood knew we'd know that a hard nose like Walt wouldn't be utterly bad, there had to be a heal to conceal, and that was the hidden element the late Mrs. Kowalski sensed and asked the youngish Father Janovich to discover. While Janovich was immediately dismissed in the opening funeral, he discovered a new Walt capable of opening his heart at the end. But even this aspect is dealt in a clever and unpredictable way. Stereotypical situations wouldn't have ruined the spirit of the film though, because from the character of Walt, we also knew the movie wouldn't end with the kind of sappy happy ending. However, the last shot remains a wonderful tribute to the mysterious mechanisms of love, as we understand what the Gran Torino is about, and only Clint Eastwood could have made such an inspiring message about tolerance without sentimentalism.Who knows? maybe in forty years, we would have a film about an old racist Gulf War veteran who discovers the lifestyle of Muslim neighbors to realize that they are not as bad as they seem.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Very Poor Ending,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie right up to the end. But the end is not good. It stinks on ice.For the end of the movie to work, Eastwood needs outside help. Remember what the Hmong cop told the kid at the end? He said that this time, it would be different because .... Well, that is a young cop. His fellow officers are likely to tell him not to count his chickens before they are hatched. That outside help often dries up and blows away long before it is actually useful.Well, all through this movie situations arise which are very similar to the end scene. All through this movie, that outside help was possible. All through this movie, nobody expected that outside help. And all through this movie that outside help doesn't appear. It doesn't appear from the community at large or from anyone related to any of the victims. It doesn't even come from the victims themselves. Heck, the victims are 100% absolute perfect candidates to give that outside help, but they don't do it either.Still, Eastwood bets everything on it. Apparently his reasoning is: If I do my part, then everybody else will do their part. He seems to be forgetting that the entire community has been unwilling to have anything to do with that outside help that he needs.And so, the movie closes in a way that would be shameful to Dirty Harry. He had so many other options. Instead, he goes against everything his character has done in his 80 years and chooses to do something that his character would consider weak and unmanly. It wasn't a brave act. Considering what else Eastwood's character was facing, this ending shows that he is giving up.In the movie, Eastwood says ""I finish things. That's what I do."" Well, he didn't finish squat with this ending. There is a darn good chance that the people Eastwood is protecting are going to be a lot worse off in the future. That outside help often disappears. Cops on Law and Order and CSI are shown having trouble with that particular kind of outside help on every other episode.It is a stupid, stupid ending to an otherwise totally enthralling movie.There is no satisfactory rating to be given to this movie. It was absolutely brilliant until the end. But the ending is horrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Irresistibly surprising movie,"I was really surprised with this film, from start to end. I enjoyed how realistic it was and how the director reached the ending, unexpectedly. The fact that us, the spectators, do not know what is going to happen in the next scene or at the end, how Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) will react, bearing in mind he is a bad-tempered and irritable man, makes us anxiously await to know the next move. I also enjoyed the process in which the children, Thao and Sue, entered Walt's life and changed his whole perspective and viewpoint on life (and death). The relationship and connection between them was unique and it was well adapted to the intriguing plot. I loved how flawless it was, from each character role, to the dazzling ending, which was so clever and precocious, left me speechless. However, the only thing I didn't like was Thao's acting. I feel that, minding that he was an essential character, he should have performed better, because he didn´t transmit anything to us. Anyway, you won't regret watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very well-meaning,  but sadly lacking artfulness","Everyone loves this flick, and I wanted it to wow me the way Million Dollar Baby did. But there are just too many holes in the acting, writing, and directing.One of the biggest oversights in production were ""gang"" scenes where it appears that substandard actors were told to wing it. Boy, that sucks, and I can't tell you how much it pains me to see Eastwood letting that footage get edited in to something with his name on it.And this, coupled with other scripted scenes with lousy writing, just down the flick for me.Again: I really, really wanted this thing to work. It may be the perfect film to point to when you want to explain the inadequacy of best intentions in the face of oversights in realization.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"For Religoius and Others, Refreshing","Others have commented about most aspects of this movie and I won't try to repeat what others have said well both here and in the professional reviews. Instead, let me focus on one narrow aspect of this movie which I found refreshing.One of the main characters in this movie is a Catholic priest. In every movie of recent vintage, this means a person of overwhelming evil, creepy, and probably a child molester. Here the priest is well spoken, intelligent and adds to the evolution of the main character while the main character adds dimension to the priest.As a personal note, I'm not only an atheist, but have a shade of anti-Catholicism in me too. Yet not in my worst thoughts of religion or the church do I believe that all priests or other Christian clergy are evilly motivated sexual perverts which is what Hollywood of today would have us believe. I'm tired of the same old same old finding this, like so many Eastwood films, thinking its own thoughts rather than following the rutted path of those who (mostly) run the movie industry.Probably a solid 8 or 9 star movie on its own, this one gets a boost from me for being such a relief in its portrayal of the religious.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Poor performances, weak material and clunky development  Eastwood being a gruff and watchable lead cannot redeem the many problems here","Having been recently widowed, Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski finds himself all alone in a community that has seen all his former neighbours replaced with members of the Hmong community. Racist, aggressive, distant from his family, Walt is living out his days with beer on his porch, watching the world go by with a gruff sense of disgust. When he finds his neighbour's son trying to steal his car  a prize 1972 Gran Torino  Walt finds his hatred justified but, when he stands up to the gang that had forced Thao into the crime, he is hailed as a local hero by his neighbours and finds himself drawn into the life of Thao and his family.Gran Torino is one of the films that benefited from the Oscar buzz around one certain aspect. Much like Mickey Rourke's performance made people think that The Wrestler was perhaps a better all round film than it was, so talk of an acting Oscar for Eastwood has put this film into the public mind as being ""Oscar-worthy"", even if that has been knocked into a cocked hat before it reached the UK. This perception is the only thing I can think of that has motivated so many IMDb users to vote so highly on this title (well, that and the fact that some users will vote 10 or 0 and nothing in between) because this is not a particularly good film by any means. If you read the boards all you will hear about is the standard of acting being a problem but for me the problems start with the script. You see this is a film that really needs convincing and careful character development to make it work. Sadly this is not what we get as the film is written in steps without a lot of attention to getting between these steps in a way that feels real or convincing. The overall arch of the film is engaging in these steps and I did not have an issue with the actual plot but too often it just feels clunky and clumsy in the writing and it gets weaker and weaker as it goes on. Those doubting my concerns over Walt's transformation being rushed and unconvincing can surely not have doubts over the minor characters  the priest talking to Walt towards the end of the film is perhaps one of the worst written changes in character I've seen! As director, Eastwood cannot fix the problems with the script but he is almost good enough to cover it in his own performance. He does this by being what we already know he is  a big gruff presence that can effortlessly fill a cinema screen. This makes him watchable but the material limits him and fortunately the Oscar voters have not been taken in by sentimentality on this occasion. By comparison though he is fantastic because the commendable idea of casting Hmong actors in their debut performances backfires badly with key players failing to deliver. Bee Vang's Thao doesn't have anything like the range required  he is OK when being natural but anything more demanding is flat. Ahney Her's Sue doesn't even really manage that and, while a ""nice"" presence she doesn't feel natural and I didn't engage with her or see why Walt would. This problem is not so obvious in the rest of cast they are mostly playing clichés or just hanging around. One person without the excuse of language or inexperience is Carley who is pretty awful but in fairness is given probably the weakest material out of everyone.The whole thing is a really weak film that sums it all up perfectly with a terrible song with terrible singing from Eastwood. This is the final misjudgement of many but the root of it all is the script which takes a basic premise and delivers it in chunky blocks that don't really scan and pushes the viewer away when it should draw them in. Things that should have an impact don't really work because of this and, although Eastwood is a solid presence, he cannot find much to really work with. The performances outside of him are roundly poor and the main players lack the range to deliver when required. The end result is a really poor film and it is embarrassing to see so many users here stepping it claiming it as a piece of greatest  see it for yourself if you wish, but let me assure you it is nothing of the sort, no matter how much I tried to go with it.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Gentle now, the tender breeze, blows whispers thru my Gran Torino.","Walt Kowalski, recently widowed and a Korean War Veteran, refuses to let go of his prejudices and embrace the ever changing world he exists in. Irked and distant from his shallow family, Walt now only cares for his dog and his beautiful mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. When young Hmong teenager Thao from next door is caught trying to steal the car, Walt could have no idea it was going to shape his, and his neighbours respective destinies.When it was first announced that Clint Eastwood was to direct and star in Gran Torino, many insiders worried that Eastwood may be about to embarrass himself as some aged Dirty Harry clone. They needn't have worried, and in fact should have afforded the intelligent icon the benefit of any smouldering doubt, because if this is to be, as expected, Eastwood's final performance in front of the camera, it's a truly marvellous bow out from a very special man.Gran Torino, I think it's fair to say is a very personal picture to Eastwood, scratch away at the skin of it and you can see that he must have waited for some time to find the right picture to finish with, Gran Torino is the right picture for him, it's also the right picture for his fans to embrace as the closing down of a career, a career that most of us have grown up with. Perfectly etched and grizzled, Walt Kowalski embodies all of Eastwood's main cinematic characters, it feels {is} as tho we have all come full circle, the ending of Torino functioning as a beautiful and emotional release of so so many things.Substance wise, Gran Torino is a shrewd look at violence, vengeance and pedal stool heroics, with Eastwood and his writers {Nick Schenk/Dave Johannson} cunningly crafting a sensitively tough film that's also engagingly funny, it's quite a trick to mold so many factors and make it work in such an earnest way. Eastwood is immense, in every scene he is a towering presence, a beacon of grumpy magnetism, and as the story veers towards its inevitable search for emotional salvation, Eastwood emotes with the best of them, even with few words he spell binds in his wrinkly vein protruding frame.Sadly the Asian actors around him are very poor, very much so, and the inevitability factor is hard to ignore, so yes, Gran Torino has flaws. So it's possibly not given some critics the swan song they wanted {he would of had to have retired after Unforgiven for a perfect swan song you feel}, but it stands proud as a great Eastwood film because of the man himself. As the end credits role, Eastwood raspingly recites the title song, this gives way to Jaimie Cullum's soft and beautiful rendition of the same song, Eastwood you feel has given way to the younger generation. But few actors of his generation will be as remembered as fondly as he is, he owes none of us cinema fans anything, and in Gran Torino he has thanked us the fans whilst simultaneously closing down a fabulous career, thank you big fella. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Swan Song of the Magnificent Clint Eastwood,"In Michigan, the grumpy widower Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran full of prejudice that has just lost his beloved wife Dorothy. He is one of the last Caucasian Americans in his neighborhood and does not have good relationship with his sons and their families; therefore he is a lonely man. When his teenager neighbor Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) is pressed by his cousin Smokie (Sonny Vu) to join his Hmong gang, he is assigned to steal the Gran Torino of Walt as part of his initiation in the gang. However he is surprised by the old man and his traditional family feels ashamed with the incident. Later Walt saves Thao first and his sister Sue Lor (Ahney Her) later from gangs and he has the gratitude of his next door neighbors and the Asian neighborhood. On the day of his birthday, Walt is invited by Sue to join her family reunion and he begins a relationship with his neighbors, helping Thao to get a job. However he realizes that the Hmong gang disturbs the neighborhood and after a coward attack of the gangsters to Sue, Walt decides to take an ultimate attitude.""Gran Torino"" is a magnificent movie of Clint Eastwood with a wonderful message. It is amazing how Clint Eastwood is able to have only great movies in his long filmography.

This movie proves what a wonderful actor Eastwood is.,"People raved about this movie, but for a long time I had never seen it. Judging by the title I thought it was a movie about a race car contest and wasn't interested. I read the full synopsis eventually though and finally gave the movie a watch.And wow, it was fantastic. The script is an intelligent commentary about generational and cultural differences, and the dialogue is some of the most quotable I've ever heard. The directing is subtle, but essentially very effective, and helps strengthen the power of the story. I love the score by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens, which far too often goes unmentioned. The plot revolves around a man (played by Clint) who is very bitter and mostly just keeps to himself. His grand kids are selfish and uncaring, not to mention he went through a horrible war. Hell, his granddaughter literally just waits for him to die so she can inherit the car, a Gran Torino. But when the Hmongs move in next door, his life starts to change...Seeing Walt Kowalski rant about all kinds of things and talk with people in the most disjointed of ways is not only incredibly entertaining, but also makes for an eminent character study. We might not side with him at first, but as the movie goes on and we learn more about him, he becomes easier to root for thanks to Eastwood's three- dimensional performance. His friendship with Sue is great, and don't you just love it when he mouths off to the street gang by blurting out ""What are you spooks up to?"". Comedy is something this movie does well too, and it definitely shows through Walt's golden platinum one-liners. I could mention my favorites all day.The one thing holding this back from a full 10 is one of the actors. I mean, not all of them are great, but I really like Ahney Her and Bee Vang is not as bad as people say. But Christopher Carley on the other hand (who played Father Janovich) was just godawful. That guy should never have made it into the movie. Even a tomato could act more believably than him. So due to Carley's acting, the movie dropped to a 9.5/10. Don't let that stop you though.You see a little bit of Dirty Harry here, but you also see a shattered, lonely old man in a growing world. Clint has still got it!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

An Old Man's Coming of Age,"As the movie opens, Walt stands at his wife's funeral, snarling and grimacing at his pathetic family. His anger, and his refusal to accept, comes from deep guilt that he has buried deep in his soul his entire life. Nothing is right. He lost his wife, ""the best woman on earth"", he despises his family, and a new family of Hmongs moves next door to him.Clint Eastwood has come such a long way from his earlier vengeance films. His reprisal for wrongdoings turns to acceptance, his coldness turns into true emotion. This is a fantastic Eastwood movie. It's also one of the most mature. Critics and casual movie goers will find something to like. Perfect symmetry in this film, from beginning to end. A perfect ending, in my opinion, not only to the film but maybe to an unmatchable career. If this is in fact his send off, I can't possibly think of a better film to end it with. Mr. Eastwood deserves an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor.I don't want to spend any time with the story, because I would probably reveal too much. This is a movie to experience first hand. I am also impressed that the trailers don't give away too much as you would expect them to. Pretty good supporting performances, although you could tell some were first time actors. This doesn't really hinder the film, however.It's a movie that shows self redemption is just as important as vengeance. It's a movie to be discussed and enjoyed. It's a movie of friendship in the most unlikely places. It's a movie that shows a coming of age, even in the later stages of life. Dirty Harry was just a little late to realize all of that.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Awesome Clint Eastwood,"From its technical side, the film is remarkable, here is Eastwood's experience most valuable. Scenes at Volt's home were extremely complex. The viewer needs to feel the lack of space but, on the other hand, should not be visually limited. His belongings, tools, weapons and even the cars, Eastwood and director of photography Tom Stern have incorporated in the image of Volt's everyday life. Locations are authentic; we got the feeling of a small community that lives its life. ""Gran Torino"" is well filmed, the coordination of the staff and space is at a high level. I will always remember Clint Eastwood as the western hero, someone who has defined an entire genre.

A Disappointing Chick Flick For Grumpy Old Men,"This was on my to watch list for a while . Six years to be precise . How on Earth I never got round to seeing it I've no idea . It's highly regarded by my peers on this website and it's by Eastwood who if nothing else is an inspiration in the way he constantly churns out movies without pausing for breath . He might not be on a par with Scorsese or Aronofsky but he's definitely not some third rate journeyman hack director who thinks he's doing an MTV ident while over dosing on cocaine which seems to be the in house Hollywood directorial style these days . That said despite the praise it has received GRAN TORINO is a disappointmentThe problem is that the narrative is an all too obvious redemption plot . Eastwood plays Ebeneezer Scoorge / Victor Meldrew with a dollop of bitter and twisted racist overtones thrown in to the uneasy mix . When he's referring to ethnic minorities in general and Orientals in particular with nasty racist names I kept expecting him to scream "" I don't believe it "" . As soon as he gets friendly with his Asiatic neighbours you understand where the story is going and there's little in the way or surprises . The tone is often a problem . The foul mouthed and racist tirades totally jar with the schmaltzt and manipulative plotting . Ask yourself if it didn't star Eastwood and didn't contain strong language would you not expect this to be a production from the Hallmark Channel ? That said it does the intelligent point if you want to survive in the American ghetto then running with the pack is probably the only option and Eastwood is always good value but I expected more considering the high praise this movie received on its release",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Powerful Portrait of Redemption and Reconciliation,"Gran Torino is a 2008 drama film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood as Walt Kowalski, a grumpy and bigoted Korean War veteran who lives in a changing neighborhood in Detroit. Walt has a strained relationship with his family and a deep resentment for the Hmong immigrants who have moved next door. However, when he intervenes to save his young neighbor Thao from a gang initiation, he becomes an unlikely hero and mentor for the boy and his sister Sue. As Walt gets to know them better, he learns to overcome his prejudices and find a new purpose in life.The film is a compelling and moving story of redemption and reconciliation, as Walt faces his own demons and confronts the violence and injustice that plague his community. Eastwood delivers a masterful performance as the complex and conflicted protagonist, who is both heroic and flawed, tough and tender, cynical and compassionate. The film also features excellent performances from the mostly unknown cast of Hmong actors, who bring authenticity and charm to their roles. The film explores themes such as racism, friendship, family, loyalty, sacrifice, and forgiveness, with a balance of humor and drama. The film also pays tribute to the American car industry and the classic 1972 Gran Torino, which symbolizes Walt's pride and legacy.Gran Torino is a brilliant film that showcases Eastwood's talent as a director and actor, and offers a powerful portrait of redemption and reconciliation in a changing world.

Grumpy old man,"As the granddaughter of a couple of grumpy old men who are protective of their property, more than borderline racist, and often find themselves living in the past, this movie hit the nail on the head. It made me miss the grandfather who has left this world, and made me want to call up my Pop straight away to see how he's going.The movie was a beautiful example of knocking down cultural and generational walls that divide us, and demonstrates that you can indeed teach an old dog new tricks. It was interesting to watch the dynamic between Walt and Sue, and between Walt and Thao. I spent a lot of the movie hating Walt's family and being able to connect their behaviour to members of my own family. ""Your wife is dead. Time to move you to a nursing home."" (When really they're thinking ""One parent down, now we want to sell your house so we can have some cash."") And trying to pretend like they were doing it all to help him.It seems that a few people have raised the question of inheritance. I have a very loving relationship with my grandparents, who other people label as ""intolerant"" or ""grumpy"", some of these people being their own children or other relatives. They disrespect them, behind their back and to their face, and yet when it comes to their wills, they expect to be included. A relationship with our elders is not just about wooing them into leaving us something, nor should being left something by an elder be an expectation just because you're a child/grandchild etc.The points lost were for the religious dude.

Eastwood's towering performance rises above a rare directorial misfire,"Clint Eastwood's film-making career has led credulity to the cliché that some things only get better with age, showing a transcendent self-awareness and reflective grasp for supremely genuine emotional storytelling and allegorical commentary on America, and the steadily fading beacons of past moral values. As such, it is difficult to envision a more fitting cinematic project than Gran Torino, addressing traditional Eastwood themes of age, morality and changing times through an unrepentant racist of a protagonist forced to rethink his prejudices when confronted with close interaction of a Hmong teenager after an attempted theft of his prized 1972 Gran Torino. However, despite all initial signs looking exceptionally promising (with Eastwood's vicious growl of ""GET OFF MY LAWN"" in the film's trailer delightfully hearkening back to the days of Dirty Harry sadistic cool), it is all the more disappointing to see Gran Torino somewhat miss its mark, falling short of the modern masterpiece it easily could have been.While the juxtaposition of Eastwood's snarling Korean war vet with his neighbours of various ethnicities could have offered for fascinating social commentary and an intriguing allegorical subtext for the state of American culture (using Eastwood's grizzled Walt Kowalski as symbolic for old fashioned values becoming increasingly outnumbered by exterior cultural influences and changing societal values - the American dream of a hard working family man not subverted, but shown to be worn out and fading continually out of touch), Nick Schenk's screenplay far too often only scratches at the surface instead of embracing such themes, an oversimplified bundle chock full of stock stereotypes and unconvincing supporting characters to drive its potentially poignant point home. There are moments which hint at the mature cultural reflection dancing continually out of reach (feeling old and out of touch, Kowalski snarls to himself that he has more in common with his similarly marginalized Hmong neighbours than his materialistic, self-serving sons), but such complexity is not readily apparent on the whole.The film is by no means un-enjoyable, particularly as an old-fashioned morality tale and odd- couple bonding story (the interplay between Kowalski and his unwitting apprentice Thao has many delightfully hilarious moments), but not as profound or resonant as it feels it should be - an important commentary on gang violence, among others, falls flat due to being pursued through frustrating stereotypes. As such, Eastwood's film lacks the tidy trimming of plot his other features demonstrate, starting out strong but quickly lapsing into cliché and unbelievable characterisation, eventually simply feeling overlong, somewhat rambling and lacking of clear resolution and purpose. Some scenes, beyond simply feeling unnecessary, come across as seemingly unintentionally hilarious (Kowalski's teaching Thao to ""man up"" by embracing ideologies of cars, hard work - preferably in the trades - and heterosexual romance) in fashion which at times feels a directorial satirical wink, suggesting such traditional values are increasingly fading and out of touch, were it not for Eastwood's emotional focus feeling uncertainly positioned, making the viewer feeling inclined to root for a position they would normally feel inclined to chuckle at.Furthermore, the treatment of Kowalski himself carries many elements of (seemingly unintentional) near self-parody, acknowledging Eastwood's baggage as a cultural icon, but instead of tastefully incorporating it into the story or subverting it, the image becomes overblown to an almost comical extent at times - as much as the viewer wants to see 78 year old Eastwood beat up gang members, the credibility of it, trained Korean vet or not, is still questionable. The film is also let down by a sagging third act, with an ending grasping at raw sentiment but ending up with excessive sap, and the potentially poignant use of Clint Eastwood himself grumble-singing the film's title tune over the ending credits comes across as less self-reflexively beautiful and more unintentionally silly than it should be.As such, Eastwood's own performance is not only the main draw of the film, but ultimately its only real draw. However, despite narrative and directorial shortcomings, he as a performer more than carries the slack - his triumphant rendition of unrepentant, grizzled Korean war vet Walt Kowalski is endlessly watchable, as each animalistic snarl, grim spitting out of racial slurs and grimace as he reflects on his own waning physical potential are alternatively hilarious, gripping and touching, managing to take a despicable sack of a man and infuse him with gruff pathos, charisma and sly humour to spare. If the rumours of Kowalski being Eastwood's last acting performance do end up being true, it is certainly a prime example of a silver screen treasure going out on a high note. The rest of the cast fail to not only live up to Eastwood's standard, but even conventional standards of quality, as Bee Vang as Kowalski's repentant teenage protégé Thao delivers a dull, uninspired performance, making key emotional moments almost laughable, and Christopher Carley as the young, passionate priest continually butting heads with Kowalski fares little better. Ahney Her is a high point as Thao's spunky sister, but is unfortunately stuck with too many of the film's weaker lines to deliver a performance of too much merit.While Eastwood is far too competent a filmmaker to have the film descend into the self- pantomime or grim melodrama it could easily have been, Gran Torino still marks a rare directorial misfire for one of American film's most lasting and reliable filmmakers. Let down by a weak script and the occasional questionable moral positioning, the film never feels genuine or compelling enough to have its elusive purposes ring true. Nevertheless, the singular pleasure of Eastwood's towering performance and alleged acting swan song is still enough to make the film overall worth viewing, but as a whole, Gran Torino primarily marks a mostly missed opportunity for something potentially beautiful and resonant.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

A banal display of gimmickery and staggeringly amateurish acting.,"""Relax zipperhead, I'm not going to shoot you"", grumped Harry the Ole Fart to Billy the karate Kid. ""I may not be the most pleasant man that walks the Earth, you zip face, fish head, you gook...grunthhhhggghhh.....""Enough already!Seriously, this film's so bad it's not even funny.Here's the whole ordeal in a nutshell:Over the top racist old war vet is grumpy. Over the top racist old war vet is slightly less grumpy. Over the top racist old war vet develops a heart. Some injustice, unfathomable plot twist. To everyone's ill concealed embarrassment, Clint barks a tune during the credits -The end-Mix in some truly pathetic acting by a cast clearly let in on a sympathy vote, the worst clichés gathered from Alan Smithee's collective works, The Ultimate Anthology of Prosthetic Plot Points, and you get this yard sale of banality which is Gran Torino.If you like your drama spoon fed to you with a predictability factor that would even make a soap screenwriter blush and if you can stand Eastwood doing poor grizzly imitation while impersonating a fossilized plank of pre-Cambrian wood throughout an entire film, I guess this movie is for you.But if you're still going for something slightly original, convincing or otherwise entertaining , I can only recommend a dozen of other films that are actually worth their viewing.Go see 'The Usual Suspects' if you never got around to see it. 'Big Fish', 'Lost in Translation', 'Funny Games', 'Ground Hog Day', 'Michael Clayton' or 'The Escapist'. And bloody shame on all those professional movie critics. I mean, surely they must have HBO so they can compare this shameful dross to for instance 'The Wire' and conclude that which was actually really made for TV, is light years ahead of this straight- to-DVD clunker.Gran Torino, a score of 8.4 and a #85 place in the IMDb top 250 list.What a joke!4.5/10",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"It's a Clint Eastwood film, what else do you need to know?","I'm not going into a sophisticated review of this film, there are plenty of those already here. I'd rather just talk about what I felt. This film moved me. I have seen this movie before, and I think it is a movie where you don't really 'get it' the first time you see it. Sure, I wanted another installment of Harry Callahan, just as we all did. This film is different. 
I think that many of Eastwood's films are too sophisticated for the reviewers. There, I said it. I've seen this in Pale Rider, and many of his films. I think we all need to grow up a little when seeing an Eastwood film. In so doing, I think we wake up a little bit, and learn something from them.

"Clint is still a cowboy at heart and his Gran Torino is his ""hi-ho Silver""","There may not be any native Californian Indians chasing Clint in this film but if this story line were played to the backdrop western theme score ""Tombstone"" you would swear you were watching Clint playing the character Joe from his 1964 western For A Few Dollars More. Clint plays a grouchy old Polish descent Korean war vet named Walt Kowalski, who with each passing decade has seen his neighborhood gentrified which is difficult for an old war vet like Walt to adjust to being surrounded by the people he shot at decades ago when he was shipped overseas.When one of his next door neighbours teenage kid attempts to steal his priceless Gran Torino you think there would be hell to pay? Instead Walt Kowalski sees in this young man named Thao (played by Bee Vang) a lost soul who needs his help to stay on the right path and to stay as far away from the neighborhood criminal elements.We learn through time that as the old western saying goes....""Walt's bark is a lot worse than his bite."" Walt Kowalsky is a widower who is a foul mouthed (appears to be) racist old Korean war vet who happens to be estranged from his adult sons and his grandchildren so Walt develops an inner fondness for his foreign born neighbors and we see his heart shine through when trouble comes a calling in Walt Kowalsky's neighbourhood.Clint Eastwood directed himself in Gran Torino and he is more than prepared to share the limelight with his co-stars which is an admirable quality in the (then) 78 year old actor/director who is still going strong today ten (10) years later.We love you Clint, so don't go riding/driving out in to the sunset just yet. I believe you have a few more songs to sing before the sun goes down for the last time even at your current age of 88.I give Gran Torino an 8 out of 10 rating.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Adding to the Legend,"Gran Torino (2008)**** (out of 4)Clint Eastwood stars as Walt Kowalski, a racist, Korean war vet living in the slums of Detroit. After the death of his wife he becomes even more distant but things start to change when his neighbor (Bee Vang) tries to steal his Gran Torino. Walt eventually comes around to befriending the boy and trying to teach him the right ways of doing things but a local gang has their own ideas for the boy. I was a little caught off guard with the opening ten-minutes, which were over the top in us getting to know Walt. I think Eastwood really pushed the envelope in showing us what a mean guy this was but in the end these scenes really paid off. I wasn't expecting too much out of this film but it turned out to be another winner for the director. What really shocked me is all the humor in the film, which mostly comes from Eastwood's racist views and names. Believe it or not the comedy coming from this stuff is very strong but once again there's a reason for this. It's not that racism is funny but it goes back to being soft or politically correct in today's world. The film tackles all sorts of subjects and, once again, I was amazed at how much of a character study this was. The screenplay allows each and every character to grow right in front of our eyes and this includes Eastwood's character, the young boy, his sister, his family, the gang members and even the neighborhood. This isn't a film for dummies, so to speak, because it requires the viewer to do a lot of thinking and I'm sure fifty-people could watch this and walk away with a different opinion on what its message is. There's no doubt Eastwood wanted to make a statement on today's issues but at the same time he struck true to the nature of our main guy. As for Eastwood the actor, I wouldn't argue that this is his greatest performance. It's hard to say considering how many great roles he has had but I believe this one will certainly go well with Dirty Harry. The amount of growth Eastwood gives his character was really fun to watch and his comic timing has never been better. The seriousness of the growl in his voice is also in fine form giving fans a lot of great one-liners. There's been some different opinions on the supporting players but I thought they all did fine work and that includes Vang and Ahney Her as the sister. Christopher Carley is also quite good as the local priest. This is a film that doesn't rush into anything and instead it takes its time to deliver the message it wants. It's very doubtful anyone but Eastwood would or could have made a film about a racist who also happens to be the hero of the movie but that's what Eastwood has always been about. Balls. The film has a lot of balls in its message, open politically incorrect attitude and its honesty, which includes the ending. If Eastwood really does retire from acting after this one he leaves us a great film and character to talk about.",,Anonymous,Drama

Completely overrated,"Gran Torino is the story of the friendship between Walt, a retired soldier and widower, and a Laotian family living next door, and the struggle of the youngest siblings not to be swallowed by the street gangs in town. It is an ode to peaceful coexistence and the right to have a better future, a non pre-conditioned racial one.The story has all the elements to be successful, since it has a lovely story of interracial friendship, initiation to maturity, migration, and of good people who want to live in peace. I liked the history of the Laotian neighbors as depicted the reality of immigration and survival in a new racial and cultural environment.I loved the performance of Ahney Her as Sue and Bee Vang as her brother Thao, which are very expressive, sincere and sensitive. I liked the sub- story of the punishment that Walt gives Thao to pay for his fault. I also liked the unexpected end, an example of sacrifice for the welfare of others, which surprises the spectator because the film is quite violent, even the poster seems to indicate that.These good elements were not enough to me because of the tempo of the film, which doesn't't have a crescendo or doesn't demarcates what is important from what is superfluous. The story sometimes gets lost in the superfluous, forgetting those elements of the story that were more interesting and important; for example, all the sub-stories of Walt's family don't add anything to the story or serve to draw Walt's character better. Some characters are badly drawn (Walt, for example, looks like an ailing Dirty Harry, a repetition of past roles) while others are too stereotypical and predictable (such as the Asian boys band.)The film is just OK. I thought it was a commissioned one, the kind of film that some directors have to direct to make money and finance more daring projects.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

A man comes to grips with his past,"It's hard to write about the emotional impact of 2008's ""Gran Torino,"" directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. At times, it's so funny, you're crying with laughter, and at other times, so sad that you're crying for a different reason. Whatever it is, it's Clint Eastwood's best performance, and certainly one of his best movies.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a recent widower and Korean war vet who doesn't have a relationship with either of his two sons. He's a complete bigot and a racist. He has guilt about the people he killed in Korea.The best that can be said about him, at the beginning of the movie anyway, is that he loves his dog. And that seems to be about all he loves - the dog and his magnificent 1972 Gran Torino.One night, he catches someone trying to steal it and, using his trusty big gun, runs the thief off of his property. It's the Hmong boy next door, Thao (Bee Vang), whose cousin is a Hmong gang member and trying to initiate the confused Thao.""Hmong girls go to college,"" his sister Ahney (Sue Lor) explains to Walt. ""Hmong boys go to jail."" Gradually, thanks to Ahney's easy way with him, and the fact that he thinks she's ""all right,"" Walt is lured next door for a family gathering. It's awkward at times, but he loves the food.He detests the gang - he keeps them from assaulting Ahney and stops an attack on Thao, earning him the undying gratitude of Hmong neighborhood. When Thao is sent to work for Walt as an act of contrition for trying to steal his car, Walt takes an interest in the boy's future - and he won't have a future if the gang influence isn't stopped.What we learn about Walt - and what Walt learns and teaches - is what ""Gran Torino"" is all about. The car, like Walt, is out of place and part of a bygone era in an old neighborhood largely inhabited now by the Hmong people. Yet he and the car belong there.The best moments are between Thao and Walt, especially when Walt teaches Thao to ""man up"" - definitely the funniest scenes in the film.A priest (Christopher Carley) promised Walt's late wife that he would get Walt to go to confession. Carley with his baby face and quiet manner, is very well cast, and the scenes between the two men are very good.All the performances are excellent, but Eastwood here has created one of the all-time great characters. It's fascinating to see what he has accomplished since he first came to public attention as a robust, handsome western hunk in ""Rawhide.""He has emerged as a great artist - most of his films are infused with complex characters and profound emotions. Not every performer has the opportunity or ability to grow in his work, but Eastwood was given that opportunity and made the most of it. At 78, he's better than ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A diamond on the rough,"In today's world of cheesy action movies (Transporter ??) and pathetic attempts at bathroom humor (Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie) i find it very hard to find a movie that i am willing to go pay 12 dollars at the theater to go watch.Gran Torino is one of those rare gems that both lures me to theater and has me leaving satisfied. Clint Eastwood delivers another brilliant performance as grizzled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. A true fish out of water, and anti-hero of sorts. A man obsessed with the notions of honor and respect thrust into a neighborhood that seems to know very little of those two concepts. And Eastwood portrays this character so well he could easily be anyone's old school war veteran relative.On that note, i found the acting to be perfect for the movie. Everyone who says the Hmong family was horribly acted has surely been spoiled by too many glitzy Hollywood blockbuster that will cast Brad Pitt for a one line role. The Hmong family were just that, a family of people, and that is how they behaved. The actors cast did their job and portrayed what they supposed to - a decent family in an indecent neighborhood. I found it MUCH easier to relate to a bunch of unknowns who exhibited real human emotion than a cast of over pampered celebrities who i figure have little or no attachment to the role they are playing. BOTTOM LINE: you care about the characters, you smile when they succeed, and you cry when they do.The story itself was a true roller coaster ride in every sense of the term. The scenes switched from comedic to tragic at a drop of a hat and it worked so well. The theater seemed to move in the direction the film did and several times during the film there was barely a dry eye in the theater.This film DEFINITELY deserves an Oscar look. And in a year where The Dark Knight has received so much award hype Gran Torino may certainly prove to be a dark horse and steal a few awards. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint drives it home,"I felt myself being gripped watching this movie from beginning to end. Clint always seems to make ""un Hollywood"" movies, by this I mean it's not a love story with a cheesy ending, or an action movie with a hero like Tom Cruise in it.I liken him to Woody Allen. They both make movies that are just a little different to the norm. I really like that sortof movie, I thrive to watch movies like this.Of course we need the fun movies and of course we like to get lost in a good ole romance, but once in awhile I like to see something with an unusual script.Saying this the script for Torino was not earth shattering different to anything else I've seen. You've seen grumpy in grumpy old men (there is a bit of humour in this movie too), but it's the simplicity of the whole movie that brings it to life.A man (Clint) who is a nasty guy, befriends a boy brings who brings out the good in him.

After 15 minutes, you can pretty much guess the stroy's process. We hear about Walt's war time memories but the movie fails to take us deep into his emotions and relationships so his changing seems untouchable for audiences. Side characters are also poorly producted. I mean what the hell is it with that church dude or those gangsters anyway? The most noticeable disadvantage of this movie however is the acting.

The closing Song He did, The demise of a former Mega City with the auto industry shutting down. The one thing I respect the most is he used actors and actresses in new positions and they pulled it off. For all the flack Clint received about racial divides portrayed in the film it was all jealousy and poppycock. He offered these young actors and actresses an opportunity of a life time. What would a retired Vet think of when he comes home to ruins. He did an incredible job and I cried through a lot of it with his ability to pull on emotional strings like sacrificing his life for a young man that ran with the wrong crowd.

Eastwood's Masculinity: A National Resource,"""Gran Torino"" is a small, intimate, low-budget movie with no special effects. It is the best movie of 2008. ""Gran Torino"" exhibits courage and pertinence that other films only wish they could have. This movie is so true, and so subversive of PC BS, it's amazing that it got made, and that audiences are allowed to see it.This is the first mainstream Hollywood movie in decades that treats a despised group of people  white, working class, Catholic ethnics, in this case, specifically, Poles  with any respect, affection, seriousness or dignity at all. There are a few movies where Italians or Greeks are allowed to be goofy, eccentric romantics (""Moonstruck,"" ""My Big Fat, Greek Wedding"") or glamorous Mafiosi, but a Hollywood movie that focuses, with respect, on a working class white ethnic man and his deteriorating neighborhood is hard to find.""Gran Torino"" actually celebrates working class, Polish values: working hard, every day, minding your own business, maintaining your house, being a decent neighbor, doing the right thing. Eastwood, in our current Politically Correct environment that denigrates traditional masculinity, has the courage to be a man. An unapologetic man. A real man.The film has the courage to expose the festering tragedy taking place in working class neighborhoods across America. As manufacturing jobs have left, neighborhoods that Polish Americans like Walt Kowalski struggled, against all odds, to build, from their own blood, sweat, and tears, have been abandoned to rampant criminality, social degeneracy, and gang warfare. Since the witnesses of this vast slum-ification of America are working class people, elites don't care, and never address these issues, or address them with all the Politically Correct idiocy demonstrated by the one white liberal in this movie, who dresses and talks like a rapper, and responds with laughable inadequacy when he and his girlfriend are menaced on the street.Clint Eastwood is magnificent. He models honorable masculinity, both for his fatherless next-door-neighbor, and for us in the audience. ""This is how it's done, folks,"" he teaches. The wise will listen.The movie further pokes Political Correctness in the eye by having Walt carelessly toss around ethnic slurs. I can't even type the words Walt uses into this review because this site actually is programmed to delete them. This is Big Brother, folks.What Walt / Clint / ""Gran Torino"" is saying is clear: PC taboos are a joke. What matters is how you comport yourself when the rubber meets the road. At that moment, the white liberal in the movie is exposed for the complete phony he is, and Walt is revealed to be a deeply caring, responsible person whose values are the only values that can lead to a truly resurgent America that can handle its multicultural population in the best way for all. It doesn't matter what words you use or what jokes you tell at the bar. What matters is this: are you a decent person? Do you treat others with decency? That's what matters, folks, not PC taboos and games.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood forever!,"Clint Eastwood has recently hinted that this may be his final film as an actor, and if so, he has gone out on a very high note. Hard to imagine any other actor playing the bigoted old widower Walt Kowalsky. Basically imagine Clint's Gunney Highway character twenty years older and twenty years meaner. In the opening scene we see his wife's sparsely attended funeral, and Kowalsky's obvious contempt for his remaining family whom he considers either soft or disrespectful. After a get-together for the family back at his place, Walt suddenly finds himself basically alone with only his old dog for company. And worst of all (for him) the downtrodden neighborhood in which he lives is virtually free of white people. Most of his neighbors are Mhnog who find him as strange as he finds them. At least they are generally polite to him, where he verbally assaults them at every chance.Trouble arises for the young teenage Mhong boy next door who is the target of his cousin's gang. They try to get the boy to steal Kowalsky's vintage 1972 car of the film's title. Kowalsky stops the boy in his tracks, and the boy's family sentences him to work for Kowalsky to repay his debt of shame. Kowalsky wants nothing of this until he realizes that he can use the boy to make all kinds of improvements around the neighborhood. Over the course of the film, Kowalsky bonds with his Mhong neighbors and they help each other out when necessary. But when street gangs are involved, this kind of conflict can only end after someone is dead.The film handles some very delicate subject matter and uses humor to let different ethnic groups and minorities come to terms. The amount of racial stereotype humor will offend some, and maybe only an actor of Eastwood's clout could play such a bigoted character and make him likable. But thankfully this is not a film that condescends to its viewers. It makes no excuses for Kowalsky, but also paints him as a real person and not a stereotypical hateful white man. Once he gets to know his neighbors, we see his true human side... even if he still refers to their daughter as a ""dragon lady"" or the boy as a ""zipper"". And the film also points out how difficult it can be for young people of any race to avoid gangs in economically depressed areas. At one point, Kowalsky watches a carload of gang bangers drive by, and instantly thinks of the boy next door. ""He doesn't stand a chance,"" he mutters to himself. And when things finally come to a head, the film can really only end the way it does. Kowalsky is tough as nails, but at his age he is no action hero. But he ends up ridding the neighborhood of the gang the only way he can.This film may well win Eastwood some more awards for his ever-increasing war chest. If not as an actor, then certainly as a director... Clint must carry on and on. And one more note. Spike Lee, who has recently been critical of Eastwood has based his entire career on pointing the finger at other people. Spike old pal, you'd better just worry about making your own films watchable! Because they haven't been for a long time. 10 of 10 stars for Gran Torino.The Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.,"I sat in a full theater with what I suspect was a crowd older than me. You have to have a crowd like that to appreciate what Eastwood was trying to say.The crowd laughed at all the right parts in the movie: the time when Eastwood's character would let out a stream of non-PC comments, and the time when he stood down the punks.Maybe we have become a nation that is too PC and I believe Eastwood was telling us that. The old man had his ghosts and it was eating at him from inside. He couldn't relate to any other world. A man has to do what a man has to do is the saying, I believe. If you can't understand that, than you are not a man, just someone to be pitied or ridiculed.But, there was a soft side of the character that opened the door to a relationship with a young man who really needed a father. The relationship grew so great that Eastwood's character did the most noble thing one man could do for another.Eastwood was magnificent, Ahney Her was a treasure, and Bee Vang was perfect.

The risk of taking on a story about an angry, Old Man, living next door to a Hmong Family in the Midwest isn't exactly the usual ""Hollywood"" movie. Yet, the movie opened to better than competitive ticket sales.

Clint Eastwood hits home in this inspiring and brutally arresting drama,"It's hard to set low expectations for a Hollywood piece starring and directed by Clint Eastwood, the old actor who's spawned as a major Hollywood icon as well as an iconic figure to the American culture. For the past six decades, this fine actor has brought smiles an praises to fans everywhere from his portrayal of the nameless cowboy in the Dollars trilogy to his awe-inspiring directorial works in recent years, and his legacy still continues. This captivating drama starring the iconic actor as well as directed him isn't quite up the par with his legendary works, and can be easily be seen as just one of his minor pieces; but the energy he delivers from both his acting and directorial skills still deserve our attention. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a disgruntled Korean War veteran who's just lost his beloved wife and now lives alone in a depressed state. The old man chooses to alienate himself from everyone including his family, and can't bare to have anyone in his property, particularly a Korean family who moves in next door in the racially diverse neighborhood. Though he unexpectedly makes acquaintance with the teenager girl Sue (played by Ahney Her), he gains tension towards her younger brother Thao (played by Bee Vang) after he sneaks into his garage one night attempting to steal his 1972 Gran Torino under the pressure of his cousin's gang members. Kowalski sets out to reform the young teen by developing a bond with him, and soon unexpectedly finds himself drawn into protecting the family against the gangs that threaten them.Clint Eastwood serves as the pinnacle and emotional core that embraces the beauty of this film. Though there are a few flaws in terms of narrative, his brutally gripping portrayal of the lead character manages to lay those blemishes to obscurity. In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to his character who is gripped with tragedy and struggles with his faith with only his church preacher Father Janovich (played by Christopher Carley) being his aiding hand. Before too long, the character retains a grumpy, tough-minded, and prejudicial demeanor as he's grown hate to everyone of various racial status. One scene the young Korean teenager beaten and harassed by a gang who put him in a dog pile on Kowalski's yard, only to be interrupted by Kowalski himself who points a rifle at them and threatens to open fire if they don't leave his property. The scene is truly intense and sparks a fair amount of tension and unease. Furthermore, the character's near-constant use of racial slurs towards Asians and African-Americans and intimidating threats punctuate his cynical and hard-to-like nature. Clint Eastwood gives honestly one of his most arresting performances in recent years. He's an actor who doesn't take commitment for his role for granted. The almost equally powerful aspect of the film is the ironic relationships between the main character and the young Korean teenager who is brilliantly portrayed by Bee Vang. We watch as the bond between the two characters changes not only the troubled young man from turning to a life of crime by his cousin's tyrannical gang but also Kowalski's attitude towards the family and his determination to protect the family he once despised. The atmosphere is both dark and deeply moving, particularly the powerful and bittersweet ending.Gran Torino is a dark, yet enthralling drama anchored by a gripping performance by Clint Eastwood and a powerful story that is hard to ignore. The film is an interesting piece of cinematic work that though may feel like a minor piece compared to Eastwood's other work, gracefully deserves your attention but only for mature audiences who can handle the dark, cynical tone of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's also the origin of those Eastwood memes you saw online, so you know is good.Movie is from 2008 and it still speaks the audience, since we still have same problems in our society as 2008. Some things have gone even worse in USA since this movie premiered. The way Eastwood is telling for example immigration story is simply awe-inspiring. Eastwood goes all out to show the viewers what life is in these day for old guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
How can this movie get such high ratings??,"I was seriously disappointed in this movie. The movie started off with some potential and seemed like it could get a bit interesting but after the movie progressed it just became very unbelievable. The acting for starters was HORRIBLE. Somehow this old man Clint becomes friend with his immigrant neighbour who's cousin is trying to recruit him into a gang. The relationship between clint and this family was completely unbelievable and interaction between the two was so unrealistic it just spoiled the movie. Clint also often threatens this gangs through several gestures all of which these gangsters blow off, their reaction to him is also very unrealistic. This movie is at best a rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Tornino is one of the greatest movies in history. Period.,"I'm no expert on movies by any means, but when a movie can make me experience every possible emotion, then leave me with tears running down my face and chills running through my body, it's quite apparent that this is a special movie. I first saw Gran Torino in 2009, during a dark time in my life, and since then I'd somehow forgotten the plot almost entirely, but I did not forget the emotional impact this movie had on me. I remember thinking it would be a typical high budget Hollywood action movie, with a lame story line but good action. However, what I got was the opposite of that, and I was very taken aback by how the movie played out, and every scene went against my predictions. Here we are 10 years later, and I am deeply moved once again by this movie. What surprises me the most, is that minus the high cost of an icon like Clint Eastwood, this movie could of been made with a budget of next to nothing.... which is extremely respectable. Clint used less resources than a C list movie, and somehow created a timeless masterpiece. I won't go into any details of this movie because I don't want to include any spoilers so that someone who's never seen this movie before can read this review, and hopefully have a great experience as I had. What a legacy for Eastwood to leave us with such a powerful movie in the twilight of his career and life. I'm sure this movie had people standing up and applauding in theaters when it first came out! Well done Mr. Eastwood!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stick with it.,"Gran Torino (2008) -Clint Eastwood, playing Walt, looked like he should have been the one in the coffin at the beginning of this film, which was boring and miserable to start.It was clear that Walt had obviously never left his time fighting in Korea behind him and still carried it as baggage every day and in many ways Clint played the character like he was still trying to be the enigmatic loner/drifter of his western films, but living in modern, suburban America. Because of all that, his sudden change of heart later on in the film was a bit hard to buy. By the very end I also started to wonder if Walt was going senile along with his other obvious illness.In Walt's defence I wouldn't have wanted that annoying Padre (Christopher Carley) badgering me either. I didn't quite understand his character actually, because he was really very odd.At the beginning, after the long and drawn out funeral, I was worried that it was going to be another film about stupid gang warfare and anger. A version of all the other cr@ppy fighting for the sake of it films like 'Boyz In The Hood' (1991), 'Do The Right Thing' (1989), 'City Of God' (2002) and so on.And also, car films don't interest me in the slightest, so the prospect of watching a film named after and therefore potentially all about a car, didn't excite me at all.As I've said, Sue (Ahney Her) broke down Walt's resistance a bit too easily and all of a sudden he was best friends with the Hmong neighbours that seemed to be multiplying daily. It was only after he found out that they were on his side during the Korean conflict that he seemed to agree to some leeway with them, but he very quickly became very focussed on them and their problems.The Hmong actors however,"" were all quite awful. At least Clint delivered his part well as a racist, miserly and bigoted old g!t, even after he started to lighten up. I have never rated him as an actor, but he did do this role justice. There was nothing endearing about Walt at all though and I only vaguely felt anything for the character of Thao (Bee Vang), despite his terrible performance, but I still wasn't really bothered what happened to him.The way some of the lines were delivered by Ahney Her as Sue was poor to say the least and again I cared little for her, mostly because of her lack of ability to act, but also because I just didn't like the story and it's developments.There were also a lot of supporting artists that couldn't act very well.I would probably say that the dog, Daisy, played by Clint's own family pooch, was the best one in the film.Although it was really slow, the chronology moved quite fast, which helped it towards the end and I found that the film and story was far better than I had expected, without being too much about the car or too focussed on the gangs as such.I had Imagined that I would turn it off after just a short while, not being a Clint fan in general and due to its miserable beginning, but I was glad that I persevered.It might have been slightly more endearing if Walt hadn't been calling Thao a ""G**k"" all the way through it, but I was actually quite moved in the end, regardless of the racism.I really don't understand the youth of today and I'm not much older than some of the people I include in that. Perhaps that was what this film was trying to explain. It was definitely not one that I would look up again, but I was glad that I saw it, as it changed my opinion of Clint slightly and surprised me as a work.677.34/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Instant Classic,"Although Gran Torino is not perfect, it is an extremely good movie that adheres to simple, proven-to-work story structure with a tight script, strong characters, heartfelt meaning, and relatable themes like friendship, nostalgia, life and death, and the American dream, in addition to having lots of fun with the contrasts in generations and nationalities. There are a few errors, and it's a shame because if it wasn't for them then this would be a masterpiece. It's still mightily close, and is still definitely an Eastwood classic and possibly one of the most important movies in recent decades.

This is another Clint Eastwood gem that is an absolute must see,"Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is in my DVD collection and I recently watched again on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an old man who is set in his ways and beliefs. When an Asian family moves next door he doesn't like how the little boy is treated and helps him once. The family and boy feel he is owed some free labor from the boy to pay for the acts. The boy and old man take to each other in a way. When the boy and his sister have bad things happen to them, the old man may come to the rescue one more time.This movie stars and is directed by Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby) and also stars Bee Vang (Voice of Shadows), Brian Haley (Little Giants),
Christopher Carley (Garden State), John Carroll Lynch (Fargo), Scott Eastwood (Suicide Squad) and Brian Howe (The Pursuit of Happiness).This storyline is so unique and contains fantastic characters that are easy to invest in. The storyline has twists and turns and there's so many smart subplots. The writing overall is outstanding and I adored the dialogue. Eastwood was hilarious, intentionally and unintentionally. The acting is out of this world and everyone delivers their characters to perfect. The settings also did a great job of creating an extra level of intensity. The depiction on how traditional Americans view and speak on minorities is very well depicted and the ending of this movie is absolutely magnificent.Overall, this is another Clint Eastwood gem that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Inimitable Legend,"Just by looking the story of the film it is quite clear that the viewer in evidencing the last acting appearance in the prolific career of a big macho icon, and considering that Clint Eastwood is one of the few actors and directors at the same time, generally an author who never make mistakes in his plan, this, his swan song is a praiseworthy move. Gran Torino makes a tribute to all Clint's characters in his career. The protagonist Walt Kowalski, who is a rigid and quiet individual - an aging veteran of the Korean War, represents actually a combination of several characters, such as Inspector Harry Callahan, retired journalist Robert Kincaid (from Bridges of Madison County), Frankie Dunn (from million Dollar Baby) etc. The story is simple but the fact that the main character is in his golden years really makes it big and ambiguous. Sentimentality, nostalgia, coping with the new times, the loss of loved ones, discord with close ones, the relationship with the children.., all these are motives that Clint dealt with in his previous movies, and although are not mentioned here, they can be felt. As a personal project Gran Torino is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Emotional and brings a tear.,My only minor complaint with the movie is that it felt just a little too longer than it actually was.

Plesant Surprise from the legendary Clint Eastwood,"I was eager to watch this movie since I wanted to see it with my Asian friend who is from Vietnam, and I was not disappointing. We both equally enjoyed the unintended humor the movie creates just out of how relatable the situations were. The main protagonist, Clint Eastwood himself, does a memorable job, and his spitting like cowboy is still on point. Some of the supporting characters do not have memorable acting, but the plot carried the whole movie nicely. The lack of soundtrack in the movie did not impact my enjoyment out of the movie because I did not notice until later that there was no soundtrack at all since I was focused in the story. Overall, I think this movie was a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino is a fine showcase for Clint Eastwood's supposed final performance,"Clint Eastwood is Walt Kawalski, a Korean War vet who never completely got over the killings he had to do during that time so that probably contributed to the estrangement of his own adult kids' families. When he ends up having to deal with an Asian family from the Hmong area who live next door, however, because of the teenage son's attempt to steal his prized car whose title is this movie's name, Walt feels a bond that grows complicated when a gang (one of whose members is the family's cousin) tries to bully this son and his sister. As this brother and sister, Be Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor give pretty good performances considering their inexperience before the camera. The same goes for many of the other Hmong players. And Clint is fine making this somewhat racist character lovable because of his sense of honor and decency. In fact, the most humorously edgy scene concerns Eastwood, Vang, and a barber played by John Carroll Lynch as Walt tries to prepare Thao for suitable-if politically incorrect-male adult conversation. I also loved the conversation between Walt and Sue after he picked her up from a near-assault from a black gang. If this is indeed Mr. Eastwood's final acting performance, he certainly couldn't have picked a better role to leave on. And his direction is for the most part fine as well. So for me, that's definitely a recommendation for Gran Torino.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's quite interesting,The movie was good and the plot attracts you because of the feelings that the characters handle and the obstacles they have in their lives. The ending was unexpected and leaves you re-calculating but it also shows the relationship that walt achieved after the death of his wife. Another interesting thing is how they show Walt's perspective by not translating when his Hmong neighbors speak. But the movie is not that good since I think the characters are not the best acting and there are moments in the movie which you feel bored.,7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film for everyone,"Having just seen this latest peace of work by Mr. Eastwood I am stunned. The last time I can remember having so many mixed emotions from a film would probably be that of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Straight away we are rooting for Eastwoods character, Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old Korean war veteran who has just lost his wife. It is no surprise that Walt is a little bit tetchy, and one can only think they have seen this character some where before. It is clear that Eastwood is nearing the end of his journey so making a film of such depth and soul is a credit to the man. It deals with issues that young and old can relate to making you laugh and cry along the way. The simplicity of the film is its charm and handles sensitive issues such as race in a way that doesn't patronise. Oscar worthy? Yes, and one can only feel a little saddened as there isn't going to be many more these gems to come from one of the corner stones of modern cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of Clint Eastwood's best movies as an actor and as a director.,"I've always liked Clint Eastwood as an actor and as a director and Gran Torino is no exception. You can see that Clint Eastwood's spirit from his old movies still lives on here and there are moments that I could not help but laugh when he would quip his one liners through his grizzled demeanour. Gran Torino is definitely one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as an actor and a director and shows that he is certainly not one to be on his laurels or just go through the motions for an easy paycheck.Gran Torino focuses on Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a recently widowed Korean War Veteran and retired Ford auto worker. He is not close to his two sons Mitch (Brian Haley) and Steve (Brian Howe) and his grandchildren are disrespectful towards Walt. In fact most of his family and neighbours treat Walt as a cantankerous and prejudiced old man who hates the world around him. Walt has very few friends and the only company he enjoys is he dog Daisy and his prized 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps in the garage at the back of his house. When a Hmong family moves in next door, Walt treats then with total disdain and rubbishes their customs and way of life. Walt is also dismayed that his neighbourhood in suburban Detroit has been taken over by Asian families and street gangs. The local priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) frequently finds himself on the receiving end of Walt's temper as Walt dismisses him as a 27 year old virgin with little to no life experience holding the hands of superstitious old ladies. When Thao (Bee Vang) is caught trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino he is made by his family to do odd jobs for Walt as part of penance. Walt later gains the respect from the Hmong community when Walt stands up to a group of Asian gangbangers led by Spider (Doua Moua) who find themselves on the wrong end of Walt's M1 Garand rifle as Walt growls ""Get off my lawn"". As Walt takes Thao under his wing, they form a grudging mutual respect for each other. At the same time, Walt also befriends Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) who also helps him understand the Hmong customs. To Walt's surprise, he finds that he has more in common with the neighbours next door than his own family. As Walt's ice cold personality slowly melts away, he must also face his prejudices and problems head on that have been plaguing him for the majority of his life.Without a doubt Clint Eastwood owns this movie. Gran Torino is a perfect example that as an actor and a director, age has not slowed down Clint Eastwood. Walt Kowalski is one of Clint's best characters that he has played throughout his stellar career, and as a director this is one of his finest movies. Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Sue are a shining light amongst a supporting cast of mostly unknowns who hold up the movie very well.Though this can be seen as a bleak drama, there are plenty of intriguing moments which can raise a laugh here and there as well as an occasional smile. It was a total shame that Gran Torino was not recognised for any major awards as this was one of the most memorable movies of 2008. Clint Eastwood is still a legend and for someone in the latter stages of his career, Gran Torino deserves a special mention as one of his finest movies in his brilliant career.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint's saracstic humor stands out than the serious themes,"(2008) Gran Torino
DRAMA/ COMEDYCo-produced, directed and starring Clint Eastwood playing a 'bigot' Walt Kowalski who enjoys living alone, until Asian neighbors moved right next door who slowly succumb to liking them more than his own already grown up children. And at the same time using the gang theme as a backdrop. The name ""Gran Torino"" refers to his favorite car, which is his most priceless possession that his already grown up kids sought after.

This movie puts a lot of families to shame.,"Usually I know Clint Eastwood only for the roles like Dirty Harry or ""blonde"" in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. His most recent performances, starting with Unforgiven, along with Million Dollar Baby gave audiences a feeling of over-seasoning with old-age. As the audiences becoming old, they also got more and more involved in the characters played by Eastwood. In Gran Torino he perfects this tone of performance and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Just the last 20 minutes are worthy the Academy Award, in my opinion.Well, I think this film is made on behalf of all the elder people, but made for their children to watch. The whole movie is seemingly race-biased but ultimately has an undertone of putting a lot of white families to shame. In China we have a saying that ""a distant relative is less reachable than a good neighbor."" which describes the situation in this movie. Walt's family is estranged and can't really relate themselves to him, while the Hmong family has a lot of respect for elders(witnessed by Walt). Despite all the discrimination of Walt on Hmong's life style, he found them easier to get along with and warmer to make friends with. Mr. Eastwood definitely has a negative comment on the American society in this movie, delivered by the grandchildren of Walt's.The end is the punch of the movie, it hit your stomach and make you think a lot about what's worth in a life. To prevent me from spoiling the movie, I will also not reveal any further story in the movie. But if you want to watch a movie made with a heart, this is one.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint dominates,"Eastwood basically plays what his character from the Leone westerns might have become if he had transported to 21st Century inner city Detroit. A racist,gun toting ,angry, hateful Republican( ?!!) who finds redemption when he befriends his immigrant neighbors. His transformation hinges on a single incident which I won't give away but it is certainly one which audiences can relate to. It seems a little easy and maybe it is but Clint gives such an excellent performance that he sells it. Ahyn Her is excellent as the young neighbor and fares the best of the mostly amateur cast but it's Clint's movie all the way. His Patton if you will. I'd like to know what his diet is to pull off this kind of thing at 78 years old!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The treatment of the gang members was so one dimensional and clearly no research had been made into gang culture. I can see that and i'm an ancient 37 yr old!!

I appreciate the fact that Eastwood, as a working actor and director, champions elders in our culture. As someone who hails from the Detroit area, but has lived elsewhere in the U.S., I appreciate the film's depiction of Detroit's little known diversity and the fact that Kowalski was a proud city dweller - in an older neighborhood. Most of all, standing up to a gang is something that all Detroiters and people in many parts of the country, and world, can cheer. I do hate the fact that so many characters with guts are depicted as alcoholics in film, let's get beyond that.

Good film of Eastwood,"Good film of Eastwood. Clint Eastwood serves as the pinnacle and emotional core that embraces the beauty of this film. Though there are a few flaws in terms of narrative, his brutally gripping portrayal of the lead character manages to lay those blemishes to obscurity. In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to his character who is gripped with tragedy and struggles with his faith with only his church preacher Father Janovich (played by Christopher Carley) being his aiding hand. Before too long, the character retains a grumpy, tough-minded, and prejudicial demeanor as he's grown hate to everyone of various racial status. One scene the young Korean teenager beaten and harassed by a gang who put him in a dog pile on Kowalski's yard, only to be interrupted by Kowalski himself who points a rifle at them and threatens to open fire if they don't leave his property. The scene is truly intense and sparks a fair amount of tension and unease. Furthermore, the character's near-constant use of racial slurs towards Asians and African-Americans and intimidating threats punctuate his cynical and hard-to-like nature. Clint Eastwood gives honestly one of his most arresting performances in recent years. He's an actor who doesn't take commitment for his role for granted. The almost equally powerful aspect of the film is the ironic relationships between the main character and the young Korean teenager who is brilliantly portrayed by Bee Vang. We watch as the bond between the two characters changes not only the troubled young man from turning to a life of crime by his cousin's tyrannical gang but also Kowalski's attitude towards the family and his determination to protect the family he once despised. The atmosphere is both dark and deeply moving, particularly the powerful and bittersweet ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Real masterpiece, with unknown actors - excl. Eastwood","In his latest movie (so far, hopefully) Clint Eastwood has shown again both his talented directing and acting. Another profound movie, where black-and-white attitudes obtain vivid nuances even in case of an old man (Eastwood was 78 when the movie was finalized). In spite of miserable and dangerous background, one has several bursts of laughter due to Eastwood character's appearance and his vocabulary and expression of stereotypes. One point less is given by me due to several clichés; pre-end of the movie, however, was different from my expectations.Moreover, it was educational to get to know culture and customs of the Hmong people - a relatively small group split into several countries in Asia and having difficult times even in the end of last century.Highly recommendable!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

But if you ever have seen another Clint Eastwood movie, you know that this movie measures up to following some of the greatest movies made by Clint Eastwood.""Gran Torino"" is one of those movies that you just get drawn into and it can make you want to watch it over and over. The overall theme of the movie is to not give up on what you believe in and keep fighting for what you think is right. Walt Kowalski befriends an Asian family where the son Thao is bullied and a gang attempts to force him into their gang. Walt fights for what he feels is right and teaches the kid ""how to be a man."" Walt Kowalski is shown as a 'hardass' in the movie and you kind of get the notion that he really doesn't care about a lot and you wonder what is going to happen throughout the movie; but you soon learn what Walt is really about. Walt Kowalski wants to teach Thao the important things in life and wants to pull him away from the gang life that he could be destined for is he continues on the route his life is on.Some people can argue with this movie and say that it wasn't one of Clint Eastwood's best movies but as director and actor, Eastwood made a very touching and heartfelt movie that everyone can truly say they took something from. This is a movie that can teach everyone something new and could definitely be looked at as an inspirational film.

The premise of this story was promising: a bigoted, crusty old Korean War vet with a chip on his shoulder forms an unlikely friendship with his Hmong neighbors. It COULD have been a great movie, and it started out well enough. But the acting was SO overdone, the script was SO cliché, and the characters were WAY too caricaturized, that the story soon lost all credibility. I was hoping that the film would portray a lesson about not giving up on people, even when they put up walls to keep people away. But Walt Kowalski was just plain mean.

A National Treasure,"I grew up in the 1960's watching a young Clint Eastwood on television in Rawhide, never imagining that he would evolve into a great director directing himself. That career actually began in 1971 with Play Misty for Me, an underrated thriller that predated and anticipated the more famous Fatal Attraction. It's hard to believe that the curmudgeons like in Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino he's now known for are the same person, yet here he is 50 years later still going strong. Not to mention the many, many, many movies over the decades he's starred in, ranging from westerns to romances, war films, police films, and even a musical. He is the living definition of prolific.In Gran Torino he plays a bigoted, recently widowed Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski who is alienated from his two adult sons and his grandchildren. His Detroit neighborhood has become (he would say) infested with Cambodian refugees. A family of them has moved in next door. Walt spends the beginning of the film growling at them. But despite his hard exterior Walt comes to know the Cambodian family and as a substitute for his biological family he develops a deep affection for them, becoming a father figure to the teenager next door who tried to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino in a botched gang initiation the boy was forced to participate in.Not unlike his Oscar winning Million Dollar Baby from a few years before, Gran Torino also features an act of sudden violence that leads to a poignant and heartbreaking ending.For his remarkable body of work and lifetime achievements as an actor and director, often both at once, Clint Eastwood has earned his place as an American National Treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another Classic,"Clint Eastwood is by far one of the best actors I've ever seen (and thats quite a lot), and his performance in Gran Torino is nothing short of amazing. Although he is now probably favouring the directors role; he is still able to carry a movie all by himself. The film is poignant and beautiful, and in my eyes, probably one of Eastwood's finest. The characters are both realistic and fully drawn, the whole film packs real emotion and drama. After seeing the trailers I wasn't sure. A film about an old racist, but Eastwood pulls it off brilliantly.I don't want to spoil it, but the ending really packs a punch, they're wont be a dry eye in the front room. It's a mix of drama, comedy and some action, although it's not a thrill a minute film, it will grab every viewer in different ways.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
themes of the film,Yes this movie deals with the Hmong and other races. first this movie introduces the Hmong community and some of its culture but Hmong people like all ethnicities including Caucasians can not be described by one view. for example the film describes Hmong as being shamanistic and animist but many Hmong are Christians also. it would not be fair to say all whites are white devils and catholic. of course this film draws out the stereotypes that many people have about Asian Americans as displayed by the jokes in the film. also the film talks about the stereotypical Caucasians that care about nothing but inheriting money and valuables. American materialism in short. their are different types of relationships that the Hmong people in the movie have with Clint Eastwood's character. the younger generation in the movie have a better relationship with Eastwood while the Hmong grandma despises Eastwood's character. and there is a good and debatable reason. in Hmong she says the whites came and lied to us and caused us to lose our homes and our way of life. it is true that during and after the Vietnam war the CIA did recruit and use Hmong soldiers to fight communism as stated in the film. the movie does deal with economic issues of race such as Tao believing that it is impossible for him to go to college and get a job. whether we believe this or not we cannot disagree that there are lingering traces of racism in America. the film does show that by getting to know each other we may not be so different yes different in religion and culture but not in humanity. if you did not know what Hmong is before this movie will give you a limited glimpse into the Hmong because no two hour movie will ever be enough to define any nationality or demographic.,8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino,"Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran. GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on American Family While at first it may look to be another episode of Dirty Harry or ""What would a retired Dirty Harry do?"", this is a much complex movie. Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his ""Dirty Harry"" character, but in the end, he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).I wouldn't call this a masterpiece yet it is a great movie, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood here suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor. The movie is about Eastwood learning tolerance and befriended with Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. The racist jokes and commentaries suit the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao ""Toad"" Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance as Walt Kowalski. Some sad moments will even make the viewer feel mad and hate the gang members. But Walt Kowalski is an old matured guy and knows exactly what life and it's burdens mean.So through his experience, fierce attitude, badass behavior, and unique sense of humor, he teaches Thao a lesson of life. The way the plot unfolds is awesome to watch. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 25 odd-minutes to prepare the viewer for climax, which left me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt overwhelmingly sad within myself. Yes, ""Gran Torino"" is profoundly moving and must watch for any EASTWOOD fanMy Rating - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good, Not Great","Clint Eastwood is a good director. I've seen ten of his films, one of them being ""Play Misty for Me."" A film that I think is incredible. But like any director, Clint's films can vary in quality. In the case of ""Gran Torino,"" it's a good film, but probably not one I'm going to rewatch very much. Clint Eastwood and Bee Vang put in great performances. Walt, played by Clint Eastwood, is a tough character to watch. His prejudices are the main reason for that.

Redemptive Friendship,"A masterful unsentimental tale of an emotionally wounded, war-traumatized veterans quest for redemption. Eastwood's character is a richly complex and haunted man. Equal parts blue-collar working class bigot, defender of the weak and marginalized, and seeker of justice on his terms. Decidely pre- and anti- political correctness, the 
barbershop banter scene is hilariously reminiscent of days when humor was non-ideological. He is at one old school and yet ultimately and sacrificially protective of those whom he allows into his heart and soul.

He pines for the old all white, Christian city that he is used to.After his wife dies, all he has left are distant children and expectant grandchildren waiting for him to die so that they can inherit his classic Ford Torino of the title.

Pure genius,"I'm not a fan of westerns, nor have I watched any other Clint Eastwood films so I came to this one with an unbiased mind.Our protagonist (or should that be antagonist?) is not the most likeable fellow. His constant racist/offensive comments are more comical than malicious but I certainly wouldn't recommend this film if you are easily offended (like the reviewers must have been that scored this film anything less than 8!).This film is so well-made, well-paced and there are some life lessons along the way. Not your typical revenge film but definitely has that feel by the end. It reminds me of 187, which is an extremely underrated film starring Samuel L Jackson.

Great film,"Clint Eastwood is a talented actor and a great director, a real master of masterpiece cinema, which I personally don't know much. All his films are vital, we believe in them, we believe in their heroes, we sympathize with them and empathize. It is for this that Eastwood's films are loved - for the fact that the hero of his films really wants to empathize. Thanks to him for that... Clint Eastwood just blew my mind as a director and as an actor. He said that this is his last film as an actor. I hope he changes his mind because Clint is a real talent and you have to play as long as you can. Although, of course, this is his decision, which I respect. In this film, he played superbly, simply masterfully. I don't understand why he didn't even get into the number of Oscar nominees for Best Actor, such a talent should be awarded the highest category awards. A truly great actor. Exactly in the same degree the Great director. Masterpiece creator.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Movie chosen by class Film Appreciation,"Lucia Rodriguez is a senior at Lincoln School. She is a lover of all types of art, fan of movies and books. Works in the organization, Un Techo para mi Pais and plans to study psychology and environmental law at the University of Costa Rica.He is more than just grumpy old man, he is a hero, he is the owner of Gran Torino.Gran Torino was chosen to be watched by my classmates in one of my classes. I didn't know what to expect from it, I just have heard that Clint Eastwood was involved with the film, and he is usually great in whatever he do, directing or acting. I really liked this movie. This movie is great in not just one aspect but in many; it has comedy, tragedy, mysteriousness and it has an unexpected finale. This is a movie that is made for different kinds of people and they will enjoy themselves. Gran Torino is just one of those films that will make you think about it for the rest of the day.Korean War vet named Walt Kowalski is a particular character. He is old, grumpy, and very lonely, tormented by the war and has no one special in his life. His wife just died and his son doesn't have a good relationship with him. His grandchildren only care for his things and not for him. People doesn't like him because of his humor but he is okay with it because he prefers to be alone. He lives in Highland Park, Michigan, a place in which lived working-class white families but through time it becomes a place populated by poor Asian immigrants and gangs; Mr. Kowalski was one of the few American white citizens who lived there. On a common night, Walt encounters one Hmong kid trying to steal his beloved Gran Torino, (a car that he had with him since the 70's), so he could become part of a gang. Since this kid, called Thao was caught by Walt, didn't succeed, so he becomes bullied by the gang. Through the movie it shows the process in which Walt creates a special relation with Thao and his family because Sue, his sister is always trying to include Walt into their life. Since he was in war, he is fearless and he is always defending their neighbors when he encounters them being bullied by some kind of gang. Gran Torino is mostly about Walt's life and his relationship with the Hmong's family and how he deals with the gangs.Clint Eastwood didn't just succeed as the director of this movie, he also did an excellent job acting the character, Walt. His acting was the most outstanding of all, I feel the he made the other characters acting seem decent but not incredible as his. He got right all the emotions and Walt's strong and intense personality. Since he was the principle character, he is the actor in which most of the viewers have their eyes on and with this incredible work he was even more notorious. Another character that seemed to do a great job is Thao. Bee Vang, the actor's name can be analyzed because of his growth and his change throughout the movie. He started as an innocent Hmong boy, who only follows everyone's orders and doesn't speak for himself. Then we can see how at the end of the film was a completely different person, he become a ""real"" man and he became stronger. This is actually a very difficult thing to do since getting into the characters' personality it is already difficult, but it is even more difficult to change so much throughout the movie. An acting that I didn't liked and in my opinion was kind of poor was of one member of the gang, Thao and Sue's cousin, Fong, also known as Spider. This actor name is Doua Moua. I felt that his acting was too forced and that he didn't get so into the character as he should be.Of my favorite scenes in the movie was in which Walt was firstly introduced into those Hmong's lives as one of them. It was when Sue invited him to her house where all her family was and his presence was kind of controversial to all the guests. This scene it is important because it tells a lot about Walt's personality and it is vital because it shows the beginning of the relationship between the Hmong and grumpy, old man, Walt. There is good comedy in the film that you can't simply avoid to smile or to laugh; for example, the scene in which all the Hmong from Highland Park come to his house with food, flowers and other gifts because he is considered as a hero because he saved Thao from the gang. He is frustrated because he doesn't want to get involve with any of these people and he is always pleading them to stop coming. There is a lot of comedy in those scenes such as when Walt decides that he is going to make Thao a real man and stop making him a ""pussy"".You get a very special and moral lesson from Gran Torino. Firstly, it shows that there is much more about a person than the first impression and there is an ability to love for everyone. Sometimes putting someone before of you, it is making the right decision and never to judge someone because you don't know the person's history and what he has gone through.As I said in the beginning this movie is for everyone because it has a little bit of everything. And I would rate this movie PG 13 because of the language and the violence in the film, and it is highly recommended to have parental supervision. I do enjoyed this film very much and I recommend it to everyone this Clint Eastwood's piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Shockingly Sloppy film from an Un-Characteristically Lazy Eastwood,"Gran Torino {dir. Clint Eastwood, 2008}*1/2/****Let me preface my comments by saying, I am not here to rally against this film nor am I someone who detests the work of Clint Eastwood (I count both Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven as two masterpieces of cinema). I was expecting to love Gran Torino, due to its impressive rating here on IMDb and its fairly positive critical notices, however, I found this film quite clumsy in its execution. Most of this is a direct result of an shoddy, inept script. This is not a situation of bad dialog (to the contrary, Eastwood gets the occasional stinging one- liner) but rather, of senseless construction and little care in story arcs and plotting. The film seems unsure if it wants to be a coming of age drama, wherein the crusty, set in his ways Eastwood learns a life changing lesson or if it wants to be Dirty Harry 6. In the end, the film is neither and is instead a jumble of both, and while there are some interesting moments within the two stories, every time the audience settles into the film's rhythm, the focus shifts top the other story.The film eschews character motivation in favor of crass sentimentality, and suffers from split personality in the closing moments. At his directorial best, Eastwood can bring subtle and delicate nuance to rather stereotypical situations, here his work seems shoddy and just plain lazy. Revelations are rendered unrevealing and due to the lack of care taken in characterization, the ending has little cumulative impact. Were it not for Eastwood's sheer magnetism as an actor, the entire thing would be a disaster. As it stands, this film is a wholly minor work in Eastwood's filmography and a completely unsatisfying experience.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great story if you can stomach the racism,"There's something extremely relatable about the character that Clint Eastwood plays in Gran Torino. Perhaps it's just because I'm getting a bit older myself, but I could totally understand how he was stuck in his ways and struggled to connect with his kids and grandkids. Perhaps those relatives were depicted in a way that was a bit too negative, but there is a lot of truth in the different ways these generations prioritize things. I could also understand our main character's struggle with the young priest who continues to irritate him. But the heart of Gran Torino lies in his slowly developed relationship with his Hmong neighbors. I cannot say enough about my enjoyment of these interactions. It was funny and heartwarming in all the right ways. They took time to develop things as well, so I never got the impression that people were changing on a whim, but they were actually growing and maturing into a true bond of friendship.I want to say I loved everything about Gran Torino and just be done with it, but there was one aspect that soured the experience a bit for me, and will probably keep this from becoming one of my favorite films. I struggle at times with characters that are written like Walt Kowalski, who have such open and unchecked racism. When it's this aggressive, it can feel like the writers are hiding behind a ""misguided character with a heart of gold"" to spew hate speech and play it off as ""funny."" Trying to excuse it by showing that his speech is just as vile with his friends doesn't do enough to make it charming for me. It certainly doesn't help the racist bent of this movie when it becomes a massive white-savior story. I allowed myself to forgive Gran Torino because you can view it as the neighbors saving him from his own grief, loneliness, prejudice, and hatred. There is also an element of regret in Eastwood's performance, and I tried to convince myself that was good enough. Besides, the story is so enjoyable that I was trying to ignore the negatives, but I wouldn't blame anyone who is horribly offended by Gran Torino.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

meh,"I've scored this movie as a 1 to help remove it from the top 250 as well as decrease its average. This decision is based upon the quality of the movie, which is mediocre at best. If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, the only way I can offer a bit of enlightenment is to encourage you to listen to any real-life conversation that is taking place between any two people at any time anywhere in the world, and then compare it to the dialogue in Gran Torino. I think you will find in hindsight that word choice, the pacing, and the delivery come off as stilted, over-played, and clichéd in a manner which would make ""Crash"" blush. As seems to be true of contemporary society, this script is out of touch with its characters' voices and makes up for this absence of authenticity by exaggerating obvious stereotypes, such as the brooding vet, the snarky girl, etc. Clint would do well to relax a bit and let the voices of these characters evolve a bit more, rather than relying on these rather easy character devices.Additionally--and I'll be brief here, because other users have covered this more thoroughly than I--the mere identification of racism is not in itself a commentary on racism; it is an opportunity to construct a story around racial themes which will illuminate different modes of thinking or behaving. In Gran Torino, Clint's overuse of racial slurs--from beginning to end--left little opportunity for racism to operate as a critical or thoughtful theme. In the end, as in the case of Crash, the racism theme was overplayed--obvious to the point of obnoxiousness, and reflective of an industry whose conception of human interactions is not evidenced by reality.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

There's a lot to unpack,"There's a lot to unpack about 'Gran Torino', probably way more than I could offer an opinion on.I fully acknowledge the talk about this film's potential impact on the world, namely for Hmong Americans (see: Bee Vang's op-ed), and I'm not saying it's perfect one bit. I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.Strictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character's lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski's face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch. If not for his on point delivery, it wouldn't have worked.Eastwood is the only actor in this worth talking about on a grander level, though I could've done without his ropey singing at the end, but I did enjoy the showings of the earlier mentioned Vang, Ahney Her and John Carroll Lynch - not that the latter does much, I just like the guy as an actor... all stems from 'The Walking Dead', he's in literally one episode back in 2015 and yet I always remember his character.I'm not sold on the ending, Walt isn't exactly redeemed and it does reek of white saviour let's be real, but it didn't affect my enjoyment in film terms to be honest.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Recommended.,"Racial and social prejudices are an imminent problem in modern society. Be it in Detroit, Bangkok, Copenhagen or San José, these are problems we can all understand and on some level relate to. Clint Eastwood does a great job integrating universal problems into a two hour film. With his excellent story-telling skills he sets up a background to the main character that enables the public to understand, yet not justify, this character's racism and social stigmas. The movie shows an evolution in the main characters and it allows the audience to travel emotionally with them as they face moral challenges.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a racist Korean War veteran. He lost his wife very recently and has to deal with living in a Detroit neighborhood filled with gangs and crimes. This is not all, his neighborhood was ""taken over"" by immigrants, which helps feed his impatient character and racism, that with his wife is not present to help sooth his anxiousness, has no natural limit. Walt as the viewer learns has little to absent religious fiber, as he dismisses Father Javonich's (Christopher Carley) help when offered and only holds very little respect for him because his late wife respected Javonich. Even though he has a rough, racist exterior, his moral character is impeccable shown in the one of the movie's turning points, when he saves Thao (Bee Vang) from his cousins gang. He is also a protagonist in Sue's (Ahney Her) rescue from another local gang and from his ""heroic"" nature is involved with the Hmong family which seem to understand him and appreciate him, because of his actions, even more than Mitch Kowalski (Brian Haley), his own son.The acting was in general very keen. The actors had a visible commitment to their roles, even if ineffective this commitment was not taken for granted by the audience. This is the case of Bee Vang (Thao), which lacked enthusiasm and verisimilitude in his character, as he was too shy when interpreting Thao most of the time and had some inexplicable bursts of attitude and energy which didn't fit the roll's general behavior. Apart from this the acting was excellent, Clint Eastwood succeeded perfectly in interpreting his character as did the Hmong family and the gang-bangers.The movie had a slow but fascinating evolution, yet watching the movie more than once in a short period of time may prove to be a unexciting task, as the rate at which the film evolves becomes much slower when the viewer already knows the outcome. On example of this is the scene at the beginning where the mourning of Walt's late wife is taking place, the images shown in the story-telling evolution is very important, but once you get to know the outcome of the story the initial scenes seem pointless and long. The movie's entertainment value is a great for first-timers.Even though the movie's entertainment value decreases after you have watched it once the moral value increases, as you can focus more on the moral evolution of the film because you already have a good understanding of the plot. More than teaching, the movie makes the spectator aware of the social behavioral problems presented in Gran Torino, examples of these are violence, racism, social and economical prejudices as well. Apart from the social critiques, Clint Eastwood thrives when connecting the viewer on an emotional level with the characters, which show a realistic development and evolution of their self and their relationship with others, which can classify the movie in the drama genre. The movie, through its gender may be compared to Slumdog Millionaire, another drama film, which is also characterized by the development of its realistic characters.This movie is intended for a young adult audience, which can understand the social interactions and social faults present in the characters, while not being overly surprised by the rude language at hand. The film is definitely not proposed to public below the age of fifteen, which should make the film PG-15. It is originally rated R, which is a little strict but understandable, because it shows very harsh language and some violent images but no sexual scenes whatsoever. In general terms Gran Torino is a must in your watch list, without a doubt worth the time and analysis.The movie is an 8.5 in a scale of 10.

Grandpa's missed gun-shot.,"I am an ardent fan of Clint. I like his 'casual' way of narrating a story in his Mystic River, Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima and Million Dollar Baby. But he failed in his attempt in this hasty attempted made-up-classic. I particularly hate this film because of its 'anti-communist' odor. I figured it was deliberate though subtle. Almost all of 'Hollywood films' have a habit of portraying 'communism'='anti-social' right from their James Bonds to Rambo s. I grew up with these films from my childhood. And now.. sorry my respected grandpa... If every one of you say say it is 'evil' then something is terribly wrong.Story: Walt(Clint) is a Vietnam war veteran in his 75s. He lives a lonely life confined only to his wife and two kids. Now his wife expires. Then he comes out of his 'family' shell of all these years; left alone at his home; his kids got married and moved away and particularly interested in Clint's house than himself. Now he begins to look around his neighbourhood which is fully occupied by Asians(Hmongs) irritatingly. Him seeing Hmongs whom he thinks as 'Chinks' he fought against in Vietnam and hates them (gooks). The generation gap of him being an old-timer who is very rude and demands high respect also separates him from the youngsters who are around. A teenage Hmong girl next door befriends him and his relationship with the Hmong neighbourhood flourishes as he plays accidentally the 'guardian' role of these people from a 'local-Hmong-Rowdy' gang. Before he starts to know them he takes a major life-threatening-risk to save them. The story ends abruptly here before it floats. Oh..The Gran Torino. It was the 1972 car he bought and kept it as a treasure of his own, which the local-gang plans to steal, and everything results from it.Hmong people. One of the ill-fated people in history. They were tribes living in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The US used(hired ?) them as 'mercenaries' in Vietnam War against their own people. The ill-fate here is the usage of an ethnic group against their own. I suspect the ignorance/illiteracy of Hmong people easily trapped them into standing against their own people/freedom. Who trapped them ? The US. When US lost the war they just returned 'back to their land' leaving these people 'in their own land'. Hmong people were obviously the traitors and they might have been brutally killed in thousands. And they were killed after the war by the Laos Communist Govt. Several thousands of them migrated to California.The movie is politically motivated and hence loses its 'story value' as a pure story. If those people whom Clint encounters were not Hmong people then story would have been better because it does not have anything to deal with any 'politics' in this story. Hmongs story plays a dirty politics of 'praising Hmongs as people who fought as allies of US for their freedom'(whose freedom in whose land ?). And that leads to Clint 'fighting for Hmongs freedom in the free country'. Alas..All Walt deals-with in this film are inter-personal-communal relationships; personal emotions; humanitarian views. I got very disappointed by this biased portrayal of American Nationalism, by my beloved director Clint Eastwood. I feel very sad that all his acting and narration have gone wasted because Walt so quickly convinced to a life-changing-decision for some people whose existence he never cared just a month back.I hoped to give more higher rating until I heard the word Hmong.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"I think some, if not many will agree with me","Its either me out of touch here or everybody else who wrote those high praising comments and all...I felt, all the way through, that this movie was over rehearsed, over done in every single aspect you can think off. Almost every single character in this movie was pushed to the extremes of stereotypes that it just didn't feel right. Walt was over angry, over lonely, over stubborn and you can probably put ""over"" in front of any describing adjective of that character. The opposite of Walt, the Chinese guy, was over ""the mentioned adjectives"" in exactly the opposite direction, and this is the theme that runs through the entire movie and all characters involved.

Welcome to the depression-dark-humor rollercoaster,"The movie Gran Torino was suggested by a teacher, so as usual I had no good expectations. However, I was proved wrong when after 10 minutes since the movie started, I was already laughing.The plot line follows Walt Kowalski, a war veteran who seems to have nothing but hatred towards humanity as a whole, even his own family. As serious as he wanted or tried to look, his face was automatically sarcasm to me, turning it undoubted funny. He ends up meeting his neighbours, a family of Hmong immigrants who he didn't fully know or understand. Throughout the movie his character is presented as someone strong and fearless, which is something that I really liked about it. Kowalski seemed to say what everyone had in mind but didn't dare to express.My expectations were held until the end, since the movie seemed to be going well with all the historical references and cultural details that I found very interesting. Either way, the rollercoaster of jokes and laughing came to halt. I personally didn't like it considering it turned my expectations around and gave us all as spectators a slap in the face. To me it was not expected, even though there were clues around the entire movie. But considering the ending was the most ""realistic"" option to pick, we should be expected to like it, right? But no. If I want reality, I watch the news. I feel the ending lacked the action that was spread throughout the whole movie, and with it, it would have definitely been flawless.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Gran Torino's got style and class,"Clint Eastwood is back at his best in Gran Torino, a film about prejudice, hatred, and tolerance through the unlikely passage of neighborly love and understanding; and, the unmistakably iconic 1972 Gran Torino. This is not an action movie, but the action is never too far away. Living in a Hmong community, Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is in the minority, an elderly ex-Korean war veteran, a white male with a comical disdain for everything. He hates his Hmong neighbors. He hates his kids. He hates religion. His wife is dead, the kids have fled and the grand kids are typical spoiled brats. He's old and he lacks respect. The world is a bitter place. But rather than sentimentalizing about the 'good old days' Walter growls and scowls his way through life with gritted teeth and an inimitable style that reminds you just how good Clint Eastwood is. Walter is not bad. He's just forgotten what it means to be good. The shots of Walter making a gun symbol with his finger and 'shooting' one by one is a classic Clint Eastwood Motif: the lonely Pale Rider, the shooter Dirty Harry. Walter means business. Walter's not afraid of a fight. The Hmong community is like any lower-class suburban area: deprived, crime-ridden, where young people are faced with the dilemmas of adolescence: drugs, peer pressure and a struggle to survive the agonizing pressures of those that rule the roost. Thao (Bee Vang) is the young Hmong male struggling to find any positive signs of masculinity in this community. His English is poor, his manner is soft, and his heart is in the right place. His sister Sue (Ahney Her) is intelligent, witty and acts as the 'translator' of Hmong culture and traditions. This is where the 1972 Gran Torino steps in and becomes the well-earned sign of masculinity for the young Thao. The motif is symbolic and the moment iconic for the thematic development of the film. Walter is the hero. Thao is his successor. Walter and Thao make an unlikely but formidable team. There are moments of fatherly love, and of hilarious misunderstandings as Walter tries his hand at diversity and transgresses the rites of culture. The 'getting to know you' scenes will have you crying laughing. There is no doubt that the movie is simple in its formula. It's raw and the language is strong but real. Walter is tough. But comedy is never too far away: Walter sips a beer at the barbecue keeping a close eye on his dog for fear that the Hmong may place it on the menu too. Gran Torino mixes comedy with brutality. The film shocks and surprises and we see how vengeance can lead to nowhere. I was moved to tears at the end and this is a testimony to Eastwood. The ultimate message of the movie is one of hope",,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint good, Hmong actors not-so-much","What can you say about Clint that hasn't already been said. He's a terrific actor... no, make that, he's a terrific screen presence. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen, but you can't help but seeing an older version of every character he's ever played -- which is basically, well, just one: Clint Eastwood. So, given you know what you're gonna get -- you won't be disappointed with Gran Torino. At least when it comes to Clint. If he had cast experienced competent actors in the other lead roles -- specifically Thao and Sue -- Gran Torino would likely be a riveting, entertaining and award-winning film. But, alas, the amateur performances of the Hmong cast sink the film to, at times, high school production levels. I assume Mr. Eastwood chose authenticity over professionalism. Big mistake. It's like hiring authentic hillbillies (who can't play instruments) for a blue grass recording. The ambiance might be right, but the music will be severely wanting.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood at his finest,"Set in present day Detroit, Gran Torino stars Clint Eastwood as the recently widowed Walt Kowalski, a veteran of the Korean War and retired line worker from Ford Motor Company. The supporting roles in the film are played by actor Bee Vang as Thao and actress Ahney Her as Sue. Gran Torino is a film about relationships, tolerance and diversity. Most of all it's about friendship and what we are willing to sacrifice to give the people we care about a chance at a better life.Grant Torino is about Walk Kowalski, a man, who has suffered with guilt since his days during the Korean War. Since the passing of his wife, Walt has very little to look forward to and his life no longer has purpose. He is your typical angry, bitter, grumpy old man set in his ways and ideals. Walt has very little tolerance for diversity. He's constantly using racial slurs when talking to or about his Hmong next door neighbors, Thao and Sue.Without thinking Walt reacts to the threat of danger quickly, and protects Thao from members of a gang who are trying to recruit him. News travels fast in the Hmong community and Walt becomes somewhat of a hero after this incident. Walt unwillingly begins friendships with both Thao and Sue. Sue is as quick witted as Walt. She isn't afraid to call him out and she is not intimidated by his anger. Walt has met his match with Sue and he appreciates her candidness. Walt's relationship with Thao is very different. Thao is quiet, shy, and intimidated by Walt. Walt sees an opportunity with Thao to teach and help him become a better man. Walt soon realizes he has more in common with them then he realized.The film was shot on rough-grain film, creating a better connection to the location. The film stock selection contributes to the look and feel of the hopelessness that surrounds the area in which Walt lives. It also makes the story seem real. This could be your town or someone you know. As the Director, Clint Eastwood made great use of lighting. Light and shadow change to match the inter turmoil his character feels. When Walt is experiencing happier emotions, there is very little use of shadow, light comes through. In his darkest moments, there is very little light. As a viewer we need to adjust our focus to really see what is transpiring on the screen. This use of light and shadow allow us as viewers to see the different dimensions of Walt.Gran Torino is a great film about how if we are tolerant to diversity, relationships we never wanted or intended may develop. We might find out they are however, exactly what we needed and we'll be surprised at what we're willing to sacrifice to give people a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Gran Torino, Eastwood all over.","The first thing that struck me when I started watching Gran Torino was the remarkable shape this guy is in at 78. He is simply amazing. The other characters in the movie are pretty insignificant and Clint Eastwood character Walter, as he is supposed to, is the only person who stands out. This is a Clint Eastwood movie, and has his name written on it all over.Living in a Hmong community, Walter has a disdain for almost everything except his dead wife and his 1972 Gran Torino. His wife, he says to Toad (the neighborhood Hmong boy), was the best woman to have lived on the planet. As Korean War veteran who is an Atheist, he thwarts all attempts made by a young priest to make him confess until towards the end of the movie, he tells him about things that make him feel guilty. Though this happens at a church, it's not exactly by way of a confession, but much like opening up to a friend. His grunt is a familiar feature throughout the movie, and it is the grunt of an old man flustered by what he sees around him and is wondering what the hell it has all come down to. But he doesn't bore us with clichés of how good the old times were, instead settles for the grunt which does bring up a smile.There are things that Clint shows us other than the main plot of the movie, which is a gang of no-good nearby rowdies are trying to force a young Hmong boy ('Toad') into horrible ways like their own. He shows us how his sons and grandsons fake their affection and love for him to get something out of him. They have their eyes on his house and his car and what not.Toad is forced to steal the Gran Torino as an initiation into the gang and is caught by Walter. He escapes but Walter starts hating him and the likes of him. 'Get off my lawn', he warns the gang one night when they are forcing the boy to go with them again, and in the process, shoos them off. Then gradually the neighborhood and the community start warming up to Walter and we see him sipping beer at a Hmong party. He even becomes good friends with Toad whom he used to hate and finds him a job. Everything is going on well till the gang folks assault Toad again. This time Walter beats one of them up as a warning and makes it clear that he doesn't want them hanging around anywhere near Toad. And that's when all hell breaks loose.Toad's house is fired upon and his sister is brutally raped and beaten. Walter is shocked and furious and we see him planning the vengeance with Toad. Toad wants to go right-away and shoot the bastards but Walter has other plans. What those plans are, I won't reveal now and believe me, it something that you might not be able to guess till the very last minute. And then it will all fall in place.Friendship, salvation and the meaning of life and death, all are answered for Walter in one way or the other. Set in Detroit, as can be seen from one of the signboards somewhere in the movie and also made evident by the dead streets, the movie also tries to bring back the lost glory of the Great American Auto Revolution with its focus on the Gran Torino.Eastwood in snubbed by many in Hollywood as a stone faced actor; and he corks their mouths shut every time he makes a movie. At 78, he is capable of things that I can only hope to do at 60, and his drive as an actor and a director is unmatched. He is, in my opinion, easily one of the living legends of Hollywood. You might not find the movie outstanding, neither did I, but not for a moment will you be let down in this gritty drama of a war veteran trying to retain his self amidst the diversities and perils of the modern world we live in.I have deliberately omitted key important facts from the movie plot, and as in any good movie, getting to know them won't give it away, but would just make the experience of watching it more interesting for the viewer.Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood from start to finish and trust me; you don't want to miss it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Grrrr... I used to be Dirty Harry,"Gran Torino (2008) ***When I saw the preview's for Clint Eastwood's new film Gran Torino, I kind of thought, 'What the hell is this?' Then I looked into it, and found that the film has so far received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Clearly, the advertising for Gran Torino wasn't doing it justice. The truth is that Gran Torino is simply out of sync with the current movie marketing paradigm. The film is a delicious throwback to old school hard boiled tough guy B movies of the 70s and 80s. Eastwood has his tongue planted firmly in cheek, and the end result is a film a helluva lot funnier than could ever be anticipated by the grim growly TV trailers.Eastwood, directing and starring, plays Walt Kowalski, a widowed and grumpy Korean war Veteran. The film begins with Walt's beloved wife's funeral. He grimaces with embarrassment as his materialistic sons arrive with their greedy and inappropriately dressed children. The sons seem to think that their father will get in trouble all alone in his neighborhood, but neither is willing to take him in. He wouldn't leave anyway. When one son later brings him pamphlets for a retirement villa - along with some other comically old-people themed gifts - he has a long scowly growl before throwing him out of the house - on the old man's birthday no less.Walt's neighborhood is now inhabited by immigrant Hmong families. ""Why'd they have to move here?"" Walt growls then spits; ""Why is that old white man still living in this neighborhood?"" the elderly Hmong lady next door grumbles, then out spittles the old man. The young boy next door, Tau, is something of a push over, and is harassed by his older cousin and his gang banger friends. They persuade him to steal Walt's prized possession - his '72 Grand Torino. Walt catches the boy and he runs off. Tau's cousin and gang return the next night to tell him they'll give him another shot, but a fracas ensues. When it spills onto Walt's grass, that's when he gets angry and pulls his rifle. He stops the fight and scares the gang off. The next day, to his surprise, he's greeted as a hero by his Hmong neighbors. They give him gifts and food he does not want.Walt later stops a group of thugs from harassing Tau's sister, Sue. The girl takes to Walt, and pesters him with invites and friendly conversation. One day Walt finally agrees to go next door to a party. He begins learning about his neighbors and their people, and is shocked by their kindness to find that he has more in common with them than his own two greedy sons. Walt takes Thao under his wing after his family says he must allow the boy to make amends for trying to steal the car. He, of course, becomes fond of the boy. He teaches him how to talk like a man, and gets him a job at a construction firm to toughen him up. After Thao is stopped one day coming home from work by his cousin and the gang, they break some of his tools, leading Walt to react. From there, the violence only escalates.Gran Torino finds lots of little tongue in cheek moments of humor, from Walt's near perpetual grumpiness to his bigotry. He's like Archie Bunker with a hangover. His racial insults are comical in their obvious bigotry. For some reason most of his insults do not seem malicious, but rather almost innocently ignorant. His Hmong neighbors greet his ignorance with amusement. Of course by the end of the film Walt has come to respect those who are different from him, and even comes to terms with himself and his own dark past. He's pestered by the young Parish Priest, who was asked by Walt's wife to keep an eye on her husband, and see that he confesses. Walt refers to him as an overeducated 27 year old virgin, but sees that even though the Priest is young, he's also wise. When Walt tells the priest he knows nothing of death, the priest responds in turn that Walt knows nothing but death.Gran Torino has a lot to say about respecting and understanding each other, while also sticking it to the attitudes of young punks. It's a film that could clearly and probably will be taken the wrong way by many people, just as All in the Family was in its day, even with its ultimate end message. But Gran Torino is cheerfully tongue in cheek.Walt Kowalski is something of a loving parody of Eastwood's bad ass characters of the 70s. He's a geriatric Dirty Harry. It's not an explicit comedy, but it is quite funny - and on purpose. Gran Torino is a genuinely sincere effort from Eastwood to channel his past, and has a little bit of everything, just like a good B movie should.",,Anonymous,Drama

Not Clint Eastiwood's best,"I was expecting to see something as good as Million Dollar Baby but unfortunately I was disappointed. The Best part about the movie was certainly Clint Eastwood himself, but the rest of the characters just fell flat. The acting of the younger actors seemed doctored and not up to the mark.Clint comes out well as a grim old man who's seen a lot of life or death in his case. He's shown to be Mr.Grumpy and does an excellent job of that. He's not like by ppl around him, not even his own sons, and keeps everyone at a distance. This all shows well with Clint's character in the movie.But the rest of the casts just don't seemed up to the mark at all. You've the young boy, referred to as TOAD by Clint who does a good job of a kid who is reserved but cannot act where the punch requires,such as the scene where Clint locks him up.The emotional bond that was to be set with CLint and the kid (what the story revolves around) just isn't set well enough. It just seems to go from scene to scene but didn't bring about the similar reaction from me (the audience) that Million Dollar Baby brought about.One the up side the humour was a nice touch and did bring about a few laughs that were well placed. Overall the package isn't just as engaging as one would've liked. I couldn't say don't watch it, but I wouldn't recommend it either. Certainly not Clint Eastwood's best here.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Country For Old Men,"""Gran Torino"" is director Clint Eastwood's prosaic and compelling essay that we are, in fact, a country for ""Old Men"". Though the film's trailer seems to suggest revenge flick, those seeking their solace in the salacious will not only be disappointed, but will even get schooled.If ""No Country For Old Men"" is the apotheosis of random Fate, then ""Gran Torino"" is the apotheosis of humanity and Free Will. One flips a coin and people die. Another reads his horoscope and . . . did I mention that I liked this movie? I don't know how Eastwood could ever top the sheer transformational power this film.

"""The lessons of life and death""","GRAN TORINO is another masterpiece from Clint Eastwood and is a story that resonates with the diverse cultures of America today and the issues of assimilation into a white America. Eastwood portrays a typical blue collar American in the Midwest, hesitant to change, and dealing with his own personal issues. But when he takes on his neighbors and begins to understand their differences,along with their culture, magic happens on the screen and Eastwood's journey is one that brings laughter, as well as tears, to his growth and love for others. The Golden Globes missed out on this film, but Eastwood should be there at Oscar time and GRAN TORINO is a film that should be justly rewarded as the themes of life, death, family and assimilation of cultures into the American main stream, are extremely important ones.

Magnum Bunker,"I recently saw this during its opening weekend in the Phoenix area.

An ambitious year for Eastwood as a director with this film coming at the heels of his critically acclaimed ""Changeling"" he goes in front of the camera to deliver yet another classic Eastwood character. At age 78 he plays a crusty bigot who is at odds with his grown sons and their families and the modern world in general. Filled with great lines from a story by Dave Johannson and screenplay by Nick Schenk it's got to be the wittiest drama ever.

"Extremely flawed film, which still packs a punch...","Gran Torino is a film with a lot of problems, which ultimately packs an emotional punch which will affect most audiences..Part of the problem here is that the subject matter feels like a well worn path - mined in so many previous films - gang violence, racism etc..All treated with equal measures of serious drama and humor.The script is also very clunky, and some of the scenes seem woven together just that little bit too perfunctorily..It's somewhat surprising that Clint, who i rate as a cinema legend (actor and director) couldn't beat this into a tighter, leaner film...The performances are all fine, the racial slurs appropriately confronting in the script..but there is a definite lack of style and the deft touch required to make this kind of subject go from over-earnest preaching to greatness However flawed, by the time you hear Clint refrain the theme in his gruff voice as the credits roll the powerful message of this film should have had its impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
We all love Clint Eastwood but can we PLEASE be honest and admit he made a bad movie!?,"I can't understand WHY so many reviews on here are just kissing Clint Eastwoods ass. There's no question Clint Eastwood is a brilliant actor and director.

But this movie did NOT live up to any of those for a number of reasons.I'll keep my review short but anyone with an objective mind has to be able to agree that many scenes and lines in this script were laughable. It says a lot when more than 1/2 the movie theater was laughing throughout the movie. Casting choices were no better. The priest was AWFUL. i appreciate Eastwood wanting to cast no names, and in the case of the the two Hmong children, locals as well who were starring in their first feature film.

A classic,"A variation on a storyline of countless movies but few, if any, this good. It would have been very easy to screw up this movie but Eastwood turns it into one more modest masterpiece. It's difficult to imagine anyone else playing his part and especially the comic aspect of it with the same dead on results. Having been an admirer of Mr Eastwood for most of my life I think his secret as a director might be that he has the attitude of a craftsman rather than an ""artist"". From what I've read about his on set tactics he seems to be relaxed and patient enough to wait for good things to happen and tasteful and experienced enough to recognize them when they do. This is definitely one of the movies he will be remembered for, both as an actor and a director. A couple of major awards would definitely be in order!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood does it again!!!,"Eastwood's age doesn't stop him from making masterpieces, and he proves it by making this powerful drama, where he stars and directs, showing the world that he's still go it. One of the most emotional films I, or the whole world has ever seen. It just goes to show that age has nothing to do with pride.Former Korean fighter Walt Kowalski observes his new Korean neighbors during his wife's funeral, and automatically hates them. Walt's life could be described as gone, for he can't cope with the fact that he's worn out, and can't reach out to his two spoiled sons. He catches one of the Koreans who moved in next door try to steal his most prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino. He realizes the kid, named Thao, (Bee Vang) was forced into it by his trouble making cousin, who's in a Korean gang. Despite several insults and arguments, Walt conjures up a relationship with him, as they bond together into a partnership.As usual, Eastwood gives a spectacular performance and gets extremely into his character, as well as the others. The music, also by him is not half bad. Despite Eastwood's lack of singing abilities, he still manages to get through it.A dark tone sets itself throughout the movie, turning to disturbing scenes of depression and hate.

The laughter from the crowd in the funny places was loud and genuine and the silence from this same large group was complete during the more poignant ones.At the end of the film, the entire audience clapped during the credits.This is not a perfect film, but it is damned close. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances *ever* in this film and with only a few rare exceptions, virtually carries every scene.The only scene that felt a bit too scripted was the barber shop scene with Walt, Thao, and Barber Martin, though it was still damned funny! Even if you don't love Clint Eastwood, you will love this movie. And if like me you are an Eastwood fan, you will experience one of his finest moments on film.Bravo, Clint! Thank you for giving it your all once again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Better than I expected!,"For some strange reason I avoided this movie for all this time. I presumed it would be a routine movie around the subject of racism with stereotypical characters.I should have known better - as it stars and is directed by the great Clint Eastwood. Admittedly the movie does start out fairly predictably and you kinda think you can guess how the story might pan out.Good performances by all the major players - the goodies and the baddies!!! The thug gang types were very realistic. I do think that Clint's racist character is very in-tune with the 'average' racist in as much as he has preconceived ideas and beliefs about 'recent' foreign immigrants. Clint's character himself is an polish immigrant from many years ago and regards himself as a true American, rather than a Polish immigrant! Worth a watch - it comes round on TV fairly regularly - it is more than just a routine racism movie, it goes a lot deeper.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
not realistic,"All Clint Eastwood directed movies are watchable as there's always a poignant story to tell that ambles along in its own time, this movie is no exception. However, unlike his earlier work, I found it very unrealistic that Walt would effectively give up his life for Thao. In the space of a few scenes, we're meant to believe that this crusty, inflexible, set in his ways, racist etc old man who has hated Asians and their ilk for generations now would fall over for them, I don't buy it even if he hates his family and is dying himself. Men like that always go to their grave bitter and angry. But as Clint was acting in his own movie, he can do what he wants I guess. Similarily, when confronting gang bangers in earlier scenes, again why would they just stand aside and let him do whatever he wants, maybe Clint was yearning to be ""harry"" one last time, very noble but sadly unrealistic and that detracts from the movie for me. Otherwise, its a decent story about modern America although, at times it seemed like a documentary about the Hmong people with sue explaining their culture, why they are in the US etc! Clint Eastwood is an amazing actor and director but I think his ego got in the way of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another Masterpiece From Mr. Eastwood,"This movie is by far one of the best pictures of this decade. Mr. Eastwood has obviously perfected his trade.. making movies that entertain and teach on the highest possible level.. Very well written script.. and a genius performance by Mr.Eastwood that its almost impossible to see anyone who can top that . This movie is really genuine in its story, emotions and its lessons.. it will leave you thinking a lot about matters of life and death and it has the perfect balance between tragedy , drama and comedy. Just watching the facial expressions of Mr. Eastwood in the very first ( Funeral ) scene really says a lot. I salute Mr.Eastwood and all the cast for the wonderful performance. This is a must see movie! 10 out of 10... Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a shame.,"When I first looked up this movie on IMDb, and saw the nominations along with the user rating; I thought this movie was going to be a blast. I started to watch it, with great expectations. But as the movie went on, with Mr. Eastwood constantly making inhuman noises, launching non-funny - but ""all-american; I'm-a-RAW-son-of-a-b****, the world has hurt me, and left me to rot"" jokes, and ""mingleing"" with the horrible cast - I just wasn't entertained. I'm still getting goosebumps of humiliation on behalf of Bee Vang (The actor who plays Thao), in the scene where he is locked in Walt's cellar; once again, horrible, horrible. At the end, I was just really disappointed in the movie. It could have been a great accomplishment - but it didn't, at all, rip itself off the Hollywood wallpaper. We have seen this movie a thousand times before, and will most likely see a thousand more of them (perhaps a few this Summer already).So WHY this movie is rated 8,5 here, and has been nominated for a golden globe, is a mystery to me.Footnote - Clint proves, that just because you have done a curtain thing for many, many years - it doesn't mean that you have gotten better and better.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""As Good As It Gets"" meets ""Dirty Harry""","""Gran Torino"" really took me by surprise. I expected a movie that was much more serious in tone. After the epic ""Changeling"", the two World War II movies, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Mystic River"" I didn't think Eastwood would get back to entertaining cinema anymore. And yet, ""Gran Torino"" is just that for the most part. The first two thirds of the movie are actually laugh out loud funny. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski runs his mouth with so many politically incorrect statements, it's a delight. The character is somehow reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"", but of course Eastwood adds his own ""Dirty Harry""-spin.Kowalski is a gun toding, grumpy old Republican, slightly racist, but with a golden heart. At first disgusted by the all Asian neighbourhood, Walt doesn't give a crap about the people living next door. However, more or less by accident he strikes up an unlikely friendship with the family's daughter and finds himself caring more and more for her and her mother and brother.As I've said, watching this movie you can have a jolly good time. The line's are funny because Eastwood delivers his racist slurs so dryly and quickly. It's not all mindless comedy, though. If it was, you wouldn't care as much for the characters. ""Gran Torino"" has a nice morale to it - drawing blood for blood isn't the right thing to do, and prejudice is no good.Still, Eastwood's latest movie as a director (and his last as an actor) is more entertaining than it is educating. The dialog seems structured for the most part, the characters are a bit clichéd and the ending is highly unrealistic. None of that takes away from the quality of Eastwood's work, though. I'd even go as far as calling this the best movie he's made since ""Unforgiven"", maybe even longer.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood's Final Performance is Vintage Clint,"I've seen this movie twice already and I'm sure I'll see it again. I think it's going to be one of those movies, like ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" that people will want to see again and again, based solely on Eastwood's unforgettable performance as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in a bad neighborhood in Detroit. Walt's character is a composite of Eastwood's many different screen personas he's portrayed throughout his long career: ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, William ""Bill"" Munney, and the boxing trainer Frankie Dunn from ""Million Dollar Baby"" come to mind.The plot is Walt's wife has recently died and he is alone in his home, coming to grips with what's left of his life. He doesn't get along with his sons, who live in the distant suburbs. He has a contentious relationship with his parish priest, who won't take no for an answer when it comes to getting Walt to attend confession. He doesn't get along with his neighbors, who happen to be Hmong immigrants. However, when the neighbors are harassed by Asian gangs, Walt springs to their defense and an unlikely friendship develops between Walt, his neighbors, and the Hmong community, who view Walt as a hero. The rest of the film develops the friendship between Walt, and his neighbors Thao, and Sue, both Hmong teenagers, while protecting them from the predations of the marauding Asian gang.It's an incredible story with a fitting ending. Eastwood has gone on record as saying this is his last film as a lead actor. It's seems only right and proper that his last film was his best.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Blue Collar Character Study,"Roger Ebert wrote many brilliant movie reviews. He missed on this one. He said it was a formula story of a gruff old man whose heart was softened. That description applies better to Pixar's ""Up"" than to this movie.We don't see Walt Kowalsky's character change, we see it gradually revealed. He throws around ethnic slurs because working people of his generation did. For him they are descriptions, not pejorative. He lives in a multi ethnic neighborhood and knows enough about the people around him to use them accurately. He is well aware that it's unfashionable. He takes Thao to the barber shop to teach him the nuances.Walt Kowalski served as an infantryman in the Korean War. People probably called him a hero. He knows better. The enemy troops were always human to him; just another ethnicity. Many were younger than he was. His time there marked him.His wife is dead. He's unhappy with the way his sons turned out. His neighbors have a serious gang problem. He sees a way to solve it, and perhaps be a true hero.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Exceptional,"I'll keep this short, Gran Torino was an amazing film. I walked in knowing little about the plot but hearing it was a great film. My expectations were low so it probably increased my overall reaction.You can find a better plot description elsewhere so I won't waste your (and my) time. Clint Eastwood was absolutely fantastic and I was shocked to see a best actor nomination wasn't given to one of the best performances I have ever seen in a film. The Asian gang harassing the neighborhood were menacing and genuinely scary. I felt uneasy every time they showed up and was glad they weren't reduced to the clichés they so easily could have become.But what made the movie for me was that Gran Torino felt real. It didn't feel like a green screen studio with paid actors and trailers off screen. There weren't any references to Eastwood's older films, no shameless product placement and nothing that could show you're watching a movie rather than looking out your window.See this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
So real,"Mr. Eastwood, Bravo. You have an amazing way of writing and acting that touches every cord. I went to this movie not really knowing what it was about but you told a story that really touched my heart.I had a neighbor just like Walt, a WW I veteran that all the kids in our town were afraid of but me and my siblings. He protected our end of the street with the vigor of a warrior while feeding me peppermint candies. I had forgotten about Ken until now. I believe that he has continued to protect me all these years.Your movie has so many levels, from respect and acceptance within a family, restitution of past events, repentance, true love, genuineness, and I could go on if I was an eloquent writer such as yourself. The theater audience laughed in disbelief during the movie at what you were saying and sobbed during the credits as if we had lost our own father. I have never seen an audience respond in such a way in my life and it was because of your genius. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood is alone by also his character and performance,"İ was hoping something more in the beginning because in Eastwood's films i expect more,his intelligence is unquestionable but in this film he is playing by himself. He really shows his quality by his performance (one of the best in this year) but the rest of the cast was miserable. So film can be watch just for one man's acting.Eastwood's direction is perfect simple but effective and screenplay(jokes was brilliant) is well but not good enough to tolerance bad acting.But i can guarantee you that you will laugh a lot when watching Eastwood he is really good at in this in this film.He must choose the rest of his cast more carefully after this film",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

An instant classic,"When I saw Gran Torino in the cinema, I found myself gloriously amused in one second – and howling like a lap dog in the next. In a nutshell: I wished the film would never have ended. So I was curious if I would still benefit by watching it a second time – if it might actually be called an instant classic. And my answer: I did. And it might.Eastwood sticks to his style by addressing the central topics of life in his very own (we nearly called it Clintonesque) way. As was the case for Million Dollar Baby – and perhaps any great film – our fascination is not caused by the topic's irresistibility (or have we recently missed a drama starring an intractable pensioner with xenophobic – not to say misanthropic – tendencies?), but by the breath-takingly outlined characters and their interaction. Nevertheless, we need to take a short look at the plot: Walt's life is in shambles. His wife left him via a coffin, his children want no part of him (except for his car and house), and his neighborhood has been overrun by immigrant clans a long time ago. Thus he's got nothing left but his dog; and his Gran Torino, this battleship of a Ford he helped to build decades ago as an assembly-line worker. This is the starting situation for a 116-minute-long emotional roller coaster ride through strange and even stranger cultures.By the film's virtuously proportioned intensity and dialogues with snarky humor we are not only invited, but are intrigued to participate in Walt's second life. Quite unintentionally, he changes the lives of an inexperienced clergyman, a neighboring family and finally – his own.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful Movie!,"This is definitely in the top 3 of 2008 films. This movie is so great, I can hardly describe my feelings in words. Clint Eastwood did such a great job making a film that moves yous and that everyone would like.Clint Eastwood plays Walt. Walt is a racist Korean War veteran. His next door neighbor, a Hmong tries to steal his mint condition Gran Torino. He is caught by Walt and he instantly reforms the kid and protects his family from a threatening gang.The acting is very good. The only actor that everyone knows is the masterful Clint Eastwood. The Hmong actors are unknown but they did a n excellent job.The story keeps you on your toes, waiting what's going to happen next. The music is great. The song during the end credits is great. You even get to hear Clint sing.At 78, Clint still goes strong as a drinking, smoking, mean racist dude. Go Clint! I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Grandpa Torino,"The plot of the story you most likely know so I'll skip that and just give you my 2 measly cents.Clint's latest flick of self-change, bravery and having an open mind is definitely another solid flick from this phenom of an actor/director. Gran Torino isn't perfect like his past pictures like Million Dollar Baby or Letters and Flag, but it succeeds like those do in giving messages.The film's really only gripe is the acting by the Hmong characters. I don't know why exactly that they all seemed to have zero acting experience but I'm sure Clint had a hand in that. Probably to make the movie seem more authentic he chose non-actors to be casted. And actually it works if you think about it that way. It's a guess, but it really seems that was the case.The story and the message he was delivering to people his own age is what stood out for me. I can't count how many times I've seen old timers be flat out racist or just express themselves as if the problems they were plagued by years and years ago are still a legit reason to be crotchety today. Stubbornness, narrow-minded ideals are major issues with war vets and children of the years past. It's obvious this will most likely be an ever-present problem but with Clint's celebrity and his loyal following of people who grew up with him, I'm sure it'll sink in some of these old farts heads that this is the sure way to think. Even for a young guy like myself I take these lessons displayed and try to keep my mind from becoming close-minded.So next time I hit up the local dive bar, the YMCA or anywhere for that matter and I hear a disgruntled old poop talk about his 30+ year issues, I'll tell him/her to watch Gran Torino. Then they'll probably tell me they don't watch movies.....",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood's Best,"Just seen it, and must tell, how much I am amazed.Mr Clint Eastwood and his team made maybe the best film in years.Without telling too many details, it is a must see. This movie speaks about all the things around us -we want to recognize them more or less-, humanity, love, compassion, friendship, isolation, immigration, violence, loneliness, cruelty, revenge, sins and shrift. However, this movie does this, without ""teaching"", and this is one of its greatest virtue. It is not just a movie what we see, but we are involved so deeply that we realize only towards to the end.All the supporting cast is really good, but the personalization of Walt Kowalsky by Mr Clint Eastwood is among the very bests of the movie history, and surely the best of Mr Clint Eastwood (and He has proved many times his talent).The directing is a masterpiece, after a while we live in the film, and the film turns to be our life and fate. The script is one of the best writes. The music (especially at the end) is also wonderful.It is a real challenge to find words to describe, but it is true, if there was only this movie, Gran Torino, only this movie for a year at the cinemas and in the TV-s, I would watch it every second or third day, and on the days in between I would think of all the things what we can call Life...Thank You Mr Clint Eastwood, thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
a complete blast for NZ$13.30,"having only seen the posters of the movie, I did not know much about it, except that Clint Eastwood plays a racist old war veteran with Asian neighbors. Of course I was expecting the whole tough guy thing from Clint Eastwood, but what really got me into the story was the gang culture in an Asian dominated neighborhood.now, Clint, as always is good in his tough guy role and even at 80+, he still seems like the guy u don't want to mess with. i loved the scene where he intimidates the gangs that he comes face to face with. especially the scene where he points his finger at an African American gang, like a gun and an Asian gang in later scenes.his relationship with the Asian neighbors, especially the fatherly figure he becomes to tao and Sue is quite nicely portrayed and at times hilarious and rather heart warming. he nicely fitted into his role as an old racist man, who slowly begins putting aside his prejudices and appreciating his culturally different neighbors.the dialogues in the movie were excellent too, especially the one's where you can see the dirty harry still alive in Eastwood. Man! it was quite an experience watching Eastwood deliver yet another Oscar worthy performance. I would recommend this movie to basically anyone who appreciates good drama with tough dialogues delivered with style.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's the deeds that count,"This movie is a one man project: Clint Eastwood, 78 years, main actor, director and creative brain behind this movie. It seems as if this movie is his final work and his last one - maybe not as a director but as an actor in his own movie.Hasn't he always been Walt Kowalsky? When he was younger he was Dirty Harry and later on Frankie Dunn, his character in Million Dollar Baby. In fact, these two movies are particularly similar because the characters are almost identical: They both dislike church, think badly of family and get attached to a stranger who becomes like a son / daughter to them. They have a soft spot under a tough shell.Many viewers have written that Walt's character changes throughout the film. I don't think so. I think people never really change and Walt doesn't either. In the beginning we don't know him so we judge him by his outside- his looks and his behavior: We don't like him. Throughout the movie we get to know Walt and in the end we even love him. We are the ones that change our opinion about Walt.Gran Torino goes deliberately against all trends of today's world: Walt is an grumpy old men, impolite and primitive, he has bad manners and is absolutely politically incorrect. All these attributes make him a very irritating opposite of the so called ideals of today's public world: fashionable good looks, sweet talk, slick appearances and phony political correctness.Walt (and Clint) doesn't like the direction today's world has taken. Its society is phony, weak and superficial.Talk is cheap. Nobody seems to deliver. He is ready for real sacrifices in order to make the world a better place? Are we?It's such a simple story (some say it's too simple) but stuffed with so many important issues! Once you start thinking  you realize the movie has covered them all - mainly through Walt's character: sacrifice and death (redemption), real values (they don't make them as they used to""), religion, family (relation by choice""), the future vision of society (not the white race..).In its own way it's a kind of a feel good movie even if there is nothing much pleasant at first sight. The message of the movie, though bitter, gives us hope and makes us feel right, because its heroic role model character teaches us the real values of life and makes a lasting impression.A movie must see for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood is still the most hardcore actor in Hollywood,"Eastwood makes this movie watchable. His presence energizes the movie throughout. I kept trying to imagine other actors that might fit this role (Duvall, Ford, Caan, Hopkins, others) and I came up with a 4 out of 10 rating movie. The rest of the acting in the movie is average at best. Eastwood is showing his age and is a bit of an anachronism (probably intentionally), but I still wish I was half that hardcore.I rated the movie a 7 overall. Gran Torino seemed to bog down a couple of times and Thao's (Bee Vang) acting was terrible. His dialog delivery took me completely out of the movie at least 3 times. The rest of the cast was solid with Eastwood obviously standing head and shoulders above the rest of the cast just by presence alone. In summary, he completely carries this movie start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing!,"I hope that in 30 years someone decides to remake Gran Torino. Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom.Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors.Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward.The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids. Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect.Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Tell Me Punk -- Are You Feeling Lucky?,"In the last few years, Clint Eastwood has enjoyed a career renaissance like no other, but I've become increasingly resistant to his films. Movies like ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" felt like masterpieces while I was watching them, but after I'd had time to digest them and think about them, they began to unravel. As for ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" I found it accomplished but cold and formal, like Eastwood was trying too hard to make a Great American Movie.For those reasons, I went into ""Gran Torino"" with modest expectations. Whether or not time will be kind to it I don't know, but as of now this stands as the best of Eastwood's recent string.Eastwood himself plays a relic from the past, Walt Kowalski, a lonely and gruff widower living in Detroit, hateful toward anyone who's not white and not much better to those who are. He reluctantly becomes involved in the lives of an Asian-American family next door when a neighborhood gang terrorizes them, and we see gradually see the ice of Walt's reserve melt as he realizes that cultural divides aren't so hard to hurdle after all. Trailers bill the film as a Dirty Harry/vigilante-type story, and people may come to the film in anticipation of seeing Eastwood kick ass. He does do some ass kicking, but the film has much more than vigilantism on its mind, and a surprisingly sweet and warm narrative emerges as Eastwood decides it's up to him to teach the boy next door how to be a man.The film is not without its missteps, notably in Eastwood's depiction of Walt's awful family, caricatures of yuppy affluence and privilege (he made similar stumbles in depicting Hilary Swank's trailer-trash family in ""Million Dollar Baby""). And the screenplay gets off to a horribly clunky start, especially in some early scenes between Walt and the neighborhood priest. But by the time the story had sucked me in, these flaws became increasingly easier to overlook.""Gran Torino"" doesn't feel like it's trying to achieve greatness, and maybe for that very reason, it does.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood Classic,"I am normally very critical of movies and invariably find a flaw in either the writing, acting, or directing. Not this time!! This was so well done in every aspect that I may do something I never do and see the movie a second time. The writing was absolutely fantastic, the acting was beyond fantastic, and for once there wasn't any politically correct baloney. There was certainly a great deal of bigotry, cursing, and crass behavior but for some reason it all came together and actually enhanced the story. I'm not sure Clint Eastwood is given proper credit for his directing and producing; this movie exceeded another of his efforts, Million Dollar Baby, by a mile. If you're offended by normal day-to-day coarse language and being politically incorrect, don't see this movie; however, if you enjoy a true to life conversation, by all means, see Grand Torino!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
To Sleep (and live) With Anger,"Despite the fact that Clint Eastwood announced some time back that he is considering retiring after filming his latest opus (Gran Torino), he is,in fact working on his next project. Until then,we can sit back and enjoy 'Gran Torino'. Eastwood pulls no punches in his portrayal of Walk Kowalski,a decorated war veteran (Korea,in this case),who is in his later years,and longs for the way things were,back in the day. Walt is a walking case of anger,bitterness & repressed remorse for what he did fifty plus years ago in Korea. Things aren't any better, when his beloved wife has passed away, and his two sons want to put him in a retirement home. All Walt wants to do is sit on his porch with his dog,drink beer & smoke. Things only get complicated with the fact that he's the last white person on his block (which is boasting of a growing South East Asian community). The icing on the cake for Walt is the growing number of street gangs causing trouble for his Hmong neighbors (whom he already has major issues with). When he defends his neighbors from the street gang, a troubled sort of relationship starts to form between the two. Clint Eastwood directs himself (from a crisply written screenplay by Nick Schenk & Dave Johansson) as well as a top notch cast in a film that incorporates drams,pathos,humour & action. Eastwood himself deserves major kudos as a embittered war vet who's glory days are far behind him (and has no problem with expressing it). Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film contains vulgar language (including some unpleasant racial slurs),as well as some violence (including the upsetting after effects of a rape & beating). Not a good choice for the kiddies.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
""" I know of Life and Death, But then Life doesn't haunt you like death does ""","As Clint Eastwood's life progresses one can see the toll it has taken in his movies. In his youth, death was a trademark. Now in the twilight years, he seems to have brought out the humanitarian in him. In this film called "" Grand Torino "" Eastwood plays a retired auto worker, content to live out his life as a ill tempered curmudgeon, misunderstood by neighbors and family. His sole wish in life is to be left alone with his dog. Unfortunately, his neighborhood is infested with Asian foreigners, some of which live alongside him. As he nears the end of his life, he observes the youth gangs in his neighborhood have little manners and thus constantly invade his peace. That is until one boy is caught trying to steal his one remaining possession, a Grand Ford Torino. Dodging the gangs is difficult and Eastwood's character reluctantly accepts the boy as a pupil and tried to inject his life's philosophy into the troubled youth. As a result, the elders of the boy reciprocate with kindness. This allows Eastwood to galvanize the neighborhood into a merging caring collective which produces an unexpected result. A remarkable film and one which supposedly is Eastwood's last. An excellent tribute for a single lifetime as Eastwood Produced and directed it. Recommend ****",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Peep This Reviews,"My favorite Clint Eastwood movie...and I honestly can't really describe why. I just absolutely love this film and it was an instant masterpiece after I saw it for the first (of many) time. It's a drama that at it's core is simply about an individual grumpy man's version of 'family' evolving and changing. But it masterfully mixes family relations, race relations, intense drama with some well placed humor. I just hope that as both an actor and a director that this priceless film doesn't get lost in the vast shuffle of Mr. Eastwood's filmography",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Fine Film, Don't Miss It!","I went into this film with mixed emotions, having read that it may be Clint's last film in front of the camera and my son's friends who had seen it telling me it was racist and nasty (18 year olds). Wow, what a film. My son and I were in tears at the end and for a film that could have fallen prey to so many cliché opportunities, it was clean, well cut and drove home some excellent characterizations without being maudlin or cheesy. If you wish to see a fine film that has great characters and a wonderful story to tell, do not hesitate to see this one. Clint Eastwood, despite his ""Dirty Harry"" image is one of the great film makers...period and for those of you who are film buffs, take a chance on a film that will make you laugh and cry in equal measures. Although I rarely rate a film a ""10"", I could not resist. Any flaws are overcome by the wonderful story and the rich characters in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another one of Eastwood's Great Works,"I started wondering if there is a more consistent filmmaker working in Hollywood now, someone who can be held to the highest standards and who achieves his goals in a more graceful and flawless manner. For the last decade, Eastwood has delivered one amazing film after another. Most couldn't believe that he could top ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and others along the way. Then in 2007, he comes up with two fantastic movies, and ""Gran Torino"" once again defies expectations and proves he is one of our best directors.It's amazing to see how this man can be both behind and in front of the camera and with his nonsense style, is able to direct a story that touches both our hearts and our minds and put together a performance that is a great achievement on his own regardless of the fact that the star is also in charge of the entire project, too.""Torino"" explores the relationships between generations and members of different cultures, including representatives of various ages and origins, using language that once would have been considered ruthlessly cheap and derivative, but here because of a tight and insightful screenplay serves its purpose well. ""Torino"" walks a tightrope, through a mine field of potential problems and backlashes and wraps up its very emotional story in one of the most satisfying endings ever in a movie.Walter is a character who has seen his shares of changes and somehow has built an apparently satisfying world for himself and his family. However because of experiences that are eventually revealed, his existence has not been perfect, and in his later years, he manages to find ways to redeem himself, help himself, and others.""Torino"" is a hopeful film, a lesson in how humans grow and can aim for better futures, lives, relationships by showing us how sometimes it helps to give each other a hand, putting preconceptions and prejudices behind; yet not forgetting that transitions are bound to difficult and bumpy.One of the most amazing elements in the film is Eastwood's solid turn as the man who must learn to find a reason to live again, even when this can only be done through the most unexpected ways. His Walter is captivating, dynamic, powerful, and moving, one classic role that is bound to be remembered for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A humorous and powerful movie,"I have never gone out of my way to watch a Clint Eastwood film. I had heard that he was brilliant, but it wasn't until i saw Gran Torino that i fully understood. He blew me away, and so did the movie. I had no prior knowledge about the storyline beforehand; as far as i knew, it was based on car racing, like the video game Gran Turismo. I complied with the movie choice and went along. What i liked about this movie so much was that it was funny and centered around the theme of humanity. It focuses on Walt (Clint Eastwood), a disgruntled old Veteran, who has just lost his wife and is adjusting to the upsurge of multi-ethnic residents in his local community. As the movie unfolds, he becomes increasingly aware and learns about the cultural dynamics in his community. There are difficult/unpleasant moments of gang violence and cultural ignorance, but the relationships Walt forms with his next door neighbors (who are Hmong, an ethnic group in Southeast Asia) are really enjoyable and touching. How they confront the problems in their community is essentially what it's all about and it is a very emotional journey.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best Eastwood movie I've seen...,"I loved MIllion Dollar Baby (which was my favorite of his til now), The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, the Unforgiven, and Absolute Power (one of his underrated ones) but this one takes the cake no question! From the minute it starts, it reels you in. I loved every minute of this soon to be classic. It's first off, hilarious. I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing either. Clint plays an awesome curmudgeon, one of the best I've seen. It makes you laugh, then shocks you, then possibly makes you cry your face off! I almost lost it. It's a tale about what people bring to other peoples' lives when they don't even intend it. It's a tale about great sacrifice and learning. It's about accepting people regardless of your own colored past. The characters are great, very creative. The side stories are present and interesting but not overwhelming as to take away from the main story. Superb acting by Eastwood and my only complaint is they could have worked a little better on the boy but he did a good job all around. I will watch this movie over and over again. I don't think I could rave more about it. Start to finish, one of the best movies I've seen in years (since Into the Wild or Lives of Others).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Get off my lawn"" is scary as hell.........","""How does he do it?"" is the only question I always feel like asking after I watch a Clint Eastwood film. This man is 80 years old but he still has the passion for cinema which makes new age film makers look like kids playing in the sand. The story of one man who has a huge amount of guilt on his soul and pain in his heart will be made a slow moving melodramatic movie by any other film maker but not by Eastwood.The sick 78 year old grandpa wielding a shotgun saying ""Get off my property"" or ""I'll blow a hole in your face then go inside and sleep like a baby"" sounds just as scary as when he said ""do ya feel lucky, punk"".This movie feels as if a right of passage has taken place between Walt and Thao.The fact that this movie was snubbed at the Oscars by not even earning a single nomination is disturbing indeed. The academy has overlooked a great film and the final performance of Clint Eastwood glaringly. The performance by the rest of the cast of the film supports and compliments Clint's performance very well. From the tough Sue to the submissive Thao everyone plays their parts brilliantly. The movie is very well written with perfect notes of comedy and emotion. And yes Eastwood will jerk tears from your eyes with this.For magnificent direction and performance by the bad boy grand dad of cinema, heart touching story, gut wrenching scenes and many many more positives Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino gets a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
the memorable Golden Years of Walt Kowalski,"Seeing Clint Eastwood now is like looking at a face weathered away on a mountain ridge. The crevices go so deep on his face that one has to put that right alongside the voice, which is now so growl-like (indeed Eastwood's Walt Kowalski does growl in some scenes) that he would be a dead-ringer to play Batman if Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns ever got adapted (yeah, he's in his 50s in the comic book, it's not a stretch really for Clint when you think about it). At 78, you wouldn't want to cross his path down a dark alley, or even just in a diner, without paying some proper respects. It's his presence, if nothing else, that makes Gran Torino compulsively watchable. It may be flawed with some of its dialog and plotting, as well as some key performances. But it's Clint Eastwood directing and Clint Eastwood the star acting in a near perfect two-dimensional performance (it works best as that, anything too much explained actually defeats the strengths of Kowalski for the audience), which makes it a minor must-see.But there's more. Gran Torino showcases, in some scenes that have blistering comic effect, a rarity in movies: a drama about racism that focuses on a main character who is a kind of dying breed of pre-Baby-Boomer era racist blue-collar white workers who love drinking their beer, cursing out minorities (sometimes just kidding around or what amounts to kidding around, sometimes definitely not). It is in that sense kind of like a Dirty Harry picture, in that Eastwood's character is an equal opportunity offender. But he also is wearing a similar hat to his Million Dollar Baby persona, complete with a pestering Priest and a protégé in Thao (Bee Vang). He's a curmudgeon, and the kind that audience's eat up. At first, indeed, it's instantly comical, like a more parody-like take on the old-man Eastwood persona, grumbling around during his deceased wife's after-funeral dinner and while, well, sitting on his porch chugging Pabst Blue Ribbon and getting his shotgun out at those punk Asian gang-bangers having fights on his lawn.This leads to the obvious point that what Eastwood does as an actor makes it so watchable because it's layered: we get the ""Get off my lawn!"" line that made the trailer look as funny as it is- this is, at least for a good half of the movie, a kind of comical Eastwood performance without ever breaking a sweat- and as a soul who can't seem to figure on knowing how to live since knowing death is kind of easy as a veteran. And yet, for all of the joy in watching an icon like him on screen, and for some of the memorable scenes that make it enjoyable (oddly enough, since it's not as good a film as it, more enjoyable conventionally than Changeling from just two months ago), its not up to snuff with what Eastwood's done this decade at his best. In his 70s he's been more or less on a roll, making masterpieces like Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima and even near-excellent pics like Million Dollar Baby.Gran Torino, sadly, isn't one of them; for everything that Eastwood has going for him as star of the picture, he doesn't cast the bulk of the supporting parts well: Vang is actually dead-flat or just flubbing a lot of this character of Thao, and his sister Sue (Her) doesn't far much better. The Father (Carley) is decent but ineffective, and these kinds of average pieces of acting surrounding Eastwood magnify some of the phoned-in qualities in the script. While it goes without saying Gran Torino is nowhere near as hackneyed as Crash or lame as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, for every powerful scene dealing with racism in the picture there's another that's just a little too tidy. It works best to see Kowalski not changing much by the picture's end, being still pretty true to who he is as a good person and a mean SOB, as opposed to silly scenes with the Korean gang who are gone for very long chunks of time from the story.For everything that doesn't work with the picture though it's just a lot of fun seeing Eastwood as this character. I'm not sure it is his last performance, as I hope it wouldn't be (as an optimist I'd hope he could find just one more icon-defining-and-redefining role before he moves on or retires), but it's not at all a sucker's way out of his iconic place. That's the way Clint, like Walt, would like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint Eastwood masterpiece. Solid 10/10,"Gran Torino (2008) is a beautiful masterpiece directed by and starring the legendary Clint Eastwood, which truly deserves a 10/10 rating. The movie is a poignant and thought-provoking drama that explores themes of prejudice, redemption and sacrifice.Eastwood portrays Walt Kowalski, a grizzled and bigoted Korean War veteran who has a disdainful attitude towards his Asian-American neighbors. However, when a gang threatens the life of one of his Hmong neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang), Walt is forced to confront his own prejudices and takes on the role of a mentor to the young boy.Eastwood's direction is masterful, seamlessly blending moments of humor, drama and tragedy to create a moving and emotionally resonant story.

Expertly crafted drama/comedy from Eastwood,"While Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is a fantastic movie in it's own right, it also serves as yet another reminder that Eastwood is a master behind and in front of the camera.The follow up to his Best Picture Winning film, Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood brings us another directing and acting performance, this time playing a grizzled, grumpy and ""old fashioned"" Korean war veteran. If you are a fan of Eastwood's classic portrayals of a cowboy gunslinger or a city cop, then you should love him in Gran Torino, as he is essentially just an older Dirty Harry.Yes, Clint Eastwood is truly a badass in this movie and it is great to see him back in this kind of role, even if it is sad to see him so aged. He gives an honest and unfiltered performance as a disgruntled old man living in a Detroit ghetto. While the film makes his character out to be a rude grump in the beginning, I deeply cared for his character and wanted to hug him by the end. He gives a great performance and manages to cover many ranges while keeping his concerned and on-edge personality up front for us to see. We do not get the full details of all the horrific acts he committed in Korea, but his demeanor and actions show us that we really don't want to know. This is the sign of a masterfully crafted character that fully completes his arch by the film's end. The rest of the cast however, needs some work. These characters were certainly important to the story, but the acting was consistently awful by these actors and sadly pulled me out of the immersive story. It really surprised me that this quality of acting would pass in a carefully crafted film such as this one.The story is simple and undoubtedly entertaining. I was never bored watching Gran Torino, especially during the awkward and jaded interactions between Walt and his uncaring family. These scenes of character-based tension feel like verbal shoot-outs with hilarious insults flying back and forth that I will probably remember for a long time after hearing. But when the dry comedic script isn't in hand, the gripping dramatic aspect takes over and it feels just as good. There are tons of memorable scenes to reminisce over by the films end.Now there is one minor flaw with the film and it's simply that Gran Torino thinks that it's more important than it really is. The social commentary within the movie is important to the story, but it certainly doesn't feel realistic or relatable to the audience. This leads to some moments that ultimately feel cheesy and sometimes forced. This doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining, but the social commentary sometimes feel unnecessary.In the end, Eastwood has crafted another cinematic gem that solidifies him as a master modern director as well as a classic actor spanning many decades. Gran Torino is very entertaining, touching and just impossible to look away from.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good movie.,"Before I went to see the movie the previews were looking great. I was expecting an action packed movie with a decent story line to keep my attention. I was soon told by a few people that saw the film before me that the movie was not action packed at all and more focused on character development. With that in mind i went to see the movie. I'm glad that I was warned about the film because I don't think that I would have liked it. That said, I think the movie was well put together. You can watch the few main characters grow as the movie flows, and the story line kept your attention throughout. Some people might get offended by the racial comments said in the movie, but i thought that they came often enough that it felt as the comic relief of the film.I saw this movie with a wide variety of people and age groups, each with about the same opinion of the movie. Which is why the movie got a 9 out of 10. The movie related to a lot of people and I enjoyed a lot. Would have given it a 10 but I thought that the trailers of the movie gave out the wrong feel.

An Urban Masterpiece,"The big screen has only been graced by Clint Eastwood's presence three times since the turn of the century, yet not a single one of these performances was after 2004. Obviously, being teased for years with his directed films and only a handful of film with his acting talents found within, getting a film with not only his acting, but directing and producing as well is simply a dream come true. Gran Torino is essentially a mash of American History X and Lakeview Terrace, and it accomplishes nearly everything it sets out to do.Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, a widow due to the recent passing of his wife, and a man that has been knocked down by the world one too many times. His two sons don't really give a crap about him, his grandchildren are a bunch of greedy little jerks, and the classic American neighborhood he once bhttp://nsider2.com/forums/start-new-topic-f11.htmlought a house in has been infested with feuding Korean gangs. Considering Walt has become a racist and prejudicial individual after all his time and experience on earth, his interactions with the people in his community are sometimes humorous, sometimes disturbing, but always interesting and powerful. The writing in the film is phenomenal, the character development is top-notch, and the story is engaging and significant.It is most certainly necessary for viewers to know what they are getting into before going to see the film, though. Gran Torino is a brutal and rough film that holds no bars with its very harsh themes and general messages. Like I stated earlier, the tone of the film is very similar to American History X, in that it does not soften anything to appeal to any specific crowds, and if some viewers are offended, well, they just have to deal. This method of film-making is rarely seen anymore due to how Hollywood is obsessed with toning everything down so it appeals to the largest audience possible, so it's refreshing to see the movie Clint Eastwood wanted made, done right. It's raw, it's gritty, but the film could not have existed any other way, which is a concept that will be become blatantly apparent by the end of the film.The beautiful thing about the film is watching all of the smaller aspects work together in harmony. The score is made up of great instrumental tracks that heighten the suspense and set the mood for each scene, and dead silence is also works in a brilliant way. The acting, besides Clint Eastwood's outstanding performance is quite good, and all the supporting actors are fine in their roles. The film flows perfectly, the impact is major, and overall, it all just works.After months of awful remakes like The Day the Earth Stood Still and failed potential like in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, watching a brilliant film with one of cinema's all-time finest is more than I could ever as for. While often raw and disturbing, Gran Torino is a film that needed to be made, as it does not sugarcoat the raw themes of racism and prejudice that are still raging strong in America, despite what some may say. Everything works incredible well in the film, and perhaps my only gripe is that there are some problems at the end that I won't discuss since spoiling a masterpiece would be a sin. In the end though, Gran Torino is one of the best films of the 21st century, and for an aging Clint Eastwood, this may be the last chance to see one of the greatest all-around filmmakers to ever live.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Eastwood's many talents trump a slightly flawed script,"""Gran Torino"" has to be the only good politically incorrect film to ever be made. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a crotchety and ignorant old Korean War vet whose vocabulary is a thesaurus of racial slurs. He's basically a racist Dirty Harry in his 70s-80s and the script hits us over the head with his unabashed insensitivity and cold-heartedness to the point where ""Gran Torino"" is half comedy. But then, as only a masterful director such as Eastwood can do, ""Gran Torino"" becomes one of those classic unlikely relationship films between a widower and his teenage Asian-American neighbor. It's a film with a great premise but an off-kilter script that Eastwood salvages into something poetic.There's no question Eastwood liked the potential he saw in rookie writers Nick Schenk and David Johannson's script for himself as an actor and a director. It is the perfect cap to his illustrious acting career, combining his great character acting in westerns and the Dirty Harry movies with his more dramatic pictures of the last 15 or so years. It's an unrefined story, but contains a lot of great storytelling potential.Taking place in an old Michigan neighborhood that has since become overrun with Hmong (Southeast Asian) immigrants, ""Gran Torino"" is about the widower Walt and the teenage Hmong boy next door, an introvert who is peer pressured to join his cousin's gang. When the boy, Thao, tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino and Walt unintentionally saves Thao from gang trouble, Walt, Thao and Thao's family become entangled, more so than Walt would like.Walt sort of mentors Thao in an inappropriate and grouchy way and he boldly confronts various gangs posing dangers to Thao and his sister Sue despite doing something each time to counter his act of ""kindness"" with a demeaning or ignorant comment. The script meddles with stereotypes a bit too much in this way, trying to use other characters' dialogue to battle the extremism of Eastwood's character. Sue, for example, gets hit on in one scene by three black guys who trash her white friend who calls them ""bros"" and to defend herself she starts calling them out on their stereotypical ""pick on the Asian girl"" behavior. Basically, ""Gran Torino"" gets a bit in over its head in trying to present an accurate racial palette.At the same time, diversity themes are part of the film's strength. No major film has focused on Hmong Americans before, and considering the prejudices Walt brings with him from the Korean War, they're an ideal focus for the story. The major differences between Walt's lifestyle and theirs is part of what keeps ""Gran Torino"" interesting.There's no question that Eastwood know what he's doing. He has an uncanny ability to keep the audience guessing what's coming but the story never goes where you expect it to. It's both engaging and surprising and his techniques speak as much truth if not more than the script.The only other thing hurting ""Gran Torino"" is its lack of an experienced supporting cast. Although Hmong actors needed to play Hmong characters, Walt's sons and the Catholic priest that pesters Walt to confess his sins are weak. Eastwood dominates the scenes he's in and if he's not in a scene, the film lacks power and authenticity. Walt might be a flagrant hater of all peoples not white and American, but he's at least convincingly so where the other actors aren't.So despite its twisted and questionably inadvertent sense of humor, ""Gran Torino"" is a triumph of veteran film-making and a dominating lead actor over amateur storytelling and a weak overall cast. The film takes refuge in its quiet but lovable teenage protagonist and the relationship he develops with a foul-mouthed old man and how both help each other in the end. We expect Walt to turn into a softie when he takes Thao under his wing, but he never caves completely, and that's admirable, even if it would be nice for him to take a break from the pejorative comments so that the laughs would be a bit more guilt-free. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint Eastwood is Gran!!,"This film is terrific. Clint Eastwood is at it again and I have finally come to the conclusion that in this stage of his life it is impossible for him to make a bad movie. In the past 5 years he has directed great films such as Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers, Letters From Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino. So many great movies in such a short period of time. Eastwood seems to be like a great wine, he gets better and better as time goes by. I really enjoyed this film. In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays an old grumpy and racist Korean War Veteran who befriends his Hmong neighbors and protects them from a gang. It is this unlikely friendship between them that makes this film work. And you cant leave out all the crazy dialog and racist comments which are what gives this film the comedic effect. Eastwood is probably the only person who can get away with this as he leaves all the political correctness out of place and truly becomes this grumpy old character.

Cleaning Up,"I saw this together with the recent Sly Stallone director-actor effort, ""Expendables.""That's because they have similar sensibilities of justice in the world. But Sly is an actor who makes movies. He knows that the effects he is looking for have to come from his face and body: the movie is just the delivery vehicle for his brand. Eastwood on the other hand is a filmmaker. Even in the spaghetti days, he was a collaborator with the director, reaching for an effect rather than a character.He really is quite a filmmaker and just knowing he is still vital at nearly 80 is cause for some pleasure. Never mind that the only reason to make this is to parade that fact. He's colored it with a story about old-school suburban texture because he seems fascinated with what it means to be American and how film defines and reflects that. Never mind that the story arc is as feeble and cheap as ""Million Dollar Baby.""Sly has never made a decent movie and never will. It isn't because he has dumb values. It is because he is an actor. Clint has made one excellent film and several very good ones. All of them are crafted well, coherently envisioned and narratively closed. I think I can summarize the style as economical. I prefer loose ends and open narratives, ones that deal with ambiguities, analogy and sliding truth. Clint instead shows and indicates nothing that does not move the narrative ahead. His shooting style mirrors this; investors love him because he doesn't diddle.One risk he is taking; the use of the muscle car as a symbol of a lost nation may become quickly obsolete, and thus lose much of the punch he built around it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood knows how to make a movie,"Clint Eastwood is without a doubt the biggest movie star since John Wayne rode off the stage.Eastwood has done it all and his latest movie shows that Eastwood went from being a great actor to one of the best directors Hollywood has ever seen.In this movie Eastwood stars and directs.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski,a retired auto worker,who is watching his neighborhood turn into a mixture of ethnic groups.Soon after his wife dies a group of Hmungs move into the house next to him.The Hmungs are a mixed Asian people who helped the US during the Vietnam war.Being a Korean war vet Eastwood has no liking for the Asians next door nor much of anyone else for that matter.He has two rather dopey sons who don't have much time for their old man and Kowalski ,being an equal opportunity hater ,seems to hate his own family as much as he does the blacks and Asians who are taking over his neighborhood.Kowalski's pride and joy is his 1972 Gran Torino that he helped build back in his days on the assembly line.The Hmung family next door has two teenagers ,a girl and a boy,who are soon at the mercy of an Asian gang who attempts to recruit the boy and harass the girl.The gang also develops a liking for the Gran Torino.Kowalski gradually builds up a grudging respect for the Hmung family next door.But the Asian gang soon makes life miserable for Kowalski and his new friends and he decides if the family next door has any chance the gang members must be taken out of the picture.This was a very good movie.Eastwood knows his stuff and it shows.As an actor or director he is among the best to ever appear on the big screen.He has a presence like no one since John Wayne.The movie wasn't perfect by any means.The two young Asian actors were surprisingly bad at times.I'm a bit shocked that Eastwood would allow some of their scenes into the picture and a few of the scenes were a bit off ,such as the scene in the barber shop where Kowalski was trying to get the young Asian man to learn to talk 'like a man'.That just didn't ring true for a gruff old man like Kowalski.But still these small issues aside this was a very good film.The ending was jaw dropping and totally unexpected and Eastwood used his own reputation to completely warp your perception of how this movie was going to end.I'll watch anything Eastwood directs and especially anything he stars in.While he may not hit the mark exactly on every film,who does,his body of work when it's all said and done will stand up against anyone in filmdom history,director or actor.Rumor has it that this may be Eastwood's last role in front of the camera.I hope not ,he is still more fun to watch than any of the little teenybopper crap-heads who some people laughingly refer to as 'movie stars' these days.But if it is his last acting role he ended his career with a very good film.Eastwood is one of the giants and we won't see his likes again once he wraps up his career.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Contrived, Stereotypical, Coincidence-Ridden Tragedy","""Gran Torino"" is one of the worst racial bound films I've ever seen. I thought ""Crash"" and its heavy-handed symbolism and enormous cast was bad, but ""Gran Torino,"" shockingly enough, makes ""Crash"" look like a masterpiece. Both have plots that rely on contrived coincidence after contrived coincidence. Both play on stereotypes to nauseating levels. Both have characters overcoming their bigotry to make happy endings.Where ""Torino"" truly separates itself from another kind of awful is in the acting and the writing departments. The writer (whose name I wont even look up) has no real views on the different races brought up in the film. He or she simply goes off of all the stereotypes he or she is aware of. It's so bad that we get racial slurs dominating prolonged statements from the cast members-- mostly coming from Eastwood. I don't know how many times I heard the term, ""Zipperhead."" The problem with ""Crash"" is that you had people talking in politically correct racism. They didn't bother to use racial slurs, which made the authenticity of the characters bigotry feel artificial. Those actors felt very restricted. Almost as if they didn't want to be too racist-- it didn't help that the writer / director was preachy and overbearing. Eastwoods character, however, uses so many slurs, so often, that is makes his characters bigotry also seem fake and artificial. It became laughable. And just to make sure they weren't picking on just the ""Spook's"" and *beep* they also slurred the ""Mick's,"" ""Polak's"" and ""Dago's"" I'm sure the writer didn't want to come off as too racist, so he threw everyone under the bus. All these characters, with the lone exception of Walt (Eastwood), are cookie cut-outs that have no depth and provide no cultural impact to the film (even though one character explains the actions and the values of her ancestry).The ensemble cast is amongst the worst in film history. The casting director should be shot in the face. The acting from pretty much every supporting role is bordering on horrendous if not well beyond horrendous. These actors are just inexperienced and way over their heads. Some of these young actors can't even say their routine lines with any sense of rhythm, then you ask them to have an emotional breakdown? Not happening.Eastwood is bad. Don't buy into the hype. Much like De Niro and Pacino playing cops in ""Rghteous Kill,"" Eastwood is just twenty-five to thirty years too old to play this part. His constant scowling and groaning under his breath becomes tiresome and it feels lazy. This is one of his worst performances of his career, and the guy has never been much of an actor to begin with. I felt his character had absolutely no depth to speak of. His character is actually the only thing that's fairly well written, but Eastwood leaves his performance on the page. He shows no range with this character. He never does anything in the movie but scowl and then put someone down. Well, he has a few bright spots with the young kid. This was a big missed opportunity for an actor in their 50s that fit the part to give a truly great performance. The two brights spots, Christopher Carley (the Father) and Brian Haley (Mitch), give the two best performances.The films premise actually makes for, what-could-have-been, a solid film. It has a great story with an excellent arc in the hero and a great ending. The ending is very good, and is the only thing in the film getting this any stars or credit. The ending is the reason why this film is getting praised by critics and completely overblown. I have no idea why they're calling Eastwood good, because he's embarrassingly bad. The Dirty Harry days are over. It just goes to show that people still love redemptive endings no matter how awful the rest of the film is.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Reaction,"As the films end credits began to roll, a very rare, tangible wave of emotion expanded throughout the theater. Added to this collective sigh of an audience finally being able to catch its breath was a few claps, which quickly became the loudest applause I have heard in a theater in years.Gran Torino reaches a level of storytelling that successfully one-ups Eastwood's previous work, and indeed anything released in 2008. The sold out crowd left the theater, some silent, some crying, and others like myself feeling like I had just truly experienced something... something wonderful, something painful, something so undeniably true and loved that it will remain a part of the viewer indefinitely.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood should be Captain America,"Clint Eastwood should be the real Captain America. He respresents and personifies America when they were the strongest. And his movies reflect the same. No different with Gran Torino. There is no bs, no moral lectures, just excellent storytelling. Something that today's generation of American kids sadly, might never be able to value.Its starts out like you are watching someone's daily affair and would question on your decision why did you choose to watch something so ordinary, but then it starts to make sense that this story is not an explicit Met Gala but a quiet gathering of meditators where you feel more than you speak or think.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino,"First, before I say anything about this film, let me preface this review by letting anyone who reads this know that I watched an ""Award's Screener"" of Gran Torino and I did not see it in a movie theater (so I am unable to comment on the audience- which, I think often times can make/break a film going experience.) Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's second film of 2008 (Changeling) can be seen as a culmination of his last decade of work. Eastwood, one of the few actors who actually might be a bigger draw behind the camera than in front of it, loves to tell the story of a man shaken by his past; a man whose faith in humanity and the divine has been uprooted through the harsh realities he has experienced (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby.) I see Gran Torino as a sort of ode to these films. Eastwood, the male lead, has channeled the characters in these films and ended up with Walt Kowalski; the Korean War vet who loves his lawn, hates his neighbors, and can't quite seem to reconcile his differences with the man upstairs. Sound familiar? For me, the film was more of the same; which don't get me wrong- I some the aforementioned films- but Gran Torino never settled in for me like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby did. I was never able to relax and enjoy what I was watching on screen because it felt old and cliché.Kowalski, just like Frankie Dunn (Million Dollar Baby) and Bill Munny (Unforgiven) is a gruff old man who never gives the viewer a concrete reason to sympathize with him or his wonderfully timed sarcasm until he begins to peal away the layers of his sun baked exterior and let his emotions run free. The ploy has worked for Eastwood before, but or me, it never felt right in Gran Torino. Even when he opened up, I felt like Kowalski was trying to hard to make me feel anything but spite for him. I feel like Gran Torino, at best, merely featured Clint Eastwood running in place. He brought nothing to the table that we haven't seen.Yes, the performances from the supporting cast were great, but Eastwood showed us nothing more than what we've already seen from him. Five years ago, this exact performance was moving and it felt right, but now it's nothing more than Million Dollar Baby two.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

If Clint Eastwood doesn't receive an Oscar for this then my faith in the film industry will be completely destroyed. How he managed to portray a racist bigot and then actually manage to make the viewer love the character was absolute genius. His acting in this film was better than I've ever seen from him.

"Eastwood's last, and in my opinion, his best.","This movie had one of the best stories ever in the history of film making. Clint Eastwood's acting for the role of grumpy and disgruntled war veteran Walt Kowalski is top-notch, and Bee Vang does a great job making the Thao character look how it is supposed to look- sensitive and soft, but eventually toughened up by Kowalski.This film also has one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen, especially when you consider their actions at the end, which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen this.Another thing that made this movie so outstanding was the dialogue. It was PHENOMENAL and filled with witty catchphrases, especially from Eastwood's character. Eastwood's character even used a few facial expressions that made me laugh, and I can't remember the last time I ever laughed at a face a character made in a film.This is one of those films where everything is slightly scattered out at the beginning, but throughout the movie, the pieces of the puzzle gradually come together, and by the end, they have all formed an awe-inspiring, beautiful picture.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Simply Excellent!! - Yet Another Eastwood Classic!!!,"Man, its just hard not to like Eastwood films!! Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging. It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today. Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs. For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes. He is also in a vulnerable place. He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood. He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, that he eventually ""modifies"" his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski - this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying. Clint was just wonderful as Kowalski and the actors portraying Sue and Thao were equally impressive.This one, I'm sure I'll watch over and over again. I hiiiiiiighly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Just see it.,"If you're one of those people who only watch movies that receive high acclaim from critics, or maybe one who thinks the the world is too rough and that there is no place in this world for the mean spirited white man, you wont be compelled to see this movie. Obviously the snobs and professors at the Academy of Arts and Sciences in their never ending attempt to shape the world into their fantasy utopia and pervert sex party clearly snub this film in an attempt to make movies like this go away. I'm proud of Clint for making this film because he is able to sort out people's differences and show that being rough around the edges, patriotic, and a little harsh, doesn't make a person an enemy of society as academia and the mass media would like you to think.Just see this movie and make up your own mind. It has no Oscar nominations because it doesn't fit the politically correct agenda that is constantly being pushed down our throat and shoved up our -ss. I give this movie a 10/10 not because it is the best movie I have ever seen, that would be Braveheart, but because it demonstrates a real depiction of life, the mindless brutality of gang-banging thugs, and the hearts of good men who are most often branded as angry white men.

Clint in Detroit,"After a career in which he's played cowboys, cops, and a boxing trainer, Clint Eastwood casts himself in a totally different kind of role. He plays Walt Kowalski, a chronically angry Korean War veteran in Detroit. Further embittered after his wife's death, Walt holds a grudge against the Hmong* immigrants next door. But after Walt saves a Hmong boy, it sets his life on an irreversible path.Whereas it is common for Eastwood to play a tough guy, this role takes a look at the changing America. Walt - who worked in a car factory for years - doesn't like it one bit that his son helps sell Japanese autos. The Hmong community's presence looks at the rising Asian population in the United States. Specifically, the fact that Eastwood set ""Gran Torino"" in Detroit - as opposed to San Francisco or Los Angeles - bring to mind the Asian communities across the country, and of course the outsourcing of the car industry (which left Detroit impoverished).All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. If, as Eastwood says, this is his final acting role, then it is a great end for him. Worth seeing.*The Hmong are a people in Laos. The CIA hired them to grow heroin during the Vietnam War to fight the Pathet Lao (Laos's independence movement), and many had to flee the country after the Pathet Lao took over.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not his best, by far.",I don't write reviews but I just had to say something about this film.Im a huge Clint fan and have been for years but this had some major flaws and I am having trouble looking past them. I am mainly referring to the acting. I have heard that Clint shoots really fast and this movie shows it a lot more than others. The obvious answer is the largely amateur cast he chose for this movie. Did he do it for budget reasons? I assume so but it kind of ruined many parts of the movie for me. That kid is just not actor material. The mother as well. Of course he did a great job but that's not enough. It's as if he was being lazy and wanted to just knock this out as fast as possible.I also think the singing in the end was just a little bit off for some reason. Worthwhile? Maybe so but I like his other new films more. Watch Mystic River if you want a real Clint directed movie!,6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sucks,"This movie sucks balls. Directing is really boring, and it shows in the actors that hurry their lines. It's like the actors ignored each other when they weren't filming, like they never discussed the script or anything. Then I guess the director didn't care, or just wanted to hurry production along. What's the deal with the priest? He's utterly useless, and the guy playing him is very monotone, doesn't deliver any lines with emotion, and his character doesn't affect Walt in the slightest. Walt gains a little respect for the priest, but that matters little, the priest is still useless.The cinematography is nice, so I give another point. I liked the stories' direction, kind of another Karate Kid, only without the Karate. But it takes too long to get to the core action of the story. Why the f#%^ would I want to see Clint Eastwood in a bathtub for? Then there's another scene where Walt (Clint Eastwood) finally has confession with the priest. And its the most piece of s**t garbage boring a$$ scene that I have ever sat through. Then I couldn't stand it anymore, an hour and 38 minutes in, I got up to go to the bathroom. Wandered around the snack bar for a while. Came back six minutes later, hoping for a gun fight.I wont say what happened, but it was okay. Not enough for the torture of the whole film though. Then the priest goes to get up and talk in front of everyone, and thats it I walked out. There was probably only a few minutes left, but I just couldn't stand it anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
A fine example of directing.,"Clint Eastwood has surprised me with his directing since I first saw 'Mystic River' (2003) and 'Changeling' (2008). His latest directing efforts left me sat watching the very last credits roll. 'Gran Torino' is a simple, funny and shocking drama surrounding a widowed Korean war veteran who discovers a connection with his neighbours, a Hmong family.I saw this movie twice and both times it delivered what a movie should, a consistent journey of emotion without overloading. The pace offers much room for prediction but I didn't anticipate the ending and how it would leave me thrown back into my seat not wanting to be the first to move as the lights fade up in the theatre.I thought it was great to see a director having physical input into the soundtrack to the film, Clint Eastwood & Jamie Cullum's track at the end is beautiful. I've been humming this since I I first saw the movie and I can't wait to buy it. Possibly one of the years best!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A taste of old school in these troubled times.,"Gran Torino - Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War vet with a mean temper and an unlimited bag of racist slurs. He unwisely chooses to live in a run down urban area in Detroit with gangs aplomb. After his Hmong next door neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) unsuccessfully tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino, the boy is ordered to work for Walt for absolution.Clint Eastwood delivers a great performance. The man is still damn intimidating, even at 78, with a face chiseled out of concrete and those just plain mean eyes. I'd be hesitant over whether I could take him. He's also damn funny, with his world weary attitude and obvious disappointment with just about everything. The mentioned racial slurs are ever so tongue and cheek, making the film just about as guilty an old school pleasure as can be. It's a comfort knowing, behind the screen, that Eastwood doesn't mean any of them. This also comes through on screen as well because Walt's interactions with the ""Chinks"" next door proves many of his assumptions wrong. Gran Torino has a few clichés sure, but the ones used work and work well. It's the truth and feeling behind them that is important.It's the first film Clint has made in a long time I've felt like I could watch over again and probably buy the DVD. Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, Changeling... All good to great films. Not a one of them I could sit through and watch again. They're just too painful and touch far too many vulnerable points. Gran Torino has wit to go with it's heart and head. This film considers what is going on in our society and what our younger generations are being passed down. I'm a young man, and I can safely say that generally, my generation is not polite and rather ungrateful. Torino also hits several sore spots considering violence. Eastwood is tired of violence. It's made far too easy down on film and the act of killing has been marginalized over the years without being given the magnitude it deserves.Perhaps it's because I love the Dirty Harry films and Eastwood so much, or perhaps because the film touched the old soul within me that constantly wonders just what the heck is going so wrong right now, but this film really spoke to me. It's one of the best, and last, films of 2008, and I enjoyed every minute. Gran Torino gets an A.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
GRAN Clint Eastwood,"In this movie, considered as his last tribute to cinematography, Clint Eastwwod leaves a very precious gift, by delivering an over the top performance: this 80-year old man truly dominates the scene, physically and morally, he makes think, laugh, cry, he is simply GREAT.He chooses a delicate theme, racial conflicts, but involving many others: violence, justice, revenge, all focused around an old man, who lives on remembrance, cannot accept the sense of uselessness brought about by ageing, a man who has made rage the reason of his going on, but whose inner moral force will turn him into an example of wisdom and integrity.The real conflict is not that between white people and Asiatic people, but that between real human beings, and human rubbish, which has no colour, nor racial identity (even the white appear in a quite bad light).When closing credits appear, and you feel so deeply emotionally engaged, you can't but thank that genius who was able to concentrate such depth and richness in two hours: that's a MAN, an ACTOR and a DIRECTOR. We can just learn from him and hope he will deliver other precious gifts.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood singing like a badass.,"I will try to be as unbiased as I possibly can because Clint Eastwood is one of my personal heroes and quite frankly, it is impossible for me to hate any of his films, acting, singing, anything really. I haven't seen Changeling yet, but I have seen Gran Torino and let me tell you, it packs quite the punch. What Unforgiven was his to his career in Westerns, Gran Torino is his swan song to the Dirty Harry persona and perhaps his Acting career overall.The National Board of Review saw it fit to award Clint in the Best Actor category a while back. While I'm not complaining, let me just say straight off the bat that Million Dollar Baby was his best performance. Gran Torino comes second. OK then.As most of you know, Gran Torino presents a 'what-if' scenario- What if Dirty Harry was old and lived in a neighborhood crawling with dumbass gang members? But it isn't just that, because Clint manages to do a coming of age story as well. After his wife dies, an Asian family moves next door. It doesn't help with the fact that Clint is a racist living in a town filled with different nationalities (aside from the Asians). So in short, he hates everyone. When Clint mistakenly (or knowingly) saves the next door troubled teenager from being taken by Gang members, everything changes.The film isn't just Clint kicking ass, its about Clint helping and teaching a fatherless, insecure, and lonely kid everything he knows on what it takes to be a 'real man'. You know those movies where the old, disgruntled man has a change of heart and decides to start helping those in need? Same thing here. Now before you kiddies start pressing the 'No' button, feel free to learn that the film uses the clichés to its advantage. We've seen it all before, but rarely with this amount of heart, which is of course provided by the amazing performance of Clint and his amazing grasp at directing.Now here's the kicker- you won't see the end coming. As cliché as this film is, the ending will leave you dazed and confused, until you start putting everything in perspective. Its quite powerful the image that Clint creates and it won't leave your mind any time soon.Clint basically carries the film on his shoulders (it is his vehicle after all). I mean what else could I say about his performance that hasn't already been said? It's funny, it's tragic, its menacing and it is funny. Did I mention it was funny? I can't say the same thing for the supporting cast however. Clint pulled a Bresson and decided to hire actors that aren't really actors. Its a shame that the most important role in the film, the role of Thao, was unintentionally funny. He composes himself in some scenes, but the rest just fall apart. Thankfully we have veteran actors like John Lynch pulling everything back together again.Morally, this is as good as it gets. The tale is full of heart and you'll leave the theater happy if you aren't one of those boring, elitist types. And while Gran Torino is a great film, things like bad acting hurt it greatly (even more so than the script). Overall, even with all those mishaps, this is an instant must-see.And please, don't expect the film to be an Unforgiven or a Million Dollar Baby, because it ain't.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood at his best,"Take Dirty Harry, Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven, let a brilliant director mix it together and you get Gran Torino. Immigration, gangs, racism, age and self justice are the subjects that are treated in a way that is not as you would expect from any other director.Eastwood is the old school American that come from another time. His environment has evolved while he has not. He is an alien in his neighborhood but learns to live in it. He manages to let his conservative way help improve his neighborhood while he learns even more form the immigrants next door.Gran Torino is a social drama in many ways, be it Walt's private life, his age, the immigrant's situation or juvenile gangs. Eastwood tells the story with his very own sensuality that is refreshing and has its own realism.

Another fine piece of work from a veteran actor and director,"Since ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" in 1964, Clint Eastwood's body of work as an actor and director is without precedent in volume and accomplishment in the history of Hollywood. After directing only in the triptych ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jiwa"", here he returns to the combined acting and directing (plus producing) of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and again the core of the movie is the relationship between Eastwood's character and a young person seeking a way in the world.Now aged 78, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Silver Star veteran of Korea who subsequently spent 50 years on the production line at Ford, where he acquired his immaculately-preserved 1972 Gran Torino. Grizzled and growling, he has just lost his beloved wife, is estranged from his two grown-up sons, and has a fractious relationship with his ethnic neighbours, notably the Hmong family next door. There is a lot of anger and racism in this film but, book-ended by funerals, it ultimately manages to be up-lifting and redeeming.We're told that this will be Eastwood's last acting role (his 45th since adopting the pancho of The Man With No Name) but hopefully we'll still see his directorial work (this being his 29th such outing).",,Anonymous,Drama
Clint shoots 'n' squints his way a little further into the elite,"Would you cross Clint Eastwood when he's on a mission? Thought Not. The acclaimed screen vet' may've given up his guns for a different kind of shooter in recent years, but don't go thinking a fistful of treasured turns as a director has rendered the man soft. I still wouldn't mess with him. Would you? Thought not. But it's still fun watching a gang of punks doing just that in 'Gran Torino': Eastwood's first crack at leading the pack from both behind and in front of the lens since 'Million Dollar Baby'.For me, Eastwood's reputation as a director rests not on his Westerns, not on his genre burying classic 'Unforgiven' or his thrillers but on his recent crop of human dramas: 'Mystic River', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'Flags of our Fathers', 'Letters From Iwo Jima', 'Changeling'- Not a bad string of films, I suppose, but what about 'Gran Torino'? Well, Eastwood plays rigid Korean War vet' Walt Kowalski- a grouchy, ominous old git who sets out to reform his gang hounded, east-Asian neighbour, Thao, after the teen's attempt to steal his trophy car (a vintage 1972 Gran Torino) runs afoul.Drawn against his own will to get with the times and accept the company and race of those around him, Clint's Kowalski soon finds himself pulling back the hammer on his M1 rifle in the way only Clint can to protect his fellow neighbours from the hoods that plague their turf. ""Ever noticed how you come across somebody once in a while,"" he growls, ""somebody who you know shouldn't have messed withthat's me!"" Lucid shades of dirty Harry Callahan, cut man Frank and a wasted William Munny help paint Clint's obstinate yet august Kowalski, then. That unnerving, doll-like look in his eye still holds up. As does the by-gone icon's forbidding, set-to-be last on-screen turn as the hostile yet righteous martyr. Say what you want about Eastwood's age and overall range as an actor, he 'can' still carry a film.There'll be no Oscar nods for acting, directing or producing this time around, though. Eastwood's 'Gran Torino' borders grand but it's not that kind of film; it's not 'that' good a film nor does it reach the heights of his previous five. Eastwood doesn't tell us anything we don't already know: the elderly are, by and large, blinkered; they hate kids and immigrants and retirement homes and often cling to their prejudices but, it's never too late to change. Whether you're good, bad or ugly, morality can upend bigotry. Age gaps can be bridged. One man can make a difference. We know all this. We've seen it all before. Yet 'Gran Torino' still makes for a pretty decent film, and watch for that matter.Final Verdict: An engaging yet flaw flecked fusion of Clint Eastwood's love for the one-man-army action play and the human drama. Not his best, but still more inclined to the good than the bad, or the ugly.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood is Still The Champion!,"This was a very warm and touching film. Not only did it tackle the issue of getting older and the family struggling with what they are to do with you so you get proper care, but it also tackled the RACE ISSUE in neighborhoods and the GANGS...so there were really three movies within this movie and Mr. Eastwood was just excellent. Not only did he Direct, Produce, Starred in Film and sang the final song in the movie...I guess that was a flash back from Paint Your Wagon....yes he was in that too. On top of all of that...Clint Eastwood is in pretty dang good shape for an old Dude...He is my HERO...a great roll model and still moving forward with new projects. Good Job!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
stop talking to yourself Clint!,"When i first started watching the movie, my expectations were low.. at the beginning i thought, well this might be one of the movies where good acting compensates for the lack of a good plot. I was wrong, the movie has a sweet storyline but fails to deliver a proper climax, and on top of that you have to listen to Clint Eastwood talking to himself throughout the movie, which was a bit to bad ass for my taste. the Vietnamese actors in the movie are clearly inexperienced, i was at one point during the movie comparing their performance to my own fifth grade school play performance(very very poor).I like Clint Eastwood and the charisma he brings to the big screen but that alone didn't make this movie worth the watch, and it ends up being one of those movies you can go see if there is absolutely nothing else to watch.Mediocre overall, but if you are a Clint Eastwood fan it might be worth the watch anyways.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Vintage Clintwood,"Here, Clint Eastwood directs himself in the role of Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old retired auto worker, who has just lost his wife. Emotionally distanced from his two sons who want him in a retirement home and even more so from his grandchildren, he drinks cheap beer and scowls from his porch as his declining Highland Park, Detroit, neighbourhood is taken over by migrants from Asia. After a bungled attempt by the Hmong kid next door, Thao, to steal Clint's precious 1973 Gran Torino Sports as part of a gang initiation, Walt gets to know the family, including Thao's bright young sister Sue. He is surprised to discover that the Hmong are an ethnic minority from Vietnam who supported the US during the war. He supervises Thao's unofficial community service, teaches him (with Harry the barber, a delightful minor character) to talk like an American working-class male, buys him tools and helps gets him a job. But this upsets the gang, and Walt finds himself in a nasty confrontation.I am an admirer of Clint Eastwood's more recent work (the earlier action stuff is less alluring though Dirty Harry is a classic of its kind) and have enjoyed ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". Midnight was pretty shallow, but he entertains and stimulates the mind at the same time. I don't quite know how Eastwood the director manages to direct Clint the actor; perhaps there is another persona, Clintwood, who does it for him.Walt, who shares his surname with a much younger curmudgeon, Stanley Kowalski (Brando's role in ""Streetcar Named Desire""), sees his world fading away. Worse, he realizes his life has been wasted, raising hateful unpatriotic children and working in a plant producing, as Dan Neil of the LA Times put it ""overfed, undersprung and largely unlamented muscle cars"" such as his prized Gran Torino. He also has bad memories from his service in the Korean War. Walt is a grumpy old bigot but Eastwood, with that grim, granite face of his makes us understand. I couldn't help thinking though he would not have been the most congenial of husbands.Early on in the story, the ridiculously young parish priest, after promising Walt's wife to do so on her deathbed, tries to get Walt to attend confession. He does, eventually, but it's interesting that Walt has not a lot to be guilty about. And, in the end, he redeems himself. It would be a very curmudgeonly person indeed who did not cheer, inwardly at least, at the final frames. The Gran Torino is up and running along Lakeshore Drive in the hands of a representative of the new America. Clint, I think, is cheering him along.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best performance of Eastwood's career.,"I've never been a fan of Clint Eastwood, as a writer or director. In fact I've hated almost every single film he's directed or starred in. When I first saw the trailer for Gran Torino, I couldn't stop laughing. I thought it looked absolutely ridiculous and full to the brim with clichés and stupidity. So all things were pointing to this being one of my least favorite films of the year. Much to my surprise, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Gran Torino is one of the best films of the year, Eastwood's best directorial work since Mystic River and it contains the greatest performance of his career.That's not to say it's without flaws, of course. As a whole, the film is very clichéd (the angry old man mentors the naive, fatherless boy, the angry old war veteran is haunted by his past, etc.) but that's easy to look past because it's not a film about the story; not really. It's about this character and his transition throughout. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a bitter, angry old man. He spends his days drinking beer on his porch with his dog, admiring his beautiful lawn and the 1972 Gran Torino he has sitting in his garage. When he's not on his porch, he's growling to himself, talking to his dog about his disgust for the Koreans who have moved into his neighborhood. Walt is a traditional man, and it's easy to see why things in his life make him hate his family (his grandchildren where football jerseys and shirts revealing their bellies to his wife's funeral, for instance) and isolate himself to his home.His disgust for the world is put to the test when a group of Hmong gangbangers attack the young boy who lives next door to him, and Walt steps in with a rifle when they cross over onto his lawn. He saves the young boy, Thao (Bee Vang) and as a result the Hmongs in the neighborhood start to worship Walt and consider him a savior to the people living there. At first Walt turns away their love and admiration, but slowly they beat it into him to the point where he accepts their gifts and starts to associate with his neighbors. They bring down the wall of anger that Walt has built up around him over the years, and when they start to move into his life he realizes that he has more in common with these people he detested than he does with his own family. He finds a common understanding with the Hmong family next door, and accepts Thao's request to help him with chores around the house. What results from this is your typical story of an old man mentoring the young, fatherless boy, but Eastwood has a way of making it all feel fresh. Nick Schenk's screenplay definitely helps in making it feel more original than one would expect. To my knowledge there has never been a scene in a story like this where the old man takes the young boy to his barber to show him how to talk like a man, by insulting everyone your friends and doing nothing but complaining about how much life breaks your balls. Something I didn't expect from this film was just how intentionally hilarious it was. The scenes with the barber (the always under-appreciated John Carroll Lynch) are some of the funniest stuff of the year.Walt invests himself into the Hmongs life and when the gangbangers come back and start harassing Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her), he feels a responsibility to step in and protect them. Walt wants to do something meaningful at the end of his life, something to repay for the sins he committed in the war and defend the few people who he feels are good in this world. It's all a little typical, but as I said earlier, Gran Torino isn't really about the story. It's a character study of a haunted old man who opens his door and finds that the people he despised are actually more akin to himself than his own family, and the fact that he'll do anything to protect the people he's come to care for throughout the film. Clint Eastwood directs this all with that old Hollywood feel he's been pouring into his films this decade which makes it feel very cinematic, which is a good thing in the context of the film.The real shining aspect of this film, however, is his performance which is astonishing. He imbues Kowalski with an air of Dirty Harry and it works so well for the character, because this all feels like it could be the final installment of the Dirty Harry franchise and it would be the best film in that solid series. Eastwood doesn't hold anything back, slurring off every racist remark in the book within the first half hour and making it all feel so believable. And despite all of the racism and bitter resentment for everything in the world, Kowalski remains an insanely likable character (the fact that I found a lot to relate to in him definitely helps, but it mostly comes entirely from Eastwood's brilliant portrayal). I enjoyed watching him for every second he was on screen and as his heart warmed to the Hmongs (without ever getting sentimental or anything close), so did mine. The Hmong actors all give pretty terrible performances (especially Her), but it's easy to look past that when the film is anchored by such a tremendous lead. On the surface, Gran Torino seems like something typical and potentially ridiculous. But don't let that deceive you. This is a subtle, powerful film with an ending as devastating as it is moving.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Breath taking... Amazing...,"I just watched this movie... and felt i needed to share my experience with other people.Watching Clint Eastwood interact with people, as the slightly racist and old fashioned Walt Kowalski, is something i hope i never forget. Not only did Clint Eastwood do a really amazing job, playing the role, he also managed to catch some unique moments, directing the movie.It starts out heavy, with giving Walt a personality from the very first scene, which is why you get stuck to the screen from the beginning to the end.This is a really great movie. And once again, Clint Eastwood shows off his amazing talent, by sucking you into a universe where you just enjoy every single minute in it.Very good ending with a twist, extremely realistic.Watch it.. you will never regret.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

An Eastwood Triumph,"I was a little thrown by this movie (mislead you might say). By all the previews I saw on television, I thought this was another ""Dirty Harry"" action/adventure film. Clint does possess some of those qualities in his ""Walt"" character but to me, the movie was about him developing qualities of acceptance...of his neighbors, of his stint in Vietnam. It was so beautifully told, very moving. To watch his ""gruff"" character grow was amazing. I won't spoil the ending, but I would have preferred something different than what happened. I will also have to admit, I could have done without Clint's singing during the credits, but I was impressed he wrote (or co-wrote?) the song! I would highly recommend this movie even if you aren't a big Eastwood fan (like I am!). I truly hope Clint gets recognition for this movie (an Oscar or Golden Globe maybe). It (in my opinion) was one of his best!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gran Torino should have been up for Best Picture,"Michael Gold (character name of Jeff Goldblum in The Big Chill) once said something to the effect that the attention span of the average person is about as long as one spends taking a crap. That said, I would suggest printing this and taking it on your next trip to the Crapper.Here we go...I find it a bit bizarre that a film ranked in the top 100 by IMDb users, and ranked 8.4 out of 10 stars is not nominated by the Academy.I just watched it this evening and I was completely blown away. This movie was well-cast, acting was pretty superb, and Clint was simply incredible. The story and direction was compelling. I loved Eastwood's reactions; the moans, groans, language, everything, and I really loved the way the actors fed off one-another... it did not feel contrived or forced.I can only assume the movie was not nominated for Best Picture, Director, or Actor (Clint) because of the perceived racism. But isn't a film supposed to be judged on the quality of the film itself; how captivating it is to the movie-goers? And if that is how a film is judged, then it is clear the great majority of movie-goers taking the time to judge this film are raising their arms, clapping their hands, and applauding this accomplishment by Clint Eastwood.Yet no nominations or awards at all by the Academy?There have been many times in the history of the Academy Awards that I've felt people/films should have deserved a nomination and did not. One example was Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky. I thought he was far better than Sean Penn in I Am Sam and could have been nominated over Will Smith for Ali.But I think the omission of Gran Torino is the biggest shaft I have ever paid witness to.The Academy ought to expand the list of nominations if it's that close. Or maybe they never intended on nominating the film at all, but if that's the case, then I'd have to say there's a lot of politics going on behind the scenes. Are the racial over-tones any more controversial than the right-to-life decision in Million Dollar Baby?There is no doubt after watching The Reader, Slumdog Millionaire, Frost/Nixon, and now Gran Torino that this film ranks right there with them, if not above. Honestly, if I were voting Best Picture, I'd have Gran Torino #2 to Slumdog Millionaire, but I could be swayed to vote Gran Torino Best Picture of the Year.Either way, Gran Torino deserved at least the following nominations:Best Picture, Best Actor (Clint), Best Director (Clint), Best Writing (Nick Schenk), and I would have thrown a nomination to Abney Her for Best Supporting Actress; I think she could have given Penelope Cruz a run for her money. I would have voted for Her.I have always enjoyed watching the Oscars to see how my predictions play-out, and I tend to agree with many selections for most the categories. My gripes about the nominations are usually minuscule and debatable, but I do not know how anyone can argue against how deserving and how shafted Gran Torino was.I truly believe something has to change. There are a lot of people who love films, but will not watch the Academy Awards because of the long, boring, redundant speeches with everyone thanking everyone. Furthermore, the show takes too long, always goes beyond the scheduled time, my DVR never records the whole thing, and that's mainly because there are WAY too many commercials (about 5 minutes of commercials every 7 minutes). Thus, many movie-lovers avoid a show they'd otherwise watch because of all that garbage.If that's not bad enough, now we have to sprinkle in some politics and omit a great film such as Gran Torino.What do you think happens next?I'll tell you what. Omissions such as this by The Academy are going to discourage other people from watching ""the Oscars"" because people are going to see that the best films and performances are not getting nominated due to politics! The omission of Gran Torino might be big enough to deter me from watching next year; we'll see.I wish Ebert and Roeper were still on TV so I could have heard what they had to say. Or better yet, I wish Siskel were still alive because I imagine he would have been livid.I am Toadwriter and my fifteen seconds are up.Take care folks.Sincerely yours,Disappointed",,Anonymous,Drama
"""Get Off My Lawn!""","Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this drama, playing Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran and recent widower who hates the cultural changes in the world, and his Michigan neighborhood in particular, which has an ever-growing group of Hmong refugees as citizens. One of them, a young man named Thao, under pressure from his gang friends, tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino automobile, but is stopped by Walt, who almost shoots him. Thao's family is deeply ashamed by this behavior, and after Walt busts up a gang threatening them near his lawn, will do anything to appease him, and won't take no for an answer. Walt finds to his surprise that, despite the ethnic differences, this family shares much of his values, so he decides to take Thao under his wing to reform him, although the dangerous gang is still out for revenge, prompting Walt(who learns that he is dying of cancer), to take drastic action...Intelligent and moving film avoids clichés to tell a story of redemption and understanding. Sure, this is similar to John Wayne in ""The Shootist"" but this film works well; it is a bit long, and almost goes wrong once or twice, but pulls it together with a clever and fitting final act of redemption and heroism from Walt.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
How has this scored so highly?,"Because Clint Eastwood directs it? Because Clint Eastwood stars in it? Because Clint Eastwood portrays a very convincing role? Because of Clint Eastwood! To be honest, if those are the reasons, I'd have to affirm that I agree with all except the first one (and perhaps then I'm not entirely sure of my answer)!I liked the premise of this film and I thought Clint Eastwood was great in it. But that's where it ended for me. The acting of all the other characters is nothing to write about. If their passive, lack of emotion was intended, they did a great job. I felt next to nothing for the characters' welfare in the story, besides Walt (Clint)!To be fair, and iterate on my previous comment; Clint Eastwood is, definitely brilliant in this film. But one actor definitely doesn't make a film good, or the fact that it has a ""loving"" message! If this is the fault of the director.

Bitter old man who has seen too much of life? Check. Formerly nice, middle-class neighborhood being overrun by generically ethnic hell-raising teenagers? Check. Hard-working and helpless women, children and old people who need some strong-arm style protection? Check. Creepy neighbor with lots of guns and a cool car? Nothing new there. And then the script writes itself - although judging by the dialog of the younger characters, I'd guess that someone even older that Clint Eastwood wrote this thing. As far as Eastwood's age goes...well, his reaction shots, the ones that are supposed to show us what a rugged and tough old dude he is (including growling), consistently look like he's just having a particularly rugged and tough bowel movement (including growling).

It definitely deserved some Oscars.But that's not what I want to talk about.I want to point out that this movie perfectly highlights the dangers of mass immigration. Take a look at these Hmongs in this movie. They all live in same neighborhood, they don't bother to learn English. They eat only Hmong food, keep all their customs and traditions. Younger males become criminals and form gangs. Young or old, they all refuse to cooperate with the police.All in all they refuse to assimilate. They're not Americans, they are Hmongs living in America. And I can guarantee that this is super-realistic. It's not a made-up story, this is how minorities behave in USA. Mexicans behave the same. Somalis behave the same. And this goes for many other ethnic groups of immigrants.That's why immigration must be individual (or small families), and never in large groups. A single couple of say, Poles or Cubans in a new city will search for American friends, form bonds with local community, learn the language. They would never do that if they moved their entire neighborhood to USA.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint once again shows he is the master!,"I just watched Gran Torino last night and I must say WOW! Clint once again blows the competition away with such ease. I sat in the theater not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing so much at how awful Clint's character, Walt, treats every single person. Its not funny that he is awful but his ignorance and hilarious comments just make this movie a comedy for the first half. That was fantastic as I was not expecting this at all. The whole audience was laughing and getting into the film from the very beginning and it was so great to see. Suddenly, the movie slips some tender moments in and you begin to get those feelings you get in his movies like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. You realize that this whole film is evolving into a deeply emotional black hole that is sucking you right in. When the climax hits, it hits hard and it was amazing to see the audience go from laughing to complete silence in one second. This is one of if not the best Clint Eastwood performances of all time and as I may be sad to hear he may quit acting, it gives me joy to know that he will be leaving on such an amazing performance. The young man who plays Tao is quite a great actor at his young age and brings some of the best moments of the movie to the screen.

Shamelessly Ridiculous and Entertaining,"A shameless Clint Eastwood takes the reigns in 'Gran Torino', an absolutely ridiculous but undeniable crowd pleaser. It is the unlikeliest of films, both humorous and thrilling. What begins as a picture that's very difficult to take seriously transforms into something much more respectable. One of the weirdest films you'll see this year, or any year, but 'Gran Torino' will win you over.After the death of his wife, grumpy Eastwood's Walt Kowalski does what any widower in mourning would do. Terrorize his Asian neighbors and threaten local gangs. Here is a man so bitter, so unhappy with the changing world around him. A veteran of the Korean War, Walt holds onto as many racial prejudices as one could imagine. It is an absurd tongue-in-cheek character for Eastwood, a combination of every Dirty Harry-esquire role he's played that gives him an excuse to grunt and grimace every chance he gets. If I wasn't supposed to laugh, something is very wrong with this film.Thankfully, I think the comedy is every bit intentional in 'Gran Torino'. Though Eastwood shows no signs of slowing down at 78, this is a sort of swan song for Hollywood's perennial heavy lifter. But if his latest film is about anything, it's not Eastwood's prized 1972 Gran Torino. After taking Thao, the neighborhood boy targeted by his cousin's gang, under his wing, 'Gran Torino' takes on a more poignant message of redemption. He instills quirky but sincere morals and values in the young lad, and through the process has his own eyes opened to a culture he never cared or tried to understand.Through all his racial slurs, Walt becomes one of the most strangely likable characters of the year. And though the spotlight is certainly on Eastwood, the film is buoyed by shining performances from the young Bee Vang and Ahney Her. Once Eastwood becomes satisfied with his self-referential humor, 'Gran Torino' moves out from underneath its own awkwardness and into something more serious and reflective. Once the film hits its stride, it doesn't take a genius to know where 'Gran Torino' is taking us. It is a hugely entertaining ordeal, and as effective as a film like this permits. It's an odd movie, 'Gran Torino'. But one you'll find yourself enjoying more and more as time goes on. A hard-edged and rugged salute to a career that has finally come full circle.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A lot of people have described his character Walt as being ""Racist"", but I would have to disagree with that. In watching the Movie he let's a lot of racial slurs fly. His Character is very complex. What comes out of his mouth doesn't always line up to his actions. I would say he is more like a ""Archie Bunker"" type from all in the Family. But a lot more complex. I don't wanna give a way the movie or the character, but I think Clint Eastwood broke ground with this character. Because Walt in a ""Non Traditional"" racist. Whatever that means, lol.

"""Torino sheds light on not only a veteran bad-ass, but also an entire age group's mentality and mediation.""","I grew tired of seeing poor reviews from over-analytical ""savants"" for a Clint Eastwood movie and decided to take a personal day to go to the theaters. Sometimes critics need to look at a movies plot rather than focus on the subtle convoluted messages. This movie sensibly conveys a beautiful story of interaction and shows viewers that everyone has their own form of bigotry. What Eastwood knows and most of the viewers realized is that he accomplished more than to associate the plot with everyday interaction. Clint/Gran Torino accurately portrayed war veteran feelings and motives. Few movies accomplish this feat, Clint Eastwood spoke out for an entire age group and Veterans world wide. The charisma for one's country is very degenerative in some cases and inevitably causes life long prejudices. That being said, this story wont reach most of the said group's ears but to those that it does I am confident that it will have some impact. If Clint ever reads these reviews, I hope he knows that I and many of the other posters here believe he deserves the Academy award for best actor for this and all of his work.

Eastwood did superb.,"Gran Torino tells the story of a deeply hateful, overcritical and narcissistic elderly man inadvertently getting involved with his new foreigner neighbors and eventually changing his lifelong stance on how he treats them, his family and others.Clint Eastwood executed it really well and made his character's journey authentic. Lots of offensive slurs were exchanged but that was only done to fit the main character's sense of humor. Even though you don't want to, you'll find some of their back to backs amusing to watch. He simply carried the film with his performance as no other actor rivalled his acting skill. It was obvious the Hmong actors were amateurs at acting and did not do good. That was the only flaw I noticed in Gran Torino.The story was realistic and a bit poignant seeing how uncontrollable circumstances force people to be involved in gang violence. Even though Walt was viscerally hateful to the Hmong, he was not able to cover his eyes to their arduous lives and eventually sacrificed all to help them.

Gran Torino Serves Up A Vintage Clint Eastwood!,"In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, he stars as Walt Kowalski, a cantankerous, beer-swilling Korean War veteran and former Ford factory worker who lives in a run-down portion of Detroit ravaged by white flight. Recently widowed, Walt is old-school: He hates his children for driving Japanese trucks and for trying to put him into an assisted-living facility and his grandchildren for their insolence and impropriety. Compounding Walt's loneliness is that he has become a stranger in his hometown; his neighbors all have died or moved away, and a cadre of ""dog-eating"" Hmong immigrants has taken their place, whom he incessantly disparages. His gruff demeanor and steady stream of racial epithets make him unsociable for his neighbors.The tension comes to a head when Thao, the teenage boy next door, tries to steal Walt's prized possession - the eponymous Gran Torino, a 1972 vintage Ford automobile - as part of an initiation into a local gang. Unaware that Thao was the would-be thief he chased off the night before, Walt breaks up a fight between the wayward youth and his gangster tormentors that spills onto his yard. Seen as a savior by the Hmong community, he is showered with gifts - much to his displeasure, as they insist that the boy pay for his crime with a lengthy dose of community service under the supervision of Kowalski. Walt reluctantly takes Thao under his wing, and befriends Thao's older sister Sue. The Oriental boy and girl next door make Walt see the good in gooks as we watch this curmudgeonly Scrooge figure open his eyes and mind to the realities of a multicultural America. He quickly discovers he has more in common with his culturally conservative neighbors than his own kin who regard him as an embarrassing dinosaur to be shipped off to a retirement home. However, Gran Torino gradually takes a darker turn and becomes a much more poignant depiction of Kowalski's willingness to seek redemption.Gran Torino is surprisingly funny; as Walt's icy exterior melts away and culture shock leads to wary respect, one can't help but laugh. With a personality as prickly as his looks - flint-eyed squint, sour puss, scruffy hair - he's a bad-ass old coot, who spits his disapproval at the world. It's an idiosyncratic performance that might easily have descended into comedic caricature. But Clint Eastwood somehow pulls it off with profound pathos and bravado. He also directs with his typically sure hand; the plot moves relentlessly forward on his formidable shoulders, assisted by the slyly hilarious dialogues.Gran Torino could have become a tediously pious fable about a racist learning the error of his ways, or - in its final act - an audience- pleasing revenge fantasy. But Eastwood bravely avoids both extremes. Gran Torino is vintage 'Dirty Harry' – Reloaded!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This movie is fantastic, but one person ruins almost everything...","OK, so this movie is really good! I loved it actually!Buuuut, its got one MAJOR flaw! And his name is Bee Vang.This guy is seriously one of the worst actors i have ever seen! He is so bad, it almost ruined the whole movie for me! What did Mr. Eastwood think when he filmed this? Didn't he notice how horrible this guy is at acting? I don't understand how he let Vang play such an important role in this movie when he is so bad at acting!The movie plot is awesome! All the actors are doing a really good job, except for Vang.Eastwood does one of his best performances since The unforgiven. Too bad Vang ruins it all in every scene they share by making me laugh out hardtime of how dreadful his acting is.I know this pretty much is nagging but its irritating me how bad this guy is!

watch harry brown instead.,"in short. woeful acting from everyone, its really, really bad, clint's never been a great actor in the true sense of the word, but he always had a huge presence which is still here somewhat but his lazy delivery is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the stilted performances here. this leads us to the next stages, script and characters, neither of which help the actors performances. the dialogue is awful, stilted and wooden and the characters are so stereotypical its unreal and make the whole thing almost laughable if it wasn't so insulting to any viewer who doesn't keep their brain in a jar. i said in short so id best just leave off with the plot, predictable, predictable and, yes, very, very predictable. clint is a screen legend but im sure if he made a documentary on paint drying itd be nominated for an Oscaror two, i genuinely wish more effort had been put in and some enjoyment could be had. watch harry brown instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Outstanding,"I won't put any spoilers in. Quite simply, I found this film high class and very entertaining. I doubt that Clint Eastwood has surpassed this effort as an actor or a director. It's as good as his last effort, ""Million Dollar Baby"" at least. I did find some comments by the critics quite amusing. Someone thought that 90% of the people commenting on this film wouldn't know good acting or a good script if they saw it. That is not only laughable to most of the 28000 people voting on this movie (at the time of writing), but it represents a staggering case of self denial. It does present a valid statistic though.

One of Clint Eastwood's better performances.,"This is not only a good movie, it may be one Clint Eastwood's better performances as as an actor. Rarely has Mr. Eastwood been more effective and entertaining, and for a career as successful as his, that's saying a mouthful. The movie itself is good, although there are some glitches in the plot and some overly contrived dialog. But the basic story is solid, with themes relating to social change, ethnic tensions, gang violence, aging, family tensions, and immigrants. Most interesting is the portrayal of members of the Hmong community who at first seem utterly out of place in its American setting but soon becomes apparent that they too share American values, both positive and negative. The movie also does an effective job of dramatizing ethnic tensions between minority groups. The main star, however, is Mr. Eastwood and his character Walt Kowalski around whom the story revolves. This movie is certainly worth watching and provides good entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Loved it,"Gran Torino just adds to the great collection of movies that have come out this year. I'm only 15 so i haven't been able to enjoy Clint Eastwoods movies over the years. But after watching Gran Torino i know that he is a movie legend. I can't wait to see Changeling.Gran Torino is wonderfully written, nicely directed and is made even better with its great cast.This isn't a movie i would normally get sucked into. There is talking all through the movie. But it was so gripping and intense. But i felt the ending was too predictable and was too short.

What's surprising is that this isn't the whole story; much of the movie is dedicated to building relationships and coming to understand Walt Kowalski.I especially appreciated the accurate references to the Hmong culture. My grandmother worked in social work for their people for many years, and the fashion and even home decorations are legitimate and detailed.A must-see!

Gran Torino,"It's curious that the main English language awards largely ignored this, yet it won both a David and a César in Europe and is definately one of Clint Eastwood's more characterful efforts. He is the curmudgeonly ""Walt"" who has recently lost his wife, has an arms-length relationship with his son and looks disapprovingly as his neighbourhood ceases to be the home of ""Americans""! His prize possession is his Gran Tornino car and he doesn't take to kindly to Bee Vang's ""Thao"" (or ""Toad"") trying to pinch it. Quickly, though, he sees that this young man and his sister ""Sue"" (Ahney Her) are being bullied by their thuggish extended family - a gang of obnoxious would-be gangsters who drive the streets picking fights and taunting people. He decides to intervene and the rest of the story sees a bond develop between him and his new ""family"" based on a degree of mutual understanding, trust, and ""Toad"" becoming his slave for a fortnight by way of penance! We are given some clues along the way as to the grand designs of ""Walt"" as he sets up a denouement, after a brutal assault on ""Sue"", that will satisfy not just himself, but keep his neighbours safe too. It's not the most naturally written dialogue, indeed at times it's quite forced but the underlying premiss of bigotry and the attitudes of intolerance and bullying are well addressed. The characterisation of the distant and prejudiced ""Walt"" is delivered engagingly, and with some dark humour, by a star/director who has a point to make. There's also quite a gently potent effort from Christopher Carley as the local priest. He is trying to offer the perfunctory words of hope and comfort to this veteran and he perseveres despite the dog's abuse he receives from a man who no longer feels it necessary to commit to the niceties of society. Clearly, 'Walt"" cares little for what is left of his life nor for any of his sins to be forgiven. It's about grief, relevance, community and I think it works. Give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

His performance was certainly equal in caliber to the others nominated. And this comment is coming from someone who never really appreciated Clint Eastwood till later in his career. He is definitely an accomplished director, but his performances in later films such as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" have proved what a gifted actor he truly is.

Clint Eastwood at his worst,"Honestly, this movie deserves more than one star but I need to neutralize all these nine and ten stars that I can't understand. I like Clint Eastwood's movies as much as anyone else, and I know it might be the last one in which he shows up on the screen, but it's not even close to being one of his best movie. Even that one good thing that some reviewers mentioned, and that is Clint Eastwood's acting, looks good only in comparison to the very bad job the rest of the cast does. I mean, what's with that growl? Didn't we have a multiple other hints, none of them subtle, that Mr. Kowalski is an embittered old man? Somewhere in the middle, I hoped that would be a movie about what a parent or a friend could or should do when a kid is bothered by a local gang. But, there is no any effort to think about that problem any deeper. Too bad!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Thank you, just thank you","I have the main song of the film, ""Gran Torino"", stuck in my head. It goes: ""Engines humm and bitter dreams grow/heart locked in a Gran Torino/it beats a lonely rhythm all night long"". Clint Eastwood has always been a man to fear, even more as years go by because, as my friend Urdinez says, he's like wine; and gets better with time. What does Eastwood, the genius filmmaker feels? What does he think about life? In ""Gran Torino"", probably his last effort as an actor/producer/director, we see a man completely exposed, and the movie may contain the answer.It's not that what Clint has inside is important, but his Walt Kowalski is one of his typical characters; one of those men who will do everything by themselves and don't even accept the help of their own family. His performance is so hearfelt, so perfect, that's it's hard not to imagine Mr. Eastwood keeping a Gran Torino in the darkness of a garage.Clint works hard to establish the personality of his war veteran from the first scene in which, during the funeral of his wife, he grumbles at the sight of a piercing his granddaughter has in her belly. This scene also presents, by making a fool of him, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), another of the film's crucial players as he preaches a ridiculous sermon about life and death. With his wife dead, Walt will now be almost the only American (with a flag hanging on his porch, of course) in a quiet neighborhood inhabited by Chinese immigrants; and when a kid next door named Thao (Bee Vang) tries to steal his Gran Torino, we know peace can't last too long.Walk Kowalski doesn't like priests nor Chinese or African American people, not even Irish or Italians; or maybe he does, but he certainly doesn't show it. The narrative mastery Eastwood has achieved at this point of his career lets him present two or three scenes in which some Latinos, blacks or Chinese gang bangers molest Thao and her sister (a fantastic Ahnie Her; watch the scene in which she's molested and you'll find an mild but nice social and even cinematographic commentary). When things are about to get ugly, Walt always appears, with a rifle on his waist, to save the kids who start-along with their family that leaves him all kinds of gifts on his porch-viewing him as a hero. But Walt doesn't want to be one; such as Frank didn't want to train Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby"".As it occurs with most of Clint's recent films, there seems to be a lot unsaid between scenes, mostly in the scenes Walt speaks to the young priest. Boxes that are hardly opened, secrets from the past that haunt Walk Kowalski. And ""Gran Torino"" is not about an old man trying to be better; it's about an old man doing what he always did and finding some friends because of it. These are definitely not the friends he would have chosen but the ones who chose him.In between there's a lot of beer to be drunk, a lot of food to be eaten, a lot of culture to be learnt and even some life lessons. The miracle is that everything is natural and shot with a careful eye in the light of day and in two or three main scenarios. When the night comes and the movie gets darker, Clint is very close from letting the movie slip away but never does. One shot of him sitting in an old couch, with the light on one side of his face and complete obscurity in the other one, is the highest point of his collaboration with director of photography Tom Stern and probably the movie's most painful moment.It occurs with almost no music, and the music (written by Clint's son and probably himself) is another of the pilars of this masterpiece that brings every production element together. A lot of war drums in moments of tension, an almost muted bass playing the melody of the theme song in moments of quietness. And the script, almost flawless and inevitably funny as Walt insults every person he encounters on the street, whether they have good or bad intentions; but unnecessarily clarifying after the last encounter the old man has with the priest.I wanted to express this final thought. When a man who has received orders all his life, doesn't do what he's told, there's always the chance that something goes wrong. Maybe he can fix it, and we'll listen to phrases that only Clint can say and believe them. Things that are right in the like: ""I finish things, that's what I do"". ""Gran Torino"" is a film with class, not only because it has what we call class, but because it is classic; 'old-school' as Urdinez said. The kind of movie that doesn't get made anymore, in which from something ordinary you end up finding things you want to call extraordinary. Thank you Clint.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint's Finest Hour,"The movie has been described as ""Classic Eastwood"" and in a sense this is true. Even the previews show Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski) aiming an M1 Garand and telling the trespassers ""get off my lawn."" There were a couple of times I wanted (nay, expected) him to utter that classic line ""go ahead, make my day"" (but he didn't).Still there were times I laughed so hard it hurt, and then I cringed and braced myself as the drama unfolded. I laughed at the relationship between Clint's character and the neighbor lady on the front porch. Then, I cheered quietly about the same relationship. I went to see the show with my teenage granddaughter and as we left the theater she said ""I haven't cried at a movie since I was 11."" This movie really has something to evoke every emotion, and the audience seemed to feel it too.But, I'll tell you who stole the show, and who has seemingly been ignored in this movie -- that's Ahney Her, the young actress who plays Sue. From every indication, this is her first acting role before the camera. Yet, here she is, co-staring with Clint Eastwood, working under him while he directs the movie, and while she's got to be perhaps only one third his age, she goes toe to toe with him throughout the movie. In the yard, in the house, among family, at intersections on public streets, in his truck, she's right there with him giving a performance I'll never forget (and I doubt she will either).The building relationship between an older white male, recently widowed, living as the last remnant of his class and culture in a neighborhood suffering from ""white flight"" and the newer residents is outstanding. Having served in the military, along the Pacific rim, having grown up in a white, middle class, blue collar neighborhood, I could easily relate to Walt Kowalski and many of the issues he struggled to deal with.I don't know if this is going to be Clint's swansong, I hope not. But, even if it is, he couldn't end on a brighter note.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A powerful performance from the iconic Eastwood, his character inspires and he proves that anyone can come to terms to an unexpected friendship.","Clint Eastwood the man the tough guy himself certainly is in top form here with his latest ""Gran Torino"" which perhaps could be his final screen role, considering he's close to approaching the age of 80 years old. And after you watch this you will feel as fresh as ever and happy with Clint's performance as his manner is as gruff and as macho as ever. Only on this journey you see how no matter how gruff that this old man can humble when it comes to the ways of the world and can develop new and unlikely friendships.Eastwood is Walt Kowalski a Korean war vet who lives in Michigan and after retiring as an auto worker and upon the passing of his wife, the world has certainly darkened for Walt. Yet Walt is a tough natured type of a guy one who's wise with wisdom and he lives with his most prized possession a 1972 ""Gran Torino"" yet mostly his gruff and tough nature is the eye catcher that most see about him including family. Yet the film theme turns social when it shows the nature of racism. From the start you the viewer see with Walt's actions(tobacco chewing) and tough witty talk(racial slang and jokes)that he's clearly a bigot and has plenty of stubborn blood flowing in him. And when a Hmong family moves in next door this is when Walt's life and character is tested the most.It is here we see that film takes on a complex and tough grumble journey of a process of character transformation. And the theme of racism is so common as so many of us have dealt with it in our lives in some form. Even though the undercurrent and subplot of the neighborhood gang issues and the violence of the film shows a side of Eastwood's character to be somewhat of a local superhero to the family, it still fails in comparison to the films message of learning to accept a new take on friendship. The development and growth you see in many of the scenes between Eastwood and Bee Vang(good supporting work)grow on your thoughts and emotions. As after seeing this film it leaves everyone with the hope of a better world proving that all of us no matter what racial, ethnic, or cultural background are the same and bleed the same blood. Really it's a hope for a better world showing that unlikely friendships can develop and that even the most stubborn and strongest types of people(Kowalski) can have a change of heart and view the world differently and change before they pass on.Overall wonderful work from Eastwood maybe one of his strongest, yet his performances are always well done with class and perfection. It's a must see here for the fact that this could be the legends last screen time perhaps. And too for the strong message that this film sends of looking at friendship and growing to change one's ways in such an unblinking way makes it very powerful and certainly a film to be respected. So ""Gran Torino"" in my view is certainly one film that drove into the winners circle.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood At His Best,"It may seem strange to say this about a well-known actor such as Clint Eastwood who's had a lot of successful movies in his career, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed an Eastwood movie as much as I enjoyed this one. Eastwood (who also directed) was perfectly cast as Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War veteran whose wife has just died as the movie opens, whose family wants little to do with him except to get their hands on his house and his prized 1972 Gran Torino, and who is tormented by the fact that his neighbourhood has been taken over by Asians. Kowalski's racist nature was actually comical (in an Archie Bunker sort of way) but the most impressive thing about Eastwood's performance was how well he portrayed Kowalski's gradual change of heart toward his neighbours, beginning with his unexpected friendship with young Sue (a great performance by Ahney Her) and developing into his role as the neighbourhood's protector against the violent Asian gangs that continually invade the area. In that sense, Eastwood began to resemble an elderly Dirty Harry, with ""get off my lawn"" becoming Kowalski's version of ""make my day."" As Kowalski growls his way through his various encounters, first with his neighbours and then with the gangs, you are both appalled and amused by the character. You root for him in his battles with the gang, and finally end up applauding his ingenious and selfless way of getting the bums off the street and protecting his Asian neighbours who, as the last scenes of the movie demonstrate, have become far more his family than his real family had ever been. This is funny, action-packed, emotional at times (especially after Sue is attacked) and, in a strange sort of way for a very violent movie, even uplifting at the end. It's truly a superb piece of work by Eastwood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
It'll go ahead an make your day,"If ever you wondered what ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan would be like in his retirement years, look no further than Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's glorious acting swan song. If ever there was a performer who could pull off playing a 78 year-old action hero it's Eastwood, who still has the ability to burn holes in the screen with a glare and a scowl.Set in the ""white flight"" suburbs of Detroit in which entire neighborhoods have been transformed into immigrant ghettos, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford assembly line worker and grizzled Korean War vet. A walking Rolodex of racial epithets, the recently widowed Kowalski is dismayed to learn that the house next door has been purchased by a Hmong family, and even further ticked to discover that the family's two teenage kids, Sue and Thao, have attracted the attention of a gang of Asian thugs.For Walt it's as if every demon that's been haunting him since his days of killing ""gooks"" has come home to roost.Initially the story unfolds in a crude, almost unrefined fashion, akin to 70s grade B action fare, something that seems out of sync with Eastwood's maturity as a director. However this appears to be a deliberate attempt to establish a bridge between the crudely enjoyable films of Eastwood's salad days, and the smart and cagey movie that this morphs into.After a few scenes that establish Walt's need to liberate his neighbors from torment of the gang, the story takes a surprising turn as he discovers he has more in common with these ""foreigners"" than his own kids. Sue and Thao give him a second crack at being a dad and he makes the most it, determined to transform Thao from a ""pussy"" into a man of respect. It allows Eastwood to slip comfortably into a role similar to Frankie Dunn, the boxing trainer he played to perfection in Million Dollar Baby, and it all comes together to make Gran Torino feel like you've settled into a nice comfy pair of slippers.Eastwood's his own man, however, and the movie doesn't always follow the formula you'd expect, which is a good thing. The end result is something much cleverer, and far less conventional that your standard revenge flick.If this is indeed Eastwood's adieu in front of the camera, he definitely picked a high note to exit on.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

To a small extent that's true, but not the undercurrent. The girl who played Sue has a big future, what confidence on screen. Everyone has a father, uncle, granddad just like Eastwood in this role. And we all have our own prejudices against migrants - until we get to know them. Don't want to give too much more away - this is a must see.

Less impressive than 'Changeling' but it has the heart in the right place.,"Clint Eastwood's thinking about anything but retirement as he released no less than two movies this year. It's rumored that this will be his swan song when it comes to acting. And he's very good in a role that brings back memories of his past famous characters, most distinctively 'Dirty Harry'. The film's equipped with yet another heartbreaking, beautiful score and quality songs (golden globe nomination already in the bag), again an own composition from the hands of Clint and son Kyle.The movie itself definitely lacks ambition and the narrative sort of strolls along a lot of the time, I'm not too crazy about the overdose of moralistic lessons either. Especially the religious theme I couldn't stand. The movie opens when Walt Kowalski's wife passes, and he's left to live alone in his neighborhood, a part of town ridden with immigrants. He forms an unusual friendship with a local Asian-American boy, he becomes the boy's mentor and teaches him about manhood and the importance of hard work.The movie's sweet, but almost sickly so, which annoys a lot of movie fans, who are usually a darker kind of people. Never the less, the movie's features a great soulful Eastwood and an uplifting message. Don't be surprised if you catch yourself chuckling once in a while too, some of the dialog hits your funny bone, luckily it's intended that way.Oh and remember, a racist character never ever means a racist movie, quite the contrary.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Terribly embarrassed for my boy Clint,"This movie is simply plastic, thin and irrelevant. It felt like pieces from 12 other movies patched together. Everything about the film is painfully predictable...there's nothing original about this. It felt like The Karate Kid meets My Bodyguard. Clint's racism and bigot-ism is SO one dimensional and over the top that it feels completely phony. His character arc(the transition from racist to racist with a heart) also feels quite forced. The acting was literally embarrassing for just about every character but Clint. No one could deliver a darn line in this movie. They all felt like first time actors!(their ethnic backgrounds weren't the reason...the Father and Clints son's were the same way and they were white.) The humor was so generic, completely dependent on the impact of one liners....situations quite void of laughs. The antagonists were only in the film just enough to know who Clint is going to have to face at the end of the movie, but nothing more than that to make any kind of impact in the film. How about giving them some personality and a reason to be the baddies they are? How about maybe attempting to make them come off 3 dimensional? They were terribly constructed and their overall impact was null because of it.At the end of the day this is simply a fish out of water movie, like thousands of others, where an outsider gets to learn a new culture and try to save the day for them, the only difference it's being made and led by a legendary movie God who seemingly has finally gotten to the point in his career where he IS willing to make films WELL below his abilities if he has nothing else to work on. I used to think Clint was one of the few unwilling to sacrifice quality for screen time, but this movie has shown me even Clint is human. I can't emphasize enough how much I respect/love his work.....but this movie was awful...Im CONVINCED his worst. My buddy and I spent half the time cringing from how embarrassed we were for him, and the rest of the time making fun of it. It was that hollow and pointless. For people making it out to be like it's the next great cinematic piece of history....I have to ask if this was the first movie you've ever seen. I see about 100 films a year and I can say with confidence that this film had the most on the nose dialog, the most exposition, the most generic and predictable storyline, the worst acting.....all of the above. It all stemmed with the script. This was an awful script from beginning to end and even the great Clint Eastwood and his multiple talents couldn't save it. Why he chose to make this we'll never know. But please do not read these glowing reviews and get your hopes up when going to see it. I'm astonished by how people are gushing over this. I walked out in disbelief.

Can Walter change at this late in the game?What is really beautiful about this film is the way it approaches the topics covered in it. While seemingly a film about race, it's really more about the gap between generations. Walter doesn't connect with his kids, they don't understand him -- making efforts that are misplaced, if thoughtful -- and there's just a sense that ""the old ways"" aren't appreciated by many. And the film makes it clear it's not taking sides; while a film about Walter, it doesn't condone or criticize his actions.The common sense idea that this film is about race strikes me as wrong. Walter is not, in fact, a racist as many have made him out to be. He quickly adapts to his Hmong neighbors and is fairly accepting of them. He uses racial slurs, but never performs any racist actions... and there is evidence that his slurs are meant to be harmless, as he talks the same way to the few friends he has.Some of the twists and turns are unexpected, and the way the older generation teaches the young (and the young teaches the old) is inspiring. Eastwood claims this is his last film as an actor, which is likely not true, but a high note to go out on if he sticks to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Original Real Man,"The key to this movie is that only Clint Eastwood could have played the lead role. Here he is extending or annotating most of his oeuvre of characters: ""Dirty Harry"" most obviously, a bit of Bill Munny, but also Gunny Highway from ""Heartbreak Ridge"", whose voice he is both using, and modifying by adding a hint of Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong (esp. ""What A Wonderful World""; note Clint's spoken word performance at the end credits). There is a brilliant set up that prepares us for ""Unforgiven"", but resolves instead with a twist.----------Those who don't care for the larger socio-political implications shouldn't continue reading.What surprised me when I read through other reviews on this site, especially those from posters with a great many entries, is how quickly 'Racism' is declared. By what definition is any part of this movie or the lead character racist? Webster's points to A) belief of one race's superiority over others, or B) race prejudice or discrimination. Folks, this was all explained many decades ago (and Clint, again, is annotating here): ""Oh Harry's not prejudiced. He hates everybody."" Same with Walt Kowalski - he just wants everyone to leave him alone.To declare racism at the slightest of provocations (by a work of fiction!) shows how we, as a society, are no longer capable of thinking. We have substituted instant outrage and speech codes for our ability deal with each other as adults.Well, you know what? I detest this puritan style of eviction from our social discourse everyone whose opinions are not precisely congruent with the thinking of college-educated Americans in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. Most people are not college-educated. Most people are of the working class, and they do not think in that whipped, perfect-PC manner. The barbershop scenes are there to illustrate this point. Spend some time talking to blue-collar workers and maybe your tender sensibilities won't be so easily offended after a little Thao-style conditioning. Lord knows I've been through it: it provides perspective.Better yet, spend some time talking to combat veterans. Especially men who were drafted for WWII (my father's father), Korea, or Vietnam (my father's brother). They've EARNED the right to say whatever they damn well please, without a lot of tut-tutting from a bunch of overeducated sissies. So please cut the remaining Walts of this country a little slack.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
You Don't Wanna Know,"Greetings again from the darkness. I was caught off guard by the political incorrectness and comedy and depth of Clint's latest. Say what you will, but this man has turned into one of the finest and most dependable filmmakers working. He is an expert director with a real feel for guiding the viewer.Now the hard part. What to say about his character, Walt Kowalski. Equal parts Archie Bunker, Dirty Harry and Buford Pusser. Walt spews racial epithets like a sports announcer spews superlatives. It will be very uncomfortable at first until you can adjust to his nasty temperament. But guess what? There is a heart of gold beneath the rugged body armour. Sure it stretches the boundary of believability at times and certainly his pet project, ""Toad"", could have used a stronger actor or better character development. Still, there is quite a dose of social commentary on the developments occurring in neighborhoods across the country ... both racially and politically.Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torina bears a resemblance to its owner. A relic of the past that still has a bit to offer. A couple of my favorite scenes involve Clint and John Carroll Lynch (Fargo) in the barber shop. These guys go at each other hard and with no holds barred. It is laugh out loud guilty pleasure. Also, don't miss Clint's real life son (and the film's music director), Scott Eastwood, as Trey ... the anglo-tough-guy-wanna-be who gets humiliated by both a group of blacks and Walt.So while the viewer is expected to make a few leaps in understanding, and this is not perfection, it is in fact, still very good film making and worth watching. Supposedly this is Clint's final acting gig and I hope that's not true. Sure, the patented grunts and moans are a bit over the top, but the man can still carry a scene and a film. Either way, let's be thankful for his amazing ability to produce quality films.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Old Men, New World, Timeless Values","The film's theme revolves around the question of what it means to be a man in the modern world, and (it being American) its background question is of course ""where does authority ultimately come from?"" Eastwood's Kowalski character, the perfect dutiful middle-class American, having put his house and his Gran Torino car into perfect shape (property + car + working for a car company + being vet = Fine Upstanding Citizen), takes on his next reno project-- his young Hmong neighbour Thao, who Kowlaski christens as ""Toad"" and repeatedly calls ""stupid."" Which, to be fair, he often is. Kowalski needs to show young Thao what it means to be a man, and he does. From the value of hard work (and the pride that comes from doing it well), standing up for one's principles, having guts, knowing when to trash talk and when to be polite, what it really means to care about family, to of course how (and when) to ask a girl out and knowing who your friends really are, Kowalski teaches Thao that masculinity is principled, compassionate and not easy.Kowalski is a role model right until the film's final frame. ALthough the ending is a bit pat, the ride is great. From the staggeringly politically incorrect language (half the fun is waiting for what Walk can possibly say next to top his last anti-Asian outburst) to the political and moral questions, this is solid fare. The film avoids cultural stereotypes (no Hmong or immigrant demonisation here) and indeed shows us a vibrant, tough and decidedly non-stereotypical character in Thao's sister.As a high school teacher, I use this with gr11 and 12 students, many of whom face the same pressures as Thao-- to join gangs, be violent, disrespect women, to have money without working for it-- and the film, much to what I am sure would be Eastwood's delight, gets through to them loudly and clearly. Ultimately, it teaches us an old lesson: the only things in life (and death) worth having are those we honestly work for.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A perfect adaptation of the Eastwood movie for the 2000s,"An excellent adaptation of the Eastwood icon for the 2000s. It is still a Western, but in the 2000s there is no cattle to be moved upstate. Also, Clint isn't 30 anymore and nobody would believe him doing one of this old movies. Hence this is a perfect adaptation for the icon. And the story is very well polished also. I love how they avoided making the old man a politically correct yahoo. Sadly the end ruined it for me. And yes, for this story there isn't a better ending than this. Still, I disliked the ending so much!",,Anonymous,Drama
vintage Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood fans will be smiling ear to ear. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a hardened, disgruntled Korean War veteran living in the ever-changing suburbs of Michigan.Gran Torino is a drama. It has many parallels with John Singleton's early nineties release, 'Boyz in the Hood****1/2(outta5)'.One of the surprising qualities of the film is it's humor. Walt is constantly throwing out fist pumping, 'dirty harry' tough guy lines. I have to say that the movie is extremely funny in what amounts to a serious character study.Perhaps the only negative thing that I can point out is that none of the supporting cast can keep up with Clint's stage presence and acting ability.Walt Kowalski is a role that is perfect for Clint. He's as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it and Gran Torino, if it is Clint's last, will be a grand exit and a fitting finish to an epic career. You'd think the 78yr old is invincible, unbreakable, but this film has some messages that made this viewer ask,'were they coincidence or was this Clint saying goodbye'. If for no other reason, see Gran Torino. 83/100",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood never disappoints,"There is certainly an idea of a made in-USA pride running through the whole story, with shots of Eastwood on his porch in front of an star spangled banner and a Ford Torino; three icons that are worth the price of the ticket, not for rhetoric itself but for the way they summarize the film's idea. The story was not written for Eastwood but it certainly feels like it was. The director has always tried to explore the ageing process of American society with a dose of sarcasm and very genuinely. In ""Gran Torino"" as well the audience will see a mix (quite eccentric actually) of violence and humanity, everything in harmony with the setting and the ambiance of many other Clint's works.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Eastwood, actor and director, on superb form","A superb piece of cinema which sees Eastwood scale new heights as both Director, and Actor. I have never given a film a maximum rating before, as the very essence of art is striving for that little bit more. But not to do so for a work that so conspicuously accomplishes its lofty objectives would be churlish indeed.The story is simple enough, just widowed Walter Kowalski, a Korean War veteran is becoming increasingly isolated. His wife has died, the world is changing all around him, and his neighbourhood is dominated by South East Asians, some of whom have moved in next door. Yet mistrust gives way to acceptance which turns to friendship as Walter fights one last battle with those that threaten his sense of values.It is hard to watch Walter Kowalski without seeing virtually every character that Eastwood has ever played, and in part, he is a distillation of them all. Sometimes he doesn't talk at all, just emitting a Bear like growl, of anger? Of pain? Or maybe both. In part this is an elegiac, valedictory paean to the American Dream, embodied by his eponymous ""Gran Torino"". The American motor car holds an iconic place in U.S. popular culture as lauded by the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen and Jack Kerouac, so when next door neighbour Tao is forced to try to steal it as part of a Gang Initiation, this is more than an attempted car theft. This is an assault on the very essence of what ex-Ford car worker Walter holds dear.Yet it draws him into a culture which whilst ostensibly alien, he comes to realise holds dear values which he has considered lost. Family duty and service are paramount. Whilst his own son sells Japanese cars, his grand daughter has her own eyes on the Gran Torino, and the family are circling the Estate like vultures. The irony that the Polish immigrant antecedents of a name like Kowalski are testament to a previous generation's assimilation and adaptation of the American dream resonates throughout.Pushing 80 years old now, actor Eastwood wisely eschews an overtly ""hard man"" role, yet in that icy stare lies not only the fictional quintessentially American blue collar views of veteran and production line worker, but also the ghosts of Dirty Harry and a plethora of Western vengeance seekers, and wreakers. The violence, such as it is, is understated. The depiction of the Mong gangs, restrained. Ever since the stylised teenage gang violence of West Side Story morphed into the gratuitous excesses of ""Death Wish"", American cinema has glamorised and celebrated this phenomena in shameless supplication to a teenage audience. Not here it isn't.Director Eastwood has produced his finest hour here. Not a single frame is wasted. The American flag flutters behind him as he sits on his porch, dog by his side, early in the film viewing the wholly alien customs and language of his next door neighbours. The dialogue is similarly efficient. Elegaic, without being sentimental, Eastwood's trademark wry humour is also evident as he tries to introduce ""man talk"" to Tao, in his Italian hairdressers, and in his ongoing duels with a Priest a third of his age, keen to speak to him about matters "" life and death"".There is an excellent supporting cast, lead by Ahney Her, as Sue who provides a linguistic and dramatic bridge between Kowalski and the surrounding community. If this is Eastwood's swansong as a leading role actor it is a fitting one. However I do hope that his Directorial ambitions remain. As an actor popular acclaim superseded critical acclaim resulting in his fairly late entry into the Directors chair. On this form he still has much more to give.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Gran-d Movie,"Gran Torino is Eastwood in one of his finest roles. Eastwood is fantastic as the disgruntled, bigoted, ex-Korean war veteran who has become recently widowed. Now his character not only has to deal with life alone, but life with an Oriental family next door. Being an ex-Korean vet, his dislike for the Asian culture is evident at the onset of the film. Gran Torino is a wonderful character study of a man who learns to deal with his prejudices of others, of a man who learns to respect another culture and a man who learns to become friends with someone who he would have never looked twice at in his earlier years. It shows how a man changes from someone who hates a person to someone who becomes a strong male influence on that same young person. It is a wonderful, heartfelt and at times humorous story about the relationship between these neighbors. Gran Torino is an excellent film that ""real"" moviegoers will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Not brilliant (#82?!?), but well made enough to warrant merit","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWalt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a cynical, grumpy, unfriendly older gentleman whose wife has just died and whose family he has little time or respect for. He has even less time for the hmong family who live next door, with his racist thoughts always simmering to the surface. Things aren't helped when a young boy who lives next door is forced into a gang initiation by trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino car, which fails miserably. When Walt saves the girl next door from being attacked, a truce begins to form between them all and when the boy offers to do chores to make up for what he tried to do, it sets him and Walt on a bonding exercise where he teaches him how to approach people and things in life (often not in the most positive of ways!) But the relentless quest of the gang to get the boy to join them threatens to tear this new unity apart.You can't seem to keep Clint down. Acting, screen writing and directing (and now, it would seem, song writing) seem to be in his blood and have no sign of leaving there. We're dealing with a natural movie star here, and one who shows no signs of going down. Also, unsurprisingly, a more old fashioned star who refuses to move with the times. Whose films still seem and feel as though they were made maybe thirty years ago. But who still gets a big fuss made whenever a new film comes out. Gran Torino is the latest such film and, well not as perfect as (some?) seem to think, is still competently made and surprising enough to hold your attention.Despite being presented as more of an action/thriller? kind of film, it emerges really as more of a drama. Unfortunately, some of the writing and dialogue is so clunky and clumsily executed it can come off as a bit of a comedy, most notably by Eastwood himself. His racist slang, insults towards the young boy and funny muted growling whenever you sense he's about to get angry here seem to have you in guffaws of laughter rather than any sense of anticipation or edginess, not to mention the ridiculous scene where he confronts the gang who are about to attack the girl with a make believe gun made from his two fingers. I don't think it was meant to come off this way and it's a failing of the script that it does. And yet, the big man carries it off with such aplomb you can't help but admit it's at least fairly well written and made. Despite a first half that's become bogged down in unintentionally funny and steadily more boring drama, things pick up with some shock dramatic events at the end, some surprising emotional human drama from Clint before a shock ending no one was expecting, before the end credits where you could swear down it's Clint singing the title song (but it's actually Jamie Callum!)Gran Torino is an unremarkable film that mostly doesn't do anything you don't expect it to but Clint is such a pro he carries it all off with enough flair and substance to make it all that bit more enjoyable. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hands Down Excellent and near Perfect,"Clint Eastwood will not disappoint for this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all. The movie was very funny, and you'd laugh. But it also has a dark side and it's serious. The humor for this film is great and the audience had its shares of big laughs. But then it got serious, and it always was from the start. It's a healthy mix and it doesn't run itself over with pointless and poor drama/humor films. It's simply amazing and brilliant. It was very emotional and great to see Clint Eastwood at his last work. He was excellent in the film. He definitely should deserve the Oscar for Best Actor. Yes, he was that good. Another thing. The story is very interesting and not a lot of movies can have the same plot feel. It's about a war veteran from the Korean War and lots of Asian people started moving into his neighborhood. He's developed a certain dislike for Asians because of the war, and he was mean to them. So when one day an Asian kid tries to steal his prized possession: his 1972 Gran Turino. It's a good plot, with lots of drama and humor. I recommend everyone to see it. It's near perfect and deserves Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Creates Another Sleeper Classic,"In today's much hyped cast and CGI effects laden world of cinema, Clint has proved his might at either ends of the camera sans the CAST and CGI. He never stops at testing human emotions to their core. He subjects his characters to such trying conditions that we wonder how would one react to all this by placing oneself. Such is the genius of Clint that he involves his audience in his films and this movie is no different. This movie most notably stands out because it is very realistic view of a disgruntled soldier. Clint plays this character beautifully. He gradual transformation is beautifully captured.

Eastwood Delivers Again,"I like to think that I have seen quite a few movies and have fairly good taste when it comes to the film industry. I have only seen a few movies that ""stick with you,"" but this is easily one of them. This may actually be my favorite film of this decade thus far. What made this movie different for me? Realism. This film touches on subjects that exist in today's society and, for the most part, are completely plausible. Another important factor for me is character development (which is a dying trend in today's films that seek only to entertain at any cost); yet this movie provides the audience with an intimate portrayal of the characters.As much as I enjoyed this movie though, I do not believe it will get the attention it deserves simply because of the harsh racism it contains. Again though, that is what makes this movie realistic. While we have made vast progressions in eliminating racism, it still exists in many areas.I won't give a lengthy reviews that touches on each cinematic aspect; if you are reading this review right now you are obviously curious about this movie. The only advice I can give is to go watch this film; it is well worth the ticket price and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Minor Clint Eastwood Film Powered By His Badass Performance,"Packing an old-school toughness beneath its contemporary setting, Gran Torino is another sleek, sound & sophisticated work from Clint Eastwood who this time not only impresses as a director but also leads the show from the front with a sturdy input that towers above all else.The story of Gran Torino follows a recently widowed Korean war veteran who has trouble getting along with everyone. When one of his neighbours tries to steal his car for his initiation into a gang, the grumpy old man sets out to reform him, and ends up doing more than he intended to.Directed by Clint Eastwood (best known for Unforgiven & Million Dollar Baby), the film finds the veteran actor exhibiting no loss in form, and still more than capable of carrying the entire film on his shoulders. His work behind the camera is just as polished though the story doesn't pack a strong emotional punch.Eastwood's old-school attitude & badass charisma is on full display here but it's delightful to watch him play a role he does better than anyone else. Though the rest of the cast play their part rather well, not one of them commands the screen like Eastwood does. As for the present Hmong culture, it is treated with respect.On an overall scale, Gran Torino is a small-scale production of a small-scale story that's skilfully crafted & steadily paced, and finds Eastwood in control of his craft, both in front & behind the camera. The story isn't memorable by any means nor does it deviate from the archetypical white saviour trope but the cinematic ride it offers is interesting, engaging & mostly satisfying. Watch it for Clint Eastwood.",,Anonymous,Drama

This is a good film, with a fine script and Eastwood is excellent in the role of the cantankerous old racist. What lets this film down is the supporting cast of 'unknowns'. To say some of the acting from them was not at its best, well that would be an understatement. Bee Vang is trying to act on a par with Eastwood and fails, he instead comes across as wooden.

The number of gross inconsistencies in character development, and highly improbable scenes are enough to make one wonder why time and money were spent making this film. Clint Eastwood's performance was a reprise of his earliest western films in which the tough guy staggers through the inane script. The appearance of weapons in unlikely situations can not be explained, and were obviously used to show how tough the main character was supposed to be. Apparently, his death at the end of the film was a vague metaphor for an even more illusory cleansing, but who knows what was meant? The entire film was so improbable that it seemed interminable.

Eastwood TRIUMPHS !!!!,"I pride myself in having seen every Clint Eastwood movie. Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. I am writing this comment just after I watched ""Gran Torino"" and am still wondering how to describe it. A drama ? YES - Touching ? YES - Moral issue ? YES - Funny ? YES - Action ? YES - Does this movie have it all ? YES !!!I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians, in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not gonna spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say this. The ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.I can't recall having enjoyed a movie like this over the past 15 years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick ass (and does so) !. In fact his character could be described as an old and cranky Dirty Harry but with moral standards and a touch of humanity.Even if you're not an Eastwood fan, this is truly a great movie from start to finish. I would even go this far in saying that it surely ranks as one of the zeniths of his career. Thank you Clint. You were and are a giant !",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Suggests that people have the capacity to change,"Walt Kowalski is a retired autoworker and Korean War veteran living in a decaying neighborhood near Detroit, Michigan in Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino. Like Dirty Harry and Bill Munny before him, Kowalski (Eastwood) is an individualist who answers to no one and whose racism and anti-social behavior is the way he deals with frustration, in this case, minorities and Asian immigrants in the community. When local gangs threaten Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), the young son of a large family of Hmong immigrants from Southeast Asia, however, Kowalski's cranky individualism is challenged in a way that compels him to reach out and transcend his misanthropic veneer.The film opens with Kowalski at the funeral of his wife showing disdain for the manners of his two grandsons. His scowling and growling carries over to the young priest, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) who promised Walt's wife that he would look after him after her death and make him go to confession. Kowalski abruptly dismisses Janovich, saying that he knows nothing about life and death and telling him: ""I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy just out of the seminary!"" Walt's prickly attitude is equally directed to his two sons and especially to his neighbors, a Hmong family consisting of a grandmother, mother, and her two children, Sue (Ahney Her), and Thao. Walt is an equal opportunity bigot, calling the members of the family everything from pagans to gooks and other choice epithets unsuitable for print.When pressure to join an Asian gang prompts Thao to try and steal Kowalski's immaculately maintained 1972 Gran Torino, Walt discovers him in his garage and menacingly points a rifle in his face. Later, however, the old man flashes his M-1 rifle to protect Thao from being hurt in a gang disturbance that spills over onto his lawn and, in gratitude his neighbors bring food and flowers. Later, Sue invites him to their house for food and drink which he accepts, discovering in the process that he has more in common with these people than with members of his own family. Reluctantly, Walt finds himself becoming more and more involved with his Hmong neighbors and seems to drop his posturing when he is around Sue who acts as a guide and translator.He rises to the occasion by helping Thao make amends for his attempted larceny by giving him jobs to do around his house, teaching him about tools, and using his contacts from having worked for thirty years at a Ford plant to help him get a job with a construction company. Local thugs are not finished, however, and when Sue is assaulted and Thao is again threatened, it becomes time for a final confrontation with the gang and for Walt, never answerable to anyone except himself, a final grand gesture. Gran Torino is impeccably acted by the entire cast, including some who have never acted before and Eastwood's performance is one of his best.To its credit, the film suggests that people have the capacity to change and transform their life. As Walt discovers the humanity of his neighbors, he gets in touch with his own as well. Unfortunately, the film tends to glorify ""rugged individualism"" and vigilantism at the expense of acting responsibly in a community. Walt's idea of ""manning up"" young Thao is to train him to use ethnic epithets when dealing with local merchants as in the scene where Thao is put through the paces with a local barber. It does not occur to Eastwood, however, that acting manly might lie more in working to ameliorate the problems that have led to the deterioration of the neighborhood than in macho posturing or hurling insults.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

An Eastwood Film With A Truly Human Touch,"The Location of Gran Torino is Highland Park, Michigan. It is ground zero for both the rise and fall of the American automotive industry. Once the home of the world's first assembly line, built by Ford and the Headquarters of the Chrysler Corporation, it now stands as a symbol of the decaying rust belt. Clint Eastwood couldn't have picked a better location on a bet. It's adjacent neighborhood still contains individuals who are the spitting image of Eastwood's main character, a retired auto worker named Walt Kowalski. All Mr. Eastwood had to do was inhale deeply and the essence of the main character flowed into him from his very surroundings. Indeed in the background of some shots you can see Oakland Avenue, a street crossed by thousands of Walts on their way to put in another day at the plant.I must say that those who were disappointed in the film seemed to be looking for qualities that Mr. Eastwood did not intend to give them in this film. And even those who loved it missed the true nature of the main character, at least in part, calling him ""a crusty old racist"" and such like. The portrayal of Walt gives you plenty of clues to the reality of the situation, such as the hilarious scene where Walt tries to teach a young man how real men talk to each other. The racially tinged banter is indeed how many of the tough old autoworkers talked to each other, usually with the same degree of humor and affection portrayed in that and a few other scenes. Real men made sport of the racial stereotypes, I know, I grew up there.I'd been avoiding telling too much of the story by design but to support my assertion that Mr. Eastwood tells a tale with a true human touch I must at least point out some of the more compelling aspects of the portrayal of his characters: Walt is an old man, the world has changed right before his eyes. To a PC and selfish ""Me"" generation he appears as racist old stick in the mud, an impediment to their narrow ambitions... and this is his family I'm talking about. An old school stoic, Walt isn't much for using feeling words but at the same time he knows who he is. He's a guy who'll look you over pretty good and if you appear to be a decent sort he's still capable of being a friend. It's just that in Walt's world he hasn't seem much to be friendly about lately.It's no surprise that Walt warms up to his immigrant neighbors, even though before he gets to know them he does harbor some racial bias, likely gleaned from hard experience. The Sister of the young fella he eventually takes under his wing sees that Walt can be charmed and she does so brilliantly, thus opening the door for him to know her family. I felt that Walt, being the stand up guy that he is, couldn't help becoming what he does to the young man and his family. I think that attentive viewers of Mr. Eastwood's story come to see that Walt is something of a rare commodity these days, a real man - a man's man, capable of dealing with life on life's terms and making the hard choices that real men have to make. Up to this point it meant being a hardworking breadwinner, husband and father. Not too many frills and flourishes, just reliability and steadfastness. But as we meet Walt in the beginning of the story all that is fading into the past was he buries his beloved Wife and tries to figure out how he ended up with such selfish and ungrateful children and grandchildren. He thinks they're lacking in character and they think he's an asshole.So, here we are with a aging man's man looking to stay useful in a world that's increasingly unfamiliar as a series of man-sized situations seem to make their way to his door. And here's what I appreciated about what Mr. Eastwood did with his story; He had Walt meet these situations head on, sometimes uncomfortably awkward and sometimes in puzzlement, but head on nonetheless. And we find a man who'd never really opened up his heart to others, not because he didn't want to but because he was just too busy taking care of business to learn how. A seemingly immovable object who meets the irresistible force of some young people in need of those things that young people need.This time, unlike with his children, life has prepared his heart to open wide and the force of his genuineness is, in my opinion, one of the strong points of this tale. This story of the unfolding of warm and lasting human relationships is filled with humor, a bit of conflict and complexity and backed by the stronger forces of loyalty and sacrifice. This last giving shape to the arc of on old man's life and an example to the eyes of a young man with most of life before him. You'll have to somehow forgive yourself for laughing and crying at some sappy old movie... Well, maybe not, if you remember that you're in the hands of a Master Cinematic Craftsman.I had the pleasure of watching Mr. Eastwood's production company at work, as Walt's house is at 238 Rhode Island Street and my Mom still lives at 150, a block away. I grew up there and so upon viewing this film for the first time the feeling of familiarity was so profound as to be slightly unnerving. According to my former neighbors, Mr. Eastwood and staff were most gracious guests and were fully aware of the authenticity of their choice of locations.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Nutshell Review: Gran Torino,"You know Clint Eastwood means business when he stares down at you with those steely eyes, and his rumbling, booming voice tells you to either make his day, or to get off his lawn. Either way, only a fool would want to stand his ground, with anyone else preferring to back off and never cross the man again. Having a weapon pointed straight at you adds to needless convincing too.It's a somewhat different role of Clint's that I've seen, not that I've seen all. Here he takes on both directorial duties as well as the lead role, where he plays an unsavoury character, a very angry, racist man who doesn't mince his words to tell you in your face just what he thinks of you. And pepper that with plenty of personal insults laced with fluent vulgarities while at it. Words like gook, spook and unflattering nicknames come flying, and he gets away with it because he's an old man, and second, that weapon he always packs nearby.A Korean War veteran, the film opens with the funeral of the wife of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), and we learn that he doesn't get along with his sons and their family, and just about everyone else besides his dog Daisy. He finds the persistent young priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) a real pest, and his Asian neighbours nothing but noisy trouble. His twilight years is spend fixing things given an impressive tool house, where his prized possession of a 1972 Gran Torino is kept in. A gang initiation heist of his vehicle goes wrong, and he strikes up a father-son relationship with neighbour Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Ahney Her).It's a great character study of how a man can change, given that, and I think I've overused this phrase, this is a world without strangers, only friends we never met. While he begins as a very hardened man, Walt's relationship with the Hmong community slowly softens him up to accept differences, despite having started off on the wrong footing. And while he harbours some deep resentment, hatred, and pain that he locks away, the two Hmong children become the children that he never had, given his estranged relationship with his sons (not that they are angels to begin with), with new found respect from Thao and Sue because they find that he's their cool guardian, and so does everyone within the neighbourhood who showers him with gifts after a valiant and successful attempt in fending off the black sheep of their community.Gran Torino has classic Clint Eastwood direction  assured and very economical in movement and technique, never showy but packs a punch whenever it needed to wear its emotions on its sleeve. It's really tough not to laugh along at the banter of barbed insults traded, and all conversation between Walt and his barber Martin (John Carroll Lynch) will test anyone without a sense of humour to chuckle at how only such statements made could be done so between buddies, as Thao learns the hard, but hilarious way. It's not a comedy of course, because trust Eastwood to sucker punch you when you least expected it to, and I absolutely love how he manages to lead you on with hope every time you feel the notion that things have past beyond the point of no return, and shake things up a little just as you get too comfortable.It's somewhat a pity that this is possibly the last movie that Clint Eastwood would star in, preferring I guess to being behind the camera rather than in front of it. If Gran Torino is anything to go by, I still feel he has some legs to go on doing both. He never ceases to amaze me at the boundless energy he has to continually craft some critically acclaimed movies, and Gran Torino firmly stands tall in his filmography. Definitely highly recommended, and goes into my books as one of the contenders for my list of favourite films published at the end of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Get off my lawn!"" is the new ""Go Ahead, Make My Day!""","Clint Eastwood is at it again. In ""Gran Torino"" it's a nouveau gem in the rough! Clint plays Walt Kawolski, a grizzled Korean War veteran, who's too bitter to be accepting change. He resents the new neighbors on his block. A group of Hmongs move next door and he's full of contempt for those people. He's a widower, and he's also dying of cancer. On his birthday, he throws out his kids when they give him a chance for independent living. He later on slowly, changes his view when a young Hmong named Thao(Bee Vang), tried to be part of a local gang. His initiation, steal Walt's Gran Torino. His sister gets rescued by Walt when some black thugs start hassling her around. She later gives Walt a birthday dinner he'll never forget. When he sees Thao being a zero on getting the ladies, Walt gives his a crash course he'll never forget. Though he doesn't see himself as a hero to the Hmong, he ends up being one. Giving the chance to earn Walt's trust, he lends him the car when he gets the lovely girl. Now that's trust! Both men get vengeful when the Hmong gang attacks Thao's family, and brutally attack his sister, Walt was furious! He beats up one member when Thao gets his face burned. Walt ended up a hero when he confronted the gang. At least he got peace, the painful way. Well, maybe. It was funny where he was explicit with his will. He only wanted Thao to have the Gran Torino. Simply, he doesn't trust the granddaughter. Yes, he may have been hardcore, but he was old-school as well. Sue(Ahney Her) looked up to him a lot. Though he may not agree with her actions, he kinda did, just wouldn't show it. Some things would make any man bitter, it takes time to give it a chance. Most people let the past go to their brains. Walt didn't. He did get a chance to be a father figure again, to some who's not from his family. Clint Eastwood always know how to make a hit. He did point to some of my favorites, Ford Motor Vehicles. That what really got me going. Also diversity, that what makes the world go round. Learn the ropes, from a veteran is always going to be better than learn things from a rookie. This movie is a gemstone. ""GET OFF MY LAWN!"" is the new classic here! 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Briliant Film,"The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year, GRAN TORINO, was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial, since all of the Hmong cast are first-time actors, who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood, even with Eastwood helming and starring. (The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished.) In casting, Eastwood didn't want ""thespians."" He wanted an honest exactness of performance. While I really like and respect all his work, I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably *not* the best film of this year, but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention. GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry, culture clash, political refugee immigration/resettlement (and, by way of that, US foreign policy) and Old School, Doing the Right Thing (vs today's more commonplace ""situational"" ethics). All of this rolled into two, parallel, coming of age stories, served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs, with the sting of truth, and are never too preachy. (Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers, always, without ever talking down.)
One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid, Tao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang), a dirt-poor son of divorced Hmong immigrants (Vietnam war political refugees).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Pitches of Eastwood are still striking magic!,"It is deluxe, it is old, it is powerful, it swaggers, it still runs well, it can direct you smoothly, it is priceless, and it is infamous. I could be easily referring to the classic Gran Torino automobile; however, I am primarily talking about the monumental Hollywood God: Clint Eastwood. He continues to flabbergast all of us movie buffs by still maintaining his film-making supremacy even at the twilight of his illustrious career. I do not know what drives Clint; but I do know that he has driven his latest film ""Gran Torino"" to a superb flick destination. Eastwood directed ""Gran Torino"" and stars as Walt Kowalski, a retired Detroit autoworker who grimaces and prejudices his way through life. He is a recent widow who has two estranged sons; and he is not shy to share racist comments with others about the Hmongs whom he feels have wrongfully inhabited the neighborhood he has resided in for decades. Walt has trouble getting along with others including his two sons and his grandkids. Let's just say that Walt Kowalski is at the opposite end of the spectrum of Walt Disney. Walt's precious possession is a 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps stored in his garage in mint condition. When Walt's young Hmong neighbor Thao is forced to steal the Gran Torino by a group of hoodlums is when ""Gran Torino"" stars gearing up its thought-provoking plot. Thao's family is almost attacked by the same hoodlums but Walt comes to the rescue and to quote Dirty Harry himself ""makes their day"". Walt all of a sudden becomes ""the good, the not-so-bad, and the pretty"" geriatric boy of the neighborhood and is suddenly worshiped as a hero in the Hmong neighborhood. The Hmongs bring Walt gifts in appreciation, but Walt wants to be left alone in his ""grumpy old man"" life. However, some type of ""changeling"" gradually embodies Walt and he stars befriending his Hmong neighbors; most notably the witty female teenager Sue and her younger brother no other than Thao himself. Thao is forced to work for Walt by his family in order to repay his debt to ""Walt Society"" for trying to steal le Torino. Walt and Thao's elevator relationship is the heartstring and spark plug of ""Gran Torino"" and provides the sincere life lessons of the film; but not in an afterschool special kind of way. Writer Nick Schenk's touching screenplay is one of the best of the year; you have to ""schenk"" it out. I am glad than Schenk took a ""grassroots"" approach to writing by including the film's catchphrase ""Get of my lawn"". Let's head back east now! Because ""Gran Torino"" is Eastwood's showcase! He has never acted better in his classic career! He was mesmerizing as Walt and his ""Gran Torino"" thespian performance is headed for a red carpet light at The Oscars. Within Clint's direction of the film, he properly drives ""Gran Torino"" into reverberating societal & humanistic issues as: racism, mortality, religion, kinship, culture, friendship, and even more. In other words, his ""Gran Torino"" is fully loaded! Therefore, test drive the ""Gran Torino"" today! It will be worth your cinematic ride! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

No Country for Old Men? Yeah Right!,"Clint Eastwood responds to the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men with Gran Torino, a film that represents America's senior citizens' strike back. The aging movie star well into his 60's makes it very clear that this is HIS country, and he isn't about to let Koreans into it. Unlike William Butler Yeats (from whom the title ""No Country for Old Men"" comes), Eastwood refuses to go sailing to Byzantium to escape the hardships of being an old man in a young country full of gang bangers and quiet Asain boys. The movie makes No Country's Tommy Lee Jones look like a pussy; he cannot handle the new violence in America. Well Clint Eastwood certainly can; in fact, he's the one making the violence! GO CLINT!

Almost a film for all ages...,"Having been a fan of Clint Eastwood for many years I was on the edge of my seat when I heard of this film with him in the lead role. After checking out a few trailers for it and under the impression it was almost a 'O.A.P. Dirty Harry' flick I decided to watch it to see if the magic was still there.To my surprise the film isn't action packed, as some other people have pointed out the advertising gives a wrong impression of the film as a whole, not that this lowers the enjoyment of it. To tell the truth I was smiling for the majority of the film and many of the set pieces are heart warming and funny. Clints character portrayal as a cynical old Korean war veteran is perfect and he could quite easily be the elder version of the gunnery sergeant he plays in 'Heartbreak ridge' as that character also was a Korean Vet.I only hope that Clint goes on to make more films as good as this, whether he plays the lead or directs!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good, but not Great","Clint Eastwood delivers a masterful performance as Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Subtle and thought-provoking, Eastwood deserves critical raves for yet another demonstration of his creative prowess.Other than that, the performances of the other actors, especially those playing Sue, Thao, and just about every gang member in the film, are absolutely horrendous. Sometimes actors fall into the trap of ""just reading lines"" - the result is a stilted, wooden delivery that makes it sound like they are reading from a page in the script instead of internalizing and then emoting.Gran Torino is a good film, but it is uneven and doesn't pack the same wallop as it should.

Clint Eastwood is a genius,"I'm not sure I will be able to write anything that is either new or indeed especially interesting, what I can tell you is that Gran Torino the film, is as beautiful as the car which sits in Walt Kowalski's garage.To see such a brilliant movie made in America, with such a huge name and yet, achieve nothing in the Oscars is such a shame for both the Oscars and indeed the general public who make think this is simply a 78 year old playing a character that should be played by a guy 50 years younger.Unfortunately, when I saw the trailer, that was exactly what I thought, but then I should have known much better. This decade has been a real high point in the movie-making and acting life of Eastwood and this film underlines his position at the very top of the movie profession.Gran Torino is quite simply a laugh-out very loud, poignant and dramatic film that is so normally absent in American movie-making. It also has a legend, quite prepared to take the mickey out of himself, indeed even to the point of poking fun at the parent-child relationship, in this case his own real-life one.It's not perfect, some of the relationships are a bit heavy-handed but then for me that was part of the deal in the film, even this aspect for me makes the film much more charming than if 10 stars were paid $80million to say the same lines slightly better.The only drawback is to see Thao smile at the end, after all his sister did suffer, badly, but perhaps the end was simply a metaphor of escaping the ghetto life he'd led in the past.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
irreverently funny!,"Surprisingly enjoyable! The poster seems serious and poised its viewers for heavy drama, but Gran Torino is irreverently funny. It's great seeing Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby) create movies for himself using material that would otherwise never see Hollywood. Not only has he continued to successfully direct emotionally-charged dramas but he also shows aging actors how to create roles for themselves.Set in the not-so-sleepy suburban Midwest, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a grumpy widower and Korean War vet who ends up befriending his Hmong teenage neighbor, Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), who tried to steal his vintage car, a 1972 Gran Torino. The old dog is also forced to accept new ways when he has to deal with the growing number of minorities in his neighborhood, while struggling against his well-meaning son who tries to take care of him with embarrassing results.The rest of the supporting cast is laudable and turn in earnest performances, including Christopher Carley as the young Father Janovich, who relentlessly tries to befriend Kowalski, and Ahney Her as Thao's sassy sister, Sue.

This is about Walt Kowalski- a veteran of the Korean war who is of an old mindset. This movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption. A must watch.",,Anonymous,Drama
Direction and acting trump the aboveboard story,"There comes a point in ""Gran Torino"" when enervated Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) suddenly swaps angry speech and action for something anomalous. The change of pace is brisk and perplexing. For the longest time Walt's behaviour attests to an embittered human, content to snarl at what he views as profoundly obnoxious with the modern world, yet with no hope of being able to change a single thing. He can attempt to maintain his way of life - and does, such as when he hears noises from the garage holding his most coveted possession, or when he forces a youth-led melee off his property - but the years have not been kind in his attempts to encourage others to accept his way of life. The moment I was intimating towards occurs in a bad side of town, which Walt just so happens to be unofficially patrolling.

"Clint Eastwood's Best Work Ever, and that is a Bold comment considering all he has done.","How can I give this film less than a 10?

I will not give up any details of the film in this review, because I wouldn't dare rob a single viewer of the pure satisfaction of this work of film making perfection. Go see this movie! You will not be disappointed! Every scene is crafted with beautiful story telling. As I watched Walt Kowalski interact with the other characters I couldn't help but think of my beloved late Grandfather Lallatin. He was discharged from the Army two days before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor so he went right back in to be stationed on Angle Island where he guarded Japanese prisoners of war. During the war my Grandfather's youngest brother, Keith, was killed in the Meat Grinder on Iwa Jima. Grandpa was the oldest brother by 13 years and Keith was only 19. He carried that loss with him his entire life. If anything came on TV advertising something made in Japan, Grandpa would go out of the room mumbling ""Damn Jap Crap"", and would get mad at him for being prejudice against the Japanese. My Dad raised me to never judge someone by their culture, ethnicity or race, only by their character. Thing is, we always had Japanese exchange students growing up and Grandpa alway treated them with kindness. It was just in the privacy of his own home that he expressed he prejudice. I came to understand him before he died...but this review is not about my Grandpa, it is about Gran Torino. Go see this film! It is film making greatness!

However, the story even though emotional and warm is somehow dry and raw and lites only the surface of our hearts.

On the other hand, I love the charming way he introduced all the stupidity of prejudices based on racism and especially implied it during the Asian party he was invited to. It must be very hard to direct and play the main role in the movie, so I certainly send all my respect to Clint Eastwood's work in this movie.

"Literal, simplistic, predictable, manipulative - typical Eastwood","To avoid over-analyzing this film, a job that was quite adequately done by many one-star raters, I simply would like to make several, hopefully original, comments and also to lower rating a bit - to me this film is obscenely overrated.Perhaps seventy eight years old Eastwood started seriously contemplating mortality and what would be a good way to go with a bang, one can entertain such thoughts, even when not in a hurry to die. Self-sacrifice always sells - how anyone can object? And how such a gun-man as Eastwood can go, other than by a gun? You just can't teach old dog new tricks. I think it is too late for him to start making new kind of film, he already have said all he could say and now just cuts and pastes from his earlier work. Yes, he was great in his genre, (spaghetti) westerns. He was the best in Sergio Leone films and very good as Dirty Harry. But how good is he now?With almost limitless film media released every year and systemic lack of time to view it, when planing to invest some of this precious time to see a film, of a good quality, I dare to say something new, it should be a lesson to all of us not to expect anything new from a person with fifty-year career behind him, who amply demonstrated what he's capable of, and not to waste our precious time in vain hope to find something new in his work.

Eastwood perfected,"I've always been an Eastwood fan since I watched the Dirty Harry movies growing up. The all American tough guy is synonymous with Eastwood from this line of films. Plenty of that shines through in Gran Torino, gruff, cold and a dark sense of humor. But Gran Torino takes the character development so much further. It makes Eastwood a deeply complicated person, struggling with how rapidly the world around him is changing when all he wants to do is be a regular guy: mow his yard, drink beer and the only company he needs is his dog. The meshing of these two elements, tough and real, take Eastwood to a whole new level and if I dare say it, make the ultimate character in any movie I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Prized Drive,"Some people are born dissatisfied. Fussy about small things. Too prejudiced about race, culture and custom. They hate change. Think that world should go their way, else they don't give a damn. And if such a person has a military background who has seen many deaths in war, then the world seems a vicious circle to him and everyone seems to be either an enemy or a victim. Walt is such an old man, disregarded by his own family, waiting to die in his old house, surrounded by Hmong neighbourhood. His hatred towards his neighbours was equally reciprocated. But one kind act, even if inadvertent, can change this hostility. And something happened that changed this prejudice. The racial barrier is removed. Fondness increased. Love blossomed. Self discovery happened. And sacrifice ensued.I have high regard for Clint Eastwood both as an actor and as a director. This movie strengthens that regard. You will simultaneously fall in love with, despise, adore, laugh at, be awed at Eastwood as the grouchy oldie. Other actors were average, if not good. The story realistic and characters believable. With a subtle message of freeing self from racial biases, the movie is quite moving.Don't miss the prized drive in the Gran Torino.(Originally published @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
besides being a gang film it is a film on redemption,"Of course GRAND TORINO is a vehicle for Clint Eastwood, the best of him. Not only as an accomplished actor and veteran, but also as producer. I will use the film to start an analysis on moral character. Other people say it is a parabole, and a Christian parabole. But for me it is a reflection on culpability. The life of Walt becomes idle until he confronts a gang asault and violation, but yes he has his demons from Korean War and he must get freed from them. What ar his motives of not confessing his war murder at Korean war? I would tell this film is a psychological thriller, since only at the final scenes you find out all the internal thinking of Walt. For all of this I say it is an excellent filme.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Heart Locked On The Gran Torino,"I don't usually do reviews but after watching the movie, I couldn't help but share how beautiful the movie really is. Seriously, this is the first movie (after a very long time) that touched me at an emotional level. The story's packed with the immense ingenuity of the director's mind that is collaborated with realism, expressing very nature of human heart. It's the kind of movie that gives you hope, inspires you and really touches you deeply to the bottom of your heart. Very clearly thought out storyline, well acted story of humanity and friendship that brings out the true essence of acting as it should be. This is not your everyday monotonous movie that runs on Hollywood high names and gruesome budgets but rather a well composed film that we can all relate to in some way. Clint Eastwood has done an excellent job to create a masterpiece,such that it looks unto people's perspective and not just for the critics to pick apart. One of the loveliest movie's I've seen in a long time...a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Growls Abound,"I really enjoyed this film. To me, the message was this: How we each deal with our humanity is different, but born of the same shortcomings (i.e. fear, ignorance, etc). Less realistic aspects of the movie and any technical critiques fade away when a story is as rich in sentiment. There is some clumsy scripting and chemistry amongst characters... but it could also be interpreted as an intentional awkwardness to highlight the cultural divide between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors. It was refreshing to see an intimate portrayal of someone that our politically correct and morally righteous modern day world would otherwise not tell the tale of let alone allow to be the hero. The non-recognizable actors added an authenticity to the struggling, lower middle class families they were meant to represent. Clint Eastwood's character, although not at all like myself on the exterior, was very relatable. To me he was a person standing outside of the absurdity of it all and struggling to find sense and happiness. Some of the more powerful moments could have had longer screen time, such as the return of Sue. All in all it was an original and worthwhile film that I would recommend to others.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another masterpiece by Mr. Eastwood,"Since I've summarized it all in the title, what else to write? This movie, like most of other Mr. Eastwood movies, is simply perfect. Him being director, actor, composer combined with a simple yet multi layered story and excellent casting is all that takes to make a little masterpiece. Like all of his movies (well, not so much as his beginnings in spaghetti westerns and Harry Callahan stuff)are emotional with just a measure as they should be, beautifully photographed and directed, with fantastic music and actors' performances... Let's face the fact that Mr. Eastwood deserves Academy award for every movie makes. I only hope he lives long enough to bring us more of his work.Extremely recommended for true appreciation of the art of making movies by the people with refined taste.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Clint's still Clint, but the story is thin and supporting acting weak","OK, I had high hopes for this film, and maybe that's why I came away thinking ""meh"". Clint Eastwood is getting up there in age, and that probably helped him pull off his curmudgeonly, over-the-top racist character believably. Fans of his will enjoy the movie if only to see him still up on the screen, kicking ass.Unfortunately the story is a bit weak, and most of the supporting acting is weak. The main supporting kid is great when he's not saying anything and being the shy, introvert that he's supposed to be; when he tries to deliver any line or show any emotion, it comes across as forced. The girl has her moments and the grandmother is good.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
What is happening here?,"After watching flags of our fathers and the million dollar baby, i though i am going to watch another solidly made movie by Clint Eastwood, but boy was i wrong. What was going through my mind most of the time during this movie was that how can this be? how can this movie be so bad? You could imagine how astonished i was when i came to vote for it here and saw that it has a 8.4 and is already in top 250!?! and I can not begin to understand why!?The acting is down right bad, even Clint himself is far away from what you expect him to be. Dialogues are unimaginative, repetitive and plain corny and full of mostly unnecessary racial slurs, the characters are completely stereotypical and don't get much depth, many plots seem just pointless and don't lead to anywhere... and finally the directions is terrible. You see people waiting for their turns to say their lines, you see people looking into the camera and you see that the movie is seriously low budget, for example where presence of police is kept to the minimum necessary and the characters have to explain that police has already left... the whole thing looks and feels very cheap and amateurish.I seriously hope that Clint did this just as a favor to someone (or lost a bet?)or for quick money, otherwise we might be losing a good director.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
An excellent latter-day Eastwood vehicle.,"Producer & director & star Clint Eastwood here fashioned a completely disarming fable that showcases him to memorable effect. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a retired Ford auto worker who's just lost his beloved wife of many years. He's also a Korean War veteran who's very free with his politically incorrect views, and doesn't particularly care for the Hmong immigrants that have moved into his neighbourhood. All the same, he finds himself driven to look out for the troubled teenager (Bee Vang as Thao) who lives next door. When things get ugly and melodramatic, Walt rationally looks at ways to remove negative influences from Thao's life.""Gran Torino"" (the title taking itself from the 1972 vintage automobile that is Walts' prized possession) is compelling every step of the way, with Clint doing extremely well in the colourful lead role. His evolution as a character is central to the story (concocted by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson), and it's believable and realistic all the way. Walt doesn't just miraculously shed himself of racist views overnight. We can see that he's become something along the lines of a stereotypical Grumpy Old Man, but Clint always makes him a real human being and not a cartoon character. The other characters are also treated respectfully and interestingly, and while the subplot with the Hmong gang may ultimately drive the tale into more conventional melodrama trappings, Clint keeps things rooted with an interest in ruminating on the whole idea of life and death. Walt may have lived the bulk of his life already and have little to lose, but he doesn't want to see his new friend blow it all for the sake of vengeance.The supporting cast is variable, but the earnestness of Vang, and Ahney Her as his sassy sister, does count for something. The gang members are the kind of unrepentant scum who make for absolutely perfect villains. Clint anchors everything with an appealing, nuanced performance that *could* be viewed as an aged variation on Dirty Harry Callahan, but in truth is something deeper and more affecting. He's always been ambitious in terms of performances and projects, and here we get to see him flex typically sharp filmmaking muscle.Not to be missed, for any fan of classic film stars such as Clint.Music composed by Michael Stevens & Clint's son Kyle; another son, Scott, appears on screen as Trey.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Redemption?,"I like to think this is a sequel to Heartbreak Ridge. Cause listening to the softspoken Clint on the documentary, and hearing him as grumpy Korea veteran Walt is two different things. Elienated by his two sons, Walt is a widower who lives by old laws. By random he becomes the unlikely friend with neighbours Sue and Thao of the Hmong people. The rest is a dramedy, turned tragedy, turned revenge/redemption. Walt has lung cancer. We never hear the word, but it's pretty clear and at last stage. It's not important per se for the story, but says alot of his character. Selfmade, he don't tell anyone. I'll easy rate this as Clints finest performance since Million Dollar Baby. He actually kids around with his old macho image. The hmong kids both do a very good job, likable, just as you feel disgust for the gang tormenting them. Close your eyes two seconds, and you'll miss Clints son, Scott, in a very minor role.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
make my day,"I saw Gran Torino mainly as an admirer of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as director. And I was very impressed, there were parts that amused me and others that had me moved. Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"If this is Clint's acting finale, it is a grand one!","I saw this movie a few days ago at a pre-screening in Denver, Co. I have only been to a handful of movies in my life in which there was applause at the end. This was one of them. I also found myself cheering for an acting performance that will remain historical. Mr. Eastwood's portrayal of Walt Kowalski is perfect in the way that he envelops the character, a character with flaws, inner turmoils, and ultimately a willingness to accept what he has always perceived as unacceptable. There are other good performances, but this is Clint Eastwood's movie. He is the focal point of every scene. He is at times very serious, at times very funny, but he is always believable. There are a few scenes where he could have rekindled Dirty Harry, but he didn't. Dirty Harry, also one of my favorites, was super-human, Walt Kowalski is human, with human characteristics. When Walt is a smart-ass, it is very funny, but we also see that turmoil that creates the behavior. Many out there will say that this is just a 78 year old actor trying to look tough one last time, but they would be missing the heart and soul of this performance. We see this toughness, but it, in no way diminishes the true depth of the character or Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the character. We should all see this great actor/director and this great performance on Oscar night.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
brilliantly written and directed movie,"Clint Eastwood stars in and directs Gran Torino. The fact that there are no other well known actors/actresses in this film does not take away from this brilliantly written and directed movie. The movie takes place in Highland Park, Michigan in what used to be a predominantly white neighborhood but in recent years has become a predominantly Asian neighborhood. Walt Kowalski was a retired union autoworker and a Korean War veteran who had occasional flashbacks of his war days. He was very patriotic, meticulous in his thoughts, and in most instances harsh with his words. Although Walt was a good financial provider he was emotionally detached from his children,grandchildren, and neighbors. Walt's most recent neighbors are a Hmong family with two children that he becomes bothered by almost instantly . . . . . Sue and Thao. Sue and Thao are constantly being harassed by gang members. Thao is pressured daily to prove himself to the gang (who happen to be family members) by stealing Walt's prized Gran Torino. Walt's emotional complexity worked both ends of the spectrum which is depicted in the following scene clips: The film starts as Walt is returning home from his wife's funeral. It is obvious his relationship with his children and grandchildren are strained, yet he subconsciously realizes the importance of these relationships, especially since his wife has passed. His children are concerned with the changes that have taken place in the neighborhood and try to encourage Walt to move. Walt too is concerned with the crime, violence, and racial ethnicity that has taken over his once ""white"" neighborhood. He does not make any effort to associate with or understand his neighbors and is in fact disturbed by their lack of care and sense of pride in their homes and yards. In the final scene, Walt reveals an array of emotions as he decides to take care of the gang that has bullied Thao and his family since they moved into the neighborhood. The dialogue in this movie was relevant to Walt's time with racial slurs being exchanged between Walt and his buddies as well as undertones of racial tension between he and his ethnic neighbors. The overall lighting was set appropriately for the scenes, when in dark places like the basement the lighting reflected the darkness of the room yet zoned in on Walt and what he planned to do. The lighing in the final scene captured the suspense of the climax by focusing in on Walt standing alone in the dark, a ""one man show"" with the dimming lights that followed the poetic justice of the final scene. The irony in this movie is that Walt Kowalski served in the Korean war against Asians and at the end of his life he was fighting for them. By Lori Hubble",,Anonymous,Drama
They say that falling in love is wonderful,"This movie is some kind of snake-swallows-its-own-tale cap for Eastwood's career. Somehow he manages, in the course of almost two hours, to work in every one of his famous facial gestures. Disgust, rage, threat, snarl: it's all there. That's one reason to love it. Cuz this movie is about Clint. Forget the plot, really: it's about those adoring Hmong ladies bringing him lots of plates of food. Now there's a hero: Love me.= SPOILERS=Another reason to love this story is that the next door neighbor kid abandons an opportunity to be a gangsta. Not does he do that, in favor of the beloved *hard work* this country was built on, he learns how American males talk mano-a-mano. It's so CUTE!Best of all, the movie's all about cars, our beloved cars. It's set in Detroit. Much of which is lying in ruins after what we called the American dream has awoken in ruins. With the auto companies on life-support, after what they did to us and their employees and the environment (see Michael Moore et al), thanks to the tax dollars earned by us hard-working, self-sacrificing Americans, we get a movie whose main inspirational symbol is an (ugly) US classic automobile. The only 'special features' on the DVD are about the car.And that legacy gets handed on to the next generation in the end. Along with a great-big-dollop of self-sacrifice. Yeah, take what we've learned from cars and run with it, neighbors. Cuz we're at the end of the line here.

'Vintage' Eastwood,Clint Eastwood can't put a foot wrong these days. Ever since 'Mystic River' he has been putting out cinematic gems and 'Gran Torino' is no exception. Plus he's even in this one as well! When we first meet Walt Kowalski it is in a church and he is standing by his wife's coffin glaring down the aisle at the mourners as they take their places. As his grown-up sons and their children arrive he snarls in their direction making no effort to hide his contempt. Walt snarls a lot in this film and never more so when confronted by his disappointing offspring.With his wife now gone Walt lives alone with just his dog for company the only white man in a district that has become predominantly Korean. Not exactly the ideal milieu for a Korean war veteran and he makes his dislike for his neighbours very clear – and very often. Then one night when he catches the kid from next door trying to steal his Gran Torino he is dragged into the family's life and his own is changed forever.This apparently has been Eastwood's most successful film ever taking in over 140 Million dollars at the U.S. box office alone. It's a success that's richly deserved and if as rumoured it is Clint's final appearance as an actor then it's a fine performance to close on. Looking every day of his 79 years he still manages to convey real menace from Walt when he takes on the local gang and you know whose side you'd want to be on. There had been stories circulating before the film's release that this was actually a final 'Dirty Harry' movie (which may have accounted for its enormous success) and while Walt Kowalski is not Harry Callaghan he's just as compelling and entertaining a character made all the more so by the great grizzled performance on show here.,7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Good story, some holes","Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) befriends Tao (Vang) to keep him away from street gangs. Walt is a Korean War Vet and has a sour attitude on just about everything. His wife just died and he is now alone in a neighborhood that has many Korean neighbors and he isn't happy about that.The story is a good one, but there are some holes and maybe this is why no Oscars. What is important in here is what wasn't addressed. His wife. Seems he loved her dearly, but none of her influence had much effect on him. He is mean and sour on everything and everyone including his sons. There were many of her friends at the reception after the funeral at the house, but very few comments about her were heard and Walt wasn't too interested in hearing them anyway. None of her friends came around afterwards. That seemed strange to me. He gains some civility just by interacting with his neighbors and that is a good thing. And, actually, the movie became more enjoyable because of that. Walt's relationship with teenager Sue (Her) was pure gold.Another hole is his confession to Fr. Janovich (Carley). We thought we would learn something about the way Walt is and the guilt he appears to be carrying around with him. We learned nothing. Very weak confession. Again, the wife seemed to be the key regarding what he confessed, but she didn't have that influence either.Another hole, if it could be called that (and you know I do), is his attempt to man-up Tao in front of the barber and the construction boss. It all just seemed over the top and quite unnecessary. Very stilted dialogue here. In a way, embarrassing as well.Other than that, the movie is quite good. It could have been titled Walt or even Kowalski since the story is really about him. The Gran Torino was just the carrot and a reminder to him that there were times when life was good. Also both are one of a kind and no one should change them.This is an exceptional cast and with Mr. Eastwood directing we expect no less. You will have to be ready for much language and ethnic slurs spewed by Walt. Thank goodness the Korean neighbors were very understanding because despite his behavior, language and slurs directed to them, they considered him a very good man. He becomes their protector from the gangs.Maybe because of the way Walt is, you kind of expect Dirty Harry to emerge. Stay tuned.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes. Throughout.
