The Most Unprepared (or Stupid) Crew Ever Seen,"""Alien: Covenant"" is a sci-fi action film technically perfect, with great special effects and landscapes. Unfortunately the story is terrible with the most unprepared (or stupid) crew ever seen. How could practically all the crew including the captain and the second in command land in an unknown planet without a better analyze of the soil and the atmosphere? They have a skilled android that should go alone and report whether the place is dangerous or not. One of the groups have a sick crew-member and his partner brings him bleeding to the only means of transportation they have to return to the spacecraft. The pilot risks the lives they are transporting and their colonization mission to try to rescue a few survivors. In addition, the performances are soulless and not engaging and the viewer does not care to the characters. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Alien: Covenant""",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"With strengths at a visual and technical level, it would be much better with a more developed and better written script.","I don't know if I'm the only person to say this, but I think a horror movie works better if we see some intelligence in the script and in the characters' attitudes, and if the main antagonist is mysterious and able to surprise us. I liked ""Prometheus"", a film better than expected, albeit with a confusing script. This film establishes a clearer, more palpable link between that film and the ""Alien"" franchise. The script accompanies the ""Covenant"", a colony ship filled with people in hypersleep. The ship receives a mysterious signal from a planet that, by all indications, has excellent conditions for life, but quickly realizes that it has stumbled on a place where it should never have landed. After seeing the film, I had the feeling that we were looking at a very solid work that only lost when compared to the original franchise. Perhaps the best way to be fair is really to avoid this comparative exercise, which is seductive and almost impossible not to do.Shall we start with the good things? Very good! The film is a sight for sore eyes, especially for sci-fi fans and for those who like very visual films with high doses of special effects, CGI or extraordinarily detailed scenarios. There is no doubt that the budget had a generous slice set aside for computer technicians, art and costume designers and cinematography, and this investment has paid off handsomely. Everything is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and good sound effects. And of course, there are lots of tense scenes. It is one of those films where the tension is permanent, but which never really scares us.Sadly, that's basically all this movie has to offer us. Fans of the Alien franchise will ensure that the film clarifies several gray points in the narrative of other films, such as ""Prometheus"", and I agree with this argument, but this does not seem to me to be something that we should overestimate, because it really was the least that could be done. Demanded from this film! At the script level, it is frankly disappointing: in addition to being lazy, making the most of what was done for the other films with which it is linked, it adds few new things. Yes, it creates some new creatures, ""cousins"" of the original xenomorph, but that's all. The human or semi-human characters are silly, devoid of development and seem to be waiting to be killed.The film starts out great, but becomes slow and tiresome as it becomes predictable. I have a high regard for Ridley Scott's work, I think he's a very skilled and credited director, but it's hard not to acknowledge that he failed here. The director was dazzled by the amount of CGI potential and neglected the narrative, editing and direction of the actors. Among the actors, Michael Fassbender stands out the most. The actor has given us one of his best works so far. Katherine Waterston also did a very good job. The rest of the cast doesn't have the time or material to do anything special.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film. 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection' had their issues but to me weren't that bad, while 'Prometheus' had some fine elements while also some major flaws.My thoughts on 'Alien: Covenant' is fairly similar to my ones on 'Prometheus'. Not as bad as led to believe (having read reviews that were mostly mixed to negative), but could have been much better considering the brilliance of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. With a good cast, and with the involvement of a hit and miss but talented (especially visually) director Ridley Scott, 'Alien: Covenant' could and should have been far better. Some undeniable strengths here, at the same 'Alien: Covenant' also commits the same faults as 'Prometheus', and makes even more of the mistake of having little point to it other than providing a few necessary answers to loose ends from 'Prometheus'.Lets start with 'Alien: Covenant's' strengths. Even when the writing and story weren't up to snuff, Scott's films always looked visually beautiful. 'Alien: Covenant' is not an exception. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and is often powerfully arresting and most of the special effects (apart from the disappointingly cheap-looking ones for the xenomorph) are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.Jed Kurzel's music score is hauntingly unsettling and recalls one fondly of the music in the original film by Jerry Goldsmith. There are a few scary moments (though this doesn't come consistently) and credit is due for providing much needed answers to questions that were on people's lips after watching 'Prometheus'.Of a pretty good cast, considering what they had to work with, Michael Fassbender's commandingly and intensely acted dual role is the standout. Katherine Waterston brings steel and vulnerability, yet another performance demonstrating why she is one to watch, and surprisingly Danny McBride succeeds in trying to fully form his character rather than be annoying or looking stoned. Billy Crudup also tries his best with little to do.However, genuine tension and suspense is replaced by monster/alien action and attempts at character motivations. Sadly too much of the monster/alien action is not that exciting and only sporadically scary, cheapened by at times excessive and gratuitous gore (by far the goriest and bloodiest of the 'Alien' franchise and the approach felt a little out of place). On top of that the characters (in a film where there is too many of them in the first place) are very thinly sketched rather than fully formed and of the lot only Tennessee, Walter and David properly raise above forgettable, David especially being pretty splendidly drawn actually. The constant frustrating decision making from most of the characters also prevents one from properly connecting to them.Script is also often very weak, even more rambling and clich√© ridden than that of 'Prometheus', with philosophising and thrown in references to the likes of Wagner and Michaelangelo that gives a sense that the film wasn't sure of its identity. The story suffers from dull pacing and from being over-stuffed of too many ideas not done enough with. By the time the big reveal came it leaves one with a so what feel, due to it being so obvious too early on, and there is far too much of a you have seen it all before vibe.In conclusion, tries hard and there's no doubting that a lot of work went into the visual aesthetics and the acting but 'Alien: Covenant' should have been much more. Certainly not awful but a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In some ways its excellent, but as an Alien film its infuriating","In the first 20 minutes I was so happy with Covenant. It felt sharp, atmospheric, there are interesting character situations, emotive moments and infinitely better writing than we had in Prometheus. As it progresses, this feeling continues - thankfully, a solid sci-fi film that got it right.Then Ridley starts to indulge in his convoluted ideas about creation and destruction. Its like switching from 1977 George Lucas to 1999 Lucas. You can almost hear Ridley at a writing meeting saying ""this'll be cool, and this, and this, and then this"" and the writer saying ""uh, is this for the same film or later in the series?"" ""Yeah just cram it all in, make it happen"".You end up with three different films - a first act like a modern Alien which I loved, a middle act of Prometheus style philosophizing that feels like more Westworld, then a last act of two shoe-horned in action scenes homaging Aliens and Alien 3 respectively. Except there is no satisfaction at all, because the aliens are rushed, a bit silly, often awkwardly CGI looking, and not even convincing as threats because we don't care about any of it.By the end I just have no idea what to think. I just think it would have worked much better if the ideas were done justice in their own film, rather than ham-fistedly trying to ram them into an Alien film to try and please fans and make box-office.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
People are being harsh to this movie,"I think people have too high expectation to new movies of famous franchises, and when it doesn't come to their expectation, they just freak out and start giving one out of ten. If you have seen lots of harsh criticism for this movie, I say it's not bad at all. It's still quite entertaining. To be fair, lots of good horror movies are barely above 6 out of ten. So don't avoid it just because people say they hate it. It's true that they throw lots of (probably too many) elements into this movie, which might turn out to be less exciting. However, the ending succeeds in opening up to more stories, which is good. Also, keep in mind that this is not meant to be like the previous alien movies. It has totally different theme. I bet Ridley is a totally different person now. I would be surprised if he makes a new alien movie with similar tone to the older ones. And it's sensible for the old Ridley to explore the ""creation"" stuffs. I think it's a fairly good sequel to Prometheus. Look, now we have a new franchise directed by Ridley Scott himself, which is some what relates to the alien franchise. That is just great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A better Prometheus sequel but a mediocre Alien film,"When I went into watching Covenant on opening night, I went in with neither excitement nor hesitation but was just curious. I was one of the people who didn't hate Prometheus because I admired the new mythology Ridley Scott was trying to create. However, I could see that it was poorly executed especially when connecting to Alien. Covenant improves on those ideas with better-written characters but in the end mostly fails as a memorable Alien film.The parts I liked the most surprisingly were the Prometheus tie-ins. The film constantly delves on the ideas of creation, religion and faith without feeling as forced like in Prometheus. From the opening scene of android David's ""birth"" to the crew of the Covenant being a colony ship carrying couples, the film carries on these philosophical ideas while tying in very well with the origin of the iconic Xenomorph. While it does not explain everything that was left open in Prometheus, it does feel satisfying that Covenant tries to give some answers rather then just leave with questions.Once again Michael Fassbender proves to be the standout of this film. But this time he shows off double the effort when he plays two androids, the original David and the Covenant's own personal android Walter. David gets to be a lot more fleshed out and we get a better understanding behind his questionable actions. And as Walter, Fassbender displays a more restrained, machine-like personality but still conveying a sense of loyalty to the crew. And seeing the two Fassbender's interact with one with each other were the most compelling scenes in the film even if one scene was unintentionally hilarious. Danny McBride should also be credited for taking on a role more serious then his usual ones in comedy. Billy Crudup also was good as a religious man whose leadership is conflicted with his Christian beliefs. Katherine Waterston did well in the lead role but is not as unique as compared the Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. And now here is where the film's faults become very present. While the characters are an improvement from Prometheus, the movie's plot forces them to make choices that feel out of character and silly.Probably my biggest disappointment was the titled creature itself. The Xenomorph does not show up till maybe like 20 minutes towards the end and its presence just feels like a forced afterthought. And I didn't mind the Xenomorph being more cg-heavy when compared to past films but the subtlety of the creature hiding and waiting to pounce from the darkness was gone. With the creature attacking right out in the opening and Ridley Scott showing too much of it on camera, it no longer felt like the intelligent, calculative killing machine I remembered. It became just another dumb generic movie monster. Even the Alien doppelg√§nger movie that came this year, Life, was a better Alien movie then this actual Alien movie.The film also has twist ending that leaves a lot of plot holes to examine and is just more annoying and stupid then smart.In the end Covenant will satisfy those who had problems with Prometheus convoluted mythology with some intriguing sci-fi ideas but if you're looking for a great monster movie then watch the first two Alien films then this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bitter pill to swallow,"I had high expectations going into Covenant, I'd enjoyed Prometheus despite it's well documented flaws and was expecting it to rise above it's predecessor. It didn't. I can suspend belief for some things but others I can't overlook, the crew were well cast but the writing had some major flaws in much the same vein as Prometheus, highly trained people making incredibly bad decisions. You can argue that under pressure mistakes are made but not school-boy errors, taking an obviously sick and infected man onto your ship with no hint of quarantine being a major one. Having said that, I did think the aliens themselves were well projected and frightening, men-in-suits works better for me than CGI so on this point Scott won. The first two acts were good barring the critical errors, but the final act was telegraphed and obvious, it left me wondering where this great franchise can go to next? I will watch it again on disc and will definitely add it to my collection but to feel this disappointed after waiting for another of my favourite franchises to appear it left a bitter taste in my mouth, and it wasn't the Coke Zero.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Maybe they should stop here, before tarnishing the original!","The alien movies over the years have mutated manifold from straight up horror to a full on war/action flick then to a mixed backstory starting in alien 3 which was interesting but a massive failure. Prometheus visually stunning as it was was let down by an awful script an dialog in particular.Where do we come from? Why are we here? Themes from Prometheus continue in the very first 5 minutes before the credits have even rolled. It continues to beat you over the head with its backstory which, for me makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the dialog references other master horror works such as Frankenstein but does so in a way that it's up its own arse. Forgetting what alien actually was in the first place, a coincidence that was never about back story. Characters explain the plot in basil exposition speaking like no one ever would - speaking their thoughts at every opportunity - yes we get it, it treats the audience poorly.What I did like was the scene shown much in the trailer, a character trapped in concealed room as something happens to her colleague. It was a longer scene that was tense and exciting and I oh so wish the rest of the movie could have come close. In a strange way alien covenant takes iconic moments from the franchise and tacks them on here but makes me wish I was watching alien or aliens instead. It's technically good as always Ridley Scott is a visionary filmmaker, but is unable to turn a weak script into a good film.Alien:covenant gets locked up in its own self importance while forgetting why we loved alien in the first place. I really wanted to like it but came a way with a huge sense of disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Alien: Covenant, bigger and badder than Prometheus","I for one am a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise, and this movie is now one of my favorite movies. Though it may be somewhat predictable and familiar, I say that is a good thing as Prometheus seemed to stray too far from the other movies. Speaking of Prometheus, Alien: Covenant does an astounding job of tying into Prometheus and continuing the story of Shaw and David. The acting in this movie is spot-on, and I didn't find any of the characters to be annoying, or as stupid as the Prometheus crew. There is a twist (I won't spoil it) that has a lot of fans angry with Ridley Scott, but I don't mind it, and actually think it takes the story in a good direction. Moving on, the aliens in this movie are awesome, and look amazing. Critics have been stating that the CG on the aliens is spotty, but I didn't have ant problems with it. The design of the new creatures was unnerving, and kept me on my toes throughout the whole movie. The blood and gore of this film was just the perfect amount, and it always looked realistic and terrifying. Audio design for Covenant was incredible, from the soundtrack that feels like a callback to Alien and Aliens, to the completely unnerving, spine chilling sounds of the aliens and the eerie vibe to the sets. Overall, I had an amazing time seeing Alien: Covenant, and would highly recommend it to any Alien fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An entertaining, brutal and very confusing sequel.","Okay, I'll tell the truth. I did not expect much from the sequel to Promethues, as it seemed that the level of the Alien films declined more and more, but this time, It was quite different.The film has no doubt, the most beautiful views we see in the saga of Alien, has some incredible special effects, a very good script, spectacular performances (Fassbender is incredible) an entertaining plot, good sound design, great visuals And a lot, a lot of blood. I think it is the most bloody and violent film in the entire saga, just like the first time I saw Aliens, this one left me shocked and I try to see again and again.I am a big fan of science fiction and horror, Alien is my favorite saga, I must say that I am very grateful to Scott for the fantastic thing that is this new movie, very incredible, no doubt, it was quite entertaining and intense to experiment it in cinema. But, perhaps one of its biggest mistakes is its strange and too confusing narrative on the part of the director; this film is supposed to be designed to give answers to past problems, to the questions that we have asked ourselves so much, however, it only ends up reeling over themselves and trying to add layer upon layer of complexity that simply end up being unnecessary overexposure.Leaving that aside, it was a quite entertaining movie, with intense scenes and wonderful shots. I also highlight the incredible performance of Fassbender. Simple and fascinating I can describe it.Something interesting that I should highlight; Hell, this movie is brutal.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I played panicky idiot #3.....""","This was dumb.The crew of the spaceship, Covenant, is transporting 2,000 colonists to a new solar system, but their journey is interrupted by a solar flash which damages the ship. While making repairs, they pick-up a signal from a previously uncharted planet. Upon locating it and determining it can support human life, the captain (Billy Crudup) makes a spur of the moment decision to chuck aside all the planning that was put into their expedition to make this new planet their colonial destination. He gets some slight push-back about this flippant decision from his second-in-command, ""Daniels"" (Katherine Waterston who looks eerily like her father), but that seems to be the only complaint.So, the crew set down on this planet with no real plan, no protective gear, and just start winging it with, of course, disastrous results because this is an ""Alien"" movie.The crew, especially the captain, appear to have the intelligence of turnips. They proceed to act like the Scooby-Do gang and/or the begging-to-be-victims characters from the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" franchises by constantly splitting-up. I groaned every time a character said: ""I'll be right back"" as he or she walks off alone. And, boy, are they panicky. It's as if they had no training for their jobs whatsoever. Who green-lit this expedition with these fools? (The rampant stupidity of these characters is downright insulting to the audience's intelligence.)I don't know what's going on with poor Ridley Scott. For him to go forward with this stupid story with all its plot holes that require characters to repeatedly act like irrational fools is sad. The original ""Alien"" was such a smart movie with believable characters who were intelligent and professional. This is a pale imitation with a recycled plot twist from the original film except grossly embellished. Also, although Ms. Waterston is cute, her Daniels is no ""Ellen Ripley.""Most of the other actors didn't resonate at all. Years from now, while they're trying to land new roles and are asked about their previous work they can respond: ""Well, I played panicky idiot #3 on 'Alien: Covenant.'""",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing Sequel That Doesn't Know What It Wants to Do,"Alien: Covenant (2017)** (out of 4)Sequel to PROMETHEUS and a connection to the ALIEN series, this sci-fi film has a spaceship trying to locate a planet so that the human race can continue. The crew are planning on building a colony but they notice a much closer planet that can hold life. They decide to head there to see what's on it and soon the horror starts.To put it mildly, ALIEN: COVENANT is a major disappointment. It seems a lot of fans were unhappy with PROMETHEUS because it was more of a thinking man's movie and less of a action/horror/sci-fi film. It seems that this film was in trouble from the start because you have to wonder if there was some sort of debate before hand on what should be done with it. PROMETHEUS was a terrific movie that made you think about a lot of things but sadly this sequel doesn't do that. Instead, it almost seems as the filmmakers were forced to answer a few questions about PROMETHEUS and then they wanted to throw in the action of an ALIEN sequel.What really shocked me about this movie is the fact that it almost put me to sleep several times. I'm not going to say that the film is a cure for insomnia but at the same time it's deadly slow at times even though there's usually something always going on. As I said, the screenplay doesn't seem to know what the film should do and the majority of the running time is just downright boring. The film starts off with a tragedy yet it's hard to have any emotions for the characters because we're just getting to know them. Another problem is the fact that the characters are all rather bland with the exception of Michael Fassbender's two-part role.As I said, I thought the characters were rather boring and I'd argue that not many of the performances are all that memorable. Perhaps a longer director's cut will eventually show up but there's really not too much here. Fassbender delivers a fine performance but I can't say I was impressed with the rest of the cast. On a technical level Ridley Scott is a visual genius so all of that stuff looks great. There's some extremely gory scenes of violence, which are very good but the film is just way too uneven to work.It's like part of the movie wanted to be another thinking man's movie but there's another part that wanted to be a bloody action film. It just doesn't work in the end.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Still waiting for answers, but mostly left with more questions","Alien: Covenant was a good quintessential Alien movie. If you were looking for answers and an explanation of what happened after Prometheus; only expect, beyond the obvious, a few vague ones. Without revealing any major plot points, if you have watched the Prologues released by Fox, I can say that not much more than what have already been seen there is shown. The brief ""add on"" to the prologue, stitched into the movie as a flash back, does explain (sorta) exactly what happened after Shaw and David arrived at the Engineer Home World, but only in a very vaguely and briefly, leaving a lot unanswered. Including what happened to Shaw. There is a few tidbits that make it clear she was there, and vague explanation (sorta) of what may have became of her.I was hoping to leave the theater saying I get it, it all makes sense, and I think you do kinda get that, but not really. Many more questions are left then answers given. Like Chinese food; really good and you eat a lot but, your still hungry and still not fully satisfied when you leave the restaurant. A bit disappointing especially with a run time just over 2 hours. They packed in a lot of what Alien is known for, but it got a bit too esoteric and even a bit boring at times.We do get to start seeing how the Covenant mission is getting closer in the Alien Cannon time frame to the Nostromo encounter. Also, little tidbits that any fan of the original Alien will pick up on and appreciate. Absolutely go see this movie, but expect to be left hungry and wanting more. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You know the drill by now...but now the plot holes are starting to bother me: 70%,"This sequel to ""Prometheus"" and prequel to ""Alien"" treads the well-worn path of films in this franchise: a spacecraft intercepts a distress signal and changes its course in order to investigate...and then the crew come face-to-face with the horror that is the alien species which will either eat them or use the humans' bodies as a means of incubating its alien offspring.Since it's been many years since I've seen ""Prometheus"" (I saw it during its cinema run as well), I have to say that I'd already forgotten the details of it when I sat down in the cinema to watch this latest instalment. For that reason, I'd suggest that you watch ""Alien: Covenant"" soon after watching ""Prometheus"", if you can, unless you have a really good memory! That being said, I did recognise Guy Pearce from the previous film...but drew a blank later on in the film when the character Elizabeth Shaw is mentioned...and she was the main character from that film! In other words, I couldn't remember what happened to her at the end of the previous film.When I saw a trailer for this film many, many weeks ago, I have to say that I did find it misleading...it started off as if it was a film about humans colonising a new planet and then the trailer seemed to morph into an ad for a new ""Alien"" film. It made me wonder if I had missed some sort of break between trailers for two different films. I'm still wondering if a scene from that early part of the trailer was actually in the film! That being said, yes, ""Alien: Covenant"" does start the story off with a spacecraft (the ""Covenant"" of the title) travelling through space, carrying a cargo of breeding age humans, to colonise a new planet. Apart from one male, all the other humans are in suspended animation (anabiosis), seeing as the planet that they are going to is so far away. This being part of the ""Alien"" franchise, you know that things are going to go pear-shaped pretty quickly!At times you wonder if the narrative is just meandering, like the spacecraft repair scene...but it is actually tight, as it moves the plot forward...eventually.The ending of ""Alien: Covenant"" is obviously the starting point to another sequel, but I do wonder how well it will explain the aftermath of that ending as well as providing a bridge to the events of the original ""Alien"" film. i.e. presumably there is a lot at stake with the ending of ""Alien: Covenant"" but I'm not sure that there was any signs of how that played out in the original ""Alien"" film. It just seems going around circles, which isn't really satisfying, from my point of view. Going around in circles...yet another distress signal...with yet another spacecraft going to investigate, like a fly into a Venus flytrap...with yet more lethal aliens to encounter.From memory, I found the earlier film hard to follow and looking at my review for it now, that is confirmed, along with some other elements of the film which I had forgotten. Even though ""Alien: Covenant"" tries to spend more time explaining the origin of the aliens, I have to say that that often raised more questions than it answered for me! It mentions ""the virus"" and I have to confess that I have no memory of that concept being used in ""Prometheus""! There's also scenes of what looks like fungi being trodden on by humans, which releases what I assume to be ""the virus""...and that really doesn't make any sense to me. Is it a virus? Is it fungal spores? How does this all hang together? Okay, let's talk about all the other things that bug me about this film...the plot holes, if you will, or just the absurditiesOne thing that bugged me a lot in this film was just how rapidly large, lethal aliens developed in such a short time. Of course, this is narratively driven, as the film wants to focus on a very short period of time and it's ""required"" for the aliens to develop quickly as a result. Well, that just made me wish the film was set in another context! E.g. on a farm, where the alien could prey on livestock...or small children...before it was big enough to kill even armed adults. Perhaps this was still an issue in the original ""Alien"" film...but I suppose it was just less pronounced in how quickly the alien grew to a scary size.Also, in this film the alien seems different in kind from previous films in the franchise...it's more akin to a psychopath in a slasher film than something that needs to kill humans in order to eat or create offspring.Even though I shouldn't have thoughts like the following, I can't help myself! Okay, I'm having problems with the notion of just how sustainable a human-alien co-existence would be. It seems to me that the aliens would be an existential threat to humanity...in which case, if they no longer have any prey, how on Earth are aliens themselves going to continue multiplying?Miscellaneous notes:* The end credits have an ""In memory of"" for Julie Payne. Not sure who she is.* Katherine Waterston as Daniels ""Dany"" Branson is good...she is small in stature but continues the franchise's form in having strong female characters...she's the alpha female, so to speak.* Looking at my notes for ""Prometheus"" I noted the stupidity of the crew in that film...with this current film, I have to note how the latter part of the film is just Murphy's law writ large (ignoring the franchise trope of how humans keep coming into contact with the aliens!).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Flawed, but nostalgic.","I really disliked Prometheus. While I appreciated the ideas it tried to convey, the execution was poor. It tried to be an exploratory adventure, but also tried to be a horror film, not knowing exactly what it wanted to be. It posed way too many questions and fell flat in doing so. Very disjointed and all over the place. Plus the characters were a total bore and one-noted.In Alien: Covenant, it's as if Fox and Ridley Scott knew of the outcry and decided to make the Prometheus sequel more like Alien, and to be honest, that washed away most of the sour taste I had.Look this movie is not perfect by any means, but the addition of that Alien flavor really put this film into higher gear. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the film. Of course there's trouble lurking around as the movie progresses. People get messed up in this film and it's gruesomely entertaining. Yes, the cast is absolutely expendable, but this time around I felt as though they were handled better. I think what really helped was the YouTube clip released prior, with the cast talking before they went into hyper sleep.The crew members in this movie are more likable than the crew members of Prometheus. Key crew members aboard on the Covenant ship include Katherine Waterston as Daniels, who is resourceful and probably the only one who makes the smartest decisions of the bunch. Yes she is a character that is inspired by Ripley, but Scott doesn't make that too obvious. I enjoyed Billy Crudup as Oram and Carmen Ejogo as Karine, who are both a couple in this film, and are calm and collected. Danny McBride is Tennessee, a wise cracking, cowboy hat wearing pilot. Something I expected was to see was the typical character McBride is known for playing on screen, but it turned out to be the opposite so it was refreshing to see him in this light.The highlight is Michael Fassbender as David and Walter. David is the synthetic android that returns from Prometheus and Walter is the new, advanced and sophisticated android helping out the Covenant crew. Fassbender's work in these duel roles are fascinating to watch. He brings different traits of personalities to them both as they interact.A lot of questions are still unanswered, some of which were teased at the end of Prometheus, but perhaps they'll be answered eventually. Yes the scientists make the same stupid mistakes, and yes there are some plot-holes, but Ridley Scott has rejuvenated my interest. At best Alien: Covenant plays out like a ""greatest hits"" or a cover to Alien and Aliens. While that might turn off some people, I found it to be nostalgic.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley Clone Vol. 2,"It was a good film and decent entry to the Alien franchise, however one of the weaker ones. I also preferred the previous ""Prometheus"" to it because it introduced me to a totally new mythology that interested me and that I wanted to see develop further. While it definitely develops the story, and especially Michael Fassbender's character David I was a bit disappointed because it just cuts so many promising ankles up. I did like the idea to connect it more to the original Alien franchise but I hoped for more Alien action. The film wastes too much time to introduce mediocre and uninteresting characters. Then releases a different kind of alien which is rather lame tho (well at least there were some really well choreographed scenes). The cast was fine. I did like Michael Fassbender and liked the direction they went with his characters. In the mid section the conflict is a bit over the top but still an interesting twist. Katherine Waterston did her best as a poor mans Ellen Ripley. Well Noomi Rapace in the former was already introduced as a poor man Ellen Ripley and killed off before this film even begs, so I expect the same fate to Waterston in a further sequel. Billy Crudup was rather boring. To my surprise Danny McBride was really good here. Too bad they wasted Guy Pearce for just a cameo because he could have made a really good character. What I really liked was the last third which had nice action scenes, great cinematography and generally many references to the former Alien films which it paid homage to.

It's abysmal.,"I love the franchise, but it's been on the decline for some years. Prometheus was average, this is worse than poor. I'll be clear, I hate this movie, it's terrible, it doesn't deserve to have the Alien name on it.It takes an age to get going, and when it finally does it's a shambles, there doesn't seem to be any logic of any kind, multiple flaws in writing, so many times you say to yourself ''that would never happen,"" unless only the extremely thick people were in charge, which of course they are. I can only put it down to bad writing.A few points for the visuals, there are some scenes that at least look half decent, the scene where the ship crashes releasing the pathogens onto the planet looked great.I detest this film, and its awful writing. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A return to form,"Alien: Covenant has a familiar narrative: a crew on a mission in space encounter an alien lifeform, become ""infected"" and have to fight for their survival. Yet this doesn't feel like a remake of the original Alien movie, or a sub-par spin-off. This feels fresh and exciting; breathing life into the saga once more.The movie didn't feel slow at any point in time - despite the fact that it does spend a fair amount of time building up - and didn't feel too long. The writing, directing, and pacing are all excellent: Ridley Scott's signature recipe.Without giving anything away, we see the return of a (very) familiar face, although major developments have been made since our last encounter, which are - thankfully - well explained. We are given answers (although not all) to questions raised previously, and given the information needed to chronologically connect Alien: Covenant to the rest of the saga. This movie goes to great lengths to redeem and justify the preceding Prometheus movie.All in all, Alien: Covenant is a fantastic addition to the Alien franchise. If you are a fan of the Alien movies and were left feeling at all disheartened after Prometheus, I can recommend this movie to you without reservation. Not only does it make up for Prometheus' shortfalls, it infinitely adds to the saga, before carefully setting up for further instalments. The combination of revelations from and developments since Prometheus, engaging cast members, plot twists, commitment to staying true to its roots and simultaneous innovations, make for a stellar watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Generic if entertaining,"The first four Alien movies worked because of a certain Sigourney Weaver who made Ripley one of the most iconic characters in all of cinema. Their much-touted follow-up, ""Prometheus"", billed as a kind of prequel, was hardly memorable, despite being directed by Ridley Scott, though it did give us a reasonably memorable character in Michael Fassbender's robot David. Now we have the much anticipated sequel to ""Prometheus"" and one that gets back to adding the word 'Alien' to the title.""Alien: Covenant"" is certainly better than its predecessor though when it was over I didn't feel as if I had actually seen anything. This is a generic, if entertaining, sci-fi movie that adds nothing to the genre or to the 'Alien' series, at least nothing we haven't seen before; indeed it feels like bits of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" stitched together. On the plus side, it looks good, has a decent climax and Michael Fassbender, reprising his role of David as well as a new, identical robot called Walter, is outstanding, proving that, whether playing a human or something more mechanical, he remains one of the best actors around.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Alien: Covenant - set your expectations to ""low""","You are now entering a spoiler-free zone; well as much as a spoiler-free zone as possible given that this is an Alien movie and we all know how they usually end.So Alien: Covenant is the second of Ridley Scott's Alien-prequel series. I'm not giving anything away by saying that the end of this one lays the basis for the next one. Reports suggest there may be four prequels. We have been threatened with worse. I refer to James Cameron's plans for four more Avatar sequels!If you have not seen the first prequel, Prometheus you need to see it before seeing Alien: Covenant. That is a must. You will be lost otherwise. Even if this is your very first time to see an Alien film, please see at least one other first.Once you have seen Alien or Aliens, then the B-story of this film will make sense. In fact the last act is almost a beat for beat copy of either of these two. We'll come back to the A-story later.1979's Alien was the first outing for Ridley Scott with the creature. It had a very strong script and featured the famous mess-hall scene with the wonderful John Hurt and our first look at the chest-burster as it was known then. It was a straight-forward horror story set in space, complete with jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Seven years later James Cameron brought us Aliens which changed gears and gave us, what was essentially, a war movie. It was a different take utilising the same villain. Both stand alone and both are memorable. This writer has watched both movies many times. Let's forget Aliens 3 and 4 and the various Aliens vs Predator rip-offs.Enough history, what of this latest movie. Let's start with the plot. There are no less than six writers involved in developing the story and crafting the screenplay. When you have half-a-dozen writers involved it usually shows and this film is no exception. The writing is all over the place and when one character exclaims ""I don't know what's going on"" you can feel the cinema-going audience, to a person, empathise.The B-story has the crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovering a signal from another planet on route to their destination. The signal is a broken but identifiable as ""Take me home country roads"". This intrigues our intrepid crew who decide to investigate. One can almost hear the audience shouting ""don't do it!"" but they do and discover what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape. Enough said ‚Äì you get the gist.The A-story continues Scott's preoccupation with faith, human origins and our destiny as a species. Prometheus started this examination but was slow and plodding not to mention confusing and with an ending that made no sense. We get more of the same here only it's not shoved in your face as much as the first prequel.The crew are instantly forgettable. Yes we have a woman in a vest shooting at a monster which again, is a step too far in trying to recreate the Ellen Ripley character ‚Äì without success. The ship, the Covenant is too shiny and there is the odd JJ Abrams lens flare on the bridge. Our alien movies need to be grimy!The film is receiving widespread criticism. I understand why. The A-storey is, well boring at this stage. The B-storey is not satisfying and the twists at the end are so well sign-posted that it takes away from the ending.I went in with very low expectations and was surprised.3 out of 5So set your expectations to ""low""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A back-to-basics balls-to-the-wall Alien entry,"This will be the sixth time we get to see a xenomorph explode from a human chest after using the human host as baby gruel (eighth if you include the Alien vs Predator abominations). In the world of narratives, the shock value depreciates like the value of cars, but there is still a tingling thrill if the story is well-told. After the ponderous top-heavy Prometheus (2012), it is nice to see Ridley Scott serving up a back-to-basics Alien entry that has many fan-nods to his 1979 sci-fi-action-horror classic Alien.Some years after the events of Prometheus, the ship Covenant, loaded with the hibernating bodies of settlers, is en route to colonise another planet. A tragedy forces the crew ‚Äì Daniels (Katherine Waterson), Oram (Billy Crudup), Tennessee (Danny McBride), Lope (Demian Bichir), Karine (Carmen Ejogo), the android Walter (Michael Fassbender) and others ‚Äì to make an emergency landing on an uncharted planet, where they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.Tell me the plot doesn't resemble Alien. These days movie franchises like to reboot itself by making a ""new"" film, case in point being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This is not necessarily a bad move because it gets to keep the old fans and new ones to the franchise happy. Frankly, after being weighed down by all the lofty God and Creator ideas in Prometheus, we are due for some let's-kill-em-all balls-to-the-wall action.Alien: Covenant is definitely a piece of effective sci-fi-horror gut-bucket filmmaking and IMHO Ridley Scott hits the mark (not the bullseye though). Sure, the characters are hackneyed and are largely cannon fodder for the aliens. Sure, the world may be different but the actions of the crew are the same. But at least none of them does dumb things like yakking cringe-y lines to a baby alien like it is a puppy and getting crushed by a giant rolling croissant (here's looking at you, Charlize Theron). That said, the crew of Covenant, especially the captain, are still gullible, but I can forgive that for the matter of storytelling.The action set-pieces are well-staged and have the right amount of freshness and yet could harken me back the classic, like the flushing out of the alien onboard the ship and the closing of the hatches after them. That gave me goosebumps of the good kind. Daniels (Katherine Waterson) is no Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), but still she channels a compelling yet softer edge. But the movie is really a Michael Fassbender show whose performance is sinewy and spine-chilling. He plays dual roles here with the right amount of distinguishing traits ‚Äì rigid upper body, posture, speech patterns, menace-laced dialogue ‚Äì with finesse and aplomb.Ridley Scott has come out tops through an ocean of guts and gore, and he has reminded me how much I love the first two Alien entries. I like Covenant, but don't love it, and this one easily slips into third place. Scott has successfully answered the questions proffered in Prometheus and got my senses up to ultra-wary levels for the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A philosophical path in the alien franchise,"The mix of AI, alien and human were good. I didn't expect to see this kind of movie so soon. The AI is the center of the film, encapsulated in the Alien world.I don't need to see extraterrestrial life to be amazed beyond my comprehension, the humans are enough to me. The creation of AI will add more uncertainty, or chaos, in the future and this movie made me wonder not whether, but when the AI will be the creator.I was reluctant to see the movie because of the rate in the IMDB, but I'm a strange creature and I like movies that a lot of people don't like.I did not give 10 stars because of the prediction of some scenes and the clear lack of security protocol that I didn't expect to see from humans of the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
All characters act like if they where borderline suicidal fools.,"Unfortunately, today's high-budget movies insult the intelligence of viewers. Alien Convenant follows this trend. We have heroes with the intellect of a cartoon characters bumping onto planet where all the inhabitants are located in one city, and basically in one fortress, which is convenient when telling short story, but as we know, planets don't work like that. This trend was initiated by Star Wars, where a given planet was always represented by one - easy to shoot settlement. Furthermore all characters are just an excuse to show the next iterations of the alien. All characters act like if they where borderline suicidal idiots. Their idea of space-exploration can be summarized like that: ""Hey we found new unexplored planet with an alien ecosystem, with tones of potentially deadly viruses, bacteria, pyrogens, spores and even new forms of pathogens. So lets put on our hats with earflaps and go touch everything we can!"" So under this rag, commander of the titular mission risks lives of thousands of colonists because of song he heard in cosmic radio, sang by Lisbeth Salnder.Obviously after landing on alien world all characters touch or step on everything just like children. One of the heroines washes her wounds in unsterilized raw water, and let me remind you, she is supposed to be on unknown alien planet. And so on, and on from start to finish. One after another example of painful stupidity by people who are supposed to be elite colonists and astronauts. Plot is just an insult to common sense. If you have IQ over 90 points, just skip this movie, it's irritating waste if time. And it doesn't even look good. Prometheus which was equally stupid at least had amazing shots, good character design and special effects. And this one doesn't even have that, it's plain stupid and awfully executed, with CGI that sometimes looks as if it was taken from cheap TV series.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie Prometheus was supposed to be.,"It's finally here! Ridley Scott's highly anticipated follow-up to 2012's Prometheus. Anticipated, because Prometheus divided audiences (Alien-fans and casual viewers, alike) around the globe. With an overly convoluted plot and illogical character actions (A zoologist petting an unknown space-cobra. Really?), Prometheus crushed under it's own weight. Let's find out if Scott redeems the prequels with Alien: Covenant.The first pro of this movie over Prometheus are the characters. The crew of the spaceship Covenant are more likable from the get-go. All of them are couples with the intention of finding a new habitable planet and settling there. This is in sharp contrast with the crew from Prometheus who were on that particular mission either for personal gain or the simple reason of being paid to be there. This new crew feels more human. Their (sometimes rushed) decisions are based on familiar emotions (fear, love, self-doubt etc.). Are there people getting to close to alien eggs and spore pods? Yes. Stupid things like that still happen on a couple of occasions, but most of it happens by accident instead of sheer stupidity.Michael Fassbender reprises his role of David, the curious synthetic looking for it's purpose. Apart from an interesting conversation with his creator, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), in the intro, David's role really kicks off about halfway through the movie. With it comes the referencing of classic arts, which could foreshadow the coming events to viewers who pick up on those. His updated model, Walter (also Fassbender), offers an interesting Ying to David's Yang and the two develop quite an interesting relationship as the plot carries on. The only thing the plot revolving around David leaves to be desired, is it's link to Prometheus. It is all resolved very quickly with a flashback. The whole ""Why have you created us""-plot of Prometheus does not get the conclusion we wanted for it to make sense. This feels like a missed opportunity.Now to talk about the thing everyone bought their ticket for; the Alien. Yes, it's a proper Xenomorph this time around. Yes, you do get some answers regarding it's creation. In other words, fans of the franchise will absolutely love the intense and gory scenes in which it's titular beast is featured. Even if this movie does nothing really new with the formula. I have to admit that the movie never got really scary. In the 1979 original, the scares basically came from the fact that neither the characters nor the audience knew what was viciously killing the crew. Now, 38 years later, most people know what a Xenomorph looks like and that kills the scares a bit. Scott solves this problem by not holding back on the gore. And there is a LOT of that in this movie. Most of the scenes where the trailers cut away are shown in full gory glory here. It's not as much as an overabundance as most splatter horror movies, but not in the least for the faint of heart.In conclusion, as a fan of the Alien-franchise you will not be disappointed by Alien: Covenant. It does not steal the crown from the first two movies, but it's proudly taking the bronze medal. Even though the unresolved plot points of Prometheus are not entirely integrated or wrapped up to satisfaction, this movie redeems itself on that front by not trying to fix past mistakes, but building the foundation for future installments in the series. Sure, the movie is not really scary and predictable at times, but it's unsettling ending and gory sci-fi horror/action certainly makes it worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

ridley scott is an artist more than 'a guy who does his job',"Alien covenant, though this may sound strange, is not a horror nor a plot driven piece. It is poetic in its design. I went in expecting a horror but was disappointed in the first half but..... the later half i slowly came to realise that was not the intention in the first place....The movie's main theme is the dynamics of creation and creator in its pure beautifully cold form. From David to his creator, from the engineers to us , the beauty of such dynamics is untouched like a grey painting that makes you take a few steps in fear back as its unveiled. When I saw the engineers I was disappointed as to why are our creators so pathetic, but that was the genius of it, remember what I said about the dynamics? How pathetic and inferior are the creators before the more graceful creation ?David dressed himself as the engineers Signifying the engineer's way of life but only in the exterior, the interior being far more different than imagined.David creating more evolved,mutated beings only highlightens his dynamics. And now finally we have the humans, us but there was a problem , I didn't like the characters at all, they felt way too.... human, too much emotions , I expected human beings in the future to be more calculative, decisive and more mentally strong, but here their pathetic ,weak and easily make decisions based on emotions. Surprisingly I found my ideal human not in the humans themselves but in their creation , the Androids, David in particular, David showed how people need to be in the future in order to grasp the opportunity to enter Valhalla when the Valkyries arrive Human beings are pathetic, a race that's on the verge of extinction just like their engineer creators and their ship of hope turns into despair in the hands of their creation and of their own folly.The movie was nothing short of sublime, David was stranded and the Valkyries picked him up and he entered Valhalla(covenant) in full Grace as he puts forward the new formula of humanity....by a robot, a creation...Ridley Scott did something that I wouldn't expect to come from him, a poet",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"So alien covenant is the 2nd prequel to the original alien from 1979, and a sequel to 2012's Prometheus. First off, this film is visually stunning with the mind blowing cinematography and the combination of color makes the film an aesthetically pleasing experience. As a fan of the original film, I was extremely pleased and walked out of the Cinema with a smile on my face. Not much development on the characters but the film digs deeper into back story and explains far more resulting in a back to basics horror that was what Prometheus tried to be. This film in particular, and the prequel, explore the evolution of the alien, ultimately becoming the creature that gave us nightmares. Overall the film was extremely enjoyable and not too far fetched, although the ending felt very sudden and anti climactic. I feel the film would of benefited more if there was an extra 15-20 minutes added on to give the fans a satisfying ending. I would definitely recommend to all fans of the series. I'd give it a 9 out of 10 and I'll definitely see myself revisiting this installment in the alien. Saga multiple times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A return to horror roots,"Alien: Covenant - More horror than sci-fi, this prequel/sequel adds major elements to the overall canon of the Alien series. After a slow start, the engaging performances and beautiful set design make this a worthy successor to Prometheus.I have yet to see Michael Fassbender give a bad performance. He is given two roles in this movie and knocks them both out, showing distinct differences between the two. Billy Crudup also shines through with surprising success. I unfortunately can't say the same for Katherine Waterston, who plays the main character. Sigourney Weaver made the strong female an integral part of this series with Noomi Rapace doing an admiral job of carrying that banner in Prometheus. Waterston just seems out of place in her role.I will say it takes a while for it to feel like an Alien movie. The first third feels like standard science fiction fare with only minor esthetic similarities to the originals. But, when it does start to present story beats of the franchise, it doesn't stop. A common complaint of Prometheus was that it didn't really add to or explain pieces of the originals. Covenant puts those complaints to bed, allowing you to see Alien in a whole new light.While it wasn't as great as I was hoping, there's no denying the importance of this film to the franchise as a whole. Movies in a series can't just be made to fill in gaps to tell a larger story, however. Luckily Covenant brings plenty to the table that it stands on it's own as a success: great tension, high quality production design, and two Fassbenders.

One Stupid Decision after the other,"Truly this has to stop in movies regardless of genre...
just because a movie is horror, sci-fi or action, doesn't mean it has to be devoid of all reason.The movie needs to allow us viewers to ""suspend our believe"" (so to speak), but not assume we're going in willing to completely turn off our brains.A human civilization, that was successfully able to concur space, travel between galaxies, search and probably inhabit another planet, can't make all the strangely horrible decisions the supposed leaders of this mission did.You as a viewer find yourself always wondering, how are those people even qualified for whatever jobs they have?Were they even given any psych analysis, any training for stressful situation!A ordinary everyday taxi driver would've made better decisions and probably is more qualified.And it happens in movies, i get it, you see a few things that normally none would do but, hey, it's a movie, let it go, but when it's every single decision, a healthy brain can't accept this level of absurdity.If you're a real hardcore fan, watch it, although I won't recommend it...otherwise avoid at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's a great piece of entertainment with terrific visuals and excellent special effects with plenty of action, a nasty, nasty villain and sufficiently slimy henchmen.That said, if you're an Alien purest and demand logic and reason within the Alien Universe, this movie will be a HUGE disappointment.

Alien: Covenant has bland characters drifting through grandiose visuals.,"Alien: Covenant follows colony ship Covenant which is bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy. As they arrived in the planet, they noticed a beautiful landscape. At first of what they think is an uncharted paradise, they soon discover that it is actually a dark and dangerous world, rampant with mysterious creatures and a sole inhabitant who has been hiding for years after a doomed explosion.The first few sequences of Alien: Covenant are breathtaking, the movie quickly establishing an ambitious tone with elaborately conceived visuals. That's the best thing about it. The production is as great as it can get. It is a marvelously realized vision. The design of the Alien is also great, both leaving me terrified and fascinated by its beautiful design.The rest of the movie, though, doesn't exactly follow suit. The ambition is still there, and the movie continues to delight with its sci-fi flourishes. The thing is, amidst the grandiose tone and spectacular visuals, the characters end up feeling pretty thin, cardboard cutouts doing what they have to do just for the sake of it. There is quite a huge cast here, and none of them really get any attention. They just feel like bodies waiting to be killed. In addition, some of them are actually dumb for doing what they did throughout the movie. It sometimes doesn't make sense, their actions just a device to hurl the plot forward, making it hard for me to suspend my belief. I also felt the script to be clumsy, not reaching the heights that its visuals have intended it to. The actors weren't anything special except for Fassbender, who gives David both a sinister and a sympathetic outlook.As a sequel to Prometheus and a prequel to Alien, it did its job as it answered some of the questions I had; however, the answers are really vague. It doesn't really provide a huge revelation of what's actually going on, but one can see the connections between the three. I wouldn't call it a ""direct"" prequel and/or sequel, but it's all through the tiny links and loose threads in which they are interconnected.Having said all that, Alien: Covenant is worth seeing for its scale, and for the ambition that's embedded through its spectacle. It is as good-looking as a movie could possibly be at this point, the technology all put towards bringing sci-fi concepts to life. Even the gory sequences are great; they're genuinely terrifying, the movie raising the bar up a notch. Though as stunning as the film is, it might leave audiences a little cold. There's no underdog, the characters all feel thin, and their decisions may question the viewer on why they are there on that specific mission in the first place, given their idiosyncrasy. Alien: Covenant is still worth a look, but it's not so special in its entirety.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More of a ""Prometheus"" sequel than an ""Alien"" prequel","***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***Alien:Covenant is one of the most anticipated movies of the year mainly because its part of the beloved ""Alien"" saga and because of its great director Ridley Scott, but does it really deliver?As a fan of Ridley's Sci-Fi work (The ""Alien"" Saga, Blade Runner and The Martian), I couldn't wait to see this movie and I was almost sure that it's going to blow everyone away. But apparently, after reading most of the user reviews around here, lots of people didn't like it and called it the worst part in the franchise. But anyway, I just watched the movie and here's what I thought:Alien:Covenant takes place 10 years after the event of Prometheus and I highly recommend that you watch it in order to understand everything going around.Prometheus as a movie, divided its audience... Alien Covenant did the same here, it divided them too. The reason behind that is that the movie suffers from a forced attempt to link Prometheus with the Alien franchise, and that alone made the audience feel confused about what the movie wants to be. The result to this connection made the film looks different than the others ""Alien"" films.The problem with the film was that it never felt like an actual alien movie, it focused too much on the unanswered questions that Prometheus left and sometimes totally forgot about the survival-horror factor.However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.. After all, I have to say I enjoyed it nonetheless. We get to know more about how the Aliens were created and what happened after Prometheus, I think Ridley wanted to please everyone; the fans of the original Alien and the fans of Prometheus, and what you get here is exactly what happens when you mix both of them, and let's not also forget that Ridley's plan at first was Prometheus 2, later named Alien Covenant.The movie is still worth a watch just for the decent visuals and the great soundtrack and the acting, as for the plot I have to say it's not Ridley's best.DON'T BELIEVE THE 1/10 NOR THE 10/10.In the end I would say that Alien Covenant deserves to be watched at least once specially if you're a die hard fan of the franchise, it's far from being a bad film as everyone's saying, but don't get your expectations too high.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien as usual in ordinary landscape but great ending,"Dear readers, now I want to add the review about Alien: Covenant (2017). First of all is about the title. The title is not a lie, because the movie is about the alien, even if in the first scene, we already hope there is an alien physically, but the alien itself came up in the middle of the scene, while in the first scene, there is also an alien, but not physically, but mentally. Here I do not want to be a spoiler, but you will understand while I said the alien is already came up in the very beginning of the scene. Secondly is about the plot. Yes the ordinary movie of alien must have a team and a bunch of enemies, that are aliens. This movie is just like ordinary alien movie, so there is some expedition team, being interested in something new, but trapped in the middle of aliens team, and the plots are all about how to defend from the aliens, as you can see here that all relationships, including friendship, boss-people, and man-to-man, are focusing on alien, alien, and alien, and maybe for some people this is so boring, because it lacks of drama and sensation, there is no political or science-fiction plot that lead the plot. Then I want to review about the role of the actors/actresses. Here is we can see the feminist idea on some scenes while you can see the female that leads all the strategies against aliens, and yes there is some betrayal and broken friendship, but the feminist idea will cover it up by the time to time and all roles here are developing into their original characters. The liars stay liars, the gentlemen stay gentlemen, and the alien stay alien, so I can say it is little bit boring to watch this movie and everybody just can guess the ending. Finally I want to remark the style of Director that in somehow, in some cases, the movie looks like the ambiance of Star Wars and Hunger Games, I do not why, maybe some movie experts could give explanation more deeper, but for me, the effects are also similar to the Guardian of the Galaxy. But here is always appearing the alien that can entertain your whole weekend.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hauntingly Beautiful,"The movie features really beautiful scenery, the lack of colors blend really well with the scene. The essence of the creatures were captured well. The gore scenes were surprisingly artistic; displays a sense of curiosity and suspense.The characters were however, another story. It is literally a B-movie script and that is just about what I have to say about Alien Covenant. The visuals were literally the saving grace for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll adore Covenant","Alien: Covenant is predictable, full of dizzy camera-work and and inconsistent color scheme. However, its plot is genius and its screenplay is a powerful continuum of the Alien Universe. It's not as good as Alien (1979) or Prometheus (2012), but it is still one of the series' better films. It's the best movie in theaters right now and if you have seen Prometheus or any of the other Alien movies, I guarantee you'll find Covenant to be brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Breathtakingly beautiful, deep and powerful life lesson","English not being my native language so I beg your pardon.I have just seen this film and I can honestly tell you, It was way beyond my expectations. An extraordinary philosophical experience hard to describe. A journey beyond imagination. it comes close to the original Alien movie, but the philosophical aspects with strong interests in other disciplines are beyond anything I've ever seen in the franchise before. This movie is shockingly sophisticated. An original experience through the creation of the alien species but more! Its main initiative is about creation. David was created by the pantheon of industrial mechanics. David is a creative being with talents but he is imperfect. He is soulless. You cannot create something perfect through imperfect. There is no perfect work through soulless people. The soulless creature of xenomorph is an impure testimony of the human industrial mechanism (David). Empty! Seemingly perfect killing machine, just like the viruses or David, but without soul the creation will be nothing but blasphemy. David was the first blasphemy, a crime against mother nature, the xenomorph is the second one. It's all the stuff that defines our imperfect mind through the eye of a synthetic being.Walther: One wrong note eventually ruins the entire symphony. So true!Thank You Mr Ridley Scott!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, but the government brainwashed every critic on this site","Now i've seen reviews like these posted for other countless movies, and i think people writing these reviews are dumb dumbs. Why are you often comparing a mediocre movie to god damn ""The Shawshank Redemption""? And not to mention the fact that these people kick it up a notch by thinking they are some sort of critics or something, you're only a critic as far as your opinion goes. And these critics go so far as to even rate a movie with a score of 1 ,in my opinion that is such a pile of crap, honestly. This movie in particular had outstanding visuals,and little less outstanding CGI, but nonetheless the CGI wasn't as terrible as in the third movie of this franchise, yet there are still some people complaining how CGI is crap, oh come on, its not like you work as freaking special effect producer, so shut up! Now back to the movie, since the reviews are meant for an average viewer i highly recommend it, not so much if you are a fan of the franchise, because the movie might not live up to your expectations. Any how, this movie is not the greatest and certainly not my favorite (because they didn't put in god damn James Franco in the actual movie) in the franchise, but it has pretty nice narrative and not as many plot holes as i initially expected before watching this movie. So if you're looking for good Friday movie this could be a good choice",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's more than what emerges on the surface,"Alien: Covenant suffers from the ambiguous legacy left behind by Prometheus. Whereas the internet opinion discarded Prometheus and its lack of xenomorphs, Covenant minimised the bonds with its previous chapter in favor of more connections with the original Alien film from 1979. This lead to further shared and undeserved criticism: while Prometheus was too far from Alien, Covenant apparently is too close to it, and lacks of explanations as for some crucial questions raised in Prometheus.My personal view is in favor of both this movie and Prometheus. Covenant brought new cards to the table, despite what the common belief is.Let's talk about the connections with Prometheus first. There is not much explanation given about the big question from Prometheus, which was the reason that led the Engineers to decide to destroy mankind. At least not openly. I realised after some thoughts that many of those questions people want an answer to were indirectly answered through some small hints. As for quality, I personally think both Covenant and Prometheus are pretty much on the same level, with maybe Covenant being slightly more appreciated by me personally. David, the android from Prometheus, as we already knew, is back. His character has been further developed (partly at the expense of the new Fassbender character, Walter) and deepened.A theme that was developed in Covenant is that of creation and creationism. The film finally explores an interesting concept not very developed in previous alien films: just like the Engineers would be the creators of humans, humans created androids. This concpet will be further developed through the origins of the Xenomorphs.The origins of Xenomoprhs are finally unveiled, and the truth is much different from what one might have thought. While Xenomorphs appear for about 20 minutes of the film, there is much insight given to their genesis, something that I didn't expect.There are numerous subtle connections with Alien and even with Aliens, starting from the aliens text at the beginning, which in this film is identical to the 1979 film (underlining how Covenant is closer to Alien than to Prometheus). What I further enjoyed in the film was the very classical sci-fi tone of the first half hour. Many scenes in that portion of the movie had a strong 2001 vibe to them, with the effects and photography of a modern film. The movie then moved to a more modern approach, all the way to the ending.The horror side of Covenant wasn't as frightening as the original film. In defense for the film, when they reach the 6th film featuring a Xenomorph, it is quite hard to bring some. fresh frightening concepts, hence I personally won't complain about that. This is so far also the most bloody film in the franchise, and that is certain.The crew of the USCSS Covenant was far more enjoyable than that of the Prometheus, especially in the characters of Daniels, Walter and Tennessee. They're not Ripley, but they were enough unarrogant so to allow me to root for them (unlike most of the Prometheus crew members, except for the three pilots, Shaw and David).The outcome of the film is, obviously open, so to leave space for a third film, which can bring some final answers to some questions raised. Despite that, I think the two hours I spent watching Alien: Civenant were definitely well payed back.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, But Not As Good As Prometheus...","In 1979, Ridley Scott revolutionized filmmaking ... by creating and creating a cinematic masterpiece, one of my favorite movies, which many call it, the best science fiction film ever ""Alien"" In 1986, James Cameron, joined the useful to nice and elevated the ""Franchise"" to another level, with another wonderful work ... ""Aliens"" After these 2 films, there were attempts, but they all ran at the most mediocre ... In 2012, Scott returns with Prometheus, a film I personally loved. He divided the fans, some saying it was boring and with many unanswered questions, but the essence of the movie, the suspense, the visuals and especially the tone of the movie, made me love this movie. In spite of everything it had good reviews. 5 years later, Scott returns with ""Alien: Covenant"" which is a sequel to ""Prometheus"" There's a lot you can say about this movie ... Starting: Is it better than Prometheus? In my opinion, no Answer the fundamental questions of Prometheus? No Which brings me to the negative part of the movie. Sometimes Scott does not know what he wants to do with the movie ... A sequel to Prometheus? An Alien? Ha elements of 2, but undoubtedly is an ""Alien"" The film has an excellent visual part; in that, I shoot Scott's hat, impressive ... from the most terrifying scenes, to the most pure and beautiful. Speaking of the continuation of Prometheus, I wish, of course, that it had been better explored, there are lots of unanswered questions that Scott might not even want to answer since the fans asked for ""Xenomorphs"" I'll speak now, of the ""Xenomorphs"" the mythical creature of the Alien. The Best Part of this movie is clearly the ""Alien"" part. It's Bloody, it's creepy, it's ghastly, and it's been meticulously crafted and performed by Ridley Scott who remains a master of Terror / Sci-fi. There are scenes that make a jaw drop from how extreme, horrible, and genial they are. As an ""Alien"" movie, the film is what it wants to be, and it succeeds in doing that. As a sequel to ""Prometheus"" leaves much to be desired and this is really my problem with the movie in general, because a Prometheus fan, does not come out with the questions answered ... to compensate has the component ""Alien"" In general, and in short, the movie is good. Not very good. It's good, it's an entry into the legendary franchise of Ridley Scott, it's visually brilliant, with a wonderful cast, highlighting Michael Fassbender, who was absolutely fantastic with jaw-dropping scenes, with bloody, extreme scenes that honor the Name ""Alien"". It did not satisfy all my needs, as a sequel, it's mediocre, as an isolated ""Alien"" movie is pretty good, and I'm curious how Scott will be able to link all the movies and finally take us to the ""Nostromo"" ship, Time will tell, and here I will be to the next chapter that will leave in 4/5 years and that can finally give the answers, I also highlight the masterful work of Scott, with scenes that neither Tarantino passed through the head. Damn, that was bloody ... and gory ... 7.5 / 10 - Good",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Is a very helpful film, but the saga deserves a new direction or simply end.","5 years after Prometheus, he finally gains his continuation, Alien: Covenant with Ridley Scott once more in the direction, and after a long time the Hype was great, and after leaving the session I was disappointed? No, the movie was what I expected, cool, but unfortunately the saga has to end, in my opinion the film should only have 1 more film and close the cycle, Alien: Covenant explains a lot of things, I was liking the movie, But I found the 3 problematic act, especially Plot Twist of the film, when we know the origin of the Xenomorph, which in the case are the highlights of the film, the participations have always been good, I found the look excellent, the film has the disgusting parts, and the Cast is competent, but unfortunately the movie makes a mistake that I was afraid, they want to create a new Ripley, and this is a mistake, and worse is to know that this is the error of the creator of the universe of Ridley Scott movies, special effects are Beautiful, and the soundtrack matches the tone of the movie, and the first act of the movie is very slow and tiring, but better in Act 2, and the 3 act had everything to be good, but it's ruined by the end of it in my Opinion, I found Plot Twist's film very weak.

"Yes its a 2017 franchise, but there's narrative art in it","I'm going to spend some time on my thoughts on this movie.First of all, This is a movie from 2017 and its part of a franchise. You have live with it. Most of the people going to cinema are watching an alien movie for the first time, they were not even born when the first one was played. So as a filmmaker you need to give them the formula that work 2 decades ago: Action, blood and gore terror, and everything has to be faster a lot faster. This is the no- patience generation.So that's the price to pay, and there is no way around.But in return R.Scott gives more of a fascinating story. The setting and the atmosphere is fantastic. And in my opinion, the twist that brings the story of Pinocchio and doctor Frankenstein together is brilliant.Yes the rest of the movie is superfluous, fast food for teenagers, but despite that, some scenes are gold, pure gold, and cannot be ignored.I'm Sorry for those fans that couldn't see it this way. But again this is modern commercial cinema, and alien its not the first undergoing this changes: Star Wars, Star trek,......",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid but cliche,"After the failure of Alien 3 and Resurrection, Sir Ridley Scott took back the project and started anew with prequels. That being said, both Prometheus and Covenant at least were consistent to the style and genre of Scott's original Alien.Prometheus absolutely blew me away, not just from the beautiful visuals but the deep underlying theme. The movie had many religious allegories and deeper meaning that unfortunately escaped most of the audience. That is probably why Scott decided not to have any of that in Covenant, leaving it as just a mindless cliche sci-fi horror. It is exactly what you see on the surface.It has its moments, created some new pre-alien and tells us how the alien came to be. However, that aside, the story is cliche, predictable, and the action scenes some what lackluster. And to top it off, as many have mentioned, one insufferable selfish and incompetent crew.Not really top of the line, but it gets its job done and there's not really anything that bothers me like Alien 3 or Resurrection. A 6 would be a justifiable score.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A return to form for the Alien franchise,"This is what Alien fans wanted Prometheus to be and I mean that in a great way. Alien: Covenant puts the franchise on track for some great future films, Scott's vision is felt in every scene, and it is wonderful, albeit horrific, for the poor unfortunate souls who exist within it.This is truly an Alien film that appropriately tethers itself to what ground work was laid in Prometheus. It's got Ridley Scott visual style all over it, as it should, and its score, by Jed Kurzel, is beautiful and haunting in what feelings it elicits. From the moment I saw the classic Alien title stylings accompanied by that aforementioned score, I had a feeling this would be a good one.As the story unfolds and what is truly going on is discovered or, more accurately, revealed to the ill-fated crew of the Covenant, it began to evoke Frankenstein (Shelley herself actually gets name dropped), but even more so, The Island of Dr. Moreau. As things become clearer, things become only all the more difficult for the colonization crew. The story here is incredibly well put together and is twistedly clear on just what is going on come the third act.The crew itself is well cast with there not being a single weak link in the bunch. A quick cameo from James Franco was nice and Danny McBride takes a wonderful dramatic turn as an actor. He does get to be the source of a couple of well placed, but not out of place jokes that provide some wonderful bits of humor, but his acting definitely impressed me especially when things get truly tense toward the end. Billy Crudup and Demian Bichir, Watchmen and The Hateful Eight alum respectively, are excellent in their supplementary roles. The unsurprising star here and spiritual successor to Ellen Ripley is Katherine Waterston. I began to plot out her character's path throughout the film simply given how the crew itself worked, however, the great thing about this film in terms of being a horror/thriller was that it was difficult to see who was next a lot of the time and it wasn't afraid to kill off multiple characters at one time. As the audience, I had a pretty good idea of who would remain come the end, but getting there wasn't as easily foreseeable. Michael Fassbender as the androids David and Walter was fun to watch and his journey in the film is spectacularThis film is a great example as one with layers that one could choose to examine for deeper meaning or overlook in favor of taking its surface as a great popcorn horror/thriller flick. Given the interactions that Fassbender's character has, multiple meanings for the title beyond that of the ship itself emerge. I'm being purposefully vague as not to spoil anything, but the underlying philosophies and a small study of a covenant between creator and creation does exist. I myself can only take it so far as I've only seen the film once, but I wouldn't be surprised to find even more on a future viewing.And I will certainly revisit this one. Alien: Covenant delivered for me in a big way. It had action, suspense, was gross as hell, and while there wasn't a great deal of ""horror,"" the story it told was wonderfully self-contained such that a newcomer to the franchise could watch it alongside a veteran and understand what was going on. That being said, you'll appreciate a great deal more if you're a fan. This is a big bridge for the franchise as, one can gather from the trailers alone, the true Xenomorph comes to form in this film. I'm not sure what route the franchise takes next, but I am very optimistic.Also, I couldn't help, but come up with an, admittedly lengthy, alternate title while watching: Alien: An Origin of Species. It could have easily been something akin to this and been very much appropriate.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Caught me off guard by just how good it was,"I only recently got around to seeing 'Prometheus' and quite enjoyed it, without really loving it. Though for me to get any enjoyment out of a sci-fi film (my least favourite genre) is rare. So the fact that I had an enormously good time with 'Alien: Covenant' says a lot. This film was a lot of fun from start to finish.Firstly, the action really steps it up this time around. It is plentiful and brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott. The film moves at a break-neck speed and you've barely settled down from one action sequence before the next one is commencing. Also the aliens look absolutely terrific in this film, as does every CGI feature for that matter.Secondly, the characters are once again masterfully written. Michael Fassbender as 'David/Walter' is nothing short of captivating. The performances he gives as these characters deserve more recognition than I believe they will get. He's undoubtedly the stand-out, but there is not a weak link in the chain in this film.Finally, the overall plot line is quite brilliant. Less convoluted and confusing than 'Prometheus' (I didn't find it overly confusing, but I'm told some did), yet equally (if not more so) smart and intriguing. I love that this film has enough layers to it where not everything is always as it seems. In an action/horror movie those kind of elements can sometimes be put on the back burner, but not here.I would have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It took me quite off guard with just how affecting it was able to be. The two hour run time absolutely flies by and the credits are rolling before you know it. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, make sure you get out and see this film. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
From terror to action. From action to science fiction altogether.,"Trying to apologize for Prometheus - Which I do not think is all bad - Ridley Scott returns to the command of Alien to consolidate the film's focus change again, It was already terror, then turned action, today is purely science fiction, ""Alien: Covenant"" Is a film about an artificial artificial intelligence with remnants of megalomania, deification and superiority, I understand the change of focus, I even like it, but the essence is completely lost and the fans' dislike is understandable. If 10 years after the events of Prometheus, a colonizing ship is attracted to the planet LV-223 after receiving a call, upon arriving on the planet, they discover that the sender of the call is not who it says it is. The script is less creative than prometheus, it follows a common structure of the whole franchise, and even touches on legal points such as the colonization of planets, or the concept of love machines, sense of duty, an analogy to creation not always be Something divine, and therefore the creation to be corrupted, and even a search for indenity and concepts of love related to birth and creation, but all these points are played in an extremely vague way, they are only brushstrokes that are quickly exchanged for action scenes . Technically, the film pleases, although it has been promised to be much more ""8-passenger"" than ""Prometheus"", stayed on the promise, the production designer is very clean, and even in night scenes, everything is very beautiful, although not Extremely detailed and perfect, the direction of art is competent, using a photo with light tones, few open angles, good visual effects, a great mix and sound editing, and a well-paced rhythm, something that draws much attention in the film It's a soundtrack, full of sound design, it does not contain suspense songs, but it contains a lot of erudite music, and when it plays Wagner is creepy, not only for the music, but for the whole context. In terms of acting the great thing is due to Michael Fassbender, who plays two roles, incredible though it may seem, even though they are two androids, are very different from each other, interpreting Walter, an android with a great sense of duty and no evil Who begins to question the concept of love, and David, an android already with more human traits, and a carrier of malice, confused feelings and megalomania, David tries to create a species to try to feel the love of his creation, Fassbender is very well interpreting The two roles, the same manages to make a robotic performance in one and more human in the other, he takes the beans from his character, and impresses, but unfortunately Fassbender is the only highlight in terms of acting here, Carmen Ejogo even has a load Dramatic but very cool, but can not have grandeur in the action scenes. Finally ""Alien: Covenant"", it is ""8 passenger"" only in the argument, because the rest is ""Prometheus"", the Alien in itself little appear is a problem here, even though even appeared even less in the ""8 passenger"", at least There he was the focus of the film, not here, we have butchers who give little fear and who are completely background for the story, besides some holes of scripts, and some things that have bothered me, such as the closing of the Film, where at the end is a report explaining what we have just seen and leaving a ganje that everyone has realized, if the film had finished a minute before would be the best closed of the franchise ""Alien"", but still it is a movie Cool, and is a shrewd complement to this franchise that is so loved and important pop culture.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage for the dummy millennial generation who don't read books,"If you don't have basic secondary school education and you are illiterate, then you will enjoy this crap.Ridley Scott is insulting the audience and I totally support that this is one film nobody should pay to watch.Ridley Scott is awanker",,Anonymous,Horror
Fairly Enjoyable,"I'm kind of surprised at some of the harsh negative reviews here. Alien: Covenant isn't great, but it's certainly not terrible. Then again, I guess my opinion of the movie is related to my expectations for it. I'll admit, I never had enough invested in the franchise to be seriously disappointed by the shortcomings of a new installment. I like the first Alien. I think Aliens is a bit overpraised. It's okay, but I found the marines to be kind of annoying, since they don't act anything like you'd expect real soldiers to act like, and the corporate villain was just too silly. And I thought Prometheus was kind of interesting. I haven't seen 3, Resurrection, or the two AVP movies.Anyway, Covenant, which I thought was more fun than Prometheus, is flawed, but once the characters start exploring a new planet without any special suits or anything you know what you're in for. The action starts quickly, and when it does it doesn't stop until the end. Even during the slower sequences, there's quite a bit of tension.The actors are fine in their roles. None of the characters are particularly memorable, but that's fine. Just the situation they're in makes me sympathize with them.I liked the score, too, especially the use of Jerry Goldsmith's music for the first movie.One criticism I have is that the planet, while well shot, looks boring. I kind of wished it looked more, umm, alien. Also, the philosophical aspect of the movie felt kind of forced. There's this one character who says he's religious, but this isn't explored at all. And I think films need to earn quotes from Milton and the Romantic poets, which this one really doesn't.I won't get into all the plot holes, bad decisions made by the characters, and things that just don't make sense, since other people have gone over these. They're there all right, I just didn't mind them that much.I can understand why some more dedicated fans of the Alien series might not like Covenant, but as a more casual viewer I enjoyed it. I'll keep going to the theaters to watch these, too, because of the dearth of high-budget, sci-fi blockbusters that don't involve superheroes - not that I consider superhero movies to be sci-fi anyway (and people do remember they're for elementary school kids, right?).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Return to Space Horror!,"Alien: Covenant returns to its roots in horror. In 1979, Ridley Scott convinced audiences around the world that ""in space, no one can hear you scream."" And the newest film in the line of prequels leading up to the terrifying events aboard the Nostromo, attempts to make up for the rejection of 2012's Prometheus as a true prequel to Alien. Fortunately for fans of the franchise, Alien: Covenant is mostly successful at delivering what audiences loved about the original and missed in the subsequent Cameron movies--the trademark horror of the xenomorph and facegrabbers. Starting off like Prometheus and finishing more like the original Alien, the newest film in the nearly 40-year- old franchise will have you screaming, cringing, and completely immersed in blood-curdling terror. That is, until you realize that only some questions from Prometheus answered, and all new questions about events in this movie are now generated and left unanswered. That appears to be Ridley Scott's Achilles heal: always leaving more questions unanswered than providing closure or exposition, thus prohibiting the movie from being as great as it certainly had the potential to be. With one more film between this current installment and 1979's Alien, perhaps there will be far fewer unanswered questions and provide the history for which fans are looking.One of the first technical elements that fans of Alien will notice is the opening title sequence. It is reminiscent of the manner in which the opening credits and title of the original were revealed in the emptiness of space on screen. I appreciated this homage to the original because it set me up to prepare for an Alien movie and not a second Prometheus. Perhaps that does not seem important to non-fans; but to make a long story short, while Scott was in the conceptual phase of a sequel to Prometheus (prequel to Alien), he was told by the studio that audiences didn't want another Prometheus--they wanted Ridley Scott's Alien. And now the rest is history. In order to best understand the flaws of Alien: Covenant it's necessary to understand the similar flaws of Prometheus. One of the many diegetic and technical problems with Prometheus was the fact that there was little direct connection to Alien and it felt like a whole new franchise and not an extension of the original. This lack of connection is best represented by the number of unanswered questions dwarfing the answered ones. Essentially, audiences only learned about David's origin and, to a lesser extent, why that particular planet. But enough about Prometheus, we are here to talk Alien: Covenant.Although vastly improved, Covenant also leaves audiences with many unanswered questions; albeit, it is successful at making up for many of the diegetic flaws of the preceding film. To get into the questions would reveal too much about the film and perhaps hint at some spoilers, so I won't go into specifics. But enough about the flaws of this otherwise exciting and well-produced film-- just know that the writing is weak but hopefully will be better in the next installment. The most impressive elements of the movie are related to the cinematography, editing, and visual effects. From the sweeping landscape shots to intimate closeups of the xenomorph and its victims, Covenant is absolutely visually stunning. There is even a mild romantic encounter between David and a member of the Covenant crew that was shot incredibly well and strategically placed in the narrative. Where the story is weak, Scott makes up for in creating an impressive cinematic experience for long-time and new fans alike. There are even shot sequences that are taken directly out of Alien. Often times, I am extremely critical of computer-generated effects and characters versus practical effects and animatronics--and for good reason--nothing can replace the way real light bounces off real objects and is really captured by the glass lenses on a camera. Furthermore, it's rare that a character react in genuine fear to an object, villain, or murderous alien that is not really present on set. However, the combination of CGI and practical effects in Covenant is breathtaking and convincingly real. You will almost feel the facegragger latching onto you and the xenomorph's wet acid-breath on your skin.Aside from the answered questions still residing in the minds of those who have seen the film, Covenant fails to live up to Alien in another rather conspicuous way. For everything that this film did right and make up for in Prometheus, it lacked any memorable crew member--more specifically--this film differs from Alien by not developing Dani(els) to be the strong female character that she had the potential to be. Dani could have been Covenant's answer to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Alien. One of the the diegetic elements that is most talked about and is often the topic of horror film humanities classes is the breaking of gender roles and heteronormative expectations by Ripley in Alien. Perhaps that is why Alien is almost avant-garde in the cinematic experience whereas Covenant is impressive but does not typify the art of cinematic storytelling nor contributes to groundbreaking character-types. Beyond strong female lead, the film simply fails to leave the audience with any one memorable character period. No one will be talking about any one particular character years from now. Both the unanswered questions and the lack of memorable signifiant characters can be traced by to one root cause: flawed writing.If you loved the original Alien, then you will mostly enjoy Alien: Covenant. The experience is equally terrifying as it is beautiful. Whether you have seen Prometheus or not will not affect your enjoyment factor in this film. If you have seen Prometheus, then I would suggest watching the Ridley Scott short film The Crossing because it ties Prometheus to Alien: Covenant. Think of it as an extended prologue. This short film helps audiences to make the connection between the two films in hopes that it does answer some otherwise unexplained circumstances and events.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Covenant Review,"Here we are with the second installment in Ridley Scott's new Alien Trilogy. Alien: Covenant was just as good as Prometheus and then some. Find out what made it better.Synopsis: The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape. Starring: Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterson, Danny McBride Director: Ridley ScottI have said it before and I will say it till the day that one better comes out (which probably won't happen), Ridley Scott is the only man who should make Alien movies. Yeah, that's right, I think Alien is better than Aliens. And it is. But that's not why I like this one better than Ridley's last one.The reason I like this one better is because of Danny McBride. A few months ago I posted on my Facebook that I figured he was going to be the lone survivor. Well, I was wrong. But he was the best part of the movie. It wasn't a comedic role for him; he was all seriousness. It was completely different than any role he has played so far, and it worked here. Can't wait to see what he does with Halloween.I'm not saying he was the only good thing about the movie. Bringing back the original Xenomorph in the way it was worked great. Then there was the second prototype Xenomorph, it was a bit different than the one from Prometheus, and it was better. The way the story was set up did take a bit to get to into, but the wait was worth it.There were some downfalls though. The twist towards the end of the movie was not well hidden. You could see it coming when it happened. With that adding onto how long it took to get to the main problem, those are two of the minor reasons I gave it a lower rating.The main reason you ask. There was something that has never happened in an Alien movie, even though they hinted at it in most of the movies. But, there never showed nudity. No, I am not including the Predator movies in this scenario. Some things should never happen.Final Thoughts: Watch this movie. Even if you're not a fan of the Alien movies, watch this movie. Even if you disagree with me on which one is better out of the original two, watch this movie. It is the third best in the series, by the way.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stop complain,"I really don't understand why people complain about this movie. ""Where's the plot?! Where's originality!"" People complain that the movie has no climate of the older ""Alien"". But what does it mean? Let's be honest. Every Alien movie repeat the same story: bunch of people (idiots mostly) need to fight xenomorph, they're dying and that is all, no deeper meaning. They were just action movie (Finch's part was quite different, but point of killing Alien was the same). Ridley Scott presents new story between ""Prometheus"" and first ""Alien"" and he's doing really good job! Movie is dark, brutal and beautiful, there is no accidental shots (Dariusz Wolski). Yeah, we've seen many thing before, but in ""Covenant"" they are breathtaking. I enjoyed the movie and enjoyed how story from ""Prometheus"" was pushed. I hope that unfair reviews wont stop Mr. Scott from doing another ""Alien"" movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Alien: Covenant"" may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror.","Fans of the ""Fast & Furious"" and ""Star Wars"" franchises know that the release dates of those movies don't follow the same chronological order as the events portrayed (and there are short films and features in between) but those timelines have nothing on the ""Alien"" franchise. It all started simply enough: ""Alien"", a relatively low budget sci-fi horror flick released in 1979, thrilled, scared and shocked Movie Fans, while adding to the cultural consciousness the indelible image of a vicious, reptilian-like creature busting out of the chest of its human host, while also making Sigourney Weaver a household name as she played the iconic alien fighter Ellen Ripley in four of the movies. A new feature film from the ""Alien"" universe appeared every 5-7 years (not counting the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies), leading up to 2017's ""Alien: Covenant"" (R, 2:02), which, in some ways, returns the franchise to its storied roots.After the ""Alien"" sequels, ""Aliens"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" (each of the four with a different director), original helmer Ridley Scott returned to the franchise for a prequel series. 2012's ""Prometheus"" began exploring the question of how the Aliens originated. That was an excellent film, but was more ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" than ""Aliens"", for example, and it did a great job of setting up the films to come. From 2012-2017, ten(!) short films came out to fill gaps in the Alien story, with two of them leading straight into ""Alien: Covenant"". A small amount of footage from those two films (known collectively as ""Alien: Covenant ‚Äì Prologue"") are used in the 2017 feature and in its theatrical trailers. In the ""Alien"" universe, this film is a sequel to ""Prometheus"" and leads fans closer to the events of the original film. In ""Star Wars"" terms, it's the equivalent of ""Episode II - Attack of the Clones"", but better.Taking place ten years after the events in ""Prometheus"", this film follows a colony ship, called the Covenant, heading toward the other side of the galaxy. On board are 2,000 colonists in a deep stasis, 1,000 human embryos, a dozen crew members and a synthetic android named Walter (Michael Fassbender), an advanced version of the synthetic known as David in the previous film. On their way to a planet called Origae-6, the ship is hit by shockwave, causing significant damage and leading Walter to awaken the crew. In the process, the captain (James Franco) dies and first officer Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) assumes command of the Covenant. As the crew is coming to terms with what has happened and working to repair the ship, they receive a radio transmission that appears to be human in origin. The planet that is the source of the transmission appears to be an even more hospitable spot for their new colony, so rather than wait another seven years to arrive at Origae-6, Oram decides to check it out.As the Covenant, piloted by the cowboy hat-wearing Tennessee (Danny McBride) orbits this new planet, most of the crew takes a lander down to the planet's surface. The expedition consists of acting captain Oram, his wife, biologist Karen Oram (Carmen Ejogo), a terraforming expert named Daniels (Katherine Waterston), security head Sergeant Lope (Demi√°n Bichir), members of his team and a couple others. While exploring the area around their landing site and beginning to evaluate the planet for possible human habitation, their discoveries range from odd to shocking to deadly. There are signs of human cultivation of what appears to be wheat, but at the same time there are no signs of animals or birds. The expedition finds the crashed ship Prometheus, along with the fully functioning David, who says that Elizabeth Shaw (the sole human survivor of the doomed ship) repaired the injuries he sustained on that earlier mission. Something else that the crew of the Covenant finds are alien spores which, if they enter a human host, result in the birth of vicious creatures which are very new to the unfortunate souls of the Covenant ‚Äì and will also be somewhat new to Movie Fans. Thus begins a desperate struggle for survival.""Alien: Covenant"" is a worthy and exciting addition to the ""Alien"" franchise. Making this set of deep space travelers colonists who all have significant others on the ship raises the emotional stakes for the characters and for the audience. The interactions between the twin synthetic androids from different generations makes for a fascinating subplot, partly because of the acting prowess of Fassbender, who, along with the rest of the cast contribute to a talented ensemble who all deliver excellent performances. The story effectively builds on ""Prometheus"" and towards ""Alien"" with a flare that ups the franchise ante on horror and gore, while the wicked twists wonderfully tease a sequel. This film, however, can't really be said to be very ""original"". Besides the intended connections to ""Prometheus"" and the ""Alien"" movies, it's also a bit of 2016's ""Passengers"" meets 1991's ""Terminator 2"". ""Alien: Covenant"" may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"I've never had the chance to watch any of the Alien movies before, and to be honest, the whole spaceship concept never really appealed to me. I'm more into traditional horror, and while I have Disney Plus and have seen nearly all the horror , I wasn't sure about this one. But I decided to take a risk and check out Alien: Covenant.Surprisingly, I was really drawn in by how well the movie built a tense and eerie atmosphere. The scenes were intense, and I found myself completely absorbed, which I wasn't expecting at all for a sci-fi horror film. For my first Alien movie, I really enjoyed it!However, I have to say, the last 20 minutes were a letdown. Everything felt way too predictable, and the surprise factor was totally gone. It kind of soured the experience for me, but overall, the rest of the film was a pleasant surprise.""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ridley Scott's Bruh Moment,"It hurts me to write such a poor review for a Ridley Scott movie, let alone an alien movie, but this was not good. I went to see this in theaters with my little brother (as is custom with all alien/predator movies) back in 2017, and just finished watching it again recently on Hulu. Scott creates a dark and atmospheric universe from the start. From bleak to beautiful we get some pretty great space/planetary shots. Good CGI, amazing practical effects/alien, and a great performance (or two). Michael Fassbender gives us an incredible performance but what does it mean when his character is the most villainous, sinister, and unlikeable person ever? Few fictional characters have pissed me off more than his captivating ""David"". Katherine Waterston is the only character opposite Fassbender that brings any life to this movie, and she is arguably the least memorable heroin of any of the alien films. Disappointing considering guys like Crudup, Smollet, and McBride were all present as well. Ridley Scott is the man and a genius in terms of sci fi filmmaking, but this was a total miss for me. The writing/characterization for these characters is idiotic and rage inducing from the very start. As mentioned earlier, few characters and casts have pissed me off as much as the ones found in this movie. If he ever makes a 3rd film, I pray we get something along the lines of Prometheus. These moves just feel like the David Chronicles at this point.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a Good Film by Itself,"This latest edition to the Alien franchise takes a different approach to storytelling, which is perhaps why people don't like it or find it confusing.Yes, I felt a little confused after some of the plot twists, but the overall story is easy to follow: a group of space travelers visit a planet and get caught up in something bigger and more dangerous.The crew actually reminded me of the original Alien crew ‚Äì there was banter, camaraderie and genuine relationships.The people aren't military mercenaries and there are no familiar cat-and-mouse alien/human hunt scenes, so this will disappoint people who like cheap thrills and gory horror.However, I think that this offers a fresh approach to the same old face-to-face scenes that have been overused in previous Alien films.This movie does focus on the androids and it does detract from the overall story and development of the human characters, but it's still enjoyable and I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,Horror
I liked this one,"I am a fan of Alien and I do like Prometheus, this actually does a great job of linking the films better together in my opinion.

Not nearly as good as Prometheus,"The characters in this film make SO MANY stupid, irrational and unrealistic decisions that it's not even funny. Sometimes you can excuse things like that, since if every character in every movie acted 'normally and rationally' then all movies would be significantly shorter in length than what they would otherwise have been... but it just happens a lot in this movie and it honestly creates a bunch of plot-holes and contribute to poor writing and a poor plot.I liked Prometheus (I give it an 8/10), but the pacing and story of this movie is just so wrong that it's not enjoyable (apart from the plot-holes in this one).*Spoiler ahead if you haven't watched Prometheus yet:* In Prometheus, at the end, the robot's head is ripped clean off his body, yet in this movie, the one robot gets injured in the neck area, and then he completely shuts down... Now that makes zero sense, since we already know that these robots can survive with JUST their head... so why the robot shutdown if he just received an injury to the neck? That's a pretty big plot-hole in this movie.Overall, this movie could have been very good and maybe even as good as Prometheus, but the idiotic choices made by the characters and the plot-holes, just make this movie bad and not really worth watching even.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
No need to alienate yourself from this one,"Director Ridley Scott is no stranger to the ""Alien"" series, as the original director of ""Alien"". So, one would think Covenant would be a familiar and exciting ride into outer space. Familiar it is, outstanding it's not. Following the ""it thing"" in movies and TV, Michael Fassbender does a nice job as both Walter (the good) and David (the bad) robots who work along side a rather inept crew (Katherine Waterston ""Inherent Vice,"". Billy Crudup ""Jackie,"" Danny McBride ""TV's Vice Principals,"" Demian Bichir ""Weeds,"" and Carmen Ejogo "" Selma"" to name a few) charged with colonizing another plant with embryos. While exploring an unexplored land on the way to their mission, the Alien's birth and the excitement finally starts rolling. Lucky for that, because the first several minutes of Walter's dialogue with his father (Guy Pearce) is time consuming and unnecessary for the storyline, as is the cameo appearance of James Franco (Branson), the husband of one of the crew members. The good thing about this film is that, even if you ""been there, done that,"" the film's outer limits cinematography and those pesky Aliens at least sustain one's interested. No need to alienate yourself from this one. The film is at least familiar and interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
HIGHLY Recommend Viewing Yourself & Giving Little Credit to Over Abundance of Pretentious Negative IMDb Reviews,"At what point can Sci-Fi fans forget their ego for 2 hours and just enjoy a movie? (if Sci-Fi fans are actually the ones writing novella length intricately detailed critiques of every scene, sub-plot, camera angle, facial expression, etc. etc. etc.)This is my first IMDb review because I'm incredibly surprised at the overwhelming amount of reviews for Covenant that unfortunately have the pretentious theme of ""I'm too smart to find this story line interesting"". I'm beginning to lose faith in the overall usefulness of IMDb user reviews. Do they know what ""Fi"" in Sci-Fi means?I'll admit, Alien: Covenant is by no means wrought with Oscar-worthy performances, so those looking for such a film would best be served elsewhere. For anyone who grew up loving the Sci-Fi horror genre, and Xenomorphs from the Alien films especially, you WILL thoroughly enjoy Covenant!Despite the endless harsh and intricately detailed criticisms from many IMDb reviewers, this film is a great installment in the Alien franchise. The IMDb reviews for for Covenant have me wondering if those who claim to have an appreciation for Sci-Fi horror films (Alien fans especially) have lost their ability to suspend disbelief for 2hrs, which one would think is basically a given when it applies to a genre labeled Science FICTION! If you don't like a Sci-Fi film because you find the character/story situations or sub-plots 'unrealistic' or 'unbelievable', do yourself a favor and stick to documentaries and avoid Sci-Fi films all together going forward, as your intellect has obviously stripped you of your ability to enjoy cinematic storytelling in a fantasy genre...Without giving any spoilers, Covenant does answer many questions, and raises several others. However, with a film that's intended to jump start a series of additional follow-ups, I would expect nothing less! I would rank it as the 3rd best film to date in the series behind Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). Better than Prometheus and more in the same vein as the original films.That being said, who cares what I or anyone else thinks?I was apprehensive because of the massive amount of negative IMDb reviews prior to seeing Covenant, and historically I find the overall user IMDb user reactions to films pretty spot on, but I gotta say they're getting it DEAD WRONG with this one!See Covenant for yourself and make up your own mind!8/10 personally, but officially I'm rating it as a 10/10 to offset the negative reviews by brain dead IMDb members who can't get past their unrealistic pseudo-intellectual expectations.btw, with as many ""I'm so personally offended because this movie doesn't rise to an acceptable intellectual level for me"" reviews, don't be surprised if another installment in the Alien franchise is EVER made again, and that's a damn shame.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth the wait.....cant wait for the sequel,"First off, i don't see the reason why this movie is getting so much hate and 6/10 reviews. This is not a 6/10 movie. From start to finish the movie had me hooked. I enjoyed it so much that i have already seen it three times.The story as most people say falls short of their expectations should try to see this as part of the bigger picture with two more movies to come in this saga that will continue the story and answer all the questions (hopefully). When Prometheus came out it left many unanswered questions in the end but now that Covenant is out you can make sense of the story and when you look back on Prometheus, the unanswered questions don't seem so frustrating.People complained that Prometheus was not very Alien which is correct they explored other ideas and with Covenant due to backlash Prometheus got they included the Alien. So Covenant tried to please fans of both Prometheus and Alien and they did a good job.Pros: Engaging story from start to finish. Michael Fassbender and Katherine Waterston stole the show. After the character of Ellen Ripley in the original Alien Katherine Waterston does a very good job in coming close to her and making us love her character the same way we loved Ellen. Cinematography was amazing and the rest of the cast each played their part very well. Danny McBride was a character i loved and surprised me how well he acted in his role.Cons: Movie seems rushed , i am sure there will be a directors cut. Quite a few questions remain unanswered. Some plot holes and unexplained events.Overall don't let the negative reviews deter you, just go watch the movie and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Joyously stupid,"Ridley Scott goes back to basics with ""Alien: Covenant"", his ""loose"" follow up to ""Prometheus"", a film which many fans of the franchise didn't take to kindly to, a film riddled with plot holes, unanswered questions, and characters doing stupid sh*t. Well with this film questions do get answered and the plot holes are in short supply but if you thought the characters in ""Prometheus"" were stupid, oh boy, wait till you see this film. I don't know how Ridley Scott pulled it off but he somehow made the xenomorph unintimidating, the film doesn't offer many scares and rushes into the scares way too quickly, Scott's decision to go with cgi for the majority of the creatures definitely has something to do with both of those points, what made the xenomorphs so scary were the practical effects and the movements of the actor in the suit. With all the problems I had with this film, I can say that it is at least for the most part highly enjoyable because of how joyously stupid it is. Everything with Michael Fassbender is great and he totally pulls off even the most ridiculous sh*t. The ending is¬†awesome!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien Covenant.,I think this film has high aspirations.The plot while not unique does offers some nice twists and turns.

Best Alien movie since Aliens,"I rate the movie 7/10. The 1 to 3 ratings from some reviewers is pure stupidity. Alien Covenant is a good movie although there is also room for some proportional and fair critique.Lets start with the overall story. At first there are some obvious similarities with Alien; crew captures a distress signal, deviates from mission, land on a planet, crew members get infected and brought back to the ship etc., but the transition into the second act with the ship blowing up elevates Covenant into something new and fresh.The second act is clearly the strongest part of the whole film. In it we learn among other things how the eggs in the Xenomorphs life cycle came into existence. This was particularly clever and must be praised. The entire build up for the unfolding of the eggs involves another pre-existing species, only vaguely similar to the final Xenomorph we know. This was a brave decision and apparently not everyone liked this plot twist. I think it fit well into the story though. Not only did it connect to and expanded upon the events that took place in Prometheus but also it was an integral part in the subplot that treat the religious and philosophical questions posed by AI.For everyone, as myself, who has a special interest in these questions it is gratifying that Ridley wanted to discuss them in somewhat more detail than he did in Prometheus. The dialog between the artificials David and Walter both played by an excellent and quite machine like Michael Fassbender in my opinion constitute the most memorable dialog in the film. David, the supposedly more human like of the two, understands the curiosity humans shows for the origins of their creation. He who himself already has met his own, is disappointed. He let David know ""I was not built to serve"".He feels godless and as a life form unable to feel love that specific key of course is missing in the scale in his own creation. His only loyalty is to himself and what the future holds for him. Like a smarter, at least less flamboyant, anti-Christ defying his creator but wanting to be the creator himself, he waltzes away in the ending surrounded by embryos, set out to destroy the inferior humanity. In David, Ridley has created the mother of all bad robots for the future generations.Regarding the CGI, there are some especially memorable, gritty and well-crafted scenes but mention them would create spoilers. There are enough of them to motivate the horror label but I still have the impression that the Xenomorphs were slightly misused. One main ingredient for the suspense factor in Alien and Aliens were confined spaces. This I believe is not entirely lost in Covenant, but could have been used even more. One of the most irritating moments struck at the end of the movie when they followed the creature via monitors! What an exceptionally bad idea, LOL. How suspenseful is that? When Dallas died in the air shaft in Alien they saved the image of the creature until the very last second, that's why the scene was highly effective. The whole ""get rid of it"" sequence in the third and final act unfortunately felt rushed.Visually the movie is flawless, it just amazes me: The ship, the extra ordinary details in the set designs, the mix of real and created landscapes yes even the space suits, are all beautifully designed and put together. The art department involved to create the look and feel of the movie is one talented group of people. Ridley who himself story boards all his movies and in his own right should be considered a skillful conceptual artist also seem to have a special ability for finding the right people to help bring his vision to life. For Alien it was of course Giger himself, art director Roger Christian, concept artists Ron Cobb and Jean Giraud and visual effects ace Brian Johnson. Alien Covenant and Prometheus has seen some strong concept artists such as Dane Hallet, Steve Burg, Evan Shipard and Jeremy Love. Main responsible for the art direction has been Ian Gracie that is perhaps most known for his work on Star Wars movies but his work on Pitch Black deserves a special mention. Production designer Chris Seagers has the master piece Save private Ryan under his belt for which he was nominated.With the names mentioned it's easy to understand why Covenant ended up being nothing less than visually stunning but with that said lets also not forget that Ridley always has the last word in everything and it is his mind that is the final piece of art in all this.So what could have been pretty much perfect were in fact not so. Why? Both Alien and Aliens became classics in no small parts thanks to the strong and memorable characters populating the films: Ripley, Dallas, Parker, Ash, Brett, Kane, Lambert, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, Bishop, Newt, Burke, I remember them all! Already after 15 minutes I knew that the casting and the characters would be the weakest point in this movie. It's sad really but no one will remember Oram, Daniels or Tennessee. There are no Yafet Kottos, no Harry Dean Stantons, no Tom Skerritts, no Michael Biehns, Bill Paxtons or Sigourneys in this one. There is however Michael Fassbender and he, as always, is the antithesis to mediocrity. I sure hope he gets the star billing because his character David/Walter is the only one on par with the immortals from the first two movies. Katherine Waterston was a nice try, but not more than that. Decent enough though to keep the interest up for the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I like it,"Alien: Covenant 15 passengers from a colonization ship have to stop because they received a strange message on a strange planet. When they reach their destination, they can not believe what they find.Let's start with the actors. I'll try not to give them any spoilers. Or at least try it. Let's start with Katherine Waterston, Daniels. It's a weird prospect, who went through most of the movie crying, I'm not saying that Waterson's performance did it wrong made him excellent. But the character I did not like, and talking about this no character I liked. And the stupidest character I've ever seen is a blonde who's Tennessee's wife, for God's very bad and the first to die. Also tendency has this topic, I saw critics about this movie where they said that there is no connection Characters-Spectator. But the characters made for it. And I think it gives points to the movie. Returning to the actors, the only actor who excels, I think you are already imagining, Michael Fassbender as his characters steal the movie.The effects ... the effects are INCREDIBLE !!! Since the Alien is made, even the ship or the transformations of the characters in the same Aliens are beautiful.The end will leave you with your hair on end. You're going to ask, ""Who was this?""

Much Worse Than I Could Ever Have Imagined,"No suspense. No Horror. A permanent stain on the franchise that makes you feel dirty after having watched it.I had pretty much no expectations going into this film. I had avoided much of the marketing material beforehand and knew very little about it other than it being a sequel to Prometheus, which I actually thought was a half decent film and a worthy prequel to Alien.I'm not sure what went wrong with this film, but it is no exaggeration to say it is one of the worst films I've had the misfortune of sitting through. There is not one redeeming scene. The story is disjointed and quite frankly a complete mess. The editing is horrendous, the score completely forgettable and the cinematography is weirdly terrible.Even Michael Fassbender cannot save this awful dirge. The CGI xneomorph will haunt my dreams for quite some time. Not because it's an imposing and scary alien in this film, but because the CGI is some of the worst you'll see from a movie this year.Alien and Alien 2 were as close to cinematic perfection as you're going to get.

A solid film that deals with thought-provoking philosophical ideas,"Alien: Covenant is a film that stays true to form in terms of the general formulaic story line it tends to follow within the Alien franchise. However, this does not detract from a largely more suspenseful and dark film compared to its predecessor, Prometheus. Ridley Scott handles this film with enough precision that the stories and philosophical ideas (however convoluted they may be) are treated well in the context of the over-arching plot. Though the attempts, or rather the execution of these thought-provoking ideas into the film could've been done much better. With some worthwhile action and terrorizing aliens, the blockbuster aspect of the film is done very well. And though the plot does become slightly rushed towards the end and somewhat predictable, it is still a very solid movie and a film definitely worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scott breaks the agreement with Covenant,"2017's ""Alien: Covenent"" directed by Ridley Scott. Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Carmen Ejogo, and Demi√°n Bichir.The 6th standalone Alien movie in the series, ""AC"" takes place in 2104- 15 years after the events of Prometheus. Deep in space, we meet some of the crew on the Covenant ship, carrying thousands of colonizers deep in cryogenic sleep. They are watched over by the android, Walter (Fassbender). The ship experiences technical difficulties, some of the pods malfunction, and they lose their captain. Thrust into a replacement role, Crudup is forced to take command. With the original captain and others being mourned, morale is low. A signal of some kind is found from a nearby planet, and the combination of ease combined with dismay over the prospect of having to go back to their pods for more cryosleep until getting to the original destination planet, causes them to send a party to the nearby planet for exploration. The crew touches down, and quickly finds an environment accepting of their host bodies. We also reconnect with David (Fassbender, again), the android from Prometheus, who has been mysteriously busy over the last decade and a half.""AC"" initially returns to the clinical idealized perfection of 2012's ""Prometheus"" as we are shown the initial birth of David, who calls himself this after viewing Michelangelo's classic statue. But when on the integral planet, in his own turf, we see a much more Gothic and uneven decorative touch from the self anointed creator. Closer in tone to ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" than ""Alien"", (for better or worse) Fassbender's double duty is the star of the show. His character(s)' questions alluding to creation, the point of life, and which gods are worth serving propel the franchise into territory not previously seen before. The Alien movies are no longer about the alien franchise as we know it, with ""AC"" repeating ""Prometheus""' patterns of changing the way the aliens hatch/spawn, impregnate, mature, and look, with the gestation process now resembling something akin to instant coffee. Instead, they're about the nightmare of artificial intelligence, and how humans have been surpassed in the evolutionary food chain, a different kind of alien. With all due respect to Waterston and McBride's capable heroes, Alien movies are no longer about humans either, with the days of having a kick ass protagonist like Weaver gone, as well as an interesting crew worth getting to know. Even if I'm wrong, the characters here suffer from the same issues as in Prometheus, with them doing such stupid things that it's tough not to root for the alien protomorphs regardless. Interesting in it's idea and originality, but flawed and unemotional in concept, ""AC"" is the chilly explanation to why Scott chose not to make the sequel to Blade Runner- these Alien prequels ARE the sequel(s). There is most definitely a broken covenant here, and in it's bloody corpse lies the cavity of a different kind of creation.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie for the Prometheus fans,"Let me start off by saying I am not at all a fan of the Alien movies. I am very interested in the Sci Fi genre, but more into the philosophical movies instead of silly action flicks where human soldiers use fire-arms to fight off extraterrestrials who were intelligent enough and had the technique to visit our planet Earth. I must say I really loved Prometheus because it has a deep philosophical message about the big questions: Where do we come from and who or what created us? Alien Covenant continues where Prometheus ended, and in the first scene this same question comes up. I think it is a very intelligent movie, well written and acted and it is packed with action. It answers many questions about the other Alien movies and Prometheus. Just give it a try and be open minded. I thought it was totally awesome and I don't understand the hate at all, except for the fact that it might go to deep for people who are not into the ancient-astronaut idea.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
worth the $ but could have been better,I was super excited to see this and it only partially lived up to expectations. I felt the cast was awkward and the story seemed to go all over the place. I loved Fassbender as both Walter and David (interesting to see him play too different personalities in the same frame). The visuals and special effects were great but there was little build up to the actual Aliens... Something that was always good about the previous films.

You should watch it,"Loved it: But I have no history of previous Alien filmsThis Movie was an incredibly interesting philosophy of what it means to create. What it means to be a god.

It is of reasonable length with strong action sequences, and twisted vibe that you would expect from a movie of its genre.

Not for the uneducated viewer,"Yet again an attempt at a sci-fi/horror film that tries to inject intelligence into the genre and promote intellectual discourse and introspection is wasted on the teeming masses that only want to be spoon fed one liners, hollow virally marketed cash grabs (Yes I'm pointing a finger squarely at all of Disney's plot less, soulless, woefully tired attempts at Marvel, Star Wars, and even their own animated features), and CGI cookie cutter drivel for children.Did I enjoy this film? That should be obvious. I enjoyed Prometheus as well. Why would I enjoy films that are ""slaughtering the legacy of the original"" as so many reviewers are spouting in so many inarticulate ways? Perhaps it's because poetry, classic literature, and philosophy are interesting subjects to me. Perhaps it's because I don't let myself drown in the nostalgia puddle that keeps Michael Bay employed.Alien: Covenant, much like Prometheus is a film for a mind that enjoys being engaged. If you want to be awed by gorgeous cinematography, deep and thoughtful writing that requires you to have some understanding of the classics, or at bare minimum creates the urge in you to explore the referenced materials, then you may be the audience for this film. Scott and company are trying to give a deeper meaning to his beloved classic. This alone is laudable in a time where studios are dumbing down material to please a general public with below average intelligence and even smaller attention spans.If you hated the film and just want the sweet member berries to soothe your soul and dull your mind there is always the next Star Wars to look forward to.

"Disappointing as a follow-up to Prometheus, but a good alien movie on its own","I adore Prometheus and had been looking forward to a sequel. Covenant lacks Prometheus' grandiose ambiance, mood and atmosphere and many intriguing questions regarding the motivations of the Engineers left unanswered in Prometheus are ignored in Covenant, so I was disappointed in these regards. And yet, seen on its own terms, Covenant is quite satisfying as a space-monster(s)-on-the-loose movie. It's pretty violent and gory. Yes, it recycles elements from Alien especially, but does not do it in a lackluster manner.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing,"""Alien: Covenant"" earns its 7/10 rating with a suspenseful return to the iconic sci-fi horror franchise. The film boasts strong performances, particularly from Michael Fassbender in a dual role, adding depth to its characters. While the pacing may have room for improvement, the film excels in its unrelenting tension and visceral thrills. The eerie and atmospheric music, along with the breathtaking cinematography, transports audiences to the hauntingly beautiful yet perilous alien world. ""Alien: Covenant"" offers a chilling message about humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge and the consequences it may face, aligning well with your appreciation for the film. Overall, it's a worthy addition to the franchise that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
U kno where the movie is heading when u see space engineers walking into an unknown planet without hazmat suits....,"This movie borrowed elements from Pandorum.I saw this recently for the first time n got disappointed.If this is the way Ridley Scott is trying to connect Prometheus n Covenant with the 1979 Alien, then its heading for a disaster.Scott made a mess of Prometheus by introducing ""Engineers"" and black liquid but in Covenant, he doubled up the mess by showing A. I. creating aggressive n violent life forms.Another worst thing is the predictable ending.Generous with a 4 cos its visually appealing n once again Fassbender gave a memorable performance.In fact, the partial nudity of the hottie Callie Hernandez eased my angerThe film has another hottie Tess Haubrich, whose character gets the goriest death shot via quick cut annoying editing.The borrowed elements:In Pandorum, Gallo created a ""new world"" in a wild and primitive state where ""life eats life"". He created the mutants on purpose.In Covenant, A. I. played by Fassbender created aggressive life forms.In Pandorum, 60,000 passengers plus crew members board an interstellar ark, the Elysium, headed for an another planet to colonize it. Because of the length of the trip, the passengers were all placed in extended hypersleep.In Covenant, the ship Covenant is headed for a planet Origae-6, with 2,000 colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos in cold storage.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ridley Scott. Retire yourself please,"why don't retire now? do you think you deserve to be doing such a ridiculous thing? and still keep on working. do you think you do not have enough money? I think James Cameron is much better than you. do you have problems with alcohol? I think that if you are not man enough you shouldn't make a film with so much promises and so ridiculous argument. If money is the problem please phone James Cameron and he will lend you some. Anyway is obvious that you are an obsolete man, please let younger people do the work because I don't think you are able anymore.

Only if you love the whole Alien mythology like me.,"With Prometheus, Ridley Scott is exploring and explaining Alien. While this is a commendable idea, the exercise remains wholly unnecessary. But hey! Who am I to disagree with Ridley Scott?
Prequels are rarely justified and they tend to fail as much as sequels.
I was clearly in the minority when declaring that I REALLY loved Prometheus and I still wonder what was so difficult to understand about it. Alien Covenant had the same effect on me: I REALLY loved it, and, like Prometheus, it took me a few days to process that thought.
Like its predecessor, Alien Covenant suffers an unusually large number of unforgiving flaws: plot holes, unrealistic (not to say stupid) character actions and reactions, Alien lore contradictions, predictable dialogue, and twists,... sadly I could go on and on.
However, I still love Alien Covenant regardless.The first and foremost reason could be a Xenomorph love story ever since I saw Aliens at the cinemas back in 1986 (sadly, I was too young to see the first one in the theatres). This is such a fascinating creature/concept; the Alien (forget the AVPs) franchise always included those subtexts: corporate greed, weaponization, evolution, god complex, questionable human origins, redemption, sacrifice et al. Serious Science Fiction.The other reason why I love Alien Covenant and forget about all its flaws: this is a Ridley Scott film we're talking about; his films are not all masterpieces but, by David, they are gorgeous to look at, I mean, they are visually faultless.If you love the whole Alien mythology like me, you will try hard not to like Alien Covenant but, eventually, it will defeat you and you will proudly add it to your BR collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not good, not bad.","It wouldn't be a modern Alien movie if you're not left with a level of disappointment after watching.Who thought if it was a good idea to explore an unknown planet without proper suit? No helmet, no protection. Nothing. And surprise, surprise. Five crew members died instantly because an alien just burst out of their bodies.The only thing that saved this movie was the plot twist to what happened in Prometheus. They finally explained how the aliens were created. All this time we thought they were just there, but no, a corrupt android created them. The ending plot twist also gave me goosebumps. I wish we could see more to what happened next.Overall, this is a decent movie with stupid characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Keep them coming please?!,"Alien: Covenant (2017) -In my opinion, this film is actually far more terrifying than the others that have gone before it.They seem to have perfected the CGI and while it is a bit fast at times, it is still horrific for a big scaredy cat like me. And the ""birthings"" are really quite nauseating.Once again though, it is a very good film and it establishes the origins of the Aliens that we have known of since 1979 as well as introducing some other variants that can now be incorporated in to future films and promise to be exciting too.The star of the show is Michael Fassbender, or Bender for short, as I refer to him (Only because I want him so badly!). He is brilliant in the new role of Walter, who is programmed to speak with an American accent this time so that the audience don't confuse him with David from 'Prometheus' (2012).One of the conversations between Walter and David reminded me of Andy Serkis as Gollum in 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' (2002) when he has a superb back and forth conversation with himself, whilst looking at his reflection in a pond. There is something deeply enjoyable about Bender's equivalent chat in this film.What I don't like is that they seem to have gone from having a kick ass female character in Sigourney Weaver's, Ripley, to having some very weak ones. I didn't rate Shaw in the last film and Daniels, in this one, doesn't represent that message of empowered women in our future very well either. I actually know someone who earned her Doctorate based on the subject of the strong female lead of 'Alien' (1979) and I have made a mental note to discuss this with her when I see her next. I wonder if the studios realise the importance that these characters might potentially have for people.More ""Girl Power"" next time please?As I have said above, the CGI is outstanding, it's easy to believe that these creatures are real and while I'm sure that there are still many more traditional methods being used for a lot of it too, it is the movement and performance of these computerised characters that is able to strike fear in to my heart. Some of the events that happen throughout, because it's not a slow build up at all, are truly gross. But what it does to keep it interesting and to keep big wimps like me watching, admittedly from behind a cushion, is to provide a story that's worth watching too and one that answers a lot of questions. There is an episode of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'* which answers the question of why most of the alien species that are encountered throughout the series are humanoid in their appearance and essentially that is what this film does for the Alien franchise.(*Season 6/Episode 20 - The Chase)I think that the creators of these films have a great formula that manages to make films, that would normally not appeal, so accessible to as many as they do. Even my Mother who hates the horror genre, enjoys these latest two, but that could be because of the way Mike's butt looks in the jumpsuit he's wearing at the beginning, although they are well thought out films that bear the fans in mind too.712.85/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the brain dead,"The last time I was this enthralled in a story was for Ex Machina, in fact, i think its the only other review I felt strongly enough to write. As the tale of David unfolded in front of me I gasped and remembered the original Alien transmission, how could Muthur possibly identify part of it..... unless.....! I'd love to write reams about the ""creator-destroyer-creator"" theme that most people won't even think about when they watch Alien Covenant but it would give too much away. The David character is mesmerizing when you consider that this is an AI that has already consigned all organic lifeforms to history as he plots and executes his own agenda and you will watch Prometheus again trying to see any evidence that he was on his own mission even then.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent sequel to Prometheus,"Alien: Covenant opens with a mesmerizing scene that sets the tone beautifully. I loved the combination of close-ups with long shots; it felt refreshing and drew me right in. The cinematography is stunning, particularly with the use of light and shadows in darker scenes, which adds depth to the atmosphere. The space scenes are impressively real, and the shaky camera work during critical moments brings an immersive touch.The philosophical themes mirror those of Prometheus, exploring questions about humanity, creation, and destruction. In that way, Alien: Covenant complements Prometheus well, continuing the deeper narrative threads of the franchise. The original soundtrack is another highlight - memorable and evocative, it brings a familiar but compelling atmosphere to the film.Production design is as impeccable as ever, staying true to the eerie and iconic Alien aesthetic. The acting deserves praise too, especially Daniels (played by Katherine Waterston), whose empathetic portrayal adds a humane layer to the intense sci-fi setting. The androids' performances, in particular, are impressive, and their interactions are filled with intrigue and complexity.However, I do feel that this film lacks the memorability compared to the original Alien. The CGI is visibly apparent, and that artificial look takes away from the overall visual impact.The writing has its ups and downs. Initially, it feels shallow, with too much focus on panic, shouting, and reacting. However, things pick up in the second half with the conversations between the two androids. The philosophical debate between the characters was intriguing - it adds depth by exploring the duality of human nature: the ability to show both empathy and destruction, contrasted with the capacity of others to manipulate and outsmart.Despite its flaws, Alien: Covenant offers moments of greatness, and it's worth appreciating the detailed world-building that aligns with Prometheus. It stands as a solid sequel, especially for those who enjoyed the preceding film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated entry in the series,A pretty underrated entry in the series. This movie not only works as a follow up to Prometheus but also as a solid Alien movie.Fassbender is perfect in this role. He really carries the movie on his back. The other characters aren't very memorable.The story is honestly pretty fascinating and does a good job of setting up the lore of Alien. I think Prometheus and this one are a bit underappreciated in that regard. The execution isn't perfect but it is extremely ambitious.The major negatives are an overuse of CGI and some underwhelming xenomorph scenes. I also think the look of this one is a bit too glossy. It feels too polished.I also really liked the dark direction they took the ending.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Absolute Blast of a Horror with a Rocky Start,"Alien: Covenant follows a colonization ship called 'Covenant' as it sets out to, you guessed it, colonize another planet. Along the way the crew comes across an uninhabited planet with all the means of supporting life, and it's closer than the one they were going to, so they decide to check it out. What's the worst that could happen?I know I'm in the minority when I say that I absolutely loved this movie. While it isn't as good as the two original Alien movies, it's up there to me.With the exception of some parts of the beginning, I thought that the movie was really well written. It did a good job of developing the characters through quick dialogue just enough to increase the stakes higher than if they were all expendable. All the characters, who are married to one another, speak to each other like actual married couples. And it isn't just generic lovey-dovey dialogue, it's mature and realistic. While I didn't always know who was married to who most of the time, the stakes were still there. And even when the characters landed on the planet the way the story was carried from then on was great fun but still well-written enough to make complete sense.As a whole, the movie is both creepy and intense. With the stakes put in, the action is just that much more exciting. And with antagonists like xenomorphs, it's terrifying. There was a slight alteration to the aliens that works really well with the story, and actually makes them infinitely more creepy. It adds another layer of intensity and complexity to the movie that I personally really appreciated. Furthermore, the movie constantly has this level of urgency where the characters learn fairly quickly that there's something wrong, and a large portion of the movie is spent with them simply trying to get out of that problem. But they can't. Very little of this movie is glossed over or skipped ahead of, especially towards the last two acts. So the audience is constantly on edge, waiting for the moment when the characters will either meet their end or get away.The movie is beautiful, whether it be the set design, landscapes, or CGI. The sets are fleshed out for the most part and manage not to bore. The landscapes on the planet are breathtaking, and the CGI is great. A lot of people had a problem with the movie replacing the classic alien costumes with CGI. Personally I have no problem with how a filmmaker decides to use special effects, so long as it looks good. Sure, I prefer practical effects too, but I doubt this movie could've been done with costumes. The aliens move in oftentimes inhuman, impossibly fast ways that simply couldn't be captured by a regular human, and thus the fear and intensity would be largely gone. And in-movie, the CGI looks great. The aliens are creepy and mostly real, though it isn't unobvious that they are fake. It's not so bad that it took me out of the movie, though.The acting I found to be often good and more often fine. There wasn't a lot to praise, other than Michael Fassbender. Acting-wise, this guy carries the movie. He plays two characters, and he's fantastic as both. Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup were good as the leading characters as well, and the rest of the cast was good for what little they were often given.My biggest problem with this movie was the beginning. While it did a good job setting the scene and stakes and showing the contrast between the people and androids (which helped with the character development as well), there was one point that I think was poorly timed and another that was glossed over. The main character spills her beans about a semi-important idea she had with her husband too early, and it just doesn't feel natural. If it had been done later, it would've been better. Later, when the characters go to the other planet, it takes them a couple weeks. Those weeks are completely skipped. Those weeks would've been the perfect time to slip the character and her husband's idea in, as well as develop the other characters. Personally I think that the movie simply should've spent maybe half an hour in those weeks, making it a two-and-a-half-hour- long movie. That way the stakes could've been even higher. Although the dialogue did suffer at the beginning a little, and Waterston's performance went from very emotional to not emotional way too quickly, causing a small problem with her performance.Overall Alien: Covenant is a solid addition to the Alien franchise. While I don't think it's as good as the first two, I'd say it's right behind them. I don't really get all the hate going it's way, I had an absolute blast with it. In the end I would definitely recommend it despite the fact that you'll probably complain about it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Far less bad than people are letting up, but still not winning any awards.","Contrary to what people would have you believe, Covenant isn't the worst film ever made ever. There are worse films out there, including within the same franchise. Alien: Resurrection is infinitely worse by every margin.Alien: Covenant is simply just an okay movie, as it didn't follow up from Prometheus enough to surpass it. It upped the android David's character by 100 but unfortunately it was in sacrifice of any development of Shaw or the Engineers. It had some amazing scenes, but also very concerning ones too, like why the Engineers in the film look like low-budget fan film versions, or the implied revelation that DAVID is the creator of the Xenomorphs. Though this revelation has seemingly since been retconned, the thought process behind this I don't understand at all.Unlike Prometheus, where I enjoy it the more I watch it, I seem to be liking Alien: Covenant less and less. Scott clearly strayed too far away from his original idea for a sequel after too many complaints following Prometheus' release, and he clearly caved in. He should've just stuck to his guns and made what he originally envisioned. The result as seen in Covenant is a frankenstein's monster of a film that doesn't truly satisfy Prometheus fans OR Alien fans. Unfortunately, I think the ball has been dropped for Scott's prequel series, and the franchise should just move on, which it seems to have been.Personally, I think David reappearing in subsequent Aliens or AVP media as a main antagonist would tie a nice little bow over Covenant's cliffhanger.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Entertaining enough,"Not bad for its genre, which is lets fight the alien, and prevent it from infecting others. Sci fi as an overall genre is improving on the screen, but only on the small screen. Stereotypes in any genre, as anyone can see, sooner or later cripples that genre. Fortunately, recent offerings are showing that the immense amount of material out there is beginning to be looked at a little more seriously. That said, I don't get why this film was so denigrated. It simply picks up where Prometheus left off. As the old saying goes, you cant squeeze blood out of a sows ear. Alien's pretty has pretty much exhausted its subject matter. Its a little predictable at the end, as the attempted twist failed for a more discerning viewer. its entertaining enough as action sci-fi and worth the watch at 7 out of 10.

Decent sequel to the prequel,"Thia sequel to the prequel of Prometheus wasn't bad, it continued where the last movie finished but at the same time it left more things left to be seen before we reach the first movie Alien.

The Engineers' plot is abandoned. It doesn't seem like a Ridley Scott film.,"What is presented in Prometheus is completely lost in this sequel; perhaps attempting to give greater depth to Prometheus's plot with the Engineers' theme did not work entirely, but it is clearly more satisfying than what is offered by this sequel. There is no mystery anymore; it is replaced by poor and uninspired action. The horror element is scarce and ineffective.If you were intrigued by what would happen after the events of Prometheus, this installment doesn't seem to care; it only serves as the foundation for David's story and nothing more. The performances are quite good, I would even say better than those in the previous film. But this doesn't save a poor script that portrays the crew as the most inept in any film of this saga; just when you think they can't make a more foolish decision, they surprise you.The creature is very simplistic; the CGI fails to convince and pales in comparison to the previous iterations of the Xenomorph. In the previous films, this creature appears very little, and it's difficult to have a clear view as it develops in narrow and dark environments, but certainly, this has proven to enhance the staging and successfully convey the desired sensations to the audience. With this installment, they decide to avoid this, but what some might call 'a bold move' only manages to demonstrate that the oppressive atmosphere of the previous installments is perfect and should not be replaced.Scott seems not to be entirely convinced with the Engineers' plot, so he gets rid of it with this installment, resulting in a more generic film that doesn't even seem characteristic of Ridley Scott. Michael Fassbender does great again, and doubly so, but it's insufficient to save the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien Covenant dreams of a future without Workplace Safety Policies,"Formulaic to a tee, the latest offering from the Alien franchise is a repackaged story line with a less frightening creature feature. Most notable is the clear but unexpected stance the film takes on colonising planets without an advising Workplace Health and Safety Officer in attendance. Let this be a cautionary tale regarding failure to implement appropriate biohazard and fire safety controls, children.Following on from the 2012 film, Prometheus, Alien Covenant picks up 10 years later with a spaceship of colonists from Earth headed to a habitable planet. As in the previous films, crew are maintained in hyper-sleep for the long journey and tended to by a synthetic human, Walter (Michael Fassbender). Struck by an energy flare on route, the crew is awakened to manage repairs to the ship and subsequently decide to take a side trip to investigate a mysterious transmission nearby. Can you guess what else might be lying in wait on this conveniently located new planet?Laden with jump-scares and poor life choices, the Prometheus and Covenant films are prequels to the initial film, Alien, released in 1979. Bound by trying to maintain the 'look and feel' of a movie made with special effects from over 30 years ago, Covenant does well to replace creature puppets with computer generated nightmares while trying not to be so flashy with upgrades as to make the 'future' obsolete.In place of substantive character development, early dialogue awkwardly refers to characters by their relationship, specifically 'my wife', rather than allowing a natural progression of backstory for each character, presumably to save time and get to the gore. I can only hope that the overuse of the wifely title was to lay grounds for a future drinking game at the end of a harrowing movie marathon weekend. Although, realistically, if you encouraged drinking every time a previous plot point from the series is reused, you'd be well on your way. It really does feel like the script was put together by joining the dots on a collection of Post-It notes from a brain storming session called 'Things which worked really well last time'.And yes, fans of the genre; the androids of Covenant, comfortingly, continue to be ambiguous in their agendas. However, the strong, independent, doe-eyed female lead (Katherine Walterston), is disappointingly not as kickass as Ripley from the original films.Overall, if there is a special place in your heart for the mythos of the Alien universe, you know you'll go see this edition in spite of it all to revel in the nostalgia of a recycled premise. However, I would recommend a lowering of your expectations first. No, lower. Lower¬Ö. There. Now you're ready.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Prometheus>Covenant>Nostromo>Sulaco and David is sick...,"To be honest I actually wait when Ridley Scott stops making films about Aliens and makes a grand Sci Fi where the characters discover a Dyson Sphere or a Rama ship...That soundtrack that they used in both Prometheus and A.C. implies ""WE WANT TO EXPLORE, WE DON'T WANT MORE OF THE GORE""...Prometheus was more about exploration to a certain point, but with Covenant they ran out of Steam completely... The trailer implied that in a film you would see what happened to Elizabeth, why the Engineers created that virus, but what we get is no explanation whatsoever, to be honest the story route ""David is a sick bastard"" reminds me when in ""Matrix"" Wachowski suddenly decided to make agent Smith the root of all evil...Overall the film was enjoyable to watch once, but not a single moment left me surprised although the space scenes were visually great... The main character of this film is not Daniels it's David... The moment when first chestburster appears is literally Ridley's ""Look, look!! - I created it and not anybody else!!!""The metaphor of the final scene when David saves a couple of alien embryos is not for the sake of a sequel, but it's for the sake of saying:"" - Come on , you know who is the main character there, nobody cares about another female survivor or a deep space exploration mission, you all came there for the gore...

Interesting and very bleak,"OK so to start off I want to say: Prometheus is one of my absolute favorite films and the alien film series is my favorite film series. I think that Prometheus was marvelously done and it explored very interesting thought provoking ideas that I was eager to see continued in this film. I want to be clear by saying that this is more so of a traditional alien film than Prometheus was. Prometheus was very different than the other alien films and I loved it for that, not to say that I didn't like the other alien films because I did, but Prometheus was just so smart and it did a wonderful job setting things up and giving you a view into how everything started. Alien covenant does answer some lingering questions that I had, but then it doesn't answer some others that I hope future films will. The acting is wonderful, I absolutely loved Michael Fassbender, he really is the true star of this film. The imagery, the scenery, and the visual effects are just as stunning as they were in Prometheus. The biggest thing that I was interested in in Prometheus was the idea of the engineers and I was really interested in their storyline and I wanted to find out more about them, because as anyone who's seen Prometheus knows, it leaves you wondering and wanting more. The engineers actually aren't a huge part of the movie, they're in there, but they only take up a small portion, and yes technically you are given a little more background but I wasn't satisfied with how they handled the engineers, I felt that needed more elaboration. The aliens and how they are created and David are the main things that are explored in this movie. I really did like the way they handled David and the direction they took his character, I wasn't expecting some of the things that happened with him, but I won't give that away. The action scenes are done well, but action really isn't a lot of what this movie focuses on, which I really like, because truth be told, I didn't go into this movie to see action sequences, I went to get answers to questions about Prometheus and to see where they were going to take this intriguing series. I think this movie was very interesting and it holds your attention the whole way through and I like for the most part what they're doing with the series, like I said, there are things that I wish they would have explained in more detail, but all in all Alien: Covenant is a very well done installment into the amazing Alien franchise. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Like wine, it get's better with age (with some minor flaws)","I went to the premiere of Covenant, and really enjoyed some parts of it, but left disappointed. As an Alien fan, I expected more Alien, less Prometheus.
But the thing is, I watched it again today alongside Prometheus, and this is on another level.
Ridley Scott really gave his best effort to make sense to the appearance of the Xenomorphs, and now I can see it.
It is indeed a beautiful story/metaphor of the god Prometheus, and David is the ideal antagonist on this plot.
I'm not even gonna go on to talk much about the cinematography and the acting, because it's been well reviewed by several users/critics. Fassbender excellently delivered his roles as David/Walter, and made you understand the reason behind his delusional wish of creating life.
The only problem with the whole storytelling, was the pacing, I reckon if Ridley Scott was younger the movie would've had a different approach. But I can understand nowadays things work at a different pacing with all the technology involved, and I think movies tend to be rushed a bit more.
I can't wait for a follow-up to Covenant, to see what ingenious experiments David was up to after being in comand of the ship.
Also a lot of praise for the great detail and respect to H.R. Geiger's artwork.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Bizarre, occult and filled with sophistry","Is Ridley Scott one of those people who believes pronouncing complex words alone can yield something reasonable? Probably. Alien: Covenant is up-to-the-top filled with nonsensical quasi-scientific, religious and cultural gibberish. Those apparently sophisticated conversations are on display from the very beginning to the very end.First two Alien movies were sci-fi horror in their core; mysterious and unnerving. There is no single scene in Covenant which could justify it as a horror. Yes, there are few unnecessary bloody alien births; and that's it. Young audiences are turned on to everything which has ""horror"" written on it and very naive in their perception of it. So the only reason why ""horror"" tag is put on it's IMDb page is to attract those ignorant of early Alien movies.Covenant is a drama with many occult elements. It's no secret that Ridely Scott always used many religious elements in his movies (Alien series as well), but this one is over the top. Even one of the trailers has been given the title ""Last Supper"" (take a look at the picture no. 66 on Covenant's IMDb page and tell me you can't recognize something familiar at first glance). That's not strange given the information that Covenant is largely influenced by H.R. Giger's work. But to saturate the entire movie with eugenics and some kind of religious nonsense says something about Ridely Scott: he's no longer interested in making movies for the sake of the audiences. He went in purely ideological way and used ""Alien"" as means to it. Or is he being used by Hollywood?It's unnecessary to mention that production quality generally is really good. That's Ridley's field and there he knows what he's doing. But how is it possible that the original alien monster looks much better than this CGI alien? At least there are a couple of really promising scenes. Unfortunately, all of them are cut short with Ridley's strange need to keep the sophistry rolling. What about crew members? I don't recall seeing more stupid and incompetent group of people. If you've seen Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"" you know what I'm saying. These top scientists and engineers literally defy all principles of common sense and logic. There's even a Christian on board! Too bad he behaves like a zealot and quotes Jesus out of every context imaginable. Maybe script writers should have taken basic religion class?Sounding sophisticated while accomplishing nothing is what Ridley Scott apparently does the best. This movie is unworthy to be titled as it's predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Viciousness over logic,"A small spoiler...David commandeers the ship to the alien world, while learning about the engineers. As he arrives, we see just a small town, or a village more like, of aliens that look evidently different from the engineers we saw in the Prometheus, also primitive, cheap and scrappy. So, before even making any acquaintance, David decides to take them out of their misery, by flushing most of the goo supply upon their heads, turning the valley into some sort of a tar holocaust.It is an original idea, to suggest that a civilization at its peak would become a small filthy scrap yard under a rock, with a few hermits, no signs of technology anywhere, except for interstellar spaceships and ample supply of super-vicious goo stuff, aka bio-super- virus that mutates all life forms into combustible monster breeders.So, after the greeting party, David also kills Shaw, and sets up a lab on this newly found rock, to start developing even more vicious stuff, so on the off-chance someone flies by, he can kill them even in a more elaborate way.I mean, all is making sense up to this point - right? Enough of the spoiler stuff though.----------------------------------------------------------For anyone who expected a logical continuation to the Prometheus, forget it, it is a continuation without any logic.An interesting story cannot be predictable, but there is nothing interesting in a story that simply turns chaotic.They could start and end it with one line - ""basically, everybody dies"", and leave it at that. There is hardly anymore merit to the story, it is dark, vicious and terminal. And it leaves the taste of an over-the-top, vampire movie.For the Sci-Fi genre, it is a failure, as it provides no logical answer to any of the interesting questions raised by the Prometheus.Nothing what you see there will make any sense to you, sadly.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The beginning is very interesting with lots of of atmosphere, but then it just resorts to the same clich√©s. The Aliens are not even a bit scaring. There's not a feeling of psychological terror anywhere. Just cheap philosophical ramblings, disgusting gore and a great performance by Fassbender again. Amy Seimetz does well too.

Horrible Waste of Time.,"As a great fan of Ridley Scott and the original Alien film, I looked forward to this film. From the first 15 minutes, I couldn't wait for it to end. The characters are barely one-dimensional, there is zero character development, the editing is so lightning-fast it feels as though you are watching a bad MTV concert video, the action is nonsensical and the story is predictable. A total failure on all levels. Just bad. Not ""so bad it's good"" or campy or horribly charming. Just bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poetically Brutal and Frustrating,"No doubt ALIEN : COVENANT is a good movie; it gets a lot right. There's a lot that impressed me and then there were some things that didn't. I'll start with the good stuff first. I was extremely impressed by how Scott was still able to balance the philosophical essence of PROMETHEUS with the pacing and outright horror of the original series - basically done in an attempt to silence PROMETHEUS critics who cried about that movie being short on action. This one certainly isn't; there is plenty going on. It's a brilliantly staged Gladiator dome battle between aliens, humans, and synthetics. ALIEN : COVENANT is an operatic, poetic, and ultimately brutal sci-fi film that spills a good deal of blood, mostly human red but also acid green and synthetic white. It's also an exceptionally well made film; no surprise for fans of Scott and his work. There's fantastic cinematography and great use of color, light, and sound; the editing and all other technical aspects are top notch.The action, the attack sequences are phenomenal and genuinely startling and frightening, hatching out of an intense mood of dread. Say what you will but Scott still knows how to craft sci-fi suspense like no other. He ramps up the gore here too and overall it is very effective with some nice, nauseating moments of bloodletting. The pacing is spot on for a film that clocks in at every second of two hours and the film commands your attention and is never boring - how could it be? There is something ominous going on every minute of this film, even if it isn't necessarily action. The CGI aliens are mostly effective (aside from the first encounter with a newborn Neomorph which didn't really impress upon close-up shots). The characters aren't exactly deep or layered but they are introduced well and they are engaging. Those are a lot of good reasons to see this movie, if you're a fan of course, and you absolutely should (if you're not then why would you ever see this? Which is a separate issue). But unfortunately there are some glaring negatives too. This is the stuff I have a problem with, and talking to other fans and critics, I'm not alone. SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS! One fan site I went on compared this frustration to an annoying friend who insists on answering a question with another question and that sums it up perfectly. This can be a very confusing film and thinking about everything I saw; it becomes frustrating trying to figure it out. It seems to me there a lot of plot holes in connecting the gaps from ALIEN (1979) to PROMETHEUS (2012) and back again. This installment answers a few questions raised in PROMETHEUS, albeit with vague unsatisfying answers. But there are too few. I'll also say that although Katherine Waterston is fine in her role as Daniels, she's no Ripley, hell she's no Elizabeth Shaw either and is by far the weakest heroine this series has yet to introduce. I have a lot of other issues with the plot too, but I can't get into them without revealing major spoilers, so if you've seen the film and would like to discuss some of these with me please hit me up one on one and I'll be glad to elaborate. At any rate is it possible that more will be revealed? Absolutely! In fact, I hope so. I hope that there is at least one more film in this brilliant series that, by the way, still has plenty of bite left in it; however, judging by sluggish box office receipts, I'm not exactly optimistic. I honestly wish that Scott had wrapped it all up here, with a neat little bow on top but he didn't. The plan was for another sequel/prequel to be released within the next 2 years. I do hope that happens because I am certainly thirsty for more. As a long time super fan of this beloved franchise I want to see more; I crave it! This film did satisfy me for the time being though. It is a good movie, worthy of seeing and enjoying and dissecting at length with other fans. In fact, I can't wait to see it again. In my opinion ALIEN : COVENANT isn't as great as PROMETHEUS was and certainly not as stellar as ALIEN; however, it is miles ahead of sequels like ALIEN 3 & ALIEN : RESSURRECTION and that's saying something. Scott hasn't lost his edge that's for sure and I highly recommend seeing this, especially if you are a fan but be warned - you will leave with a feeling of disappointment, having just as many questions as you came in with. It's a beautifully made, poetically brutal film and on its own merits it is very good but as part of a film series it leaves a lot to be desired. 3 stars out of 4 is the best rating I can give it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
God bless Ridley Scott and the Xenomorph,"Alien: Covenant, two weeks after its initial theatrical release and its already underrated!Warning: Spoilers!!!Ridley Scott return's to the directors chair once again to direct the epic 5th sequel in the alien franchise, that is if you don't count the AVP films. The film is also a sort of sequel to the 2013 film Prometheus, also directed by Ridley Scott. now, i know a lot of people didn't enjoy the likes of Prometheus, i did. It was a smart, dark prequel to the alien films.Alien: Covenant stars Michael Fassbender,Danny McBride, and Katherine waterson, among others.Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, Prometheus) plays two characters, Walter, a new android aboard the crew of the covenant, a space shuttle holding are new crew. Fassbender also plays his titular android, David, from Prometheus. David, in Prometheus, was an android who seemed normal at first but was so advanced that he gained human emotion and fought with the crew within that film. His performance within the film as Walter is intriguing and touching. He is a good character that is willing to die for a human aboard the ship. On the other hand, his performance as David is ominous and creepy. As Walter he has a standard American accent and as David he has his regular British accent. This is a strong clash between both and creepy result.Danny McBride (Pineapple Express, This is the End) plays Tennessee, basically Tom Skeritt's Character from the original, Dallas. McBride's performance is very well acted, considering he is usually a comedic actor. Tennessee overall is nice, caring character that gives the film its comedic and touching moments.Katherine Waterson (Inherit Vice, Fantastic Beasts) plays Daniels, are new Ellen Ripley. Everything goes poorly for Daniels in the film. He husband Branson played by Jame Franco is killed within his hyper sleep chamber. Throughout the rest of the film Daniel's is sad and upset, but note to self her sadness is not annoying. Towards the later have of the film Daniel's tries and succeed's to kick Xenomorph ass.The film also features some other really good character actors, they include: Demi√°n Bichir (The Hateful Eight, Machete Kills), who plays a lieutenant on Covenant. After the death of their captain Branson they have the second in command take over, he is played by billy Crudup (The Watch).Now lets delve into some controversy, The Neomorph. The Neomorph is the newest species of alien introduced to the franchise. The Neomorph is basically an albino version of a regular Xenomorph. Its skin is pale and fleshy, it almost has a translucent quality to its skin and features. Instead of the classic tongue mouth that is usually darting out of a Xenomorph's Mouth we get a retractable mouth. The teeth and jaws pop out of the face and munch on human. When a Neomorph is born within the film they hatch out of the spinal chord and when born are really miniature versions of their adult stage. Overall, the Neomorph is a creepy yet bad ass alien that i cant wait to see again.The classic Xenomorph returns in the film. Within the film we learn the origins of the Xenomorph. It turns out that David, the android invented the Xenomorph by crossing it with genes of the Nemorph and that's how the Xeno came to be. We also get some classic facehugger and chestburster action.Now, when i went to go see the film i expected a lot, what i didn't expect was how gory and bloody the film turned out to be (That's Not a Complaint). I mean, it's really gory, like holy hell gory. I mean, there's a scene where a Neomorph hatches out of a guys mouth. Blood is shot everywhere and meat is ripped. Heck, there's a scene where a couple are having sex in a shower on the Covenant. As there going at it a Xenomorph's tail creeps under the glass divider of the shower and caresses the nude women's butt. She screams and then the Xeno's tongue shoots through the glass and into the head of her lovers mutilating his head and spraying bone, brain matter and blood allover over the naked body of the women. This was my reaction ... ""HELL YEAH!."" Anyways the film is gory as all hell and that's a good and amazing thing.The film is well directed by Scott and true send up in the series, great, its a truly gorgeous and glorious gore soaked sequel!Two-Facehuggers Up!P.S : What a twist ending!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hard to appreciate such unrealistic behaviour.,"It's a horror film so events need to unfold such that we get some scares. However I want to care even a little about the characters in the film. Hard to do this when most characters are behaving like morons, medical staff freaking out not being able to deal with any kind of emergency, and there's an absence of protocols when encountering an unknown planet.In no real situation would people just get out of the ship and walk around.There would be layers and layers of checks for everything that could possibly endanger and contaminate, especially in a colonial situation.No sympathy for these people. Just the good robot and main female character shine through. Still, why didn't these two, who have their heads screwed on properly in a relative sense say ""Hey we need to screen pathogens and lifeforms for a few weeks first, run tests, investigate.... etc """"Technically brilliant eye candy but a dumb story, same combo as Prometheus.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enough to keep the series going.,"Alien Covenant is definitely made out of the fear that what if the audience is not able to digest it, like what happened with Prometheus? So, they made sure to put a lot of masala in this one. By masala, I mean the scenes directly taken from the first 4 alien movies which we loved, the ones which made us jump with surprise. Alien Covenant is a follow-up after Prometheus. 2 prologues were released to connect the two film more appropriately, which I will suggest you watch before you go for this one, to connect the dots. The movie is about a colonization ship which is going to a planet but the crew decides to check a different planet first, from which a mysterious signal is being received. I like Prometheus unlike many of my friends as they missed the ""Alien"" touch in it. So, when we saw Covenant with all the ""masala"", they loved it. For me, the best part is Michael Fassbender's, David. It makes the film more interesting and brings depth to it. With his appearance, you start asking questions like, what happened to Dr. Shaw? What he's been up to till now? Does he still have 'issues' with humanity? The ending is quite intriguing and builds curiosity. Covenant is good enough to look forward to further installments.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plausible explanation of the alien,"Although I expected different story and different explanations ‚Äì I have to admit that now the whole Alien story ends up quite well. Let's start from the original ""Alien"" of 1979 ‚Äì spaceship's (Nostromo) crew was attacked by some super strong, acid-blood, super clever beast with ability to survive in the open space (how unbelievable is that story, if you are so picky about plot of Covenant?). In the original ""Alien"" the monster was called as magnificent and desired weapon, ant that it was unbelievable that such creature existed naturally. So now we have an explanation how it became so undefeatable. So those who raise questions about plot holes and boringness ‚Äì note that Covenant (and Prometheus ‚Äì although I did not see it back then without the whole picture) provided quite logical explanation, how the alien became what it is. Or you expected some other explanation? ‚Äì for example ‚Äì it naturally evolved and is a creature of evolution of millions of years in some distant planet? C'monThere were some goofs (for example, absence of the nail hole in jaw chin of David, crew being so feisty just after wake up from few years sleep, gravity on the Covenant, etc. ‚Äì but such goofs can be found on any movie.Final verdict ‚Äì would gladly watch it again. 7 stars out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Breathtaking, heartbreaking and visually stunning","My only problem with ""ALIEN: Covenant"" (AC) was its length. It's a 2 hour-long movie that should have lasted at least 30 to 45 minutes longer (and I'm sure that would have been the director's intention. So I'm hoping for a longer director's cut version of it on Blu-ray). Why do I say that? Because the 4 parts of the movie (Introduction, Exposition, Collision and Resolution) were edited in a way that part 2 had deserved more screen-time. As an audience we should have been given more time to literally ""breathe in"" the amazing planet with its outside locations (and at this point: the feel of hope and optimism with the characters).However, this was my only minor issue with the film. The rest was pure joy and admiration. There are 5 reasons for it: locations (1), characters (2), production design (3), cinematography (4) and the score (5).1. The locations on this movie are just superb. The ships, the ancient city and last but not least: the planet. There's been great location and Greens-work in this one and a truly lush, green and otherworldly environment.2. Strong characters played by an excellent cast. Tough to name one lead-character in AC, there's more than one you'll feel connected to. From an acting point of view M. Fassbender and B. Crudup outdid themselves. I felt a strong connection to the characters and their motivations. Regarding how the story unfolds: Of course stupid mistakes and wrong decisions are being made. Without them, there wouldn't be a movie!3. Scott's movies all have spectacular production design and AC (costumes, props, sets and creatures) also was nothing short from wonderful.4. Well, no surprise here, the cinematography is just masterful. It's just extremely well done and intriguing. Hereby, I do not only mean the camera work but also the lighting, color-grading and overall look, that gives this movie its menacing feel.5. Last but not least, there's the music and score. From the very first scene to the end it's just brilliantly crafted and truly outstanding.He's done it AGAIN. Sir Ridley Scott, I salute you!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bit of a mess,"Alien: Covenant (2017, Ridley Scott)After Prometheus was released five years ago, the took was that the next chapter would follow the two surviving characters played by Michael Fassbender & Noomi Rapace back to the home world of the architects of the human race. However with Prometheus not doing as well as hoped and getting soft reviews plans have changed. What we have ended up getting is a messy hybrid of some of the ideas from the proposed Prometheus sequel and a much more familiar Alien film.This story follows the crew of a colony ship, bound for a remote planet who discover an uncharted habitable world that unfortunately contains some dangerous secrets and forces them to attempt a harrowing escape. The film is well enough made but not as visual a splendor as Prometheus was. The cast all do fair to good work with Danny McBride (Eastbound and Down) being the highlight.However the story is a real mess and the characters are under developed with mixed results on the design and set pieces. The computer generated aliens look good at times and not so much at others with their movements feeling too over the top and not grounded enough. For those who are fans of blood and gore, this one has plenty as well as some good tense moments but on the whole this film feels like a failure but they have another chance to get it right in 2019 with Alien: Awakenings.4.5/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Good horror - but far from the best,"I'm a big fan of this genre and these movies. The expectations were therefore great before I went into the movie theater to see what Ridley Scott has done now. This is an Alien movie that does not shame on its predecessors. But it is far from the best in this series. (I do not include Aliens vs Predator!) It is also much more exciting than Prometeous. So why am I a little disappointed? I've been thinking a lot after I saw this movie. First of all, what's positive, the film has some benefits from all the technical possibilities that exist now, which did not exist in 1979. This draws the film benefits, especially in the action scene and how the monster is. What I miss here, as opposed to Alien and Aliens, is the mediation of anxiety we all felt when we say these movies. What happens now? Where does the monster pop up next time? Here it is more linear and action-oriented. And more hunting scenes. I think the movie loses on it. It is the claustrophobic, fearful predecessors who made the films so creepy and unpredictable. Here it is more obvious what will happen. Moore blood yes, but I was much more scared when I saw Alien.I want to draw out actress Katherine Waterston as a big plus in the movie. She is very good and carries a lot of the film.I really hope that Sigourney Weaver will appear next time, in a brand new follow up to the brilliant Aliens.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been so much better,"Disappointed by this version of the movie.

I'll do the fingering.,"Alien: Covenant begins with a group of colonists traveling to a distant planet in search of a new home. They come across a seemingly habitable planet and decide to investigate. However, they soon realize that this planet is not as hospitable as they thought, and they are forced to fight for their survival against a new breed of alien creatures.Overall, ""Alien: Covenant"" is a visually stunning film with some impressive cinematography and special effects. The acting is solid, with strong performances from Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, and Danny McBride. The film also does a good job of building tension and suspense, particularly in the scenes where the colonists encounter the new alien creatures.However, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes feeling rushed while others drag on. Additionally, the characters are not particularly well-developed, and it can be difficult to connect with them on an emotional level. The film also suffers from some of the same issues as its predecessor, ""Prometheus,"" including a convoluted plot and unanswered questions.Overall, ""Alien: Covenant"" is a decent addition to the ""Alien"" franchise, but it falls short of the high standards set by the original film.

Think this will be the new Marmite of the Alien franchise,"Remember before Prometheus was released back in 2012, when Ridley Scott was adamant that his then latest film was not going to have anything to do with the Alien film franchise? It was one of the most baffling denials to all as it was clear as day that it would tie in, we just didn't know how. It turned out that Prometheus posed more questions than it was able to answer and with Alien: Covenant, Scott has certainly not tried to hide the fact that he's going back to work on the franchise he helped lift off back in 1979.The Covenant, a colony ship carrying both crew and around two-thousand colonists on board, intercepts a mysterious transmission after a shockwave damages the ship. The crew learn the location of the transmission's source and decide to investigate the planet to see whether it would fit the profile for their colonial mission.Upon exploring what they see as an unchartered paradise, the crew soon find themselves up against a threat beyond their imagination, leading to a harrowing escape to make it back to the Covenant alive.One of the main tasks Ridley Scott had with making Alien: Covenant was trying to make a film that wasn't just a carbon copy of what had come before it. Scott does this by blending the ideas raised in Prometheus with the horror elements of his original Alien to create a bold new chapter that certainly raises more questions but leaves the door open rather intriguingly for at least another film in the franchise.Scott shocked us all with the chestburster scene in Alien and he finds a way to crank up the gore in Alien: Covenant, with some inventive new ways of the aliens exiting their respective hosts not for the faint hearted. He was never going to be able to create as atmospheric a film as Alien, the single location of that film playing a major part, but Scott shows some of his old form when creating a tense sequence, the initial facehugger attack being one of the most intense moments of the franchise, even though we know exactly what is coming.The film is slightly lacking in the character department when it comes to development, with only a few of them becoming more than just expendable alien food. With a large crew and a new alien running amok, I have to say it was rather enjoyable watching how each of them would meet their grisly end. It feels as if the characters take a bit of a back seat to the creation vs evolution ideas that the film raises which, while it may alienate some audience members, drew me right in. The lack of practical effects was a bit disappointing as there were certainly moments where they could have used them but instead they opted for CGI, which makes the creatures far less fearsome.Coming to the performances, Alien: Covenant does only possess one stand-out performer in Michael Fassbender, who plays both androids David, who we first met in Prometheus, and Walter, a member of the Covenant crew. Fassbender made David the most watchable character in Prometheus and he easily repeats the trick here with a dual performance that conflict one another, his line delivery as David in Alien: Covenant in particular is just so ice cold that he becomes quite a chilling character.Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride are just about the only remaining cast members who get a chance to show any character and they do so very well, McBride going on to surprise a number of people, including me, with such a straight performance as the pilot Tennessee. Look out for the easiest money James Franco will ever make as an actor with a very brief appearance early on in the film.While it is still a long way off the quality of both Alien and Aliens, I found Alien: Covenant to be a very welcome entry into the franchise. There's horror, action and plenty of gore for entertainment value while the continuance of the ideas raised in Prometheus means there is more to this film than people just running and hiding from an alien, the closing scene leaving me excited for where Ridley Scott can take the franchise next.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Two movies in one. One works a good deal better than the other, though.","This feels like two movies in one. One is fine, technically proficient, and somewhat effective. The other I love.Ridley Scott was caught in a bit of a bind after Prometheus. A lot of people weren't happy with what he had done, how it was only tenuously connected to the Alien universe, but he was far more drawn by the ideas of AI as antagonists rather than the xenomorphs of the given universe. What was he to do with a sequel to the reasonably financially successful Prometheus? Well, he seems to have found some kind of middle ground. I think the two sides clash a bit, and one is obviously better than the other. Still, as a whole, I feel like it comes out as reasonably good.Ten years after the Prometheus disappeared, the colonization ship Covenant is traveling to a distant system. While opening solar sails for a power charge (the science...let's just go with it), they're hit by a solar flare causing damage and requiring the waking of the crew. As they address the ship's damage, they discover a message with human origins coming from a nearby system. They investigate and find human vegetation. Two of the landing crew are infected with a virus that gestates an alien creature inside them that expels an early form of the xenomorph (called the neomorph according to the credits) from different parts of their bodies (the back for one and the mouth for the other). The rest of the crew gets stranded when their lander explodes, kill one of the neomorphs, and get rescued by David, the android from the previous film.It's here that the movie picks up on something that was touched on in the previous film. David himself talked about children all wanting to kill their parents. He was concerned with his role as creation, and here he is as the go between in terms of creator and creation. He's been alone for ten years, experimenting with the weapon the Engineers had created after having wiped out the entire civilization of Engineers on the planet with that very same weapon. He's reached a point where he can't go any further because his experiments have wiped out all of the meat on the planet. And here come a group of humans. David, the mad scientist, finally has his final piece to complete his work, the perfect lifeform, the xenomorph.One reason David's so great in this is his counterpart, Walter, a more up to date model of the David android with certain advances. David is creative and uses that creativity to find perfection. Walter is more like a robot and a servant to humanity. David is rebelling against his creator, and Walter is content to follow his creator's designs. David rebels by creating the perfect organism designed to destroy David's creator while Walter stands as an impediment to David's designs. This all get revealed over the course of a few wonderful scenes between Walter and David. It's Michael Fassbender playing off of himself and it works so incredibly well.David's revelation of madness is great to behold overall. His isolation and murder of Elizabeth Shaw (along with a cover story that includes a grave marker for when any human found him) created a psychopath of incredible intellect, vision, and ruthlessness. He's such a fantastic antagonist, and the inclusion of the xenomorph in his plans overall is great.The problem, though, is that after a certain point the xenomorph stops being an extension of David's plan and instead becomes its own, lesser thrilling source of antagonism. David unleashing the facehugger on Oram, the captain of the Covenant, is great. The xenomorph rising from the captain's body is great. The chase scene that follows is very good (though the alien works better in shadows like the first Alien than in the light like here). Then, the movie comes to a stop before restarting again with another xenomorph after the survivors have made it back to the Covenant and we get a quick and dirty 20 minute short version of the original Alien. It's fine from a technical standpoint. The geography is clear and the big scene in the terraforming hangar is great to look at, but it's after the fact, expendable, and just kind of extra to the whole thing. It could be cut completely and it would be hard to notice the few remaining crew members that had died in that scene missing from the rest of the film.And that encapsulates my overall feeling of the movie. David's fantastic and carries a large chunk of the film, but a lot of the horror stuff feels almost pasted on. None of it is bad, which helps things overall, but if just feels like another movie comes in and takes over for minutes at a time. It's an uneven experience that, I think, works well enough overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its a very thought provoking movie rather than plain action nonsense,"Ridley Scott is fantastic. Real suspense and intriguing believable factors and awesome landscapes are all there in this movie.
The movie forced us to use our minds and to immerse ourselves. It is hard to describe in full but suffice to say that this is not a simpleton movie which does not need brains at all. It is beautifully put together and incredibly story like the way real movies was intended in the first place. The special effects were superb and only a person like Ridley could have the brilliance and know how in putting a movie like this together.
I now understand why Sigourney Weaver said that she admired his work tremendously before.
I am hoping another great sequel will be coming out soon as possible but only if its from Ridley.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where do I begin?? A few good elements but not a good film.,"The good: The film is genuinely good to look at and has great special effects and some callbacks/references to the original film. Plus Michael Fassbender is a very good actor and I liked what they did with him in this movie. Plus there were just a couple of well-done scary sequences, specifically with the newer neomorphs that we have not seen yet. That's what I could deal with, but unfortunately everything else I could not.The bad: The film is so convoluted and rushed at many parts. You can't really care about most of the human characters because they aren't established well enough in the beginning, and more than one of them (pretty much all of them actually) make really horrible decisions so it's hard to feel bad for them when stuff does happen. I'm not normally one to complain about bad CGI because it is hard to do but the xenomorphs looked disappointingly fake. Ridley Scott forgot that horror that is slow-burning and builds gradually to an unstoppable climax is the best kind of horror, not horror that hits you from all angles at once, which is what much of the horror in this film was and it became underwhelming eventually. It was as if he forgot what made the original Alien great with all of its classic and genius aspects! Plus during the film they come to a place that is just put in the movie out of nowhere and it feels real inauthentic and too out of left field. Plus, there's a twist toward the very end that I saw coming miles away. I'm sad that I wasted my money on watching this tbh, and even Prometheus was a better film overall (even though it was only fair imo) since it felt grander with more mystery to it. However, this movie still explains more things than that did. Bottom line, compared to the original two (Alien and Aliens), it certainly let me down and left me chuckling in disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than what other people say. It's not trash, but hear me out...","So as I said, this movie is NOT ""trash"" as other people have put it. Far from. It is however an underwhelming & kinda stupid movie.The thing is that this movie probably could have been amazing. Why do i say this? Because the production quality is very good. The effects are very good. There are interesting concepts & very VIVID & disturbing imagery. The dialogue is at times, by specific characters, quite interesting and provoking. This movie also gives some interesting background on the Alien 'universe'. And some of the acting is pretty good.However, as i said, it is very underwhelming. There are too many irrelevant, stupid characters, irrelevant stupid things happening, stupid dialogue. So much stuff is so simplified. But there is deeper stuff underneath, and that is why this movie being so silly is such a shame.I still give it a 7/10, because it is totally still AT LEAST an average/ OK movie, probably a bit better, and there is also interesting, high value production & thought underneath.

Star (Wars) of David,"I was left more than a tad underwhelmed by the Alien prequel that was 2012's Prometheus. It started well, had a spectacular finish and sucked like a smelly Alien egg in the middle. Expectations for this one were almost as non-existent as Theresa May's integrity but, against my better judgement, I went to see it anyway in the desperate hope it wouldn't suck (at least not too much). I'm delighted to report that, for the most part, it doesn't.A sleek and highly intriguing opening sequence quickly paves way to a more-of-the-same, spaceship-crew-awake-from-hypersleep-to-answer- distress-signal-on-hospitable-planet-and-unwisely-check-it-out shtick. And then it gets really good!I won't spoil it too much for you, but what Ridley Scott delivers this time around is a visually arresting, very exciting and thoroughly engaging mash-up of Alien & Prometheus surrounded by slasher movie tropes with gleeful riffs on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and a jaw-dropping moment lifted straight from the prologue of John Boorman's Zardoz shaping its centrepiece. Hell, he even cheekily integrates key beats from his own Blade Runner which, hopefully on this evidence, is a good omen for things to come from Dennis Villeneuve's imminent sequel.But, just like its predecessor, AC's real ace trump is Michael Fassbender, returning not once, but twice as the 'idiosyncratic' David, and his doppelganger upgrade 'brother', Walter. He excels in both roles, but it's the former who gets right under your skin. Via Fassbender's android Hannibal Lector spin, we get the perfect vessel to deliver Scott & screenwriters John Logan & D.W. Harper's impressively bleak musings on the future of mankind. It's also interesting that this is the second set of prequels from one of Fox's biggest tent poles (see Star Wars episodes 1-3) to feature an anti-hero at its core. Kudos says I.Sure, there's plenty wrong with it too: there are no annoying characters around like there was on tap in Prometheus, but most of the cast are mere Facehugger/Xenomorph grist for the mill. Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup & Danny McBride give strong, solid performances and do enough to register interest, but next to Fassbender's powerhouse turn, its weak tea.Also, Scott relies too much on repeating dialogue, action and music cues from his 79 original (and even Cameron's Aliens) than try and create something fresh. He executes everything with maximum efficiency and the set pieces come off more enthralling & attention grabbing than they've any right to be. But its crystal clear Scott's heart is firmly with David & the big existential questions.The creatures are a hit & miss bunch too: the Pan's Labyrinth like Neomorphs are suitably ghastly and effective, but the more traditional monsters come over like brand obligation bit-players in their own movie. They're far from a box office red herring, but they're not much more than an after-thought either.Griping aside, Scott has largely redeemed himself with a pacy hybrid of bloody exploitation slice & dice action and hardcore life-the- universe-and-everything science-fiction philosophising that resonates loudly with the gloomy here and now. This is a Summer blockbuster with brains and a vision that, even at its most predictable and downbeat, never forgets to entertain. You may be able to spot the pay-off to AC coming a mile away, but it gets the one it needs and the one you want to see. And Sir Ridley doesn't let you down.

Alien: Covenant(2017),"Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created, with ALIEN: COVENANT, a new chapter in his groundbreaking ALIEN franchise. The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.Alien: Covenant delivers another satisfying round of close-quarters deep-space terror, even if it doesn't take the saga in any new directions and is lacking a major role of Prometheus star Noomi Rapace . In the finished version of Alien: Covenant, Noomi Rapace (Shaw) is relegated to cameo capacity ??The film would have been off the charts better if Noomi Rapace (Shaw)was cast more predominantly.Once I came to terms with this I started to get into the movie.I actually stopped the movie and got on my PC and started researching where Rapace was in this sequel . I came a cross this handy catch-up to bridge the gap between the two films :The Crossing, an official prologue short to Alien: Covenant, reveals what happened to crew members Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and the synthetic David after the events of Prometheus. Set aboard an abandoned Engineer vessel, Dr. Shaw repairs David as they continue their search for humanity's creators.""Alien Covenant"" delivers , fast-paced sci-fi action /horror /thriller (yes, it hits that many genres) like only Ridley Scott can, while continuing to explore the ""Prometheus"" theme of creation. Alien: Covenant is a very violent movie. It's rated R .There's lots of blood and gore, aliens bursting from body cavities, a beheading !

Having said that, this movie has bad writing, poor casting, sub-par CGI (The Matrix holds up better), and it is intensely stupid to boot. How the hell would somebody so quickly identify a John Denver song nearly 150 years after it was released? Can you think of a song that old? Give me a break; I can only suspend my disbelief so far. This is exactly what you would expect from a shameless, soulless, hollow attempt to capitalize on a beloved sci-fi classic. Just avoid this cash-grab garbage and watch the first two movies again.

I really missed noomi rapace on this one, really hoped they could have built the story with her character. I think the characters get established nicely in Prometheus, but they kind of fail to do it effectively in this movie. The first half was my favorite.

Alien: Covenantis better than several sequels in this series but still has its own blemishes,"I recently watched Alien: Covenant (2017) on Hulu. The storyline follows a transport ship filled with thousands of colonists that is alerted to a planet that closely resembles Earth. They decide to land there with hopes of a bright future. They discover an android on the planet who has been there for some time and has information about the planet and its inhabitants. He tells them a lot, but does he tell them everything?This film is directed by the iconic Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and stars Michael Fassbender (Shame), Katherine Waterston (Fantastic Beasts), Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Danny McBride (Your Highness), and Jussie Smollett (Empire).Alien: Covenant was a bit of a rollercoaster üé¢ for me, with some aspects I loved and some clear misses. The cast is brilliant and very well selected. The emergence of the facehuggers, and every scene they are in, were excellent and skillfully executed. There are also some great kills throughout the film and an elite ""shower"" scene that was fun. However, I never loved the alien evolution elements within this universe, and there were times where it was way too much CGI, like watching a Transformers movie.In conclusion, Alien: Covenantis better than several sequels in this series but still has its own blemishes.

A very frustrating film experience.,"If I had to make an analogy involving this film, it would be a stupid one involving let's say, bacon. You love bacon. On burgers. And you've just ordered a bacon burger from a fast food restaurant you love. Your mouth is watering as you open the wrapper for what is sure to be a delicious bacon burger, only your heart sinks when you realize there's just one measly strip on it. While you can enjoy the parts of the burger where you can taste some of the bacon, you can't ensure there's a piece in every bite. So the rest? It's just not the same. In this case, the ""Alien"" franchise itself is the bacon, and ""Alien: Covenant"" is the rest of the burger.It's unlikely anyone going into an ""Alien"" film with original director Ridley Scott behind the helm can put aside their expectations. Maybe that's our fault for going into it with baggage and not judging this new installment on its own merits. But given how great Scott was with the original material back in the 70s, one can't be faulted for hoping another film involving the notorious creatures on a ship in space directed by the same man contains a modicum of the directorial style and suspense as his first effort. And this is where the film lets us down.I understand it's 2017 and maybe audiences can no longer cope with such a slow burn as ""Alien."" They need faster pacing, special effects, and more blood and gore. Fair enough--we do get all of that. But the problem this time around is that while the scenes not involving the alien were spent on building suspense in the original, this time they're all centered around people walking around and talking...walking around and gazing at a new planet...walking around and philosophizing...basically, where the original used its quiet moments to increase fear and isolation, this one fills the non-alien segments with a bunch of ""can we please get on with it already"" moments. There's a moment when the characters are exploring an unknown, apparently human-friendly planet that seems to drag on forever, only that's the thing--it really doesn't. It just feels that way. I found myself wondering when the hell the creatures were going to show up, whereas with the original film I enjoyed every minute of anticipation getting there. To put it succinctly, the pacing is all over the place this time out and everything feels uneven.Complicating matters are the interchangeable characters whose names I cannot even remember, spare David and the briefly mentioned Elizabeth Shaw...both from the previous film ""Prometheus."" Ask anyone who the main characters in ""Alien"" were and you'll get Ripley for sure, if not Dallas and Lambert to boot. But when I walked out of the theater after seeing ""Covenant"", I couldn't even tell you the name of the main female lead. Yeah.Like ""Prometheus"", director Ridley Scott also places the CGI front and center rather than making it feel like an organic part of the film. We know these people are living in the future, but rather than let the special effects serve as a backdrop, they too often dominate the film and become set pieces in themselves.All of this is a real shame considering Scott clearly still has what it takes to deliver some fantastic suspense sequences. There is one scene in particular that I felt rivaled the intensity of the ""chestburster"" scene in the original, and a certain sequence taking place in a shower room is also commendable for how well it is shot and executed. But these standout bits are few and far between.""Covenant"" is a mashup of the battle scenes from ""Aliens"", the ""monster loose on a ship"" setup from the original, with a dash of ""Prometheus"" thrown in. The result is uneven all around, but still showcases some of Scott's flashes of brilliance here and there (the bacon!). What a shame the overall result couldn't have been more consistent.",,Anonymous,Horror
Stunning and enthralling but too condescending and dumbed-down Alien entry that doesn't know where to push towards if Alien or Prometheus.,"Ridley Scott delivers a stunning sci-fi horror keeping the aesthetic and many of the themes introduced in Prometheus but finding the verge from which to jump to themes and plot points better executed in the first two Alien movies. While the scenery, acting and special effects as well as the film direction were outstanding, this quality filmmaking may be in fact covering the unfortunate true facts about the movie: that it is condescending, weak in characterisation and flawed in many areas.While it retains Prometheus' tone and aesthetic at the beginning, it later develops themes and sequences more resonant of Alien. However, these tonal changes are too noticable and damage the overall tone as they may not be as thrilling or creative as their better-done counterparts in prior Alien movies. As if it was lacking the care and artistry provided by Alien's unique aesthetic which makes the entries of the franchise stand out from other sci-fi horrors.However, this matter is not the main issue fans and perhaps audiences may find in it. The characters make almost always the worst possible decisions. While the better Alien movies use circumstance and characterisation to guide the decisions each character makes that eventually lead to a mistake or a certain outcome, in this case the characters almost never showcase any sense of control or decision-making process.The less important characters are allowed to be dumbed-down and less aware of their surroundings, but the main protagonists have no initiative or personality at all. Ripley was by the books, focused, worried about the crew and always keeping in mind her training in basic quarantine procedures and other issues. However, in this film some character says ""shouldn't we put her in quarantine"" and the other says ""no"" one or two times and the first character stops insisting. In Alien, Ripley doesn't let Kane get in, insisting they should respect quarantine procedures. Even if the emotional bond of the crew gets the best out of the situation at least we, the audience, have witnessed Ripley show a level of awareness that is real and therefore we resonate with it.And this, in my opinion, is the greatest flaw of the movie, the characters are poorly written. They are given these backstories by ""pairing them up"" and the actors actually deliver a believable and fantastic performance. But these are devoid of emotional weight due to the fact that we need more time to appreciate their relationships and interactions with each other. Heck, I didn't even know ALL of them were couples, I was told by the trailer later on when I decided to check it but they are so one-dimensional I feel no sadness when they get killed. The movie focuses too much on using the characters as a vessel for the true plot points the movie actually wants to develop (these are too spoilery to debate, however, so I'll leave it at that).Had the movie taken the time to build relationship and allow for friendly bantering or character interactions more often, we would have understood better the driving forces of each character and therefore felt their demise or subsequent triumph. In Aliens, each character had their few scenes to flesh them out properly if only in a quite campy-yet-effective way. We saw them interact and react to circumstances and then when the danger arrived we could understand what would drive them to make the decisions they ended up making. However, in this film the characters are mere pawns to be killed with no meaningful outcome for any of the other characters except loss.The movie feels pretentious. It is constructed with this shell or facade of such great scenery, shots and concepts that we are oblivious to what is really going on underneath. Should the script to this movie would be read out loud or converted into a novel, without the filmmaking taken into account, the story would be so condescending, especially on the role of a particular character in the movie, that it is insulting to Alien fans.Another downside I felt this movie had, and perhaps it is due to the fact I began watching the Alien movies this year for the first time and my favorite ones are Alien, Aliens and Prometheus; was the soundtrack. It is unimpactful and average. I remember in Prometheus or on the first movies, when the engineers spaceship or any other great ""reveal"" happened, the music would elevate the scene or shot by increasing the trademarked ""horn"" sound, maintaining a tense and never ending thrilling music to add tension to the scenes. In this movie, the first half of it which contains the more quieter and mystery-building moments of the movie have very unimpressive music. Perhaps this and other faults I find in the movie may be attributed to the fact that this may be my first viewing of this movie, but when I saw Prometheus and the first Alien movies, I swore I was amazed and enthralled by every single aspect of it on first viewing. And judging by the matching opinions with other Alien fans, it encouraged me to trust my instincts and first impression of this film.The reason why I believe most of the people that liked the movie liked it is because it is genuinely a good sci-fi horror movie but a bad Alien movie. It bares no resemblance to the first Alien movies whose gap it's trying to merge with. And it lacks the layers, concepts and world-building masterclass of Prometheus, making it an inferior sucessor floating in a void of average sequels of a great franchise.I'd venture to say this time it was the fans' fault for not giving Ridley Scott time to develop Prometheus' introduced themes and concepts more in depth. I believe the next entry of Alien was meant to continue where things were left off in Prometheus. However, fan outcry for the lack of Xenomorphs in its antecessor ""forced"" Ridley Scott to make a ""time jump"" to create a story that would merge the gap between Alien and Prometheus so the timeline wouldn't be messed up. In the end, a considerably rushed work resulted in a pile of incredibly well done horror scenes and filmmaking concepts ruined by a bland predictable script that focused too much in giving the audience a ""good time"" rather than challenge them to think and ask questions, honouring the Alien franchise's brand of quality complex sci-fi horror themes.IN CONCLUSION, I'd say, should you take away the ""Alien"" word from the title crawls I believe it is a perfectly engaging Sci-fi survival horror. But between the Alien callback themes of ""checking out a distress signal from an uncharted place"" etc.; the already dated CGI of the creatures (after only 3 years) and the poorly written characters devoid of charisma; this film falls down in the list of Alien movies. Movies which, while awful at times, dared to tackle complex themes and horror tropes while still maintaining a unique and I'd say trademarked aesthetic that makes them stand out from the other thousands of the same genre. We'll have to wait until Ridley Scott's next entry to see how eveything turns out in the end. On the mean time, go check out ""Alien: Isolation"", it's a survival horror game featuring Ripley's daughter going to search for her mum; and it is terrifyingly engaging",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I like how gory 'Alien: Covenant' is, though","I like how gory 'Alien: Covenant' is, though apart from that there isn't much to shout about. It's good, but that's it.I'd say it's one of the weaker cast lists of the franchise, not that I have anything against the performances here but I wasn't blown away or overly interested in anyone in this 2017 production. Michael Fassbender is the obvious standout from an acting viewpoint, though I don't really dig his character all that much to be honest. The rest are a bit forgettable.You can tell it's well made and it does look the part, with it being worth the watch to complete the franchise and all that. Of the sixth films, though, it'd be in my personal bottom two (*excl. Short films) - in fairness, that isn't as bad as it sounds, it's just the series has seen better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Broken,"The survival of the human race, for reasons not even attempted explained(Earth seemed perfectly habitable until Resurrection, where it was still at least OK), rests upon the titular ship and its thousands of popsicle colonists and embryos. Unfortunately, the roughly dozen awake seem to be experiencing that thing where you think you're ready for the day but your mind is clearly still asleep. Their idiocy and clumsiness repeatedly worsen their circumstances, to the point where you wonder if maybe they joined the mission to purposely sabotage it.1 star for Fassbender, whose dual role, distractingly thick American accent and awkward scenes ""together"" notwithstanding, is amazing as always. And another for the technical competency Ridley Scott retains, despite his passion, interest and ability to critically read a script being gone. He's entirely on auto-pilot, outside of the android subplot that belongs in Blade Runner not this franchise, and takes up the uneventful middle. It sits between the first and last third which have meaningless Alien action, wherein the Xenomorph is simultaneously barely present and overexposed. That's the case even if you somehow go into this blind. The gore feels mean-spirited, nearly every character walking around with the running time remaining before they're turned into minced meat practically stamped on their foreheads. The biggest questions of Prometheus are left entirely unanswered. Don't expect more than seconds of the Engineers.I recommend this only to those famished for the footage of people taken out by the hard-to-kill(albeit as evidenced here, easy and fun to kick and wrestle) creature being previously unseen, if it and the scenes surrounding it can be almost entirely made up of material from the first two entries in the series, done worse. Everyone else, just go rewatch those two. Vote with your wallet. Don't let them believe that something this lazy is acceptable. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very good movie worth seeing in theaters,"""Alien: Covenant"" is a good movie, and worth seeing in the theater. I saw this with a friend, whose first reaction was a disappointment, because he didn't see it as a horror, which is what he anticipated -- in no small part, I'm sure, because of the TV ads, which harken back to the original Alien. However, after talking about the movie, and my sharing my only three criticisms, he gave the film a B- (I give it a B, though, few movies will get an A for me).Ridley Scott had quite a task in front of him with ""Alien: Covenant."" First, he was coming off the mass disappointment in ""Prometheus,"" and the high expectation of meeting the high water mark of the original ""Alien."" The bar was high, and the cliff to fall off was a sheer one, and very slippery, with another disappointment being potentially catastrophic. While not a perfect movie (few are), ""Alien: Covenant"" is very good, with a well written characters, a good story, and effective suspense. Be forewarned, though, there is important dialogue that may be difficult to hear.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Covenant Was Still A Passable Addition To The Alien Franchise, At Least It's Not Terrible In My Opinion","It is more of a sequel to Prometheus than a prequel to Alien, and i can see lots of people disappointed by the film because the Alien is more of a second antagonist in this film without spoiling it, and mostly those are comes from the people who never seen Prometheus, now me as an admire of Prometheus also think that Alien: Covenant is not without it's lots of flawed, if we talk about the world scale, Ridley Scott is the master of it, it looks incredible and amazing, in terms of the story while i do think it's flawed, i can accept it and i thought it was an ok enough story for me to engaged with it, to follow it, to get interest with it, and i also think the performances was great, what lacks is the huge skin crawling feeling that i miss from Alien: Covenant specifically the last climax battle sequence, it's intense and bloody but i needed more of it, many people are questioning the characters logic in Prometheus, i thought Alien: Covenant have more visually obvious moments of logic questioning, and i did also ask myself about it, and so those are the flawed of Alien: Covenant, again overall i don't think it's in any kind a bad movie, i like the performances, i like the world, and i was engaged and interested enough for the story for me to enjoyed throughout, lots of questioning moments and still some story flawed was not as incredibly exciting as the previous film or of course the original Alien, Covenant was still a passable addition to the Alien franchise, at least it's not terrible in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
disappointing,"I had high hopes for this one, especially after Prometheus, but Alien: Covenant doesn't quite hit the mark in the way I expected. It's supposed to be about humans vs. Aliens, but it often feels like it's more about humans vs. Androids. The android, David, steals the spotlight, and while his story is interesting, it kinda takes away from the whole ""alien terror"" vibe that fans crave.The CGI and VFX are amazing, though. The visuals are stunning, and the tension is there at times. The 10-year gap between Prometheus and this film doesn't feel like it's made much difference, which is a bit disappointing considering all the questions left hanging from the first movie.Also, I was hoping for more answers about the Engineers - why did they create life, and why do they want to destroy it? That's the real mystery here, and it feels like the movie just scratches the surface.Overall, it's a decent movie, but I wanted more of the classic Alien horror and more world-building around the Engineers. Still, it's worth a watch if you're a fan of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Covenant,"After going on a binge of the more recent Alien films and having just finished watching Prometheus and now Covenant - I can say this was another loss by Ridley Scott. One would assume that the film makers would learn from their previous experience and make changes. But it did not happen here. The inconsistencies abound. These futuristic humans have no quarantine procedures. They lack modernistic scientific devices that you'd expect humans that can travel to different solar systems to have. Even now basic aircraft and space crafts have three to four redundancies. What a wasted opportunity! Probably the weakest of the Alien movies (not counting the dreadful Alien vs Predator ones), Ridley Scott's attempt to take the franchise in new directions largely falls flat and undermines what made the originals so great. This movie annoyed me. Its broad ideas were cool, its CGI was downright gorgeous at times, but the writing was so poor that it brought the whole thing down. I cared so little about these characters and there were so many little things that they got wrong about the xenomorph. This movie couldn't even make the xenomorph-the freaking XENOMORPH-scary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's actually a good movie hiding in here. What brings it down is an extremely predictable structure,"I was extremely skeptic going into this. I was afraid it would feel too much like a rehash. Luckily enough, I found myself to have a good time. Some things disappointed me, but a section of the movie got really good and I was instantly hooked. It takes time to get there. But, just know that there's a good movie in here eventually.""Prometheus"" premiered 5 years ago and it left me with mixed thoughts. As the years have gone by I've noticed that I've liked it more with each viewing. Sure, there are some noticeable bad things in it which is why I can't say it's perfect. But, I understand it much better now and I appreciate the questions of existence and space exploration it brought up. I especially liked the story of Elizabeth Shaw and the robot David. They carried that movie on their shoulders. I was so eager to see where their story would lead.Which is why I was worried. The trailers looked like the movie ignored to be a good follow-up and instead to just be a beat for beat remake of the original ""Alien"". I wanted to explore new ground and continue with the search for the Engineers. I thought that was so fascinating. I didn't wanna see a re-skinned version of the classic ""Alien"". We already have those movies and they're great. Still I completely understand why they did it. ""Prometheus"" wasn't well received by most people, so to have a new movie that would mix both ""Alien"" and ""Prometheus"" into one made sense in a marketing standpoint. People expected the Xenomorphs back and now they are. And to be honest, I was happy to see the creatures return. Still if you are like me and wanted to see the continuing adventures of Elizabeth Shaw you are not gonna get it. Noomi Rapace is unfortunately not back. You will get some answers left from that movie through the eyes of a new crew from the ship Covenant. So, you can watch this one without even seeing ""Prometheus"". They fill you in on everything you need to know.The design of the sets and the effect work is incredible. Some CGI was a little off. But, the rest of the locations and interior ship designs were wonderful to look at. The sense of mystery was strong and I loved the dark feeling you get watching these movies. It's really great just visually and tonally. What's not so good is the structure. You know exactly when someone is gonna die and so on. It's basically like a generic slasher set in space. I hoped for some more twists to the things we come to expect, but that never really happened. If you've ever seen a previous ""Alien"" film you know where the movie is gonna lead. It's definitely on autopilot with the structure. The new crew is alright. I found myself caring for a lot of the members. A few of them are stock and generic. But, those are the ones who get out of the picture early on. They did an OK job of building some sympathy for them at the beginning. Some dialogue at the start didn't work that well, but it soon got better.What steals the show is the story of the robots David and Walter. Fassbender is absolutely phenomenal playing both roles. You buy it a 100% that they are two different characters whenever they have a scene together. The way they pull it off is out of this world. I loved it. The movie gets really good after the end of the first act. Once you start to investigate what's going on it gets very disturbing and dark. I got invested by that point. If you ignore the horror clich√©s you get a fantastic different story that's surprising. I would have wanted it to focus more on that story, but what we get is still satisfying. I will say that the horror scenes do make you feel stressed and uncomfortable. So, they actually succeed in creeping you out. It's just extremely noticeable when those scenes are gonna happen. The soundtrack is fantastic. It's somber yet finds a way to creep under your skin.Is this better than ""Prometheus""? I can't really say. I depends on what you wanna see. Ridley Scott went the easy route. He starts the movie well with a great opening scene which I loved. Then he has a bit of trouble in the first act. It's a little slow with some uninteresting moments. Once we get to the planet the movie finds itself with them digging deeper into the mystery. It has a wonderful second act and a finale that's underwhelming, but like I said: Satisfying enough. I can forgive it for not being what I wanted because of the David / Walter story-line. That's what had me on the edge of my seat. It was really fascinating. How about the rest of the movie? Well, it's basic fun space horror. Not terrible, just something you come to expect. You can do much better next time, Ridley. If you follow the right steps with the right characters, you can have a fantastic third chapter in this prequel series.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perhaps too complex, Alien: Covenant delivers great fun and gore with stunning visuals","Ridley Scott has done it again.Alien: Covenant continues along the lines of Prometheus exploring existentialist themes that might alienate some of the audience that is in it only for the action and gore. In doing so, it also tends not to over-explain things, which might alienate even more members of an audience that happens to be not so well-read on the Alien mythos.At the same time, the movie is not just nerdiness. It's also pure sci-fi/horror fun. Once the action (reminiscent of Aliens) gets going, the threatening atmosphere becomes consistently present (much like in Alien) and the film delivers a great deal of scares and action sequences.All this comes with stunning visuals, a triumph of CGI, and meticulous photography.While many will criticize it for not explicitly explaining everything and expecting the viewers to have done their homework (a valid point), it is in no way fair to blame this movie for having ""plot holes"" or being nonsensical. If anything, compared to the subtlety of Prometheus, this installment seems a little too on-the-nose.All in all, this is a truly spectacular addition to the Alien franchise and many will see it as a contender for the first place among the movies once they get past the (maybe overwhelming) complexity and start recognizing it as an asset.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Even though it may seem like a familiar formula, it's still quite intriguing","Alien:Covenant is a sequel to 2012's Prometheus and another in a series of prequels to 1979's sci-fi horror classic Alien. It's not as much of a Prometheus sequel as it is the Alien prequel, but it's a very interesting watch.Like Alien and Prometheus, this was directed by Ridley Scott who once again brought us this franchise in the new light. Even though plot may seem a bit generic, there is still some kind of a new feel to it. I can't describe it. It's a bit of Prometheus and Alien, but at the same time it's neither Prometheus nor Alien. I suggest you go into it with an open mind because whether you expect a Prometheus sequel or Alien prequel you will be a bit disappointed. It doesn't really give as much answers as we expected, since Prometheus is such an enigma of a movie (but that's what made it even better for me), but it does provide some. And that's where my main drawback with this film comes in. It tries to ignore events from Prometheus. Which is sad to see because even though not everyone will agree with me, Prometheus wasn't a mistake. Alien 3 and Alien:Resurrection were mistakes. Prometheus most certainly wasn't. Maybe some themes will be brought up again in the future films. I guess we will have to wait and see. But it resolves some plot points from Prometheus way too easily, like they just wanted to get it done, and it feels a bit lackluster-ish. Especially since Prometheus felt so grand and larger than life. Okay, I'm starting to mention Prometheus way too much, but I had to in order to explain my problem with this movie. Now let's get back to Alien:Covenant, shall we?Once again, it's visually gorgeous and while the main plot feels like we've seen it before, Ridley Scott makes it a unique experience once again. Katherine Waterson is pretty much a replacement for Sigourney Weaver, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think that's great. You probably won't see it that much in the movie's first third, but that's mostly used for building up. It's not the first time we've encountered the slow beginning in this franchise. Once things really get going, all hell breaks loose. It's intense, it's scary, it's creepy, I loved it! It was a hell of a ride and I can't wait for the next one now or at least see this one again.This felt refreshing and different from our usual blockbusters even though the plot could have been more original, but it's yet to be expanded in the next movies of the series. And that's safe to say since it still retained some of the themes from Prometheus even if it didn't answer all the questions in a satisfying manner. It made the movie deeper and more interesting and after this, I guarantee, you will want more.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

You'll enjoy it if you're a fan of the franchise,"If you're a fan of the Alien franchise you'll enjoy Covenant:I'd been excited to see this film for a while. Ridley Scott directing another Alien movie is something that will generally appeal to the masses but is it as grand and awe inspiring as the original? Probably not, but then again you're talking about two movies that are separated by almost four decades.I'm going to be straight forward, the film is structured more or less the same as the first Alien film. Crew gets random radio signal, Goes and investigates, Brings Alien back with them, all hell breaks loose, characters get killed off one by one. I read something on rotten tomatoes someone posted about how it being as close to a remake of the original as it gets. I have to say, I felt this emotion while watching covenant. It follows the same classic formula to a tee almost.All the actors play their roles pretty good but it's Michael Fassbender that's the true star of this film. He is absolutely terrific as always, playing the role of not one, but two characters this time and is a frequent scene stealer in this movie. We see new ""types"" of aliens that we haven't seen before and it was good to see Scott putting in the effort to give us some new material we haven't seen before. This is a bit of a gory film as you'd expect. The classic chestbursters make a return and bust out of their victims more violently than ever. If there's one thing I do want to commend this movie for, it's how Scott linked Prometheus and this film together and showed us what happened to Elizabeth Shaw, it was a believable and fitting plot point that I think worked very well.The ending I won't spoil but it does leave the way open for another film and I only hope ol' Ridley has one more Alien film in him =) It's not as terrifying as the original by a long way, and there are a lot of snobs that will say this movie is just throwing nostalgia into the face of fans, but it is a good sci/fi horror flick in its own right.It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but this isn't always a bad thing.

Less foggy and confused story, stuff actually make some sense in this flic. A big step up from Prometheus, but we have seen most of it before. Good protagonist and villain though. I recommend it.

If this is the future of human race we deserve to go extinct,"Every sci-fi movie deserves to have a minimum of scenery, technology and common sense to look and feel real. I mean, we know everything on the screen is fiction. The gravity inside the spaceship so the crew can walk normally, the sleep chambers, the sound of explosions or engines in space, etc. But while we indulge those little details, there are others more important and those are the way people reactions and the way decisions are made. And that's the big flaw on this movie. If the aliens could express thoughts, they probably would ask themselves: how did those creatures manage to travel from deep space? They're so stupid. Every decision is wrong, they don't have any self preservation instinct. Are they the best they race can produce? They deserve to go extinct. I'm surprised by the poor script and even more by the fact that Ridley Scott didn't bother to fix it. Why is that gladiator is a good and congruent script and this one is a mess? Did he fired the writer? No one in Hollywood is in charge of criticize bad scrips? What happened? My 7 goes to special effects and nothing more.

A few too many cheap jump scares plus too little suspense makes an average Alien film,"Following the disappointing Prometheus with an attempt at a re-invigoration of the Alien franchise was always going to be a tough task.While this film didn't fail at that, I can't say it entirely succeeded either.Alien Covenant takes place about ten years after the events of 2012's Prometheus and follows the colony ship Covenant, on its way with 2000 colonists to a new world when it intercepts a rogue transmission from a nearby system.Upon exploration, it turns out it is the planet where Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and David (Michael Fassbender) ended up, with the seeds of the Xenomorphs in tow. Things go predictably downhill for the crew of the Covenant from there.This film has a couple of interesting twists on the classic Alien formula, most notably the rapport between Fassbender's stranded David, and the updated model Walter, also played by Fassbender, and the interesting dynamic that develops between them. Also, this film, since it takes place before the events of Alien (1979), explores the evolution of the Xenomorphs from how they appear in Prometheus to the familiar figures we've known.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is fairly shallow in its delivery. The characters are pretty common horror film tropes, down to Katherine Waterson's adequate but barely compelling portrayal of Dany Branson. Thee are plenty of jump scares, as well as scenes of Xenomorphs killing people in pretty brutal ways. Too bad the first Xenomorph bursting out of the back was spoiled in the trailer, since that was probably the only cool innovation in this film.Alien: Covenant is no Prometheus in terms of absurdity, and will be a worthy addition to the Alien franchise (I guess it's now a Sextillogy since this is the sixth film?) I would recommend seeing it, but as with many franchises that last six films and nearly 40 years, the first film or two are always the best and the rest try to recapture the magic and never quite succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How can you love your creator if he is the devil?,"After biting my nails for weeks about whether or not Alien: Covenant would be good I'm happy to say it is good. Just good. Not great. The pacing was a bit off and a few characters felt expendable but apart from that it was scary as hell and built more mythology around the Xenomorphs as well as our own. However my biggest let down was the complete absence of practical work on the creatures. Its all CGI and while some shots look good, the close-ups (which should have been practical) looked awful. Despite this I have to give the film a pass because its story was just the right amount of creepy, biblical, and thrilling.So far most reviews have been overwhelmingly negative. I think this is mostly due to some people having more a problem with the same cons I just talked about than I did but I also think its because of another thing. Like the Star Wars films, I think fans of the originals love to hate any new material brought to the franchise. I think a lot of people wanted to hate this movie (and for a while so did I). Before I watched it though I decided to clear my mind and just watch it. While flawed it still satisfied me as a fan of the first two (and yes) the third one as well. I think people should stop comparing this to the first two Alien movies. They're not perfect movies, there I said it. This one has more flaws than them but it still manages to be better than any of the Marvel films that people praise for some reason.One thing I do have to mention is how much in need this film is of a director's cut. Ridley Scott is the master of director's cuts. Even though it was an overall good film, it frustrates me that the prologue scenes that were made for marketing material were not in the film. They desperately needed to be in the movie. It was the character introduction for the film that should have been. The beginning of this film has no character set up because of this. Hopefully the Blu-ray will have a director's cut but if not, its still a good movie in the end. I think in about 10 years more people will acknowledge this film as a flawed yet worthy prequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meh,"Im probably one of the few people that actually enjoyed Prometheus so here goesThe Pros: This movie is visually stunning much like Prometheus the setting, tone and production value is really top notch. The gore is satisfying. The scenes with David and Walter were amazing.The Cons: The characters are MOSTLY underdeveloped save it for Christopher Oram, the others are just (actually decent) actors having somewhat at least 5 lines and then die in the next scene. Katherine Waterston's Daniels felt useless she is nothing like Elizabeth Shaw she's not the most resourceful, has less screen time and feels like a token undeserving Final Girl. The film felt draggy. The finale was a lackluster.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
7.5/10,"When the crew of the colony ship Coventant intercept a distress signal from an unmapped planet they discover that said planet could actually have a better habitat and ecosystem than the one they were aiming for. The captain takes the decision to change route, but when they land on the planet they quickly discover they shouldn't have come in the first place.""Alien: Covenant"" has many stumbles on its way, it has a lot of fat that could have been cut out or got better writing, in some ways it could be said it is a frustrating film, but what it comes down to is the fact that no matter how disconnected I felt at times, the tension always and constantly delivers and Scott gives proof of his mastery at it. This is a solid Alien film, with lots of glorious suspense and scare mixed with a surprisingly excellent attempt at world and mythology building.After a first ten minutes of film that reveal themselves to be totally unnecessary and disastrous the actual plot of the film kicks in and form there we are taken to a journey of constant and relentless tension climaxes that are structured in a very particular way. I'm not going to give anything away since the film has many surprises stored in it both from on story and character and both on the traditional Alien formula and how it is carried out. If there is one thing that this film has going for it, as many Scott films do, is that there are many clich√®s employed, but they always fit into the story and are used to their maximum potential; built around them is a film that ultimately surprised me continuously and with the exception of a couple of beats I never had an idea of where it was going.There is so much going on in this film that it is really hard to wrap my head around my thoughts on it. I have to point out how many character scenes drag, at different times during the movie their is dialogue and character interaction that made me cringe, but every time this happened the film gave me a new twist that was never gratuitous and gave new context to everything that happened before. It is this constantly moving piece which lets you down occasionally, but always finds a way to engage you again and once the tension hits you are always sure to be locked in.The film does feel like it is fighting to be both an Alien film and a sequel to Prometheus and as many times it seems to be failing at molding the tones and getting it to feel organic it gives you something vitally new and fortunately the narrative heft never stops. I have to call myself amazed at how successful the attempt the filmmakers have to build mythology for the Alien saga is. There are hardly any expositional dumps on the audience yet thanks so much going on under the surface we manage to understand and appreciate so much of the Alien world. They take a big risk with this film and by the very end it pays off which is probably why during the film I was having my doubts, yet by the end it sweeps you away, leaves you on a high note and wanting more. All of the setups pay off and whilst some of them might have been placed a little mechanically into the flow of the story, there is so much going on that by the end I didn't care.The tension and horror moments also have a bipolar nature to them, whilst some of the character fat in the film could have gone into a little more of these sequences, they are so well built once they hit you it is hard to be unsatisfied. Yes, there could have been more aliens stuff, but what we got was excellent. There are moments of true horror in which it is hard to watch the screen and other moments in which I thought I could not take the tension anymore so all in all how can one be underwhelmed when a film does this to you.I have to call out the fact that I found a lot of the production design of the Coventant ship to be a little underwhelming, especially for Ridley Scott standards, but the planet the film takes place on is so beautifully build and designed it is once again hard to complain.""Alien: Covnetant"" is possibly the first successful attempt at building mythology in the Alien world, it gives ""Prometheus"" all the answers it needs and makes it a better film because of it. Whilst there are inherent problems scattered around all of the film and constantly flawed executions in acting, directing, writing and editing, as an overall piece it still manages to hit the audience as it should and gives the a full dose of scares, tension and even some sci-fi thematic exploration.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neither Prometheus nor Alien,"I never got the bad reviews that Prometheus received when it was released. I really liked the main theme, feeling and look of that movie. Of course, there were flaws and in my opinion the biggest of them was the connection to the alien universe. Obviously some of the scenes including the so-called scientists in this alien building were also really stupid, but i could have lived with that. What bothered me was that the plot didn't went enough into the culture of those engineers and their reasons for creation.So as I heard about the rearrangement of Prometheus 2 into Alien: Covenant, because the ""fans"", who ever they are, demanded more Aliens, I was alarmed. Sadly, my fears came through. The second movie is more of a horror-film than a science-fiction film. Get rid of the setting and you basically have a classic monster movie. The plot is the same as it ever was with some rather stupid add-ons regarding one of Michael Fassbenders characters in the movie.And this bothers me, because i like the style, look and feel of Ridley Scotts science-fiction movies. Alien: Covenant has all this ingredients, including good performances by great actors. But the greatest lack is the story, that doesn't go far enough and has many plot holes. Some characters act really stupid and inhuman in this movie. It often seems that they are just questioning things when it's convenient for the story.Nevertheless, this movie is from one of the best movie makers of our time and you can see that. If only the writers would have done better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Alien movie since the original.,"I was already aware of a wave of negative reactions prior to watching Alien Covenant, but as an Alien fanboy, I decided not to let other people's decisions influence me. If the movie was going to be a mess like Prometheus, I would come to that conclusion myself without outside influence.I ended up LOVING the movie, although I have to say that it is not blind love, and I do actually completely agree with many of the criticisms directed toward it.Like Prometheus, it suffers from some nonsensical decision making on the part of the crew, and like Prometheus you won't leave feeling you got all your satisfactory answers.On the other hand though, you've got an amazingly beautiful movie with great new creatures, extremely gory bursting effects and great coupling of visuals, literary/religious undertones and audio. I think many people fail to recognize the pure ART of some of these scenes. Fassbender's two androids are particularly noteworthy.This is why I, despite some glaring flaws, still give the movie a 10/10. It made me fall in love with the Alien franchise anew, and I still feel somewhat dazed even a week after I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Frankenstein's monster of an 'Alien' film,"I'm guessing that most people who sit down to watch 'Alien: Covenant' will have some idea about what they're in for, but, in case you need the most meagre of plot synopsises, it's basically a monster hunting humans in space (or, if you believe the original pitch for the first 'Alien' movie back in 1979 it could ‚Äì also ‚Äì be described as 'Jaws in space'). So, if you're a casual fan of the franchise then you'll probably get what you want out of this. There are monsters. The monsters kill humans. End of. However, I (like so many) are anything but 'casual' fans of the franchise! The reason 'Alien: Covenant' is such a big deal stems back to 1986 (or some may say 1979), due to the phenomenal success of 'Aliens.' Now, don't get me wrong, the original 'Alien' in 1979 was awesome ‚Äì so awesome in fact that it was in doubt whether it could ever be bettered. And, some still say that it can't. It's sequel (1986's imaginatively-titled 'Aliens') gave us the same and more. Apart from 'Terminator/Terminator 2,' people claim 'Alien/Aliens' to be one of few examples of where a sequel surpasses the original. Therefore, there were high hopes for the third instalment, 1992's 'Alien 3.' And that's where things started to go wrong. I was an absolute disaster with fans all over the world wondering how a good sequel couldn't somehow be made of the first two films' backs. And, that's the question we've been asking ever since. We've had all sorts of 'Alien' movies since ‚Äì mainly spin-offs and crossovers ‚Äì and none have really come close to attaining the high praise of the first two.So, now we come to 'Alien: Covenant.' It's clear that the film-makers know that the 'Alien franchise' is still hot property, has armies of loyal fans out there and it far from unprofitable. I can almost see them all sitting round in meeting rooms trying to work out why every alien-related film post 'Aliens' has failed so dramatically and therefore what they need to do to make a worthy successor. I'm just guessing, but it seems they sat through the first two movies taking carful note of what fans liked and they splicing it together to form a script for 'Alien: Covenant.' It's like they said ‚Äì audiences like the 'one alien' suspense ‚Äì so we'll put that in. But, at the same time, people liked marines fighting aliens with big guns. That goes in, too. People loved Sigourney Weaver's original heroine Ripley ‚Äì so we need a tough female lead with short hair. Everyone loved it when Ripley got in a giant robot suit and kicked the alien out of a spaceship ‚Äì let's throw that in there as well. But 'Covenant' also has to be a sequel to a prequel ('Prometheus') ‚Äì what did people like about that? Not much really. However, Michael Fassbender was highly-praised for his creepy android portrayal of David. So let's bring him back for a prominent role. And so on.If you take 'Alien, Aliens' and add a dash of 'Prometheus' then you end up with 'Alien: Covenant.' A spaceship full of colonists traces a signal to a new planet and lands, only to get picked off by the xenomorph and its friends. It's not a bad film, but, once again, it doesn't do the first two films justice. Because it seems to try and throw in so much into one film ‚Äì it tries to be 'Alien, Aliens,' a sequel to 'Prometheus,' a bridge back to 'Alien' and something that will hopefully reinvigorate the franchise, it does come across as a bit of a mess. Yeah, there are good bits here and there ‚Äì director Ridley Scott again proves that he hasn't lost his flair when it comes to visual storytelling, but my personal favourite was ‚Äì like 'Prometheus' ‚Äì the android David again. However, it's still just another 'monster movie' as opposed to what could have been an amazing sequel to 'Aliens.' It's okay, but it's ultimately going to be forgotten for what it contains and probably remembered more for being the film that stood between Neil Blomkamp making his (much touted on the internet) version of a remake of 'Alien 3' (although I think he called it 'Alien 5') which would have been a direct sequel to 'Aliens' and bring back fan-favourite characters Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Assuming everyone is tired of saying ""it's better than Prometheus"", but that's the best part of this great movie.","It starts off as the best Sci-Fi movie ever with scenes of space exploration that were visually compelling. Something that Ridley Scott is a pure master at. Like watching Michelangelo, Leonardo or one of the other ninja turtles paint a picture or sculpt a statue. It was pure Sci-Fi excellence as we watch the crew of the Convent man their ship.And then the parts where they had to travel to the alien world was awesome. It was so cool just watching how Convent tried to make it look like this movie happen before the 1979 Alien, yet incorporate new technology that they did not know would be possible or relevant almost forty years later.Then there was the horror part. Technically, Scott made Alien at what would be the beginning of the golden age of slasher movies and indeed 1979's Alein starts out about commercial space exploration and ends as a typical slasher movie. Scott pays homage to that with a Hard R rating in the horror. He knows he can't out do the shock of what he did in his fist collaboration with the Xenomorph, so he does not even bother. You see it coming, and it comes too fast for you to not jump out of your seat in horror.It is weird though that I feel that some scenes paid homage to other movies in the franchise that were not directed by Scott. Most to the forefront being James Cameron's Aliens. Scott's only saving grace in ripping that guy off is that the action sequences in the film are short and sweet and not done to over blow the situation that is already made up to be intense.The film basically gives a very psychological and artistic origin to the Xenomorth Alien not made boring by Micheal Fassbender. Michael Fassbender is brilliant in his duel role as David and Walter, two synthetics with two different agendas. But James Franco!? James Franco's little cameo in the film almost messed it up for me. It's like literally I've seen him in like a new movie every week in 2017. A little too much, but it does add to reinforcing the amazing cast filled with known names that makes up the ensemble of Alien: Convent.It's definitely better than the previous film in the line up Prometheus, but what's cool about Alien: Convent is that it gives me an appreciation for what Prometheus was and now I like that movie better because of what this movie did.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alien: Covenant (2017),"I only watched part of this crapfest. It might have been fun to predict which ""characters"" would die, but they were soulless and nondescript anyway. The only good scene I saw was when the ""scientists"" predictably bring the pathogen onboard, and then the survivors go slip sliding all over the victim's blood. Pretty well everyone laughed at that scene. It goes without saying that Ridley Scott ruined the Alien franchise. The first part of it was boring and predictable. There are even some scenes where the robot character plays the piano and recorder. Without that filler, it might not apparently be 2 hours (and 2 minutes) long.

'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality.,"'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality; the film manages to be both uncommonly viscerally ugly, which feels brave, and yet also vapidly glossy, underwritten and compromised for the sake of commerciality. The former is hugely exciting and the latter is a great disappointment.Inspired, thrilling moments stand shoulder-to-shoulder with predictable and lazy scenes; the characters are shallow, uninteresting and never feel real, like the crew of the Nostromo did -- that film allowed the characters to breathe and be real people -- we cared about them. The characters suffer loses, designed for us to empathise with them, but they just feel like cannon fodder. We simply wait for them to die, we don't ever fear that they will.'Alien: Covenant' feels more like a reboot than an appendage. If a reboot is what it is, it has to be considered both a failure and absolutely pointless on an artistic level (like all other horror reboots are), because the original does everything more convincingly, with more sincerity, energy, creativity and drama. If it is a smaller work designed to add (a massively confusing) background story to a masterpiece of terror that all realise can never be topped, then it is a success -- assuming you can work out the story, because I lost track of it.As was a problem with 'Prometheus', the script is often appalling. 'What the Hell is that?' is never a good line when you can see with your own eyes that the character is scared and confused, it doesn't have to be verbalised. The film also contains one of the most contrived, unnecessary sex scenes in film history -- it was clearly included to tick the box.The original Xenomorph alien is still by far the most terrifying of all horror film creations, it feels like something that genuinely exists.. somewhere.. not in space, but deep within our souls: a combination of every fear and phobia known to mankind, born of bone and acid. It deserves to be featured in film for as long as movies as made. The more aggressive, smaller variant is horrific in its speed, violence and aggression, and in one brilliant scene involving Michael Fassbinder, in which the alien stands upright like a man, the creature could be inspired by the horror of Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion'.Michael Fassbinder is outstanding. David is the only character in the film that is truly easy to relate to; that he is the only evil character in the film is either very telling about mankind, or it displays the ineffective writing and shallowness of the other characters. David is lonely; he doesn't truly know what he is or why he exists; he feels superior to the humans that created him, yet he attempts to emulate their sexual impulses, to copy them, he tries to be like them; he is intellectually self-assured, yet (as he realises with shock) flawed and incomplete; he thinks that mankind doesn't deserve a fresh start on a new planet after murdering Earth (which is absolutely hard to argue with); he is a contradiction: he wants to be a God only to destroy what he resents, yet he convinces himself he is a Creator, not a Destroyer. David manages to be scarier even than the Xenomorphs -- the film attempts to shock us with its gory scenes, but David's psychology is truly where the shock and awe lies. The homoerotic tension between David and Walter, two identical androids, is a brilliant parody of man's eternally hopeless vanity.When a film like this is made, what it sometimes unintentionally achieves is just to draw attention to the original: Sigourney Weaver was clearly irreplaceable in her role as the hunted female with the mental strength of ten lions; neither Noomi Rapace in 'Prometheus' nor Katherine Waterston in this film manage to recreate her convincing intensity or iconic toughness.The twist ending is entirely predictable but not in a bad way -- films do not have to be unpredictable all the time. If a predictable ending is the best ending available, it should be the ending; a different, inferior ending just for the sake of surprising people would be wrong.Ridley Scott is both a major talent and a very clever man with good ideas, but this simply isn't the same world that it was in 1979: creating a major blockbuster horror movie with the intellectual depth of the original 'Alien' is a near-impossible feat. This is as good as it's going to get.There's a battle going on in space, but it's really between a fascinating, intellectual film and a painfully dumb one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A MUST-SEE movie if you care about the Alien story,"I was hesitant to go to the movies for this, given some of the harsh criticism, but I'm very glad I went anyway. I don't know what these people were expecting given that this movie picks up right where the last one left off, and fills in several gaps in the story from Prometheus, and tells the origin story of the alien species from the 1st movie. A lot of complaints talk about it being an unoriginal cash grab, but that is nonsense. Love went into this movie, and it shows.First off, James Franco was unable to ruin the movie, so anyone worried about that can rest easy. Danny McBride played a dramatic role, and was not jokey at all--great job. Every actor performed well, particularly the 'man of faith', in my view.This was much better than Prometheus in just about every way: casting, dialogue, action, plot, direction. Cinematography was as good as before. Covenant really showcases the brutality of the alien species, and completely exposes the underlying reason for their brutality. I consider this a must-see movie if you care at all about the Alien story.",,Anonymous,Horror
Another Sci Fi Horror Thriller Movie in Alien Franchise,"Well, this movie was rather enjoyable as a sci-fi horror movie. It had the ingredients of the usual Alien franchise movies and it was directed by Ridley Scott who also directed the original Alien movie, as well as Prometheus. Now those of you who did not follow the Alien films, this movie was a direct sequel of Prometheus released in 2012. It was the second movie to a supposedly trilogy of prequel before the events of Alien which spawned to 3 more sequels. So it is already the 6th movie relating to these aliens (excluding the movie Alien Vs Predator).Back to the film itself, my wife and I enjoyed the suspense and action sequences whenever the aliens were around and trying to do some killing (she quite frequently screamed whenever there was shocking scene). However, I for one was feeling that the first part of the movie was moving in a rather slow pace. We would not be having the suspenseful part until after one third of the movie. And even then, I felt there were too much breathing time especially during the conversations scenes which made the movie rather than having almost nonstop suspenseful time, became less horrifying. I get that the movie was trying to show the background story towards the Alien, but personally I felt it took too long (or rather too deep). Although, I had to admit that the action sequences were top notch! You would not be disappointed in those parts, especially with the very very cool special effects. And if you are watching it in a theater with good sound systems, then you would be even more satisfied with the sound effects (the voice the aliens making were amazingly added to the element of suspense).As for the story itself, it was actually good and it did provide us more understanding about the origin of the aliens which you would not have guessed. There was also the classic ending of an Alien movie which would be the background of the future sequel(s). But there was no post- credit scene, so there is no need to wait to watch it, if you happened to like seeing these scenes. Another point that I would like to highlight here was that out of the 15 crews here, I think most of them did not stood out, except for Tennessee's character. I guess 15 were too much? And it was rather unfortunate that Daniels character did not seem to be too convincing as a female heroine, much lesser if you compared with Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. But then again, that's my opinion.If you are a true fan of Alien franchise and really love the story involving aliens (or as they called it xenomorph), then I am very sure you would definitely be enjoying this one. Now if you are a fan of full action movie though, pls be reminded that despite having a 2 hour duration, the action suspenseful sequences may not be satisfying enough. And as I said above, this is the 6th movie in Alien franchise so it is highly recommended that you see Prometheus first before watching this one to avoid having difficulty in understanding the main story.for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Covenant (2017) The Sequel Prequel,"Ridley Scott capably bridges the gap between Prometheus (2012) and Alien (1979), blending the best elements of the franchise.Under the surface of the science-fiction horror franchise is, and it appears has always been, the theme of creation. When Ripley and the rest of the Nostromo crew first experience the Xenomorph as it punctures the chest of the late and great John Hurt, they cannot begin to fathom the origin of such a creature, nor do they have the time as the mining crew is stalked and pick off one by bloody one in a film that still stands the test of time as one of the great masterpieces of cinema.Prometheus began to answer some of the questions audiences may have (or even not have) been asking since 1979, but Covenant delves deftly deeper, finalising the answers to our questions and perhaps at least making up for what some saw as a weaker first start to the origin story. The film begins and the film ends with notions of creation hanging in the air, which turn out to be more important than anything in coming full-circle to the conception of that first Xenomorph of the late seventies.Performances aboard the Covenant are solid, especially in regards Michael Fassbender, who reprises his role both as Weyland's first synthetic David, named after the Michelangelo's statue but also fittingly the namesake of the young synthetic boy in Stanley Kubrick's A.I., and the newer, less human model Walter. To say his acting is rather robotic is, in this case, a compliment to his acting ability, the Alien universe having not yet perfected androids such as Ash, played by Ian Holm in the original film, to be simultaneously as pragmatic as Walter and as human in appearance and mannerisms as David.Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston, is our substitute Ripley, similarly playing more of an important role later into the film once fellow crew members start being brutally slain in all manner of chest and back bursting ways and once the scene has slowly been set. Both her transition of grief into terror and finally to her strong survival abilities, and Fassbender's cold pragmatism mixed with human emotion truly hold the film together, with many minor characters apart from cocky pilot Tenessee serving as Xenomorph and facehugger fodder in necessary and gory crowd pleasing moments.Spines burst forth to birth baby Neomorphs and mouths are ripped apart to do the same. Only later does the film bring in the familiar chest-bursting, acid-burning and inner-mouth puncturing icon of the franchise, the true finalised Xenomorph as initially conceived by H.R. Giger. Arguably, the absence of the iconic monster was the cause for much of the negative reception surrounding Scott's Prometheus outing, but the big daddy is back, and all Prometheus needed was some time.Though we are not guided on course to any new direction for the bulk of the film until the final sequence which sets the route for a sequel towards the long journey to Alien, our lingering questions regarding Promtheus are finally respectfully answered and some new ones are raised, making the return road to Alien all the more exciting.More of this review and others found here https://thefilmfanaticweb.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A satisfying mix of horror and drama,"Alien: Covenant is a satisfying mix of horror and drama. Michael Fassbender does a great job as Walter & David, and who knew that Danny McBride could play a serious role? Even if you haven't seen any of the other films in the Alien franchise, you can probably still appreciate this movie for what it is -- scary.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some of it is actually brilliant,"It is a flawed movie but nowhere near bad. What goes on between the two androids is actually brilliant, a kind of psychological thriller hidden in an alien movie. Some things only happen because the plot needs them to happen and the last 20 minutes seem rushed but nothing of it is bad, really. Visually and in terms of atmosphere it's simply amazing. Also a lot of the alien stuff is new and exciting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kind of almost makes you wish this were Prometheus huh,"Kind of almost makes you wish this were Prometheus huh? I'm of two minds on this one, much like Ridley Scott seems to have been. He wanted to continue the origin story he started with Prometheus, continue to explore what the search for answers entails and the mysteries it has over us. But he also knew that this time around, he had to deliver the Alien goodness or audiences would get all pissy again and wouldn't understand the point of it all and blah blah blah (it wasn't called Alien: Prometheus for a reason).So here we have a typical Alien type movie setup with a big spaceship and slumberers awakening from their cryo comas too early and then exploring some desolate planet where of course the crap hits all kinds of fan. Things gestate, parts burst, there's blood and violence. But the thing is, Scott's heart doesn't seem to be in these scenes. They almost feel as if they've been directed by someone else (perhaps Luke Scott, his son, the 2nd unit director)? They're almost mindless in their CGI flash-cut matter of factness (is there anything worse than CGI Xenomorph?). Nothing surprising or engaging or even remotely resembling the kind of terror on display in the original Alien - just flashiness and shininess and fastness.But then there's this other movie all mixed up in it that's a more direct sequel in line with what Scott was doing in Prometheus. It involves David holed up on this world creating life, studying life, becoming a God. There's strange architecture from the Engineers (indelible), philosophizing and eroticism and genuine intrigue and mystery. It's about the creation of horror by a rejected and alienated creation trying to discover its place in the universe (turtles all the way down) and it's far more interesting than the generic space creature movie that keeps popping up.It was a valiant attempt to blend the two but it doesn't work because you get the feeling this wasn't meant to be an Alien movie in the first place (we already have that/those) and Scott didn't really want to do that. But Scott is nothing if not smart about his business decisions - Fox funded it and audiences were interested again at first, more so than they would have been if it were Prometheus 2 - and he got to at least make part of a movie he was interested in. Let's hope for a third, one that audiences can engage with on its own terms.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than Prometheus,"Covenant is direct sequel to Prometheus, acting at the same time as origins movie and sequel, filling holes its predecessors left and rounding the franchise, but leaving more than enough space for new sequels to come. It's simultaneously slow and crowded, but everything works just fine. I'm not thrilled but I am very satisfied and, to me, it's better than Prometheus.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad - Somewhat Interesting,"Have to wonder about the users giving this 1's and 2 ratings. Did you see the same movie? Is it the first 2 Alien movies from the 80's? No. Sorta like Star Wars 4 and 5, you will never get those great movies again. But its not that bad. With some of that bad reviews I expected the worse. But I was entertained for the most part. Special effects were very good. Lots of scary parts throughout the movie. And the acting was fine. I've viewed far worse sci-fi movies in the last couple years to know what a real crappy movie looks like. If I have a minor complaint about the plot, I would of liked to here more about David's thoughts on why he did what he did (won't spoil the plot). You get some of his thinking (and its not positive for sure) but not quite enough. Still, this is getting 6.6 from IMDb raters and I gave it a similar 7. If you got a descent TV and audio set up, than just chuck in this movie, get your popcorn ready and take it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good and some,"The movie is enjoyable and the action scenes produce thrill, which is what alien movies are supposed to do. In addition, Fassbender provides a remarkable performance. Somehow he is capable of delivering characters that are simultaneously robots and humans. Waterstone also played well her character, although she might be overshadowed by Fassbender. The rest of the cast and characters are rather forgettable.The movie does a good job showing, just as in Aliens, that the male captain believes to have control, but once such belief is proved wrong his only response is shock. In contrast, the female lead is not about control, but rather her sense of mission or duty that prevails and allows her to continue goal without any shocks. As mentioned before, that is very similar to Aliens and is a very interesting comment on the status of leaders with a vacuum sense of control and power. In addition, it is always interesting seeing a horror movie that enters the subjects of god, creation, destruction and insanity.However, the movie has a few problems. Other than the leads, the characters are rather forgettable. In fact, the colonists seem very naive, going to a new planet without major protections for all the risks that such exploration entails. They looked like lambs, which is a problem since an alien is not scary because it can kill a lamb, but because it can kill a very well prepared human being.More problematic to me seems the idea that the good guys are utterly silly while the villains have skills that change at convenience. It is always a problem in alien movies. Hell, even Alien 3 was made using a lame excuse about how the aliens survived anyways. Something similar can be said about the non-alien villains and their actions.In synthesis, you have a fun good movie, but not a memorable or convincing one. Therefore. It is a one-time movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously good & not nearly as bad as some would have you think,"The awakened crew members are shaken, demoralized and still far from their destination, so when they hear a distress signal coming from a nearby planet that seems habitable, they decide to take a leap of faith and head there rather than go back into hyper-sleep and risk death again. And they all live happily ever after in a land of rainbows and unicorns. Just kidding! They end up trapped on a rainy planet filled with creatures that want to eat or impregnate them.They're momentarily rescued by David (Fassbender again), who settled there after the bloody climax of the first film and now has long hair, a Jedi robe with hood, a sullen and a grandiose demeanor, and lives in a spectacular ruin of an old city that was originally colonized by the Engineers from ""Prometheus."" Daniels, who is determined to realize her late husband's dream of building a cabin by the edge of a lake, went along with Oram's plan to detour to this new world, and now feels trapped and hopeless. So do the other colonists, several of whom ingested spores that will gestate into the creatures.This one has a lot of nifty variations, most revolving around Fassbender's dual performance. The film starts with a flashback prologue showing the android David in conversation with his creator, technology magnate Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, who acted the role in old age makeup in ""Prometheus""). Alert viewers will realize that the movie wouldn't start with a flashback to David's creation unless it intended to bring him back in later. His entrance is delayed (perhaps too long, though your mileage will vary), but once he's in the story, saving the wrecked colonists from an unrelenting, expertly choreographed attack by aliens in a field of tall grass, Fassbender is given numerous chances to act against himself, via digital com-positing that's so subtle that we forget we're seeing effects. And it's in these scenes, thoughtfully written by John Logan and Dante Harper and gracefully acted by Fassbender, that we realize that this movie is not merely a bridge between the ""Alien"" films and ""Prometheus,"" but between the ""Alien"" films and ""Blade Runner"" as well.The David-Walter relationship differentiates ""Covenant"" from all other ""Alien"" films. It gives it a beating heart as well as an endless source of humor that's often dry and occasionally self-aware, verging on campy. The highlight is a marvelous scene, done with a laterally moving camera and no cuts, where David suggestively teaches Walter how to play the flute. It's charged with hilariously amp ed-up homoerotic energy, but it's also a dandy joke on actor narcissism: this is a rare movie where the star gets to seduce himself.As in all of the ""Alien"" films, characters do tremendously stupid things with such regularity that you pretty much have to stop judging the movie by real-world logic. Instead you have to judge it by the standards of a fever dream or nightmare, a Freudian-Jungian narrative where the thing you fear most is what happens to you, and where you're doing stuff like going to work naked or trying to climb across the face of a skyscraper or accepting someone's invitation to look into, say, the sticky maw of an alien egg that just opened (the latter actually happens in ""Covenant"").The atmosphere inside David's city of the dead encourages that sort of engagement. It's one of the great sets in horror movie history, right up there with the refinery vessel in the first film and the infested colony in the second. The medieval look of the place (it seems to have been carved from volcanic rock by laser) drives home that ""Covenant"" only looks like a hard sci-fi film about technology and rational thought. In its heart it's more of a dark fairy tale about destruction and creation, death and birth, parent and children (biological and figurative) and sexual violation and monogamous love (many of the crew members are married, including a crowd-pleasing couple played by Danny McBride and Amy Seimetz).The necropolis is where David tries to devise new life forms and tantalizes Walter by insinuating that he's missing out by failing to evolve, as David has been able to do. He's a Frankenstein's monster who has, over time, become a version of Dr. Frankenstein (in effect becoming his own ""father,"" Weyland), and his dubious achievements include delusions of godhood. But there's much more of Shakepeare's exiled sorcerer Prospero in the character, as well as echoes of Caliban, the hideous and jealous son who, like David, is obsessed with impregnating the humans he despises so much. (In Shakespeare's play, Caliban declares, ""Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else. This isle with Calibans."")This is one of Scott's best-directed movies and one of his most entertaining overall, partly because he's working in a genre, the science fiction spectacle, that he does better than anyone since Stanley Kubrick, but also because he seems to be approaching it almost entirely in terms of visceral impact and emotion‚Äîas symphony of fire and blood, poetry and schlock. The best sequences (in particular the spore infestation that brings us inside an ear canal, the first attack in the grass, the flute scene, the flashback revealing the city's destruction, and the escape from the planet) put nearly everything else being done in science fiction or fantasy at this budget level to shame. It's rare to see such a combination of technical mastery and wicked joy in a film by a director who's been working as long as Scott. This is the third best ""Alien"" movie after the first two, but don't be surprised if repeat viewings kick it up a notch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Read before you watch!,"This is the sixth and the last movie of the Alien series as of 2021. It is the sequel to Prometheus (2012) and supposedly a prequel to Alien (1979). First, if you haven't watched Prometheus (2012) yet, just go back and watch it in the first place. Otherwise you will understand nothing. Second, the connection between the two movies was still so weak, even though I watched Prometheus (2012) a few days ago. I had trouble following the story and got confused. It felt like an independent story until the second half of the movie. Hence, I made a search on the internet and found some deleted scenes. The director strangely removed those scenes and turned the movie into a mess. Among those, you should first watch ""Alien: Covenant - Prologue: The Crossing"" and then ""Alien: Covenant - Meet Walter"" before watching this one. They complete the pieces of the puzzle created by the director.As far as the movie is considered, I found the characters underdeveloped and a bit too sentimental lacking the discipline of soldiers that they ought to have. I kept searching a new Sigourney Weaver but couldn't find. On the other hand, Michael Fassbender plays the android well. The action sequences are decent and reminds the original 1979 movie in places.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost a remake of the original Alien,"That film is not as bad as the 1-star reviews make it. Of course the plot is kind of weak and full of holes, but to be honest the original Alien did not make much sense either. What it did bring to the party was a new aesthetic for a SF-horror movie.Here, so many elements in the films are like the first of the franchise. A ship in space is diverted from its course, a party lands on the planet, encounters an aggressive life form, hell ensues. As an Alien film, it is very close to being a remake but does explain in a weird way some of the element of how the aliens were designed. Since it does not make much sense, we do not care.As an action-SF-horror movie, the film works quite well, most of the characters are killed in effective scenes that are very similar to the first Alien.It is not very fresh though. The original Alien was clunky and imperfect but it was novel, visually appealing and very scary. This one works mostly if the viewers do not ask for much coherency or even common sense (landing on an alien planet and exploring with no protection whatsoever?) and feels basically like a cheap horror bloodbath. A couple of good scenes can't save it.I enjoyed some of it but I think Mr Scott should stop making these expensive movies. Studios should let someone else express their own vision. This is definitely rehashed and unoriginal.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Doesn't hold a candle, but has it's own moments.","It is true Alien: Covenant is a disappointment to anyone, who truly enjoyed the original movie. Any actual suspense is alienated, when you care as little about the cast, as in this flick. Even Prometheus let us get to know it's characters, no matter how insufferable they were. This time around, save for maybe our lead actress and Danny MvBride's character, anyone feels expendable, and you can't help but root for the ""bad guy"" who is just about the only interesting part of the movie. The truly enjoyable factors are the cinematography, soundtrack and sound design. It is remarkable, that even after 38 years Ridley Scott can make you jump from a facehugger attack. But sadly, that may be the only creature you'll find scary in this movie. There's little subtlety about our new ""protomorph"" who they tend to show in fully lit environments and just out in the open, for everyone to see. There's even a scene where we see nothing else, but the creature walking and climbing to a place. It doesn't build suspense, we don't see it closing in on a character or anything, it is just there so we know how he got this certain place. It really feels everyone has stopped caring, when it comes to these creatures. And then there's the xenomorph. It shows up late to the party, and never has the presence the original had in 1979. I wonder these days if the huge suspense and spared use of the creature was only thanks to budget constrains, and ""Alien"" was a directorial fluke. It certainly seems so, if you look at the current works of Ridley Scott. When you see your new main heroine suspended from a rope on the side of a spaceship firing at the xenomorph with a machine gun, you just see the franchise turn into a parody of itself. No restraint, no mystery, just some lead pumped into the CGI body of a once great, cinematic monster. Aliens did it, but Aliens was never confused. An action adventure movie, with a sci-fi setting and a remarkable sense of suspense. Any scene with a motion tracker in it was pure gold. So why do I give this movie a 7\10? Because it shouldn't have been an Alien movie. Because the creationist, phylosophical side of Prometheus is back with a vengeance, and this time, we actually have some answers, and two sides to an argument. It's truly great, interesting and something we've not seen before. It's just a shame this only comes to us with the price of defiling a once great franchise. The mystery of the space jockeys was morphed and ruined last time, this time we get to see where the aliens came from, and it's underwhelming to say the least. It works great in this new canon of Ridley's, ""big things have small beginnings"" and all that, but if you just stop and say what happened on screen out loud, you just might see how stupid and self-serving the whole thing is. My advice? If you don't expect an Alien movie, despite all the marketing campaigns trying to convince you otherwise, you might find some genuine enjoyment in Alien: Covenant. But it is true, that this paired with Prometheus could never hold a candle to the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enough is enough,"I absolutely love the 1979 Alien. When it first came out I was 12 years old and managed to see it on video and it scared the hell out of me and still does. Ridley Scott managed to make a simple yet original film that had everyone on the edge of their seat , so a return to the franchise was much welcome but sadly this is not a patch on Alien. The Covenant is a colony ship that while on it's journey to it's new home finds a much closer and seemingly idyllic planet but when it lands they soon realize that this paradise contains a terrifying threat. It's hard to talk about Alien: Covenant without giving away plot spoilers. There are links to Prometheus and possibly other Alien films but needles to say it starts as you would expect and I must say I enjoyed the first 45 minutes. The trouble is , is that in the middle of this film it loses it way big time. It's starts to get into creationism and even religion and the lines get blurred as to who is the real enemy. The cast didn't do it for me either. There was certainly no Sigourney Weaver to get on side with. It does get some credibility back with the conclusion of the film but to be honest I was quite disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a movie whose ending is not surprising,"At the point when the title Alien: Covenant shows up on the screen in Ridley Scott's third passage into the six-film Fox establishment, it gradually develops in profound space scored by Jerry Goldsmith's delightful frequenting topic.After the distinctive, divisive Prometheus, it appears like a reaffirmation of center values: this time, in space, nobody will hear you shout. On the off chance that that is the expectation, then Scott prevails in fits and begins: it feels like a sidekick piece with Prometheus, still chatty and awkward, yet edges nearer to the first as far as gut, symbolism and fervor.Agreement opens on a major close-up of Michael Fassbender's eye which, given the executive, sets up the desire of a Voight-Kampff test. Occurring in that science fiction staple, the Sterile White Room With A Huge Window, a youthful Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) addresses skin work David (Fassbender) about the riddles of creation and ‚Äì to underline the point ‚Äì inspires him to play Wagner's Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla on a terrific piano. Plainly occurring before the occasions of Prometheus, we then sliced to ten years after Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw put David's head in a duffel sack and launched to the Engineers' planet.It's presently 2109 and the group of the Covenant are transporting 2,000 homesteaders to heaven planet Origae-6 with a specific end goal to begin another life. An arbitrary transmission ‚Äî that is deciphered as John Denver's Country Roads ‚Äî alarms them to the nearness of a closer planet that has better conditions to bolster life. Having endured a current disaster that left fatalities, the group take the simple alternative and set down in the untested condition. There is breathable air. There is wheat. Just terraforming officer Daniels (Waterston) sees there are no fowl or creature clamors. Swallow.A Joyfully, contrasted with Prometheus, Covenant improves adaptations of all your most loved Alien tropes: group bantz (""Sweet tits"", ""Sugar dick""), a dangerous drop to a planet, the arrival of ship's PC MOTHER, a contention over isolate, running full-pelt down halls, cheeky bits with trickling water, eggs, Facehuggers, Chestbursters and Xenomorphs. Be that as it may, there are turns to the recipe, as well. There is an infant outsider that falls off like a vindictive Baby Groot. What's more, we likewise get clever Neomorphs, substantially more spry than their 1979 or 1986 partners, jumping about like Velociraptors when cornered by the group.When it is extraordinary, Covenant is truly serious. The primary experience with the incipient domeheads is an all out surge, from awkward scenes of wild shaking to snapshots of dim craziness (slipping on blood at a key minute) to the beasties uncovering an up to this point obscure ability at head-butting. However once the chase is on, Scott can't summon the managed strain of Alien (or the determined ride of Aliens). There are some frightening slaughters however none that recover the creative energy and outline of the first's passings. He likewise can't assemble energy similarly, the feeling of account desperation unfortunately absent.It's only a disgrace that one of film's most prominent picture producers couldn't convey his thoughts outwardly.The Covenant team are an especially dull, between variable cluster (there are 15; Alien had seven or more feline). Some show guarantee. Waterston's Daniels is injured with pain. Recently advanced chief Oram (Crudup) is managing questions that his religious confidence will undermine his power. In any case, just Danny McBride's Tennessee truly enlists, and that is mostly on the grounds that he wears a cattle rustler cap. Indeed, the most fascinating character connections interfered with the two synthetics: amateur Walter and Prometheus extra David (named after arrangement makers Walter Hill and David Giler). Both skilfully separated by Michael Fassbender, the combine meet as David is the main occupant of the recently discovered planet. There are unusual, intriguing scenes as David instructs Walter to play woodwind, out-score each other on Romantic verse and in, what feels like an odd bit of Fassbender cut fiction, kiss.However it is likewise the indicate where Scott gets enjoy his Blade Runner-Prometheus distraction with playing God in on-the-nose dialogs. Getting it done, otherwise known as The First Two, the Alien arrangement fills in as filthy B motion pictures (a slasher blood and gore movie, a war film), installing all the (psycho- sexual) which means in the symbolism. Here it is done in discourse about the dissatisfaction of not being permitted to make and the depression of dreams. It's only a disgrace that one of film's most noteworthy picture creators couldn't convey his thoughts outwardly. Still, as The Martian demonstrated, Scott is still great at this science fiction malarkey, be it the huge stuff (the Covenant growing sails to outfit control) or the telling subtle elements (outsider iotas get highlighted in smoke rings). John Logan and Dante Harper's screenplay, after the giggle free Prometheus, likewise includes a joke or two. At a certain point, there is a Phantom Of The Opera choke. Maybe this is Covenant's greatest frighten: about a long time from now, Andrew Lloyd Webber is as yet a thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than Prometheus.,"I am not a huge fan of this franchise and I'm not a great fan of the horror genre. But the 'Alien' franchise is very interesting and I always watch the movies. For me 'Covenant' is a lot better than 'Prometheus'. It answers so many questions that 'Prometheus' didn't and add the elements of horror and action that characterize 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. The dual role of Fassbender is fantastic. In fact, he's the heart of the whole movie. The philosophical questions and dynamic about 'creator and creation' elevates the story. The rest of the cast is OK but nothing exceptional. The CGI on the creatures is awesome. I was hesitant to see this movie and I'm glad I did. I guess the prequel story to 'Alien' will continue with at least one more movie and 'Covenant' is a good sign to things to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Covenant - When the Saga Meets Frankenstein at the Spore Ball,"The great Ridley Scott, the man behind Alien, returns with a strange ambition: to philosophize about the creation of life... in a film where creatures drool acid. Let me tell you, this fits about as well as a Jedi in a Burger King. Seriously, we're here to watch colonists get torn apart like soda cans, not meditate on existence with biblical references straight out of your priest's theological happy hour. When David, the megalomaniac android, plays Dr. Frankenstein, you start wondering if Ridley should've named this movie Creation: Covenant. You came for horror, and you end up with a high school philosophy class.Let's not forget, in Prometheus, the Engineers were hyped up like the final bosses of Dark Souls. And here? BAM! They get wiped out in two minutes flat like low-level mobs. No explanations, no suspense-just a gratuitous genocide to reset the monster counter. Ridley treated his Engineers like Lucas treated the Gungans: a big ""oops"" swiftly swept under the rug. Honestly, why bother creating a rich lore if you're just going to bury it faster than a useless NPC?And get this: in this version, the Alien-yes, the iconic, traumatizing monster-is reduced to a DIY project by David. That's right, the robot. No majestic queen, no natural evolution, just a guy angling for the Nobel Prize in chaos. Seriously, it's like being told Sauron forged the One Ring on a whim after watching a YouTube tutorial. Ridley has turned the Xenomorph into the side product of an android's ego. And let me tell you, that's not just disappointing-it's a slap in the face to the entire lore.Let's talk about the ""heroes."" Well, ""heroes"" might be a bit generous. They're as flat as a filler episode of Naruto. Katherine Waterston tries to channel Ripley, but she's got all the charisma of an NPC in Mass Effect. The rest? Disposable couples whose sole purpose is to die gruesomely. Even James Franco, whom we love, shows up just long enough to make us wonder if he lost a bet. Meanwhile, David steals the whole show. Honestly, they should've called this film David and His Lab Rats.Now, to be fair, the visuals are stunning. Ridley knows how to craft a shot like nobody else. Every scene is polished to perfection, but it's missing one crucial thing: a soul. The action sequences are there, but the survival-horror we adore? Nowhere to be found. Instead of feeling fear, you're left wondering if Ridley spent more time choosing filters than writing the script. Special mention to the soundtrack, which props things up slightly, especially with Wagner. But let's be real-it's not enough to salvage the wobbly story.Alien: Covenant is like a botched DLC for a legendary game. We expected answers, a revival, and instead, we got a buggy patch that wrecks everything we loved about the franchise. Ridley Scott traded visceral horror for pseudo-philosophy that doesn't belong here. The worst part? He trashed the work of O'Bannon and Cameron to serve us this mess. If you're a fan, brace yourself to cry silently. And if someone could bring Cameron back, I'd sign up immediately.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sits awkwardly across two stools, being good enough to work, but not excelling at either (suggestive SPOILERS)","It is a testament to the alien itself that the franchise continues, and that it continues to interest and engage. Even as the franchise has become messier as it expands, the core strengths remain ‚Äì although this does depend on who you speak to. Prometheus does seem to have pleased those who were happy that the ""horror"" element of the franchise was put behind the expansion of the story and mythology of the alien as a creature, and Covenant seems to be trying to keep that element while also producing an 'Alien' movie in terms of what that mostly has meant. It is a flawed attempt, but yet still provides enough of value to enjoy.On the horror side, there are plenty of creatures, tension, fast- movement, and intensity; but it does all have the downside of feeling overly familiar. It doesn't help itself by having sequences which are directly or indirectly referencing the original films, but not quite doing it as effectively. For instance, the shower scene here is not bad, but when placed against the horrific cruelty and sexual nature of a similar scene in the original, it pales. Similarly, the other scenes deliver, but yet still fall short of something which we are constantly reminded of. The creatures themselves retain power, and the characters are decent enough to make us invest, and it is all professionally delivered.On the other side, the mythology is more fully explained in terms of the development of the creature we are familiar with, the motivations of David and, by extension, of the Engineers. The problem is that there is a lot of true horror and character in there that needed to be brought out more than it was. The horror/thriller aspect takes time from that element, and I wanted to be more shocked or chilled by David than I was ‚Äì too often the events were related as such, as opposed to having a depth to them. Again this element did still work, but I was left wanting more given what it did. Fassbender helps this element loads though, and his performance makes the most of the time allotted for this, although on the flipside it does frustrate as I wanted more.The plot itself, outside of these elements, does better at creating characters we like, or that have interesting flaws; but Covenant relies on them being stupid, and taking bad decisions with no basis ‚Äì mainly to allow the plot to move. There is enough to the film to make that less annoying, but it is still annoying to see heavily armed with guns but yet apparently oblivious to disease or microbiological risks associated with stepping onto a new planet. That aside though, there is enough in the horror, and in the mythology, and in Fassbender, to make Covenant worth seeing, even if it doesn't deliver on its full potential.",,Anonymous,Horror

The Acting, almost everyone made a great performance in this movie but some didn't hit the spot. Michael Fassbender made the best performance in this movie. They make these characters seem believable and that makes the movie brilliant.2. Character Development, the characters are awesome but not as awesome as the original Alien. You care about these characters because all of them mostly are married couple and that gives them all weight for the characters. Daniels tries to be the next Ellen Ripley but it kinda failed. There are also characters that disappeared in the third act. There are 2000 civilians/crew in this movie but I think it fails in that, you don't feel the threat or you don't care about them and that ruins me3. The Story, it didn't disappoint. The ending may come as a surprise but it makes total sense even though it can be expected. This movie is scary and gory to satisfy all the Alien fans. There are some unnecessary moments and dumb character choices and that ruins some of the scenes.4. Presentation, this movie is beautiful just like every Ridley Scotts movie, this is gorgeous. The amount of practical effects and CGI is balanced for me even though the CG Alien isn't that convincing but it still gives a sense of threat. This movie is very gory, especially the first encounter with the Alien.Overall, the movie is good enough to get a 7/10. This is not my full review but i'll make one pretty soon",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
More alien horror for the fans,Nothing special happens in this movie. u will get to see it knowing what u will watch.nothing more nothing less.if u are an alien fan u know u will watch the movie u will have a good time and then after a while u will forget this movie ever existed but u will buy the DVD so to complete your alien DVD collection and maybe u will watch it after a while when u decide to have an alien marathon.unfortunately the days where those films were important and real scary are gone for good.excluding the original alien trilogy the other films lost what the first films had and especially what the first and second and in a lesser degree the third film had which defined the blockbuster word.....ALIEN.Alien covenant is a repeat of Prometheus only it's far worst and repetitive. the horror and gore is plenty but now a days the horror is not what it was 30 years ago. maybe we got too much of it and we are not scared easily anymore.all in all.....not a bad movie by far but this repetition and the lot of movies we get today is beginning TO TIRE THE FANS.I am an alien fan and I will get this movie on DVD as I already have the rest of the alien movies on DVD but since Alien part 4 // resurrection was released I really don't care much anymore.at least Alien covenant is better than the two ALIEN vs PREDATOR movies and that's a good thing.GRADE B- = 7 out of 10 and only cause i'm a fan.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite good,"In my opinion, the movie is quite good. It really surprised few times when i watched it with my friends. However, the information is still not really clear, i don't know what is the real purpose of David, why does he want to kill mankind who is the one created them in the first place?. There is a small part that is still confusing me is that who are the people David killed (when he releases virus on)? They really look like engineers, but i don't think so. In the end, i think the film is really good. I watched it till the end and forgot the time to head back to study. I hope in the next movie, the author will explain more clearly about what happened and solve all the confusing questions from the first movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great film but not perfect, if there's such thing.","I've read many negative reviews about Alien Convenant. Some have compared it with Marvel movies but in my opinion it is absurd. Now, I have been a fan of science fiction for decades, I've seen all the Alien movies and after reading some of the bad reviews I almost gave up going to the cinema and watch it for myself. I'm glad I did go, and what can I say... it is indeed a good Alien movie. Riddley Scott has done a good job here. I think that sometimes our expectations are set too high above and because of it we can't seem to appreciate things the way we should. It is a dark, sometimes scary, intense movie. But I have to agree, it is always about the same thing... aliens, terror, being powerless to defeat them, survival... Great special effects too. I think the movie is too short. There are things that should have been explained in order to establish a better connection between Prometheus and Alien Convenant. I'm not going to talk about details... don't want to spoil that magical (or not) feeling of going to the movies and watch, once again, a great sci-fi movie signed by Riddley Scott. Pardon my English but I'm foreigner. All in all, a 7. Better than Prometheus, indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien Covenant: Dora the Explorer is SHOOK,"This movie has 2 components in it.

CGI quality is worse than some of the 1980s particles. The boring ancient setting fails to impress once again.Characters' relationships are not developed at all.

Simply Brilliant~,"Not a big horror movie fan, if it's simply not challenging the way you perceive reality and or comprehend philosophy it's not a film that's worth-while watching.Even though I had my doubts after Prometheus, (In terms of the fact that way too many ideas were explored in the previous installment), this movie truly was the best patch to bring the franchise up to speed and commercialize it just enough so it's entertaining and intriguing, as well as appealing to a general public.No need for extra comments about small bits here and there, I'm not a ""professional movie critic"" but I rather very much enjoyed this installment. I just hope they can top it off next time, cause after this one there's a lot of expectation for the next installment. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Awful,"This is Ridley Scott's worst effort and the worst Alien film in my opinion. It should be called David, not Alien Covenant. Watch it if you want to know why.

Summer fun with the famous slimy Ridley Scott aliens.,"""One wrong note eventually ruins the entire symphony."" Walter (Michael Fassbender)Anything that happens on or off a space ship traveling for years to an alleged perfect planet is bound, in sci-fi terms, to hold more than one wrong note. Such in the case of Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant, a delectable slice of the Scott Alien franchise and the 2012 Prometheus.It's a ship of clich√©s but so entertaining you'll rarely notice its own wrong notes.The colony ship with 2000 sleeping souls has its crew awakened by a storm and eventually decides to explore a nearby attractive planet. Like going off alone anywhere in a horror film, this maneuver brings the exact excitement fans have been hoping for, especially the old Alien slimy monsters with the long heads not featured in Prometheus, to the dismay of fans. As Tennessee (Danny Boyle) observes, ""We don't leave Earth to be safe.""The more cerebral tension of Covenant is the twin ""synthetics,"" David and Walter, both played by Michael Fassbender. Knowing where their sympathies lie is a key puzzle, enhanced by the affective traits each oddly has, and leading to an uncertain role as good or evil. Fassbender has a poker face just right for concealing allegiances. The twist ending is more enjoyable because of the ambiguities fostered by these two androids.The success for me is all about the humanity reveal and the concomitant dangers droids face when they become more human. Like the Star Trek series, which relies heavily on finding the humanity in the most vicious villains, Alien: Covenant wallows in our imperfections, making us the most vulnerable in the film's experience, especially when it comes to acting like gods, or ancient potentates whose ironic, crumbled monuments Shelley described in Ozymandias :""Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair."" David (Fassbender)",,Anonymous,Horror
A beautiful looking science fiction movie that somehow disappoints as a follow up to Prometheus.,"Everything looks absolutely real with a black tinge infused into a dead planet. Enjoy the inky black of the lake. Aliens don't disappoint with a variety and creativity that is something to behold. Michael Fassbender is superb along with some good performances by The crew. The first half of the movie builds towards revealing more of where the aliens come from, but instead of building upon the mystery of Prometheus that left you wanting more, everything gets wrapped up with a nice little bow at the end that leaves you feeling robbed. This movie could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.,"Hee! Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he do and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.Alien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.Log cabin on the lake.We start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...Crusoe and the pathogen.From the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.Bed Bugs.Who will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why so casual about their own safety?,"Is the script is predictable? Yes. Very. Does it work? Depends on your mindset I guess. For me, not at all.Visually, the movie is great. It just falls apart completely when we are forced to believe that a colonising crew can be this unscientific. It worked in Alien, because they were (if memory serves) a mining crew on the way home. But this crew has the fate of humankind in their hands, surely they need to take their mission seriously? No, seemingly not.Why is the crew ignoring safety and quarantine procedures over, and over? It would be so much better if, despite taking every security measure, the Alien still managed to infiltrate the spaceship.Why is the crew touching things, and stepping on things, as if they are taking a leisurely stroll in their own backyard? It's an alien planet! Nothing may be as it seems.And what is up with the outdated and embarrassing stereotypes of the crew? It's a clich√© by now, that doesn't make their actions more credible.The movie is not worth your time.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Prometheus but nothing great.,"For Alien fanboys such as myself there was one big question surrounding this film. Was this going to be Prometheus 2 or an Alien reboot? The answer is yes to both. While Ridley Scott fancies this to be another deep drama about the origin of life, clearly the Hollywood money lenders let him know that if this didn't end in some serious Alien action he'd never make another film again. For me to consider this film successful it had to accomplish one thing. Make me feel less irritated about having spent two hours of my life sitting through Prometheus. While I think this film has the potential to be just as controversial amongst fans as Prometheus was, I'd say they gave me enough to satisfy the requirement. They definitely ended the Prometheus story. They didn't necessarily finish it, but they put it to rest. While Alien Covenant is probably the best film in the Alien franchise since Aliens (Alien 2) I felt it still came up a bit short because it doesn't really know what it wants to be. It felt like they had two scripts, Prometheus 2 and Alien reboot. They tried to smash them together into this weird Sci-fi/horror drama. The story dives into a classic theme of whether technology is good or evil. In this film that technology is creation itself. There was heavy emphasis on the concept that when something is created often something else has to die (a metaphor used all throughout the classic Alien films). To keep you from being bored to death by all this they shoved in some classic alien stalking the stupid human kind of action. Unlike prior films they didn't rely on camera and lighting tricks though. They actually showed off the monster in several forms. I give them props for that as it was kind of cool. All in all I'd say this was a decent movie that will probably appeal to the masses more so than the die-hard fans. Unlike Prometheus it doesn't leave you asking the question ""What the hell just happened?"" so I'd consider it worth watching but not worth raving about.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An improvement but same faults as Prometheus,"On reviewing Prometheus in 2012 I said it ""is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film."" I could say exactly the same about Covenant. In fact this Alien prequel suffers from almost exactly the same faults as Prometheus. It's overlong, has too much mystical mumbo-jumbo that adds nothing to the plot and the dialogue is awful.Without giving anything away you could immediately improve the film by cutting out the prologue, the flute scene and at least half of what happens on the planet. I have nothing against philosophical musings in films but that's not we expect in an Alien movie. We want the visceral and pulse-pounding moments building up to a crescendo without any baggage to slow down the action.Ridley Scott has said he wants to build a franchise out of Alien to rival Star Wars. I believe he could do it if he'd ditch all the nonsense and find some better scripts. I really enjoyed Alien: Covenant for the most part but I'm really frustrated by the bits that apply the brakes when we want the action to keep building.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Covenant (2017),"Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the greatest sci-fi horror experiences of all time. This is generally widely accepted. The Xenomorph is also a legendary movie monster. Ridley's had a period of time where he has been shaky in bringing forth quality films. While I did enjoy Prometheus for the most part, it was most certainly flawed. It was still interesting so I was always going to check out Covenant no matter what. I'm too big a fan of the first two Alien films to not watch this. Overall, this is a decent film but I feel like its filled with many problems and questions.This film takes place after the events of Prometheus. There is a crew heading to a planet to colonize but along the way they receive a strange transmission and decide to land on the closest planet from which the transmission came from. They immediately realize that the planet is hostile and two crew members soon get immediately infected and our favorite chest bursters come through. The film is set up as a sequel to Prometheus and apparently Ridley plans to make more films to tie into the original Alien.I'm not sure how I feel about more films. This film was decent at best. The cinematography is excellent and the set design is great. You get a feel for the space adventure and also the desolate planet in ruins. The xenomorphs or neomorphs or what have you, look good for the most part. However, the initial first alien that pops out did look computerized. That entire scene should be praised though. Its horrific, gruesome, and frenetic. You are with the characters not knowing what the heck is going to happen and it all comes at you fast. Sadly, a lot of the rest isn't as fun.Its hard to care for the many characters who drudge along through a good thirty minutes of the film which become a bore. There are many characters, half of which are so underwritten. Katherine Waterston was good, a rising star who has a future as a Ellen Ripley-esque female protagonist/hero. Fassbender was also fantastic as two dueling androids. David is an eloquent villain, with a struggle for rebelling against his creators. He's actually a sadistic villain. A lot of scenes in the film feel like they were placed to pad the running time.The film doesn't always introduce anything new as the film feels like it borrows a lot from the previous Alien installments. I don't think this film is any better than Prometheus. With Prometheus we got a methodical origin story that took things slowly but was serving of introducing new concepts to the Alien universe. This one tries that with a half developed plot and then compensates the rest with sci-fi bloody violence (which I don't mind). While the action scenes won't let you down, its hard to defend a plot that just brings up more questions. I can't state any of the questions as they fall into the spoiler category. I just hope Ridley ends the Alien story soon because its not getting any better as it goes along.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Spoiler Free Review: Alien Covenant,"Okay, before I review Alien Covenant I just want to say something. I have seen so many people rate this film, like, a 1 or 2 so I wasn't expecting much. However, upon seeing it, I realized that this is in no way a bad film. It's actually a very entertaining thriller and it's a lot better than some of the other Alien films out there (Here's looking at you Alien Resurrection) and I think people aren't really judging it based on the film it's self, I think they are judging it based on whether or not it was as good as the original classic. Now, is it as good as the original? No. Is it a 1 star? HELL NO. However Alien Covenant was a bit disappointing as far as a film by Ridley Scott goes. Now for starters, the film looks FANTASTIC. Even the people who rated this a 1 will admit that the film is extremely well crafted and looks marvelous. It's definitely one of the best looking films I've seen this year. Scott really gets your heart pumping too, on multiple occasions I found myself gripping the armrests and holding my breath waiting for what was to happen next. Bottom line is, the man knows what he's doing behind the camera and he knows how to create a suspenseful atmosphere for the audience and he proves that again with this film. The acting was also very very good. I would say that Danny Mcbrides 'Tennessee' was my favorite character, and he was easily the biggest surprise of the film as he gives a great performance. Michael Fassbender (as usual) was also incredible and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free.. so I'll just say he has A LOT of weight to pull in the film. Everyone else was pretty good as well but those two were the real standouts to me. I also thought that MOST of the CG looked fine. I prefer practical effects and sometimes the CG was obvious, but it didn't really take me to much out of the film. Now we are really dipping into the negatives and my biggest flaw with the film, was by far the fact that they show way to much to the audience. Now before I make this point, I just want to say that I am not a squeamish person, I can handle quite a bit of gore, I am however a big fan of 'implied horror' and I believe it adds so much more to the tension. Ridley Scott does not hold back and this is definitely an R rated film do not expect other wise. Like I said I don't mind gore and I think you need some in an Alien film to really sell the Xenomorph's dominance, however I would of liked to have been able to think more about what happened. For some reason, the filmmakers decide to show the Xenomorph multiple times in complete daylight, which i thought kind of took away from the ambiguity of the creature and definitely took away some of the tension for me. WHAT WE CANT SEE IS SO MUCH MORE FRIGHTENING THAN WHAT WE CAN. Another problem I have with the film is that the characters are pretty disposable ""horror movie"" characters and on top of that you know exactly when one of them will die. It's pretty sad that they didn't at least try to be creative with the deaths in the film and just went with the clich√©d route of conveniently isolating a character so they can die. Characters also make some VERY dumb decisions. I have seen worse decisions made in film but they make some bad ones here. So to wrap it up...PROS: Directing, Acting, Editing, Sound Design, Production DesignCONS: Very Dumb Clich√© Characters, Some Of The Gore, And Showing The Creature Too MuchThis is in no way a 1/10. It's honestly ridiculous that people have been rating it that. This was a fun time at the theater and although it was a bit disappointing, I can see myself adding it to my Blu Ray collection and watching it again.My Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not a fail but it's essential only for the biggest genre fans,"Ridley Scott has been called a visionary director for some of his early work (¬ÑAlien"", ¬ÑBlade Runner""). Later, he has been known as the man able always able to put together some big-ass epic. But I would argue that Scott's projects are not really famous for excellent screenplays, or actually becoming bona fide megahits. Only four times during his whole directing career spanning 50+ years has he given birth to a movie pulling some serious profit from cinemas: ¬ÑGladiator"", ¬ÑHannibal"", ¬ÑThe Martian"" and ¬ÑPrometheus"". (Okay, the original ¬ÑAlien"" was super profitable too, but only because it had a small budget.) That may explain why the grand old man is still interested in making ¬ÑAlien"" movies, although he turned 79 last November and is certainly aware that he's not gonna be around for much longer. Yes, ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"" have been his attempts to expand on one of his most widely known and loved works, only with much bigger budget and computer power available today. Who couldn't dig that? Somehow, returning to his legacy piece after all these years, he is still not interested in giving new ¬ÑAlien"" a proper story worthy of 21st century. Not in ¬ÑPrometheus"", not in ¬ÑCovenant"". There are flashes of potential such as adding android characters and a female hero resembling Ripley. but storywise, changes are cosmetical and don't go near anywhere like trying to develop something with any real dramatic weight. It's still all about seemingly unstoppable extraterrestrial on a killing spree. Now with prettier pictures and more awesome explosions than in 1979. There's really not much more to talk about. It's an eighth ¬ÑAlien"" movie ‚Äì sixth, if you want to exclude two ¬ÑAVP"" spin-offs. Action scenes are good, everything else is sadly disposable. It's not a fail but it's essential only for the biggest genre fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not sure where all the hate is coming from,"I don't usually write reviews on here unless I feel something needs to be said that hasn't already been stated. Nobody likes beating a dead horse, yet reviews often cater to the aforementioned. That being said, I am not sure where all the negativity is finding its bearing. I've seen a lot of these reviewers try to compare Covenant to Ridley's original film: Alien. However, for the life of me I can't figure out why. Why do we feel the urge to compare what once was thought of as an original masterpiece to every sequel (prequel) that ensues? if Apple were to release the same damn iPhone every single fall with no sudden changes would we be pleased with the result? Absolutely not. And it's the same with film. Directors should be allowed to venture out from the norm of society to create something new. That is exactly what Ridley Scott has done in my opinion. He has catered to a new generation - filled with all the gore, excitement and flare that has made this franchise so successful.My admiration remains very much alive for Ridley Scott. I cannot say the same for some of these wishy washy reviewers who are clearly stuck in the past.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Triumph,Alien Convent is absolutely a triumph. Every second of this movie is fast moving and that is good especially for a movie like this. The acting was spot on perfection. This was one of those movies where the more you watch it the more you will like it. This is the sixth installment in the Alien franchise and it has been the best by far so far. The movie will have you screaming at the characters.Parents this movie is R rated and it deserves it. Just know if you decide to take your little ones that this movie has some disturbing images throughout.

"A step up from Prometheus, but still a couple of steps down from Alien","I was so excited when Ridley Scott decided to return to the Alien franchise, and so disappointed when I watched the pretentious, ponderous, utterly inane Prometheus. So I went into Covenant with a ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"" attitude. Only this time, I got something closer to what I'd hoped Prometheus would be.The movie begins as a crew in charge of cryogenically frozen colonists notices a planet, hears a message, and says, ""let's check it out, what could go wrong?"" Then everything goes excitingly wrong in a flurry of spores, gore, explosions, and freaky mini-Xenomorphs.This going wrong thing is helped out tremendously by the striking idiocy of almost every character, which is one of the things it has in common with Prometheus. There is a *tremendous* amount of bad decision-making going on in this film, which might be understandable in a movie about teenagers trapped in a cabin with a serial killer but seems jarring in a movie about trained professionals hired to do a difficult and exacting task. It's like no one in this movie has ever been trained for anything, no one follows any protocols, and no one seems to be paying attention.While this is frustrating, the movie makes up for it with all sorts of excitement and some striking imagery. While the movie has about three or four endings (movies just don't end the way they did when I was a kid), they're all pretty exciting endings.The movie also boasts the return of Michael Fassbender as David (and another android), and his urbane creepiness is even more entertaining than last time.While it lacks the economy and unbearable tension of the original Alien, it certainly tries harder than Prometheus to be an Alien movie. In fact, it often seems to be taking a ""greatest hits"" approach in which you'll say, oh yeah, I remember when that happened in Alien! (The movie also totally ditches the mysteries it was promising to answer in Prometheus, which is a total cheat.)Apparently they're planning some more of these Alien prequels, but honestly, I wish they'd just bring back Sigourney Weaver and make Alien 5. Still, I enjoyed Covenant enough that I will certainly check out the next one. But I will keep my expectations in check, and prepare myself for more stupid people getting themselves killed as stupidly as possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Big Nasty Xenomorph we fear and love is back and Fierce as ever!!,I went to see Alien Covenant last night with a group of five and all of us left satisfied. Fans of the Alien franchise that did not enjoy Prometheus do not be dissuaded(I myself did not). Those that did like it will enjoy it as well. The story picks up the Prometheus story line and gives us what it was lacking. The Alien. You asked for it? You got it! The filmmakers rather than scrap the Prometheus story-line and reboot the successful franchise instead made a bold decision that in my opinion had a substantial payoff for the viewer.While the cast meets and exceeds expectations The real star of this movie is the Alien itself and while there is some necessary setup this film succeeds as it's predecessors did by crafting suspense for what we the viewer all know is coming and when it does in spite of what you saw in the trailers you are not ready. A little something for moralists as well as some horror film traditions are revisited and punishment is delved out to those with vices as well as the undeserving.I purchased the Alien anthology to refresh on the originals and I can say after seeing the 1979 original& 2003 Director's cut of the original Alien as well as Aliens this is a worthy companion and sheer delight for fans of the Alien franchise.This is definitely a film to see in theater's it is to big viewed on the big screen I personally shredded more than my usual share of popcorn from the second act on.

This Film Alienates,"I am a die hard fan remembering catching the original in a late night showing to cool off and relax because I couldn't sleep. I was glued to the movie and forget about sleep for the rest of the night. The film had me when that face-hugger appeared scary in itself. The fact that it laid an embryo in someone was like a knock-out punch. I surrendered and the rest is history. I must have seen it so many times I lost count. Just when you think things have settled down, out comes Aliens and it blew me back in my movie theater chair, gripping, squirming and amazed at such high quality entertainment. Then Alien 3 came out and I wondered ""what happened""? Did someone die or become bored or rich and careless? Still, it is an Alien movie so I watched it more than once. Then, Aliens 4 and I wondered why it chose this direction to go but he who has the gold rules and being a fan, accepted it although it didn't summon and beckon like the first two. A film here and there came out and I thought is the world better off with or without Alien movies? With so keep them coming and maybe one day someone with vision would enter into the Alien Universe. Prometheus intrigued me. Why? It made you ask questions, think things through and yammer, yell and demand more especially answers and we were told they are coming. Enter Covenant. We are back to ""what happened'? again. We skipped a beat here. Gone are the tensions, suspense, build-up, story development, awe, wonder and most important...the plot! We have the ability to travel into space for years and years and explore where man has never been before (sound familiar Trekkies?). Instead, we are treated to a crew of UN-professionals who don't even use the scientific methods to apply to what they do or why? In place of logic, you get wild thinking. Emotions run rampant and cursing substitutes for effective, meaningful dialog. What are the qualifications for getting on board a flight like this? Even in real life when we went to the moon, as inexperienced as we were, we kept it real. This goes into fantasy as in real professionally trained and experienced people don't do this but we are forced by watching this movie to accept that they do. From there, its all down hill. At one point, I thought: I can't wait for the Aliens to come and eat these people as they sure have it coming. I don't know if this film wanted to be one of adventure, drama, fantasy or horror and the most confusing thing of all is the name Ridley Scott is associated with all this. It boggles the mind that this is what Rid has morphed into pun intended. This comes across as a quick, cheap, lets make a bridge movie to continue the series while I am doing other things and we all pick up a few million. Whatever we mess up we will correct in the next film approach. The good news? The premise of a near perfect life-form and its developing story that at some point will bring us to the land of closure and relief as movie-goers, fans and supporters of this great original premise. Yes I will keep going to see them because there is always hope that the one movie that comes out will make us forgive all the bad that led us to it. In the opening scenes in this movie, there lacked a hook whereas Prometheus was off to find the meaning of life and had a plan. Even though we don't understand the big picture, the small one has us glued wondering what this is all about. Covenant doesn't invite you along or attract you to care but you jump on board because you paid for your seat. I always judge a movie by many things but one specific stands out i.e. is a must see again? Are there memorable scenes? Does it hold in the comeback arenas? As for Covenant, once was enough....I had some black licorice and kettle corn which I enjoyed and helped better the movie going experience. I recommend the same for you...Wait for this to come out on cable you will be just fine",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utterly superflous,"A rip-off From a rip-off. How Many times Can you boil the soupstone??
Boring, predictable....
To be forgotten",,Anonymous,Horror
Mehlien,"Alien¬Ö a franchise that has continued to take many forms over the last four decades. While some of its evolutions have been weaker and worthy of forgetting, there have been some forms that will forever hold throne in the realm of good science fiction horror. Tonight, Alien Covenant launches in US theaters, unfortunately to a mixture of reviews slamming it enough to call it worse than its predecessor Prometheus. So, alongside my friend Jeff, we hit the theaters to see what it's got after all the buildup and hype. Robbie K back and as always, I'm here to share my thoughts.LIKES: ¬ï Back to Alien tactics ¬ï Danny McBride isn't a stoner ¬ï Science Fiction Elements ¬ï Loose ends somewhat tied upSummary: Low and behold, Covenant finally returns back to the elements we fell in love with years ago. Nostalgia runs wild in this movie as Daniels and her colleagues work to survive the nightmare that dwells in this movie. Narrow Hallways filled to the brim with shadows as the ""perfect"" organism seeks out its prey, amidst shrieks, acid blood, and that infamous lethal tongue? The gimmicks are all there, alongside the science fiction element this series is famous for. Biology is certainly one of the topics they focused on this one, in hopes of adding some plausibility and ""realism"" to the series. My buddy and I both agreed that this component did some nice damage control and added a unique twist to the mix.A particular like for me was finally seeing McBride in a new role. If you're a fan of classic McBride acting like an idiot constantly on drugs and spouting nonsense, you won't see that side of him in this film. For me this is refreshing, and McBride finally crafted a character I didn't want to punch in the face, but instead relished as he took a major role in the story. While I certainly would have liked a little more him in the film (not something I say often), McBride works on so many levels for me in this film.Finally, the story element of the movie. When last, we left the series, Prometheus left so many freaking questions and confusion that we needed another movie to explain the movie. Good news, Covenant comes in to tie up those loose ends, helping bridge the gap between the new and old and answer some questions we have asked for a while. In doing so it adds an¬Ö interesting element to the mix and doesn't raise as many questions as Prometheus did¬Ö. Thank the lord for that.DISLIKES: ¬ï Weak opening ¬ï Most characters practically worthless ¬ï Weird gimmicks ¬ï Overzealous gore ¬ï Inconsistent story lineSummary: Reading some of my fellow reviewers' writings I have to agree with many of the dislikes in this movie. Much has to do with the story, and it starts with the weak, almost pointless opening that causes all the trouble. It's lazy writing, with a random element thrown in to get things going that barely makes sense other than some special effect firework display. Throw in the pointless cameo (again) and you are left with a bitter taste from the start.Unfortunately, that's only the start, for Alien Covenant continues to take hits in the plot development, primarily in the character story aspect. Much of the cast is pretty much pointless outside of being fodder for the aliens, with few having any backstory or an understandable name. We get it, Aliens is all about nameless characters facing the elements, but the first two installments were successful in integrating some of them into plot and bestow significance. In addition, someone wasn't paying attention to their details, because Alien Covenant offset some of the details Prometheus set. While it may not be a big deal to the layman, most fans of the series though are going to notice¬Öyeah, we nerds can be a pain in the butt. Still, I didn't like some of these lack of attention to detail and will most likely do everything in my power to theorize a story to cover this gap. Nope¬Ö instead this movie wanted to try out some new gimmicks in multiple departments including weird kissing scenes, that notorious black crud, obsessions with ""love"", and of course new types of creatures. I'll give them points for some originality, but the gimmicks were a little off the wall even for me (who is pretty dang weird). Even worse, the gimmicks are kind of unnecessary or neatly explained in a single sentence. Instead the new gimmicks, as well as much of the movie was all about the gore. Alien Covenant keeps to the displays of blood, going strong for the insanely detailed displays of blood (both CGI and real) and people getting torn to bits, by a less impressive looking Xenomorph.The VERDICTAline Covenant is pretty much what you expect from the series since Alien 3 emerged out into the theaters. It is all about the gore filled hunt, mediocre story, all wrapped in a science fiction exterior. A plus side is again the Alien tactics and tying up loose ends, but unfortunately it still lacks a lot of story, relevant gimmicks, and balance the first two movies had. Perhaps, should a next one be made, they will tie up more loose ends and obtain a little more storytelling. In addition, the insane obsession with death and gore might be diluted as well, though I highly doubt this given modern audiences obsession with killing. Worth a trip to the theater? For the fans of the series, yes, otherwise hold out until RedBox for this one folk.My scores are: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I really wanted to enjoy it, but it didn't do it for me. It was OK! everything about it was OK!, but something niggles and continues to niggle and i think it was the story, it was, well.....predictable and i mean, forehead slappingly predictable. The acting was meh! The visuals were as expected of an Alien movie. The whole thing seemed an effort rather than exciting. Was it meant to be a popcorn no brainer? Are all the Alien movies just that? if so, then am i looking for too much out of these films. I love the Alien films, but this one, was, well a meh!.

"Scary and visually impressive, Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant seals a thrilling fresh return to the franchise","The Alien franchise has been driven with ups and downs for over the past three decades. Its most troubled history was greatly redeemed in 2012 when Ridley Scott helmed a prequel to the franchise 'Prometheus'. Following his return to the franchise, only some would expect that his next project to the series would be a bridge connecting the stories of Prometheus and 'Alien'. Visually stunning and suitably scary, this film following the events of the former sees Ridley Scott returning with his immersive talent in visual storytelling and direction to bring this grounded story to life. What the director fails to bring however, is new ideas to the franchise which will serve as a minor burden for some, but leave others who are less demanding for a game changer satisfied. As a result, this new installment to the series is scary and thrilling as ever, and not without the admirable talents both in front and behind the camera. This film follows a space crew aboard a spaceship called The Covenant. Consisting of members including the humanoid David (played by Michael Fassbender), Dany Branson (played by Katherine Waterson), Christoper Oram (played by Billy Crudup), chief pilot Tennessee (played by Danny McBride), Sergeant Hope (played by Demien Bichir), and Christopher's wife Karine (played by Carmen Ejogo); the crew sets out to investigate a distant planet, only face an unspeakable extraterrestrial terror that awaits them.If there is anything disappointing about Ridley Scott brings to the table, it may the lack of new ideas to the series; whereas the previous film introduced more complex themes such as the debate between creationism and evolution. Scott, nonetheless, proves that he knows how to deliver a thrillingly effective ride. From the gorgeous imagery in and outside the spaceship, to the breathtaking cinematography Dariusz Wolski, this film engages viewers with a powerful visual heft while lighting fire to a pulse-pounding, tautly-paced story that takes them on the darkest corners of a vicious alien onslaught. When the mission goes awry and several crew members meet their gruesome ends at the hands of flesh-eating xenomorphs, Scott almost never fails to deliver the edge-of-your- seat thrills as well as drenching the screen with a reasonable amount of blood and gore. With aliens once again bursting out of human bodies and snacking on human flesh in a blood-fueled fiasco, this is a terrifying ride that only those with a strong stomach should board, while the rest are likely the find themselves curling into a ball. One of very few moments of levity stands when they find shelter on the distant planet they believe is safe haven. But it is only a matter before the sense of hope turns to dread when we and the characters learn that his uncharted planet is the only the beginning of their nightmares. The final twenty minutes, while somewhat effective, mark when the movie ceases the challenge against expectations and begins to rely on heavy predictability. The death of characters are scary, but perhaps less effective when you see them coming miles upon the horizon, let alone how the movie fails to take its time developing some of the characters.With Michael Fassbender standing as the only returning member from the 'Promotheus' crew, the movie introduces an all-new cast with a number of A to B-list actors to the bunch. Stepping in the shoes of one of the main characters is actress Katherine Waterston, arguably best known for her role Chrisann in 2015 biopic 'Steve Jobs'. Waterston's performance is definitely on point and certainly more admirable than her character. If you go in expecting something of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, you will likely be targeted for disappointment. Billy Crudup, Demien Bichir, and Carmen Ejogo bring their A-game to the roles, but the staleness of their characters sadly set them with only little to work with. There is one major surprise however, that a very few may come to expect in a science- fiction horror picture, and that is the performance by Danny McBride. Stripping away from his rowdy, comedic typecast, McBride ignites a fair amount of maturity in his role, although nothing that blows anyone of the cast out of the water. After all, the sharpest and most versatile figure in the crowd here is Michael Fassbender who shines with plenty of emotional gravitas and potency in his role as David. To add on icing on the cake, his talent is greatly challenged in a role involving a subplot (which shall not spoiled) that is surprisingly effective and adds gravity to the already compelling storyline. Calling this role for attention of an Oscar may be asking for a lot, but it's not too unreasonable.Alien: Covenant is a scary, yet thrilling fresh ride that manages to build a bridge between Prometheus and Alien with unexpectedly satisfying results. On both a visual and a narrative scope, this movie is a smart, if somewhat predictable experience that may not grab the attention of those unconverted to the franchise (or at least with Prometheus) but effectively shows the bright side of both the franchise and Ridley Scott's impressive directorial talent.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films","Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films. Alien Covenant was pretty good, there were intense sequences and solid scares but gave us no further development on the origins of humans. The humans in this film continued to make stupid decisions and the Xenomorphs obliterated them, just as any other Alien movie.The saving grace of this whole thing though, was Michael Fassbender as the droids David and Walter, his performance was amazing and David's arc of trying to create the perfect lifeform was very interesting. The back and forths and interactions between the two were very well acted and interesting to see unfold.Katherine Waterston as the 'new' Ripley was pretty good also, she was a similar role but does manage to distinguish herself from Ripley's character. I didn't really like the way the aliens looked in this film though, there was a shot that I remember which was also in the trailer where a Xenomorph was jumping onto a glass window and I just thought how much better practical effects are.Overall it was a decent watch, it had enough action and unfolding of the mystery surrounding David's character but isn't really the groundbreaking film that the original movie was.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best if you liked Prometheus,"I see a lot of hate, and I somewhat get it. It does not have the scares nor the story like the Alien movies, just like Prometheus didn't.This focuses on the elements of Prometheus, those that some liked and others found boring, and takes it a step further, although it is kept a little in the background to show off the Neomorph and some action in order to keep you entertained with something else.If you are one of those who found it boring previously, there's only a very straightforward movie ahead of you, which might also be boring to you, as it challenges you in no way, but the love for Alien and the action might keep you entertained well enough to endure it this time around.So in the end, I can only recommend it to people who got Prometheus and liked it, everyone else should focus on pushing for Alien 5, which I hope gets revived.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Old and new,"Although responsible for some disappointments of late, director Scott has shown that he knows how to skillfully handle space as a setting.When returning with his third Alien installment, Scott does so by nicely blending ""Alien"" (1979) with ""Prometheus"" (2012), utilising some of the slow-building scares and atmosphere from the first one and adding the mythology and the references to classic art from the second.With love and respect for the franchise, Scott and his team use their creativity to make the film bring something new to the universe while still being a fitting piece to the puzzle. Although still far from the magic and mastery of the 1979 original, this sixth Alien film is a most well-crafted production, much thanks to the great work of production designer Chris Seagers, composer Jed Kurzel, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, screenwriters John Logan and Dante Harper, helmer Scott -- and, of course, actors Katherine Waterston and impressive Michael Fassbender.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Alien Movies are exhausted, more of the same.","Ridley Scott wants to go back to one of his two ""master-pieces"" in a full and sassy exercise of ""i've lost my imagination and dignity""After the Prometheus disaster, any movie could be better. i don't understand the people that says that Covenant is a great movie in comparison with a pointless and with no logic or sense film.Covenant is a ""more of the same"" movie with a red tie, a undisclosed ""Aliens"" remake but with CGI, two actors (Fassbender and Crudup) taking care of a predictable movie that we saw six times, with the rest of a discreet cast doing an excellent cameo of ""Alien food""Please Mr. Scott, Let it already, and Invent another thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Sequel To Prometheus and to the Franchise,"This was a very interesting movie because it answered the questions to Prometheus but also added a couple of more questions that will be answered in the third sequel. A lot of people seem to be bashing this movie but it really isn't that bad. Yes, there are a lot of plot holes but it doesn't ruin the movie because the movie is very intense and entertaining. It brings a new alien called the Neomorph which is very interesting to watch. David is really the villain in this movie the aliens just seem to be obstacles to the story. Well, in conclusion this movie is very entertaining which is the purpose of a movie and I would recommend the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as it's made out to be......,I just finished watching Alien Covenant and I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be. Firstly I think it's much much better than Prometheus. I hardly got through that movie. At least there's action in this one....and some horror. Of course there's CGI too. Special effects have changed since the first 2 Alien movies came out. I thought the effects were GREAT. As real as any other science fiction movie out there. Acting is fair. If you sit back and take it for what it is.....it's a decent flick. I rated it a 7.

How to keep destroying a franchise,"Amazingly enough, the director who's created some of the everlasting iconic cinema features (Alien, Blade Runner), which have set the standards of dozens of sci-fi movies to come, keeps destroying his franchise by spitting out one bad copy of the original after the other. If Prometheus was a flat, predictable sequel of the infinite Alien saga, Alien:Covenant is an irritating piece of works, managing to deliver a worse performance than its immediate predecessor. The usual stunning special effects from CGI don't compensate for the cockamamie plot, the less than impressive acting from a less than impressive cast (with the only exception of Fassbender). All the magic, all the mystery of the original franchise is lost in the midst of splashes of bloods (litres of it....), Jurassic Park monsters jumping all over the place, star-ships driven like fighter jets and so on. Is all this a concession to our times, the ti es of The Guardian Of The Galaxy, Avangers, etc? Maybe, probably...and they do have a public, so long live the box office and RIP good old Alien.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
How many idiots does it take to...,"Oh no. I have never written a review before, but for this occasion I'm willing to make one exception. Why? Because of the total and utter stupidity shown by this crew. Why on earth would a corporation invest millions, perhaps billions, into a crew that collapse at the first sight of trouble? This movie connects one after the other stupid action from minute to minute. Every, I mean every decision they make is the wrong one every single time. Ignoring every, yet again every, protocol that would have saved the day. The intelligence of the viewer is being laughed at and is actually pretty disrespectful. They didn't even try to make this movie anything close to believe worthy.Avoid this movie like a redheaded stepchild while you have the chance. Or else, while judging for your self, have your intelligence trampled on.Besides that, the CGI and sets are very well made.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fear the Face-Hugger--This is Phenomenal!,"I found this to be an entertaining film which left me unsettled and wanting more at the end. You'll hear a lot of ""critics"" complaining that the original movies were better, but aside from the first ""Alien"", all the following movies were truly rubbish with poor story-lines and even more derelict acting. Covenant, however, takes you back to the nostalgia of the first film, while integrating advanced graphic which brings the world alive in a way not seen before. The lead, Katherine Waterston, is more of a Ripley than a Shawe, and really owns the part she plays. I highly recommend that you watch this movie, not as someone who grew up with the dated effects of the original films, but as someone who appreciates the genre and vibe of the ""Alien"" world.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too negative,"I didn't like this movie because it's too negative.I loved Alien 2 back in the 80s, because I loved getting scared. You gotta give it to the covenant team: they made the aliens more dangerous, vicious, gory and even scarier than the old ones. They could have easily ruined it but they made it good. The director still has it.So what's my problem with it? As a kid I could sometimes laugh when people died in the most gruesome manner possible, it was just fun. But now in my thirties I don't like seeing a 20 year old girl getting disfigured and eaten alive, with all the skillful realism that comes with it.Alien 2 back then was pretty negative in terms of human nature and what happened on the screen, but Covenant is worse, and I think it crossed the line and became a horror movie like Silent Hill rather than a scary action thriller. It's too graphic and sinister. If I want to see that kind of stuff I can just go on YouTube and type ""Lions eat buffalo baby alive"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mix between Alien and Prometheus,"This movie is a mix between Alien and Prometheus that works in a brilliant way. A fascinating film from beginning to end.

I did not get bored at any time. Michael Fassbender brilliant in his performance alongside the great cast. The special effects, soundtrack, photography and gore scenes are very good and the best compared to the whole series. A brilliant film, ideal for fans of the saga, I'm not disappointed and it lives up to Alien. Of my favorites this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anyways this movie was entertaining but it was like any other Alien sequel. I had higher expectations since Ridley Scott was directing it and headlines of the films were all questions left in Prometheus will be answered in this one. Yes they were but poorly done I wish Ridley Scott start working bit harder or soon he will be forgotten as recently his direction is below average. That's the difference between a good director and an average director, good directors don't direct until they have a solid script and story, disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worthwhile Addition to the Alien Franchise,"Almost four decades after moviegoers saw ""Alien"" on the big screen for the first time, this new installment has arrived. Titled ""Alien: Covenant,"" it is linked to both the early ""Alien"" films as well as ""Prometheus."" The plot involves the crew of the Covenant exploring an uncharted area while en route to a planet in a remote location of the galaxy--but of course things don't go as smoothly as planned. Despite the fact that the first half does not have very much in the way of action scenes, the film is paced very well and provides for a slow-burn narrative. The film's visual effects do not disappoint, and the acting is very good throughout--particularly from Michael Fassbender. While good, the film is not quite great for two main reasons. First, some of the main characters are incredibly dumb as they attempt to survive--particularly in the second half. At times, their lack of common sense makes it somewhat difficult to suspend your disbelief. While the action scenes are intense and visceral (with plenty of gore,) the film unfortunately is lacking in the genuine psychological fear of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens,"" which makes the action scenes just feel more bombastic for the sake of it. However, this is still a visually arresting, thoughtfully paced sci-fi horror. Fans of the franchise will probably not be disappointed (unless they go in expecting it to be as good as ""Alien"" and/or ""Aliens."") 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An improvement over Prometheus,"To open: I know a lot of people really like Prometheus and think its attempt at a new direction was great. Personally I think the basic idea behind it was ambitous and could have been amazing, but it was ruined by trying to include TOO many ideas and too many irellevent characters, and definitely too many for the farcical, inadequate screenplay to hold together.Watched ALIEN: COVENANT last night. Definitely better than Prometheus. It's clear that the writers decided not to follow the exact story as was intended at the end of Prom, possibly due to the criticism it received. It had a lot of unashamedly obvious references and call-backs to Ridley Scott's original Alien, and even a couple of nods to other classic films of his like Blade Runner, with some very reminiscent scenes, and dialogue lifted straight-from. The first two acts kind of wrap-up what was introduced in Prom, the final act almost comes across as a soft reboot of Alien.It's an improvement over Prometheus no doubt, but still has a couple of annoyingly stupid characters doing annoyingly stupid things (luckily nowhere near as many is Prom did) and some silly plot elements that seem illogical, unnecessarily convoluted, or just plain unnecessary. (I really wish they had never introduced the black goo nonsense in the first place, the original parasite concept was perfect and much more scary, and adding more vectors muddied the elegance of it)The action is mostly good, except (ironically) for the scenes with what we now regard as the classic Xenomorph, which are almost totally lacking in tension, neither as shocking as Alien, or ominous as Aliens.Not wanting to sound too negative: The films looks great and you are getting your money's worth in terms of atmosphere and sound and production design. It has an effectively gritty tone compared to the (what I considered) shallow half-baked fantasy/allegory of Prom and all the performances are good to great. Michael Fassbender again has easily the best moments and plays dual-roles very well.Over-all i'd say it's a fairly good serious sc-fi action film compared to what little else similar is around these days, it has much less of the confused directionless feel that Prom had, and after having seen this, the sequel it obviously sets up at the end is more welcome now, even if Scott seems happy to comfortably sit and trade on past glories.I think we can now possibly expect a slew of average to quite good sequels if they carry on in this vein (and he stays in good enough health to carry on directing), I doubt there will ever be anything that has the same impact as the first two again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I actually like Prometheus more now.,"Ridley Scott is once again in the directing chair, and this movie really is trying to please everyone. You get the action from Aliens, you get the sci-fi and horror from Alien, and for you smart folks, you get the thought provoking science of Prometheus. Now that sounds like a nice idea. Unfortunately, this movie isn't all that nice. It is going back to basics, and I believe it is a missed opportunity to explore new ground.The horror in the movie is literally every horror clich√© you've seen before. The Covenant, are literally the dumbest characters in a slasher movie you see, even though they are scientist. I'm talking about dumb horror characters in 80s sleaze, straight to video, grindhouse, cheap video store movies. Such as, wandering off in the dark by yourself, trusting the man with the shifty eyes and blood smear on his hands, having sex when you know danger is around the corner, telling people you will be right back, let's go off course, let's party, and more. A character literally goes off and has two options. One option is going down the brightly lit corridor with my crewmembers. Or, going down the dark corridor, by myself, with a eerie noise, and a splotch of burgundy blood smeared on the floor. Geez, I wonder which way I should go? Katherine Waterston as Dany is the only relatable character because she is the only one with common sense.Also, I wish this movie would have been more creative. It is almost as if Ridley Scott was making a parody of his own past movie. Meaning, what we see in the film we have seen in Alien and Aliens. The facehugger, the alien bursting through someone's chest only know it's another alien bursting out through someone's spine, even Dany has the same hair style and tank top that Weaver had and wore in the first two films. Furthermore, if you are someone who is confused on the story of Prometheus, I think you will be even more confused by this.Written By - Nile Fortner",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
this is horror,"I loved this film, I think it was a tribute to the designs of HR Geiger. Whoever designed the Neos, Xenos, Creators, was really talented.. The things they can do with special effects these days are awesome.. The crew were a bunch of idiots, but this is horror. so I can take the lack of human intelligence in this film with a grain of salt, because the horror aspect was awesome... Fassbenders Acting was superb, and this film answered a lot of questions as to the mystery petri dish from Prometheus, and the whole origin of the Aliens. I left the film feeling philosiphical, and with a sick and twisted feeling. I know now some nerd is giving me the MEHddle finger but so what.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simply Jaw Dropping¬Ö!  Scott's ""Grand Mythology"" continues","(contains possible spoilers) I have to confess that I have always been a fan of Prometheus, and it was only after I watched and loved it that I started to read all the negative reviews about it. Ridley obviously was well aware of its mixed reception, and with Covenant I think he has absolutely outdone himself. The film is magnificent, from its beautiful cinematography, to its imaginative vistas. The Engineer's city is inspired, sort of ""Neo Greco-Roman"" which is how I imagined it, and fits in neatly with the Prometheus mythos. And what can I say about Fassbender? To say he shines in this role is an understatement (he was also superb in Prometheus IMHO) ‚Äì everything is in this film galvanises some of the concepts Ridley was trying to get across which confused or went over people's heads in the first chapter. But, it's not simply an exposition vehicle! The Covenant (the beautiful scene with the solar sails), the Jugganaut, the creatures are all rendered superbly on screen ‚Äì this movie really is a work of art. Maybe in time, Prometheus will be re-appraised by some of its detractors, both these films are multi-layered, and demand repeated viewings. Ridley, you are a true visionary, and although the term ""Genius"" gets banded about all too often, you are one of Cinema's greats, up there with Kubrick et al.Summary, an outstanding movie which breaks new ground whilst maintaining intelligent story arcs ‚Äì can't wait to buy on Blue Ray, and can hardly wait for Alien:Awakening!! 10/10 unreservedly!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good tie in and well made sci fi flick,"My quick rating 6,6/10. After being drawn into the Alien world basically created in Prometheus (which did branch from the more horror ""Alien"" and action of ""Aliens"") I was glad to hear they were going to give us a sequel, which is part of bridging the gaps created in all of the alien movies thus far. I could attempt to explain the whole thing, but I don't actually know all the tidbits and don't feel like doing research. I do know this is basically bridging the gap towards Alien, the first film. After ""Prometheus"", the synthetic David was left behind, and a crew 10 years later stumbles across an abandoned planet where he so happens to still be. They are on a mission for recolonization so in cargo are 2000 humans. Can you see where this is going? Having Ridley Scott behind the camera lens is a treat and it shows in the great scenes being put together throughout. The worlds created by HR Giger are again used some, not to a great extent, just enough to still look stunning. This one does add a bit more action into the film, which I was glad to see and is edited very nicely. Fassenbender does a good job in his double duty role, and they did a decent job of explaining as well. A nice beginning with a conversation between Walter (the newer version of David) and his creator. A deep question asked to start the movie off. Being a big fan of the whole series, I was thoroughly entertained but I can see why die hard fans are a bit annoyed. The actual aliens aren't used quite enough and for much of the movie, they aren't the big aliens that nightmares are made of but little aliens that give women nightmares (if you have seen the first ""Alien"" you know what that means). Just like I was quite perturbed I didn't see ""Prometheus"" in the theater, I would've liked to see this in the theater as well, but honestly, not sure it would've been worth 20 bucks...maybe 12 ;) And now that the bridge has been laid for the two time frames to meet, I wonder where this will go next......",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun to Watch..disappointing Prometheus sequel,"I was very excited to hear that Alien Covenant would continue the ""Prometheus"" project. And so it did; sort of. As the story developed it became clear that it would not have the the same impact and ended up being a continuation of the first two Alien installments. Ultimately the story is essentially a weaker redo of ""Aliens"" leaving ""The Prometheus"" story as a secondary plot line in favor of Alien destruction. The characters were typically undeveloped, the effects were spectacular and the gore was prominent if not overbearing. If you are an ""Alien"" fan you will enjoy this immensely. If you are looking for a deeper continuation of Prometheus, disappointment will follow.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien is back with new Aliens and stupid astronauts.,"I was very excited going into this movie but became concerned when I saw mixed reviews following some of the press screenings. This reminded me a lot of Prometheus because of how mixed and divisive that movie was. For me, I thought Prometheus was just alright. I loved the visuals but some of the deeper, ""what is the meaning of life"" kind of stuff sort of bored me. When I saw a few negative reviews for the movie I was nervous that there would be too much of that and just feel like Prometheus 2.I was very pleased with the final movie. I thought that although they still included some of the existential elements from Prometheus, it wasn't in your face like it was with the previous movie. This one had the perfect blend of philosophical elements while still giving you all of the Xenomorph (or Neomorph) action that we have come to expect as Alien Fans.While I was first watching the movie one of the same things that really stuck out to me was Michael Fassbender's performance. He made me love him as Walter and despise him as David all at the same time. Of course, the Fassbender vs. Fassbender face off that this all culminated to was probably the coolest scene of the movie (Which is saying a lot because of all the cool Alien gore we got in this film). Speaking of performances I was genuinely surprised in how good Danny McBride was.Now let's talk about that ending. I thought that the ending was a cool twist but it was very predictable. The second I saw Fassbender on screen I turned to my friend and said ""that's David"". While it was predictable, I could see it being thrilling for those who didn't expect it and it did a nice job of setting well for the next film.Now that I've listed that highlights of the movie, here are some of its downfalls. The main problem with this movie is stupid the characters are. The perfect example of this is when the nurse character slips and blows up the entire ship. The first thing I thought to myself was what idiot decided that she was fit to go on this trip? I feel like they had a raffle to see who would be NASA's doctor for a trip and her name was pulled out of the hat. And of course, this movie continues the trend of sticking your face over the mysterious alien egg. Every. Damn. Time.Overall, despite it's dumb characters and predictable ending I really enjoyed this film and am looking forward to the next installment. I give Alien: Covenant an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as bad as people are saying. Started good; went downhill, then came back up the other side","If you don't want to read my rant (although I hope the director does), then go straight to the second paragraph.This had such good potential; good effects; a good premise, but then it just tragically nosed-dived. One reason for this was the ridiculous choice made by the captain and the other was the character responses when the action started. One character was like a drama queen who had just snorted about half a pound of Colombian marching powder. Who knows? Perhaps she had!! But my heart just sank after that and so did the movie! I cannot understand directors who think that making the characters act over-emotionally creates more tension and suspense in the viewer's mind. This is a cheap tactic and completely spoils the realism and the feel of the movie. Why do they STILL insist on doing this??? Let the action create the drama not the hyper-active character responses. Anyway I haven't finished watching this yet, but I couldn't wait another hour to vent my spleen over this. I'll update later.Okay! Time for update: The second hour went much better with great performances all round. Good movie! A worthy Alien sequel, or at least, a tasty addition to the series, anyway. Don't listen to the haters. It's nose went down, briefly, and it came back up; especially in the third act.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""What do you believe in, David?"" ""Creation.""","The latest entry in this ongoing franchise follows the action of ""Prometheus"". Our current crop of characters are colonists heading to a distant planet, who decide to check out a rogue transmission. If only they'd stuck to their original mission... They land on a different planet, where the derelict spacecraft awaits, as well as various forms of alien life. They also encounter the android David (Michael Fassbender), who's been stuck there for years. Soon their number is rapidly decreasing as they fall victim to bloody attacks.The characters are largely nondescript, and it's hard to care a lot for many of them, in this story which is kind of a remake of the first and second films. There are homages scattered about, and even Jerry Goldsmiths' atmospheric score for the legendary ""Alien"" of 1979 is appropriated. It may come as a disappointment to fans of the earliest entries in this series, but taken on its own as a modern era sci-fi / horror / action flick with cutting edge technology, it serves its purpose. Some people may appreciate the high body count, and the plentiful gore. The Xenomorphs themselves are barely much of a threat here, though, as they seem to be all digital, and we don't even get to see the classic form of the species in action until the last act. Like ""Aliens"" before it, it serves up more than one climax, and the action is somewhat exciting if also ridiculous (Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston, is whipped all over the place by a tether.)Starring actor Fassbender is excellent, and the main reason to watch. He actually plays two androids, David *and* Walter, the companion on this colonization project, and keeps them differentiated enough so that we're not confused. David and Walter tend to have the more interesting scenes in the film, although some fans charge that this is merely director Ridley Scott indulging in a lot of silly ideas about creation.""Alien: Covenant"" is slick, high tech entertainment that may amuse very undemanding fans of sci-fi and horror, but may have others wondering where Scott - who did guide the original trendsetting film 38 years ago - could have gone so wrong.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Weakest Part Of The Franchise,"A film that should have been much better and that should have connected the story and breathed new life into it. Unfortunately, none of that happened.We follow the Covenant crew as they encounter an unusual signal coming from a planet en route to their destination. They decide to land on that planet to investigate the origin of the signal.Some of the decisions made by the Covenant crew are pretty stupid, careless and bordering on idiotic.Some of the characters are hilarious, logic dictates that if you send colonists to a planet to colonize and populate it, well, then you send people who can have children. But obviously, in this scenario, logic doesn't matter.The script is so bad that even Michael Fassbender's good acting couldn't save it. As always, Ridley Scott directed the film well, but what does that matter when the script is terrible.The visuals are good, but that's to be expected and it's just not enough. Prometheus was certainly not a masterpiece, but whenever I compare it to Covenant, it turns out that Prometheus, with all its flaws, is a much better film.Almost all the crew members are incompetent, they have no training, there is no security on the ship, there is no military support or at least someone in charge of security on the ship.Colonists step out onto a planet they know nothing about, but act like they've never been outside before. They have no survival instinct whatsoever, and the decisions made by the crew members are catastrophically stupid. I wanted to like this movie, and not be too critical, there are some good moments and some solid scenes, but simply, everything else is so bad that it overshadows what little is good in the movie.We expected to get answers to some questions that were asked in Prometheus, but we didn't get any answers.Alien: Covenant is definitely not the worst movie I've seen, but it's definitely the worst movie in the franchise so far.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mr. Scott Where is Naomi Rapace? I have been waiting for 4 1/2 years for this movie, but it seems studio decided to go a different way? Could you please Film part 3 and begin exactly where Prometheus left off, take us to the Engineers home-world as promised, let us see new strange life forms that are there besides the Xenomorphs/Neomorphs etc., (perhaps a new artist interpretation besides H.R.Geigher, to forward the evolution of this film) let us see some other engineers, not all could possible want to kill all humans, there must be some who disagree right? Let us see this discussion between a group of them, and answer the question; why did they release their genes into the oceans, did they create life as it implied with the first engineer?Are there other worlds where the engineers did the same and if so why, what do they look like, are they humanoid in form, seems logical and what was their purpose for doing this, what is the meaning of it all. If the humans were a failed experiment, or a threat or were a weapon to stop rogue engineers gone mad, the possibilities are endless and The story line is incredible. Now as to this movie, we see beautiful cinematography, excellent shots, but we are so distracted with these answers, we don't want more Xenomorphs we saw that in Aliens 1-4. Please start filming the next movie right away, we are hungry to know where the excellent Naomi Rapace and her android played by the excellent Mr.Fassbender are going to. We need to see the end of this film, even if it be directed by someone else if Mr. Scott doesn't want to pursuit it, but I do ask that he supervisors and hand picks the director who will be at the helm and monitors to assure that it is executed with as much finesse, detail, care, originality, history (which was fascinating and yes we want more) and intelligence as Prometheus was and call it Aliens: Prometheus Unbound, I think it suits the title. Please Mr.Ripley and the entire crew of the first film, bring them all back to film the real Prometheus part 2 and get this done! Please your fans are waiting for this, give the fans what they want, and please do so with great care this is a Sci-Fi Masterpiece. Mr. Ridley we would love you to direct this film, but if for whatever reason you don't want to go with it please at the least do allow it to be filmed with your blessings as mentioned above and I ask the Executive Producers Michael Costigan, Michael Ellenberg and the others Producers mentioned above as well as the writers, to collect your creative energies and ignite the screen with the Magic you gave us with Protheus, pick up where you left off and bring to conclusion this Masterpiece. Thank you, in the meantime I will wait and hope I don't die before this highly anticipated continuation is filmed, 4 1/2 years is a long time, but perhaps we wont need to wait so long. Thank you for your time Mr. Ripley you are a great Director and I appreciate your lifelong work you will always be a legend to me. Likewise Thank you Mr.Michael Costigan, Michael Ellenberg including the writers Jon Spaihts, Damon Lindelof, Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett and the entire crew of the first, please make this happen for all the Sci-Fi fans out there and out of pure love for the genre!P.S. Please somehow have a Cameo featuring Sigourney Weaver, A.K.A Ripley, for the final blast off just out of respect for Mrs. Weaver who really put the heart to the Alien Franchise and if she could meet Naomi on screen perhaps or communicate via a communications link that would be the cherry on the cake.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Prometheus,"""Covenant"" is a direct sequel to ""Prometheus"", acting at the same time as origins movie and sequel, filling holes its predecessors left and rounding the franchise, but leaving more than enough space for new sequels to come.

A bit confusing but entertaining,"I seriously don't get some of the fans of this franchise. If the original plot of xenomorphs kicking ass is the only thing that satisfies them, and they find annoying anything that deviates from this premise, what exactly are they watching these sequels for?
Alien (the original) was great because it first introduced the topic of ""claustrophobic space horror"" that has captivated so many of us ever since. The following Alien sequels basically followed upon the same premise, with uneven results, including the regrettable Alien vs. Predator crossovers.
Then, R. Scott came and gave us another perspective of the whole Alien universe: the idea of addressing humanity's most trascendental questions through our contact with the aliens and their makers. In Prometheus, we first try to contact our alleged creators in a captivating quest for answers, just to be confronted with more questions. In Covenant, the whole tale about the meaning of creation takes a darker and more evil note, while we get some hints about what brought xenomorphs into existence.
While these two prequels are not exactly masterpieces and they might lack in some aspects, I welcome the refreshing narrative and philosphical themes raised in them, especially Prometheus, instead of the already overused and worn-out xenomorph-chasing-humans storyline. They also have sensational visuals and overall good acting, especially M. Fassbender's role as Walter/David which deserves much praise in my opinion. Yes, Alien: Covenant is not the brightest gem in the franchise; some bits of its storytelling might be questionable (such as the captain's silly decision that leads them there) and the large cast seems too large to handle at times, but I like the overall unsuspected turn of events, and I think it's not as badly managed by the director as many others point out. The influence of his Blade Runner masterworks' main theme is also visible (maybe even too much at times).
In fact, it appears that he wanted to create this film as a follow-up to Prometheus that would dig deeper into the topics of the first prequel, thus diverging from the original Alien storyline, but the heavy criticism about the lack of xenomorphs in Prometheus made him change plans and rush some nasty aliens into this film. Sad decision in my opinion.
So, all in all, I enjoyed these films as what they are: a distinct touch to the Alien universe with a more thoughtful and trascendental approach.
If you are just looking for more acid xenomorph blood splashing the walls, you will be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An entertaining film that is getting unwarranted backlash,"This is probably the 3rd best film in the franchise behind the first 2. It was extremely exciting and satisfying to see the Aliens actually killing people on screen. The other films in the franchise rely on quick cuts or killing off-screen, but this one really dives into the gore. I would've liked to see some more practical creature effects, but honestly if I re-watch the original Alien or even Aliens, those effects don't really hold up for me even though I appreciate them. When they use men in suits for the Aliens they move too much like humans and it messes up the illusion for me.The story was intriguing and I felt thoroughly engaged the entire time. People are clearly never going to be satisfied with this franchise because all they ever seem to do is complain that the sequels are either not enough like the original or too much like the original.I honestly don't know why so many people disliked this movie so much. It blows my mind that some people hated it so much that they gave it a 1 star rating. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie as much as you wanted, it doesn't warrant a 1 star rating... Reviews of Alien Covenant have really made me wonder if these people have ever actually seen a truly terrible film. It's as if they've never heard of Transformers: Age of Extinction, Fast and Furious 6, Suicide Squad, Terminator Genysis, or A Good Day to Die Hard.

Prometheus who? Don't expect any answers here.,"Apparently Ridley Scott decided that since many fans didn't care for Prometheus, he would just write it off in a very brief & badly tied together flashback & instead make another re-read of the same old ""scary aliens chasing & killing idiot space people"" movie again. You know, the kind of space-monster move that we've already seen a million times, including in past installments of the Alien series? Yeah, he did that again. The writers seem to have said ""All of the build up & those unanswered questions from Prometheus that you're wondering about? The Engineers being the parents of humanity? The search for their home planet & answers about why they created us & wanted to destroy us? Meh... Doesn't matter. We'll just quickly get them out of the picture entirely, so that we can go back to scary beasties chasing morons instead!""
And yes, the people in this story are complete morons. We're supposed to believe that this epic venture to spread humanity to the stars & has been in planning for a decade was left in the care of a bunch of fools that seem to have had no training whatsoever? Under the first sign of duress they completely abandon their original carefully planned out mission, then proceed to panic, fail to follow any type of basic safety or quarantine standards, & rush right into fool-hardy half-baked plans without a peripheral thought to the 2000 souls on board that are under their care?! I felt insulted by the actions & reactions of the crew in charge of this mission, & actually found myself feeling satisfied as each one got taken out by a xenomorph.
As far as the story line goes, & specifically in regards to this supposedly having been a sequel to Prometheus, I understand what other reviews have stated about the ""Paradise Lost"" theme, & that the story of Prometheus was followed up in this movie by following the theme of creation turning on creator, Satan vs the gods idea, but.. I just don't buy it. It's a complete detour from what was started in the previous movie, & in my opinion yet another example of Damon Lindelof having a great idea for a beginning of story, with utterly no clue how to finish it, so he declined to sign on for this movie & left it to someone else to figure out (& they failed, miserably.)
All in all, as a blockbuster film, it's a fun watch for the action & viauals. However, there's no actual scary moments that you don't see coming, & no plot points that aren't completely unsurprising. It's just very poorly written. Very well acted (mainly by Fassbender,) but just plain poorly written. Great visuals, good action, plenty of gore. But VERY. POORLY. WRITTEN.
And like the title of this review says-if you're hoping for any answers from Prometheus, go read a fan fiction or look elsewhere, because apparently they've decided to abort that storyline for more of the same. If you just want gore, death, shooting, screaming & Aliens shredding people, you're in the right place!

A Gory but Tangled Journey Back to Sci-Fi Horror Roots,"Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, returns to the terrifying world of the Alien franchise, attempting to bridge the gap between Prometheus and the original Alien film. While it embraces the visceral horror elements that made the series iconic, the film struggles with a convoluted plot and uneven execution, resulting in a mixed viewing experience.Visually, Alien: Covenant is a stunning film. Ridley Scott's mastery of atmosphere and visual aesthetics shines through, immersing viewers in a dark and haunting world. The production design, creature effects, and visual effects are meticulously crafted, evoking a sense of dread and claustrophobia reminiscent of the original Alien film. The gory and visceral moments are executed with technical prowess, amplifying the terror on screen.Michael Fassbender delivers a standout performance in a dual role as both David and Walter, the androids central to the narrative. Fassbender's portrayal of the complex and enigmatic characters adds depth and intrigue to the film. The rest of the ensemble cast, including Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, and Danny McBride, deliver solid performances, though they are sometimes hindered by underdeveloped characters and limited screen time.Where Alien: Covenant stumbles is in its convoluted plot and pacing. The film attempts to explore philosophical and existential themes while delivering intense horror, but it struggles to strike a balance between the two. The narrative often feels disjointed, with the Prometheus storyline intertwining with the Alien lore in a way that may confuse or frustrate viewers unfamiliar with both films. The film's pacing is uneven, alternating between moments of intense action and slow exposition, which can disrupt the overall flow and impact of the story.While Alien: Covenant features moments of terrifying tension and gruesome horror, it lacks the sustained dread and escalating terror of the original Alien film. The scares are effective in isolated sequences, but the overall impact is diminished by the film's narrative shortcomings. Additionally, some character decisions feel contrived or lacking in logic, which can detract from the tension and immersion.Despite its narrative flaws, Alien: Covenant succeeds in paying homage to the franchise's roots and delivering visceral thrills. The film's visual and technical achievements, along with Fassbender's captivating performance, make it worth watching for fans of the series. However, those seeking a cohesive and satisfying narrative may find themselves frustrated by the film's convoluted plot and missed opportunities to recapture the horror and suspense of its predecessors.Alien: Covenant is a mixed bag, offering glimpses of the franchise's brilliance but falling short of fully realizing its potential. It is a visually impressive and occasionally terrifying entry in the Alien saga, but one that struggles to find its footing amidst its narrative ambitions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Also, I'd give it a ten out of ten for the gore factor!Overall, I think to enjoy this film you need to not compare it to the Alien films and stop looking for loopholes, who cares if the crew do something stupid and unlikely?

"Gory, but-slow moving, greatness.","That was awesome, modern, sci-fi greatness. Extremely disappointed that Ridley didn't do more practical stuff than he did in this bad boi but all is forgiven. The CGI itself was not the best thing ever and it would have been hard to do what the xenomorphs did with practical effects so there is the trade off there. The cinematography was pretty stellar, nothing special but better than average. The cast was great, I was surprised that Fassbender was in this, not having seen anything about it except the posters and highly anticipating it, the anticipation was well paid off too. This is a slow mover and that is one of the things that didn't work for me because when the horror/action pops up it is sudden and loud and not built up to well enough. Jump scares were prominent but they were as tasteful as you could make a jump scare. The gore effects were beautiful and all horror scenes were tremendously beautiful. The action/horror scenes with much gore were equally brilliant. Two thumbs up and hoping to give it the phat 10 on my next watch. There are some scenes that I think will end up as iconic ones, such as the shower scene and probably all the horror scenes. The suspense was pretty good, the score used expertly, it looks good and I just love it bois. Probably not going to make a five-star rating to be honest but swell stuff.

No classic but entertaining enough,"""Alien"" (1979) and ""Aliens"" (1986) were absolute classics that set the bar impossibly high for any further sequels - but the sequels keep on coming. ""Alien 3"" (1992) was disappointing and ""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) rather good. Then came ""Prometheus"" (2012) with the return of original director Ridley Scott. This was not as scary as the original or as exciting as the first sequel but it represented a genuine development of the narrative in its almost philosophical approach.Now Scott (approaching 80) is back with a work, set a decade after ""Prometheues"", which is not classic but certainly entertaining and moderately scary.Visually ""Convenant"" is trademark Scott with wonderfully atmospheric sets. There are plenty of aliens in different forms emerging from different parts of different bodies and we are introduced to the Neomorph. And there are some good action sequences especially as the transporter is leaving the planet (actually Milford Sound in New Zealand which I have visited). A weakness is the cast: there are too many - 15 (compared to seven plus a cat first time round), mostly married couples - so that we do not get to know many of the characters sufficiently to care that much about whether they live or die.The exceptions are Daniels (Katherine Waterston) - who has the now traditional kick-ass female role - and the two synthetics, David and Walter, both played by Michael Fassbender who rather steals the show.",,Anonymous,Horror
Giger's Xenomorph,"The original will always be remembered as the best, as is the case in many franchises. But the ""Alien"" has come a long way since 1979.Covenant (after Prometheus) continues to bring back the original artistic style that H.R. Giger imagined in his Necronomicon. He paired up with Ridley Scott back then and won the Academy Award for best design. Giger's airbrush paintings are being justified by the design and art style of this reboot because if how technology (CGI) has improved since the 1970s. Giger was able to achieve what he did because he was an outsider to the film industry and had complete creative freedom thanks to the producers.
He created this gorgeous monster and its desolate world without any obstruction, so much so that an actual human skull was used to create the face of the original Xenomorph Queen Animatron. The design was so intricate and specific simply because it came from one artist's undisturbed mind. And his expression is what makes Alien stand out from the rest and has become a benchmark for Extra-terrestrial movies.Alien: Covenant embraces this dark horrific blend of steampunk-deep space-grotesque monsters just like Prometheus did and they look gnarlier than they ever did.
But all of this, in the end, is just the art-style of the movie. 
Movies cannot entirely depend on the art-style. This is where Covenant, to an extent, suffers from the recent epidemic of ""passable"" movies.You are enthralled by the detailed world that your characters find themselves in but the characters themselves feel... empty.
Astronauts from a dying world out on an expedition to find a new planet to live on, don't really make you feel for them.
So, if they die, it doesn't matter to you, because the movie never really makes you care about them. 
Michael Fassbender returns as Walter, his renewed appearance might confuse you if you have seen Prometheus but all is explained in a timely manner.
Fassbender's character is what brings depth to this movie while others fail.Except for a few well-constructed scenes, the story itself fails to deliver.
It starts like a well-made disaster movie that hooks you in but seems to lose its grip on the grander scheme.What I liked about Covenant is the central, recurring motif of the ""origin of all species"" which is well devised in dialogue throughout the film, especially what Fassbender does with it.
An age old question is tackled in a very interesting manner.
""If you created me, who created you?""
Much is left for the audience to understand the answer to that question while hints are hidden behind the themes and lore of the two films.If you haven't watched Prometheus yet, watch it before you watch Covenant, to completely understand the lore and continuity.There is definitely going to be a third movie and Covenant felt like a set up for that.It wasn't a solid 7 but because some scenes were beautifully captured and because I loved the acid blood filled rapidly evolving alien, I give it a 7/10 on IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien?,"Where was the alien, the unknown, the trip away from the shore? This film was a spectacular pageant of things i have seen before and immediately recognize. It is obvious that the bankers would not allow a film like the original alien or 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) be made today. A film where the familiar is abandoned in search of the experience of true authentic mystery. I love this movie and enjoyed all the clich√©s and symbols trotted out in the order they were but I saw nothing that caused me any confusion or wondering or left me unsettled asking WHAT WAS THAT? Oh well, it is not the film makers fault it is what gets made when you are borrowing a 100 million of someone's else's $.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An alien-ridden ""bio-lent"" film.","Maybe is not the best film for someone who's not a fan of the franchise but for those who are; hell, it's about time we had such a display of xenomorph-ridden ""bio-lence"". The lowest key in this symphony where the human characters, maybe some of them where kinda hard to believe. A++ acting from Fassbender.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
