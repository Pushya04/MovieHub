Second time around,"I must admit that when i watched this movie for the first time i didn't really think that much of it. Sure the acting was amazing, but that was expected. But then something happened. I got a chance to read the book by Dennis Lehane and suddenly all the pieces fell into place. I watched the movie again and this time it was amazing.I don't know how i should interpret how my feelings toward this movie changed after reading the book. Is it a good adaptation if i like it more after reading the book? Should a movie stand so well on it's own merits that the book is not necessary? I don't know myself, all i know is that it all became so much clearer after reading the book.First of all the acting was amazing even the first time around. But still, after reading the book it was as if the characters gained one more level of depth. I have always felt that Tim Robbins is the true gem in this movie. His pained portrayal of the lost soul Dave Boyle is pure magic, seldom has an Oscar been so well deserved. Sean Penn is predictably great in his portrayal of Jimmy Markum. It's a difficult character, a person you really don't know what to think about. In one respect he is a worried father, in another respect he is a cold-blooded man with few things to like about him. The rest of the cast is solid, with Kevin Bacon the brightest star among them.When it comes to the plot itself this was where much was changed from reading the book. The trick is not to watch this as a crime-drama. Rather it's a movie about behavioral patterns, about humans. What they are capable of and what dictates their actions. There are huge amounts of sadness and melancholy to this story. Of people unable to break out of the path it seems life has chosen for them. This i think didn't really break through to me that well when i watched the movie for the first time. But the book is much more clear on this and when i watched the movie again i saw it there as well.In the end this is a triumph of two things really. First the great acting of some of the finest actors in Hollywood today, second the sensitive and thoughtful directing of Clint Eastwood. He manages to bring out Dennis Lehanes story in a way that is so understated and minimalistic at times i didn't even catch on the first time around. But if i look closely all the elements are there and it is truly a great adaptation as well as a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Tragic Story of the Loss of the Youth in a Contemporary Classic,"Twenty years ago, the boys Jimmy Markun, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle are neighbors and pals, playing hockey on the street. One day, Dave is kidnapped by two men, being sexually abused, but escapes from them four days later. In the present days, each one of them followed one way in their lives: Jimmy (Sean Penn) is married with Annabeth Markum (Laura Linney), has three daughters and has a small business. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective, and his pregnant wife left him six months ago. His colleague is the detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave (Tim Robbins) is a traumatized man, married with Celeste Boyle (Marcia Gay Harden) and having a young son. When the nineteen years old daughter of Jimmy, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum), is found dead in the neighborhood, the three friends in childhood meet each other again, in the investigation of the murder. A tragic event happens in the conclusion of this investigation. This movie is excellent. Yesterday, I saw it on DVD and I was impressed with the direction of Clint Eastwood and the performance of the cast. It is almost impossible to highlight one actor or actress, but I was stunned with the performance of Sean Penn. It is a film based on the acting, and not on special effects, shootings or race of cars. I was very impressed, since the tragic story of the loss of the youth is very real, full of human flaws, disturbances, prejudice and judgements. The destiny of this movie in the future may be to be considered a contemporary classic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Sobre Meninos e Lobos' (`About Boys and Wolves')",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Chilling, effective and real","After a while, one has come to expect mediocrity from Clint Eastwood. ""Blood Work"" ""Space Cowboys"" and ""Sudden Impact"" all shining examples of this. But what he has here is true; sophisticated, intricate and rewarding. Viewing is definitely recommended.Three boys, Dave (Tim Robbins) Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) are reunited after the murder of Jimmy's nineteen year-old daughter. Immediately, a whodunit case arrives. Sounds average, dunnit?...No. It's much more than average. What might appear as a normal murder mystery is more. The acting, particularly from Robbins and Penn, is immaculate. Robbins is still recovering from child sexual abuse along time ago. Penn, so realistically and amazingly, mourns over the loss of his daughter. Laurence Fishburne (playing cop Whitey) is as smart talking as ever, whilst Kevin Bacon gives a solid performance as the homicide cop investigating the case.Though the film becomes a bit uneven towards the end, this tough, brutal and uncompromising; but still, a masterpiece, and the best work Eastwood as done in years.Final Analysis: 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Eastwood's intricately-plotted family drama,"Eastwood's expert direction and wonderful performances from the three leads make MYSTIC RIVER a drama worth watching. The film is made up of three interlocking sections, each represented by one of the leads. Kevin Bacon supplies the lesser police procedural aspects of the movie, Tim Robbins lends plenty of mystery to a whodunit plot, and Sean Penn is at the heart of the family drama-cum-tragedy.The film is unpredictable throughout and slowly paced, taking its time to get to grips with the storyline instead of rushing through the plot. Never once does it feel boring. The attention to technical detail is spot on as you'd expect, and the mood finely judged throughout. It takes actors and a director of rare talent to make a movie this compelling, but in the case of MYSTIC RIVER everything comes together in a film that never disappoints.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Simply stunning,"This movie is a kick in the gut. Rarely is such a brilliant cast assembled, and even when it happens, rarely do they act like this. Tom Guiry (very impressive), Tim Robbins and Sean Penn show emotion that directors don't often stick in. And it comes off flawlessly. During a scene with Marcia Gay-Harden and Tim Robbins crying in their kitchen, there is an energy coming off of the screen that strikes you right in the chest. Which is really the way the whole movie works. It grabs you and shakes you, and makes you watch even when it can be painful to do so. The only reason that this film didn't win best picture is Return of the King. Any other year, and Mystic River has it. Eastwood's finest moment. Check it out--you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A well-told whodunit tragedy,"Watched this movie in 2022 as it had been almost 20 years since I'd seen it and couldn't really remember much. The story is still tragic, the acting is still very good, the directing is still top-notch, and the ending is still haunting. On paper, Mystic River could have turned into a classic murder mystery film, but the material actually goes much deeper. There are additional themes explored here: childhood trauma, consequences for our actions, connections from the past, ripple effects of neighborhood tragedy, etc. These elements are carefully intertwined with the main storyline which is what keeps Mystic River a step above its peers. A star-studded cast bring this film into Oscar-winning territory and you will be glad you rewatched it.Verdict: Watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2003,"Let's say it straight away: before ""Mystic River"" (2003), Clint Eastwood's last works had left me a little unsatisfied; particularly ""Blood Work"" (2002), a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality. But the following year, with ""Mystic River"", he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie, which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since ""Unforgiven"" (1992).By watching ""Mystic River"" one can feel that Clint Eastwood, more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie. From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director (as far as I'm concerned, I hated the rather insipid ""A Knight's Tale"" 2001), Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere. On another extent, Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in ""Blood Work"": favoring calm and patience. And indeed, on an unhurried pace, the film-maker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story. More important, he made this choice for another reason: to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters. The basis of ""Mystic River"" consists in a classic detective investigation (nevertheless passionating in its construction) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists.To watch ""Mystic River"" is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it. The more the movie progresses, the more we discover three heart-broken characters because they are linked by dark events. First, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn). We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a well-behaved man: he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church. But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her. Then, Sean Divine (Kevin Bacon) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell: he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night. At last, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience (he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests). The consequences are terrible: he can't communicate anymore, he can't defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood. As a matter of fact, this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters' misfortunes. Being the very first sequence of the movie, it sets the tone of Clint Eastwood's 24th movie. It presents Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing in a street. The sky is gray, the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere. The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood. Then, a big black car arrives. One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest (or does he?). He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away. This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality. Roughly, ""Mystic River"" demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives.In virtually all the critics I have read, ""Mystic River"" was hailed for its cast. It's true that Penn, Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them. By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters, one can feel that they were giving their all, which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time (39 days). They may even never battle their dazzling performances. And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole, especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence (unconsciously or not) their husbands' actions and characters.To a third degree, Eastwood's major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances, the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants. The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesn't show yet that it is devastated by violence. No matter what the time is. Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isn't ready to subside.At last, let's also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son. With this music, simplicity rhymes with efficiency. One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us.In the middle of all these qualities, there are just minor faults. So, Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however, we really don't know what went wrong with his wife. Is it Dave's kidnapping? Is it his trying job? This point remains ambiguous. Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film. What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation.The contribution of the crew in Eastwood's work is total and so is my enthusiasm for ""Mystic River"". If you haven't seen it yet, go and watch it. You won't regret it. At the age of 73 years old, ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Eastwood's next Oscar hit after ""Unforgiven""","Eastwood's big Oscar hit after ""Unforgiven"", that other masterpiece directed by Dirty Harry himself. ""Mystic River"" is based on the bestselling novel by Dennis Lehane and it has an incredible cast. The main leads are for Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Furthermore we have Laurence ""Morpheus"" Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden. The movie itself is very dark and sober without much music. The story is brilliantly written and the acting is without any doubt superb.I'm glad Sean Penn finally won an Academy Award, he's a brilliant actor and he certainly deserves the recognition. Tim Robbins was good as well, but I think Benicio del Toro should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His performance in ""21 Grams"" was much more superior to Robbins' performance in ""Mystic River"". Anyway, that's just what I think. Kevin Bacon was excellent as well and he is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney were good as usual.Although I very much enjoyed this movie, it didn't exactly turned out to be the masterpiece I was expecting. But that's maybe because this was only the first time I watched it. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to see Eastwood's masterpiece of this year: ""Million Dollar Baby"". But this movie is absolutely worth seeing as well.8,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mystic River is a well acted and well directed American classic.,"When I finally got to watch Mystic River, I was mesmerized by the acting of the ensemble cast. I watched this movie twice, alone and again with my husband. The content of the movie is relevant in any time frame. Upon watching it the second time I noticed ""small"" things that tied the movie and its characters together. Forgiveness, no I would not classify any of the characters as forgiving. It is very clear that Dave probably never receive counseling for the unspeakable crime done to him as a boy, Jimmy never really let go of his ""on edge nerve"" and Sean remains the responsible friend but not afraid to face life's messes. To watch a human drama unfold with such sad consequences and heavy retribution on one hand and little to no retribution on the other hand is a depiction that life is not always fair and some of us receive the bounty of life, while others get the smaller piece of pie.This movie was well acted and well directed. I will never forget Sean Penn's portrayal of Jimmy in this star ensemble cast.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Classic Eastwood,"This movie is a good study in human nature and fate.  Eastwood has always tried to haze the line between a good guy and the things a person does to define him as such.  His good guys do so much bad and his bad guys do so much good that we are often left pondering what we see in his movies. Mystic River will take your imagination and patience to the limit.  Mystery, intrigue and suspense are superbly blended for a home run.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The strongest American movie since American Beauty,"Mr. Eastwood has made a film of true and honest art. A film that looks up to Shakespear and actually does him justice. The depth and emotion that is in each and every scene is remarkable. All the Performances are for the ages. Mr. Penn creates a man that is deeply flawed and yet totally human. Mr. Bacon digs into a man's soul that has dealt with guilt and loss. Mr. Robins provides a man that is a child in mind and an adult in actions that is never cartoonish or ironic. The amazing Mr. Guiry makes Brendon something for the ages, a teen that is not a illustration of a teen but rather a person that has complex emotions and emotional reactions (he should win the oscar, or at least get a nomination). Ms. Gay Harden never sinks to cliches for a single moment in her playing of a woman that can not trust the man she loves, yet still loves him. Ms. Linney brings to life a woman that is truely Lady Macbeth. The music, Editing, and camera work are all exceltent as well. Mr. Helgeland's screenplay is bound for oscar gold. Great job to all involved! This is a must see for any movie lover or average film patron in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Imagine the darkest moments of aftermath.  Now think again...,"Clint Eastwood did an incredible job directing this film. It captures the pain and trauma of a death that affects multiple people in different ways. The plot is less intricate than it seems but the constant mystery and suspense makes it seem as though three completely different stories are taking place at once.Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) becomes overwhelmed with grief after a beloved family member (Emmy Rossum)is brutally murdered. He is reunited with two of his childhood friends as a result of the death. The three friends recall a terrible memory from when they were younger, that cleverly works its way into the story. It involves one of the friends, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), who's remembrance of the event causes him to take a desperate attempt at indirect revenge. Unfortunately, this makes him the prime suspect in the investigation of the murder. Even more, his two friends (the victim's father, and a cop) are, of course, questioning him, as well as his wife (Marcia Gay Harden). The movie subtly reminds viewers that there are somethings in life just should not occur, ever.The acting in Mystic River was incredible (Sean and Tim's Oscar), and the atmosphere created by the music and dark colors create a most mysterious and genuine tone that accents the emotions played by the actors. As the story begins to unfold, you yourself are subdued into the depths of the aftermath that continues to linger from the begin to the end of the film. Be prepared for some unexpected turns, and even if you do predict the ending, you'll still be thinking about for months.A+",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tightly wound drama,"""Mystic River"" centers on a murder investigation involving three men - all friends as boys from a Boston working class neighborhood -  who have taken different directions through life. One is an excon (Penn) whose daughter was murdered.  Another is the homicide investigator (Bacon) who is assigned to the case. The third is an emotionally damaged man (Robbins) who is suspect. Eastwood has imbued this novel adaptation with his signature blend of grit and humanness and created a forum for high intensity drama superbly executed by the principals, most notably Penn, who wrestle with roots, regrets, recrimination, revenge, reconciliation, and much more. With plaudits from all corners, ""Mystic River"" is a must see for drama junkies, fans of the players, etc. (A-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Clint Eastwood - my least favourite director,"Watching this a second time I was reminded again how much I dislike Ol' Clint's directing style. I just cannot get on board with him at all, and Mystic River is no exception. Kevin Bacon is the only stand-out performance for me.

One of My Favorite Movies,"I've watched Mystic River several times and it never fails to intrigue. Somebody who wrote the screenplay had a grasp of Shakespearean themes, and I don't think it was Dennis Lehane. After watching Mystic River and seeing the greatness, I read Lehane's book, then I read all of Lehane's books. I was looking for the genius that is Mystic River, the movie. I didn't find it. Lehane's books are mediocre; this film is a work of the tragedy of life, as Shakespeare gave us in Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth (Annabeth was aptly named). Mystic River gives us mistaken identity, lost love, friend turning on friend, and a broken and misguided ""king."" Sean Penn pulled off his character, as only Sean Penn could have done, and profoundly deserved the Oscar he received.

Clint Eastwood achieves a totally immersive experience with his understated direction, editing, visual composition and sound. The actors are one with their characters. Everything comes together perfectly. I find myself hesitating to re-watch this movie, despite several previous views, because it is so moving and deep, imho. I know I will be swept away. Many will describe this as a murder-mystery, a character study, a tragedy. But it also a philosophical exploration of free will vs. Fate, identity, love, and truth.

Eastwood's best work after MILLION DOLLAR BABY,"In MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood brings a clinical eye to bear on the truth, regardless of how hard it might be to swallow. He examines with the same clinical eye the development of the characters of the main figures. Tim Robbins and Sean Penn post superlative performances, but Bacon also does well, albeit in a less eye-catching manner.Interestingly, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden reflect the strengths and weaknesses of their husbands.Ultimately, Eastwood's clinical also bores clinically and inexorably into the many appearances that pass for reality in the minds of people, and his sober approach is, in my view, what adds real greatness to this work and to that end, it is helped by superlative cinematography, great action sequences, and, most of all, a lucid and highly intelligent script.Eastwood's direction is sublime.MYSTIC RIVER is a must-see masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good film - but not the cinematic masterpiece or great moral challenge it maybe should have been,"Mystic River deals with three men, once boyhood friends, who all estrange the people closest to them. Their characters become flawed because of events, of how they choose to be, or their calling. It doesn't really say anything profound, but the acting and screenplay in the first half are quite good. Brian Helgeland, whose script writing seems to veer between brilliant (L.A. Confidential) and fairly abysmal (The Sin Eater), provides three quarters of sheer maestro, a story that unfolds with a growing sense of unease; characters that, as in real life, feel no need to state the obvious but let us piece together clues. But a gripping story of childhood bonds gone bad, murder, the frailty of human certainty and belief in flawed values  all wonderful elements that should offer a filmmaker so much  are stymied by flimsy resolutions and ultimately unlovable characters. An edge of the seat mystery builds to a limp climax that rather suggests they ran out of money, or film or ideas. There is no great moral dilemma as some critics have tried to suggest  all the characters try to do good in their own screwed up way, some with better intentions than others, and most of them fail.Mystic River has a stellar cast  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon to name a few  and there are some excellent performances. Penn, in the lead role, is sadly perhaps the weakest of these three as he is seems far too conscious of those Oscar worthy moments', with the camera closing in for yet another close-up of his lingering, tortured, seemingly over-rehearsed expressions. Actors who go through this phase need a rapid infusion of French Cinema to correct their hyperbaric egos if they wish to ascend loftily and gracefully through stardom. Robbins and Bacon seem far more comfortable with their roles, without the need to be centre stage quite so much, and Marcia Gay Harden, who has already collected one Oscar for her role in Pollock, is quite superb, playing a long suffering wife with what seems like suppressed hysteria growing into panic. Mystic River is a good film and worth going to see - but such a shame it isn't another cinematic masterpiece we feel we can still hope for from director Clint Eastwood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""A Haunting Exploration of Trauma and Redemption""","Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a poignant and unflinching examination of the enduring impact of childhood trauma on three lives irrevocably intertwined. The film is a masterclass in storytelling, anchored by powerhouse performances that delve deep into the complexities of human nature.At its core, Mystic River is a story about the ripple effects of a traumatic childhood event. Three young boys, Jimmy, Sean, and Dave, and Dave is abducted and held captive for four days, an experience that leaves them irreparably scarred. Years later, their lives intersect once again when Jimmy's daughter is murdered, and Sean, now a homicide detective, is tasked with investigating the case.The film boasts an ensemble cast delivering career-defining performances. Sean Penn as Jimmy Sullivan is a tour de force, embodying the raw vulnerability and simmering rage of a man haunted by his past. Kevin Bacon as Sean Devine is equally compelling as the conflicted detective grappling with his own demons. Tim Robbins as Dave Boyle provides a chilling portrayal of a man living a double life.Luck and Coincidence, is a theme which is recurring through out the movie. Always the question of 'What if...', 'Instead of him...', is being directed by the characters to each other and often the audience also end up asking the same question of 'What if..something happened this way..instead of this... and everything would have worked for everyone in the equation'. But if this movie reminds us of anything, it is that unfortunately life doesn't work that way and the fortunes of time and place could easily be toppled by an act of God or devil.Mystic River doesn't shy away from the darkness that lurks within its characters. It delves into themes of guilt, revenge, and the fragility of the human psyche. The film's unflinching portrayal of violence and its aftermath is both disturbing and thought-provoking.The film's ending is a gut-wrenching climax that leaves a lasting impression. It's a testament to the power of human connection and the devastating consequences of choices made in the face of trauma.Mystic River is a haunting and unforgettable cinematic experience. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, challenging you to contemplate the complexities of human nature and the enduring power of trauma.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Powerful Examination of Adults Haunted By Their Childhoods,"""Mystic River"" is a very American take on genres more usually evoked by Europeans, a sophisticated cross between the kitchen sink working class British films and the spare, family-style murder mysteries of Claude Chabrol and François Ozon, and that has only otherwise been achieved in the U.S. through whole seasons of ""The Sopranos.""The clues to the mystery are subtly given to us within the first ten minutes when we meet the very individual yet deeply connected characters embedded within a powerful sense of place, isolated from downtown and change by the titular geography, with the looming bridge a constant visual landmark, only a notorious traffic bottleneck to most Bostonians.My friend in Cambridge explains the geographical symbolism: ""The Mystic River is Boston's ""other river""--unlike the picturesque Charles, the Mystic is the working river lined with power plants, factories etc,---the neighborhood is supposed to be Charlestown--traditionally isolated, working class, old school so to speak,(and yes, much of Boston remains unpleasantly insular) that has been ""yuppified"" over the last twenty-five years, especially since the mid-eighties when the Orange Line elevated train came down. The Tobin Bridge that you see connects Charlestown, part of the City of Boston with Chelsea to the east, a separate municipality. The Mystic and Chelsea Rivers flow together into Boston Harbor--the working docks are in Charlestown, Chelsea, and East Boston across the Harbor from the North End and from Charlestown. In point of fact, some of the scenes were filmed in East Boston, as well as the Fenway and Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain.""The accents aren't completely accurate, but at least some regionalism is attempted. Overlooking it from the bridge, one of the key trio early on calls it ""the old neighborhood,"" as he's somewhat left it, as in parallel his wife has somewhat left him, but both keep feeling silent tugs to come back.Memory and time catches up to the audience too in seeing two of our finest actors as gray-haired fathers (very natural make-up and hair style work), but Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are masterful as damaged men and even more damaged parents haunted by their mutually touched yet separately karoomed past and present. They are living demonstrations of Faulkner's dictum ""The past is never dead. It's never even past,"" with horrific consequences for all.The strong theme of the sins of the fathers keeps the men up front, but their wives are crucial fulcrums for loyalty and motivation, as they are in The Sopranos, and Laura Linney's and Marcia Gay Hayden's characterizations chillingly match the men one-on-one at the climax and conclusion.The constant sense of brooding unease is promulgated enormously by director Clint Eastwood's masterful music which floats up like a body in the river and keeps up the tensions in even quotidian-seeming scenes. Sound in general bubbles up for atmosphere, from Red Sox games to telephone rings.The cinematography is lusciously saturated (Tom Stern doing his first lead, up from lighting) for gray skies that ironically clear up to blinding sunshine at the uneasy end, for a neighborhood parade that celebrates Patriot's Day while most of Boston is doubtless cheering on the marathoners.(originally written 10/31/2003)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Innocence is non-recoverable.,"Clint Eastwood directs this heavily wrought drama about childhood friendships and lifetime tragedy.

In their adult life Jimmy is a troubled ex-con, Sean is a policeman with marital troubles and Dave is just a shell of a man scarred by his molestation. The trio gravitate together when Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter(Emmy Rossum) is found brutally murdered in the park. Suspicion runs high as speculation begins to rule the murder investigation led by detective Sean. Dave becomes a suspect as emotional riddled Jimmy is ready to deal out his own version of vengeance.Also in this heavily talented cast are: Laurence Fishburn, Marcia Gay Harden, Tom Guiry and Laura Linney.

Dragging,"A neo-noir drama mystery by Clint Eastwood.The biggest positive was the acting, which was strong throughout. However, Sean Penn stood out the most. He gave a lot of emotion and agony to the character, who was grieving father. I loved every scenes Penn was in. He always looked badass, but in this movie he looked sad and hardened.The story itself was honestly pretty boring. It had a depressing and somber tone throughout. I just couldn't get around and care for the heavy amount of conversations. The character Sean, played by Kevin Bacon, had a side plot with his wife, and I don't understand the point of having that plot at all. Because of this, the bulk of the middle story felt dragged out.However, the ending improved the pacing and put good impact to the story. It was again pretty sad, but could have hit me more if the buildup before it wasn't so slow.Overall, a meh and somber story that felt too long. 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Eastwood / Penn Masterpiece,"This movie will mean many different things to many different people, but for anyone who was born and raised in the Northeastern United States, it might nearly be a religious experience.  Have a dad or an uncle who worked way-beyond-hard all of his life but could never get out of a ""working class neighborhood?""  Know and love any family member with an ancestry-deep anger management problem?  Been devastatingly betrayed by trusted persons?  Does the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" mean the same thing as the word ""childhood"" to you?Although I personally cannot claim sufficient knowledge of Sean Penn's past successes, I have to say that if he does not win an Oscar for Jimmy's attempts at self-restraint and facial expressions alone, I may never watch the Oscars again!  Tim Robbins is awesome as well, approaching the quality of ""Rain Man"" and ""Big"" with the character of Dave.  And what else can one say about Kevin Bacon that hasn't already been said?  (I was alarmed at his weight loss, and do hope he hasn't actually experienced any of the tragedies touched upon in his films.)""Mystic River"" marks the first time in 40 years that my dad discovered a powerful novel before I did.

horrible ending,I haven't seen an ending this bad in a long time. This should have been a good movie and 2/3 of the way through it was. But the ending just went completely berserk. You spend two hours building characters so that they can change on a dime? What happens at the end makes absolutely no sense. I can only assume that the people who are calling this a masterpiece either left very early or were mistakenly watching Kill Bill.I can't even explain what happened or how that many talented people wouldn't notice that they were veering off course. I feel like the cast were betrayed by this wacky ending. I would actually give the first part of the movie a 9 but then ending a 5. So it's a 7/10 for me. It's a shame. And the worst part is it probably will win a lot of awards since hype is all you need to get praise nowadays.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What is the matter with the endings?,"Why is some people so hung up with the endings? This is not a movie with a ""Hollywood"" ending. It actually ends like most things end in real life. With someone who ""knew in his mind"" who the guilty was, built a ""coalition of the willing,"" committed what many think is a crime, gets away with it, and still gets high approval rates from members of his household. And when confronted with the fact that he was wrong, he gets even more support, and shows no sign of remorse.Do you know of similar thing happening in real life?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A sophisticated murder mystery - Awesome,"Very rarely does Clint Eastwood deliver a product that is not up to the mark or below average. 'Mystic River' is definitely not one; in fact it is one of his bests ever. In Mystic River he tries to explore how incidents in our childhood affect our lives in a big way, in fact they probably shape our destiny. ( I am sure this was intended - The starting scene where the three kids are embossing their names on a freshly cemented pavement, just before Tim is picked up by the padeophile, is conveying the above message. Later On, a grown up Tim sees the same pavement, with the partially completed names, once again. Surely God is in the details...bravo !! CLINT...bravo!!)The story is that of three boys growing up in the same neighbourhood. One of them suffers at the hands of a paedophile. He grows up to become a slightly mentally disturbed, lost guy played amazingly well by Tim Robbins. His other two friends become a local don (again played beautifully by Sean Penn) and one a homicide detective (Kevin Bacon). Sean's teenage daughter is murdered and thenstarts a whodunits chase. Both Sean and Kevin want to catch the culprit first. The former wants to seek revenge and the latter to seek justice. Tim's role in the murder is not ruled out as he was in the same bar as the girl just prior to the murder.The movie is simply amazing to watch for its sheer intensity of acting by Sean and Tim. This is probably Tim's second best performance ever after 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Excellent direction by Clint leaves the audience at the edge of their seats for almost the entire duration of the movie. I will not ruin your suspense by telling you the end.It is a must watch for the Clint Eastwood and Thriller fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Eventually a huge tragedy happens, which leads the three friends back again and a ending that you will never forget.The characters are very well played, you could actually feel how well they played them, the story is just perfect.

Phenomenal,Mystic river is a phenomenal movie but very hard to watch !First time I watched was 10 years ago ( I was 17 ) and shocked me ! I remember myself thinking about the dramatic ending for a lot of days ! This movie reminded me of Greek tragedies ! It's a great drama with phenomenal performances ! Clint Eastwood put his soul and mind in this film and it's ione of his best works as a director ! The music serves its purpose ! Boston as the location of filming is a great choice !

Eastwoods Masterpiece,"I am sure there are things we all wish to forget. Moments in time in which our lives and the lives of others are altered by one singular movement, one phrase, or that one hockey shot that was just out of reach. Nothing is more true when it comes to the lives of Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). Mystic River is an emotional and amazing film about the reconciliation of three friends and their wives by the tragic murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum). This rough Boston suburb that lies on the bank of the Mystic River is thrown into sorrow and misery over the loss. Jimmy (Penn) makes a vow to find the killer of his daughter and end him and throw him into the Mystic.The story is superb. Twists and turns and changing plot lines makes this story brilliantly unpredictable. It proves nothing is what it seems. Dealing with issues of child abduction and the effects it has on the future, Mystic River watches and deals with the change n the course of someone life. What something would be like if Dave hadn't gotten into that strangers car? Katie Markum would never had been born to be murdered.The acting is bar none and has been recognized by the Academy by awarding Sean Penn and Tim Robbins best actor and best supporting role at the Oscars. Sean Penn was incredible in this film. He was so into his character. An angry gangster trying to move on with his life, and get out of his life of crime and deceit. To love his children and to be the best father he can be. Strong and determined, hard and angry he tries to deal with the grief of the loss of his last real memory of his late first wife. Penn is perfect in performing this role. Tim Robbins is also and incredible actor. A man who had been abused neglected. Finally admitting to himself of the abuse he felt. He kept himself bottled and up. An angry and almost psychopathic man, who is doing his best to try and overcome the terrors he experienced by hopping in the car. An ensemble cast also included: Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Haden, Laurence Fishburn.Mystic river is truly amazing. Clint Eastwood is an incredible director. If you like Million Dollar Baby (and who doesn't! Iti s also brilliant) then you will simply love Mystic River. I would highly recommend it for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Riveting film about real people in a real town,"Contrary to the opinions of some other viewers, I found Mystic River an absolutely riveting film. The storytelling, the acting, the writing, and the cinematography were all superb, and the director and writer made excellent use of some of the finest actors working today.I avoided this movie in theaters because the subject matter seemed to be so heavy and serious: child abduction, molestation, murder, and revenge. But in fact, it is a movie with an ultimately hopeful and redemptive ending, and puts a human face on the kinds of people we are prone to pass every day without giving a second glance.As someone who moved to Boston in the late 1990s and experienced first-hand the rise of real estate costs and the slow process of gentrification, I find the characterization of the insular community of Charlestown, a working-class, white, Irish town just north of Boston, to be dead-on. Townies themselves may or may not agree with me, but I believe that ultimately the film is about survival and family cohesion within the sometimes hostile world of a big city.Sean Penn's acting in this movie was spot-on: he has the uncanny ability to evoke barely suppressed rage without actually spilling over into melodrama. Tim Roberts, as the grown version of Davy, who was abducted and raped as a young boy, does an admirable job evoking the kind of shell-shocked, medicated affect of a damaged soul who has never truly healed. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburn also perform excellent roles, as does Marcia Gay Hardin as the wife of the grown Davy, who suspects that her husband may have committed a murder and doesn't know who to tell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Way overpraised,"Three childhood friends (Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon) are reunited in Boston (actually shot in Chelsea and East Boston) when Penn's daughter is murdered.  Robbins was molested as a boy and still shows the scars of it. On the night of the murder he arrives home covered with blood.  He tells his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) that he killed a mugger...but there's nothing in the paper the next few days.  Penn is desperate to find the killer and Bacon plays a member of the Boston police who (with partner Laurence Fishburne) tries to figure out what happened.This was wildly overpraised by critics.  Why?  Because it's VERY quiet, VERY slow and VERY long--too long.  Everything is done slowly and in almost complete silence...the effect on the audience is deadening.  When a few twists come in the final reel they carried no emotional impact--they're done in the same quiet way as the rest of the film.  Also, this easily could have been done in less than 2 hours--there's no reason for this film to ramble on for 2 hrs 15 min.The only worthwhile things in the movie is seeing Boston on the big screen and the acting.  Everybody is great--Penn, Robbins, Fisburne and Laura Linney--Bacon and Harden (in difficult roles) are just superb with Bacon faking the Boston accent very well.This is basically a murder mystery that thinks WAY too much of itself.  If Clint Eastwood hadn't directed it with this powerhouse cast it would probably have been ignored.  Worth seeing for the beautiful Boston settings and the acting--but it's very slow and pretentious too.  I can only give it a 6.One good thing--it's a sure cure for insomnia. :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Only the strongest will survive,"Just came back from the theatre, and I was blown away after the movie. The storie is nothing more then a standard mystery movie, although great on his own, but the underlying messages are so powerful it makes this one a masterpiece. Brilliant performances by Penn and Robbins who give the movie that extra power to become an emotional journey afterwards. I'm not gonna spoil anything here, just enjoy watching it, and if u like to think about messages this movie gives you, then this is one for you. I would say a mix of Road to perdition and American Beauty, but stronger. I loved it 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Picture/ Great Ending,"Clint Eastwood sure turned out a great picture with outstanding acting by the entire cast. However, Sean Penn,(Jimmy Markum) put his heart and soul deep into his character and over powered the entire picture from beginning to the very end. Kevin Bacon,(Sean Devine), played a very calm and wise detective who grew up in the Boston city area and knew most of the people, especially a young boy who was taken for an unfortunate ride in a car. Laurence Fishburne, (Sgt. Whitey Powers) was a partner with Sean Devine and they both had some real problems to solve involving a young girl and plenty of suspects. Simply loved the way this picture ended, and I applaud Clint Eastwood for great dramatic art work on the silver screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
just a tedious and a dreary affair that I couldn't wait to see end,"""Mystic River"" has the foundations for both a tragedy and a mystery, but instead the film is directed like a comedy. The only fun in this plodding production is trying to figure out who gives the worst performance. Is it Sean Penn, complete with gnashing teeth and tightly flexed biceps, doing a second-rate Kirk Douglas? Or is it Laurence Fishburne, who does such a killer Lou Rawls-style self-assured turn that he literally glides through his scenes? Or is it Marcia Gay Harden, whose gaping mouth and wide eye stare recall a fish on ice? There wasn't any real emotional substance to this film, whatsoever.

I think he gets better the older he gets. He certainly hasn't lost his touch.I think all the performances by the actors were spot on. Each one had me thoroughly convinced as to what they were feeling or experiencing. Total sincerity and genuineness in every character. I think besides Senn Penn, that Marcia Gay Harden's performance was stellar. Her obvious tortured conflict is so apparent, without being over the top. I was really disappointed that she didn't win for Best Supporting Actress, although she was nominated. Penn and Robbins definitely deserved their wins for Best Actor and Supporting Actor.If you haven't seen this, you have to check it out - a true masterpiece, but be ready for some gut-wrenching drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
the end of innocence and optimism,"The fact that ""Mystic River"" came out in 2003, when I was 19, is analogous to the release of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in 1971, when my parents were 19. Both years were part of a dissolution of the optimism that had gotten built up during the previous decades, and the affirmation of a new era of cynicism (from the Vietnam War in 1971, from the Iraq War in 2003). The respective movies showed this.""Mystic River"" deals with the metaphorical transfer of evil to the next generation. It starts when Boston friends Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle are writing their names in wet cement, and some men kidnap Dave. Many years later, after all three are grown up (played by Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins, respectively), they are still trying to get over the incident. But then tragedy strikes, and all of their assumptions about life - and possibly each other - are suddenly thrown into question.I should remind you that this is not an easy movie to watch. The intensity of Sean Penn's Oscar-winning performance makes you feel like there's a jackhammer in your stomach. It's that powerful. With ""Mystic River"", Clint Eastwood may have turned out his best movie ever, although ""Million Dollar Baby"" is also a masterpiece.

Hard to Swallow,"There are a lot of reviews on here that have broken this movie down and shown it's fallouts. I will say it was captivating but I believe some more time and thought should have been put into the ending (& into the female roles seeming how they became so important in the end). I wouldn't say it's a waste to watch it but I also wouldn't say it deserved all the credit is has received.

"The film is quite raw, unpolished but emotionally gripping as a result","There are several aspects of this film that are commonly criticized. The writing around Dave isn't all that tight; the film's blunt treatment of sexual abuse is frayed and reasonable people can take issue with it. the Lady Macbeth speech at the end isn't fully set-up in the screenplay. A lot of the performances are overstated and showy, i.e. Penn's ""Is that my DAUGHTER in there?"" Eastwood's direction can feel too retrained and didactic for the film's own good. I actually agree with these criticism on the main but for all that I cannot but helped be moved by this film.I think there an alchemy at work here that the more unpolished and rough patches of the film as cinema make the emotional content of the film be even more striking and more involving. This film has life as lived quality that makes it primal and power. So sure the critic in me wants to pick at its flaw but the filmgoer in me just loves the emotional experience this film invokes. It still makes me cry.I must say Robbins and Penn are *perfect* in this as the sort of primal base emotions and characters they are playing. Robbins is so tragic in this film that he breaks my heart.This is a big part of why 2003 is the best year for film since I have been alive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Overrated Mess of a Movie,"`God was watching me but He wasn't angry.  It was more like looking down at a puppy who had soiled the carpet.' Sean Penn's character says this in `Mystic River' right before yet another horrific act is committed. Clint Eastwood must have put that line in to this movie himself in reference to his production of this twisted tale from the wrong side of the fence.  Clint must have had this same dirty, guilty feeling during filming.  If this bizarre neighborhood is any true indication of the Boston area then it's no wonder that God has cursed the Red Sox.  Why the need to go out of the way to show one of the two kidnappers as wearing a ring with a Christian symbol? Who does this movie appeal to?  I take great offense when Hollywood portrays the death of a nineteen-year-old as a reason to base a movie solely for the emotional baggage it brings to a film. There was nothing redeeming about this film and it sure wasn't escapist entertainment. Again I ask, whom does this movie appeal to?",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Clint's Masterpiece,"Three friends from the Irish neighborhood in Boston, one of them was abused when he was child, the other, an ex-convict, now the local mob whose daughter was kidnapped and murdered and the third one is the police officer who investigates the murder. Clint Eastwood's (at the age of 73!) darkest and most depressing film is a psychological character study, superbly directed, written and edited which focus on the community relationships and the way these persons lost ourselves. Sean Penn (Jimmy is a truly Shakespearean hero) and Tim Robbins (Dave, the child who was abducted and abused) won well-deserved academy awards for their performances but the unique cast (including Kevin Bacon as the third friend, Laura Linney as Jimmy's tough wife and Marcia Gay Harden as Dave' wife) is equally great.

There are two kinds of movies audiences,"One wants to escape into a pretend world.The other wants to see stories that make them think about theirs.This movie is for the latter, the former will be sorely disappointed.What looks from the onset like an unfortunate sequence of personal tragedies intended to tug on the sympathetic heartstrings of the former begins to wear thin and tedious about half way through as the all too obvious tragic outcome begins to roll downhill like a snowball gathering momentum.But like a well constructed drama the denouement (thats the comedown after the climax where the meaning of the whole thing gets explained) hits first like a splash of cold water and then delivers the blow to the gut that left me reeling with recognition.Not too many movies out of Hollywood lately have hit with that much moral force AFTER the ostensible climax. Usually you get some lamers making some clichés pretending to explain what needed no explanation because it was all too trite from the beginning. This one actually set off the old light bulb with the ""Oh THAT'S what the storyteller was trying to get at with this story!""This story tries to make similar moral judgments about ancient ingrained traditions of morality and justice in a microcosm of 3 families that Scorcese tried to portray in Gangs of New York on the grand scale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Little Overrated Would You Not Agree,"This film was hyped to the max due to the involvement of Clint Eastwood, Tim Robbins and especially Sean Penn. These three peoples involvement in this film made the people at the academy salivate to such an extent, most sadly died and the rest where required to wear drips for a period of one solid month, pumping in a mix of water, extreme hypocrisy and stupidity. A hefty dosage.Anyway, this film is what you would rightly expect from these characters. Intensity and a certain level of ability. Sean Penn acts his role rather well and the same can be said for Tim Robbins and even Kevin Bacon. But the problem is very simple. This is so unbelievable it is very hard to get truly sucked in. The characters are extreme. Robbins character is meant to be a weirdo, a freak, yet he still manages to make a living, marry a fairly nice wife and father a well rounded son. Not what one would expect from a man who's childhood and subsequent life was ruined due to a dreadful 4 day experience. 'Damaged goods' is what he is referred to in the film I believe.Sean Penn does well as the grieving father. But the hints and insights he has into his daughters life are excruciatingly unreal. He can tell by a look. No Chance. His gangster past is also a miss for me. Terrible. Kevin Bacon does well. As well as he can but he's in no trouble. His parter is though. Lawrence Fishburne's character is so badly written and filled with clichés its beyond belief. This is a huge let down and does drag the movie down somewhat. I don't know if everything is down to the poor writing but it is sickening. Poorly acted but with the material, what can you do.It seems that the realism that Clint and his chums went into this film seeking was never there to begin with. The story is weak. The murder mystery is far too easily solved and the actions of the characters can't even be attributed to desperation or to difficult childhoods. It fails in what is trying to convey. The truth. What these characters would do in this situation. It wouldn't happen this way. Its been down in many places before and the supporting characters seem very unbelievable. Shocking really. There is too much going on and most of it is not worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perfect performances in Clint Eastwood's great film,"'Mystic River' is one of the year's best films and one of the main reasons of that is the performances. Like in 'Lost in Translation', what in my opinion was the year's best film (although 'Kill Bill' and 'The Lord of the Rings' came close), every actor does a perfect job in creating a character with its own emotions and therefore they could be real people.Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) were friends as kids. One day they were playing on the street and Dave is taken by two men, pretending to be police officers. For four days he is abused by the men and this terrible event has changed them all. Now they are all grown up. Jimmy has a second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney). He has two daughters with her and an older daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) from his previous marriage. She is found beaten and dead in a park. Dave is one of the main suspects. He is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and has a little boy. Sean is one of the detectives put on the case. Together with Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) he must solve this mystery. Another suspect is Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry). He was Katie's boyfriend and they were leaving for Vegas. Jimmy hated Brendan, we learn why that is.In a way 'Mystic River' plays like a detective movie. The plot is intriguing and we wonder what really has happened. But this movie doesn't end there. It looks further, closer to the characters and their emotions. There is suspense in dialogue between characters when they are explaining what they are feeling and what they really think. Director Clint Eastwood has made a movie with a creepy atmosphere the entire time. His direction is one of the other great things in this movie.Back to the performances. The best performance in the movie is from Tim Robbins. In every scene you feel what has happened to him as a kid. He even uses vampire movies as a metaphor to how he feels. Sean Penn has a great performance as well. He is not as good as Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation' but comes close. Penn sometimes goes a little over the top where Murray was always perfect in character. Kevin Bacon seems to have the easiest part, but you can see the pain he constantly feels. He has a pregnant wife but she has left him. She sometimes calls him but doesn't say anything. Bacon does a great job in showing us how he feels.Smaller parts are very good as well. You forget Fishburne was playing Morpheus in 'The Matrix'-trilogy almost immediately. Marcia Gay Harden is probably the best from the supporting cast although Laura Linney, and especially her final creepy moments, comes close. Linney's performance is to small to really see how good she plays it. Tom Guiry as Brendan, who is not the best known here, surprised me in a very positive way. The more the movie develops the more he shows us how good he is.Clint Eastwood has made his second-best film after 'Unforgiven' with a great story, adapted by Brian Helgeland ('L.A. Confidential') from the book written by Dennis Lehane. Together with his own music and his actors he creates a creepy atmosphere and has the nerve to not simply play that out. Giving the characters real lives is a movie you don't see very often anymore. Eastwood does it and Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Linney, Harden, Fishburne and Guiry make sure they are believable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Bury our sins.,"The main genre of Mystic River is drama- but there is also a strong mystery/ suspense element. Amongst this all is a deeply woven story of the past, redemption and fate. The reason it works so well is the cast - with Robbins and Penn being the standouts. Gay- Harden , Fishburne, Bacon and Linney provide solid support. The way to describe this film is powerful and most of these scenes involve either Robbins or Penn. The score is haunting and captures the time and moment perfectly. This is not an easy watch but you won't be able to look away. One of the best dramas of the 2000s. Look fast for a young Spencer Treat Clark. A must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Mystically Captivating,"In 2003, starring some of the most profound actors in Hollywood, Mystic River tells the tale of a father who unexpectedly loses his daughter, when she is murdered. Overcome with grief and anger Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn, takes it upon himself to find his daughter's killer.Katie Markum, Jimmy's daughter, played by Emmy Rossum, is killed at the very beginning of the film, at the tender age of 19. Her father who feels as though he knows his daughter better than any other, only truly learns about his daughter's second life after her death. One of the Investigators on the murder case and child-hood friend to Jimmy is Sean Divine, played by Kevin Bacon. When the investigator begins his work to try and figure out what really happened to Katie Markum, he unveils her secret love affair with Brenden Harris, played by Thomas Guiry. The two were set to leave for Las Vegas to get married the day after Katie's death. The plot thickens when a flash backs reveal a tragedy that happened to Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle, played by Tim Robbins. All three boys were friends when they were younger and one day when playing in the street, Dave is abducted by a strange man pretending to be a cop. Dave ends up going missing for days and only returns when he escapes from his captures. Ever since the experience when Boyle was a boy he has never quite had the same demeanor. When Dave Boyle is one of the last people to see Katie Markum alive, he becomes a prime suspect to the police and to Jimmy Markum.This film did a phenomenal job of displaying the grief and anguish a parent faces when they lose a child. As a viewer you can almost feel Jimmy Markum's pain and suffering when his daughter is slain. Moreover, the complicated relationships between the 3 men who were friends as children make this film even more drama packed. Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job directing the A-list stars in the film in expressing the overbearing and powerful emotions that make this film a hit! I could not tell you one single thing that this movie did wrong or that could have been improved. Clint Eastwood and cast perfected this movie and nothing could be changed in order. Even the film's tone and scenery changed from the begging to the end, utter genius. At the beginning of the film, the lighting and shots are bright and cheery and at the very and the shots are darker and somber. Beyond a doubt, true perfection.If any Oscar should go out to anyone in this film it should definitely go to Tim Robbins. Robbins portrayal of an adult, whose childhood experiences shaped his adulthood nightmare, was absolutely unbelievable. The actor couldn't have depicted his character any better. The role was absolutely the most challenging role of the entire film, and he nailed it.Mystic River hit the nail on the head.

Close to being a masterpiece.,"This Clint Eastwood directed film, 'Mystic River', is based on the brilliant novel by Dennis Lehane. The word 'stunning' gets overused but the performances by the cast were little short of that. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deserved their Oscars; Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne; Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney; and a knockout range of fine American actors prove again how deep is the talent in the American movie business. Eastwood's no nonsense direction pushed the narrative along with concision and craftsmanship; he is a master of the subtle 'who did what' drama, such as this, and I bet it came in under budget and on time. (IBDM says $25m budget, box office $157m). My wife and I were gripped by this story of a generation growing up and coalescing later in a Boston suburb. The real Mystic River is seven miles long. It lies to the north of Boston and flows approximately parallel to the lower portions of the Charles River. It flows from the Lower Mystic Lake and travels through the Boston-area communities of Arlington, Medford, Somerville, Everett, Charlestown, Chelsea, and East Boston. The river joins the Charles River to form inner Boston Harbor. And that brought me to Robert Lowell and his Charles River poem, for no good reason other than the sheer quality of the original book, this film and that wonderful poem... All three are superb.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tim Robbin's Performance and Clint Eastwood's Hardwork Made this movie A masterpiece,This Movie is Awesome. one of my favorite movie so far. Great Performances by Marcia Gay Harden Tim Robbins etc. although i was shocked after Oscars because i had never thought that Sean was getting for this movie. Sean had done a fair job with his role. for him it was really easy to perform such role. Clint Eastwood last films were really disappointing but this movie is a great movie with all respects and Tim Robbin's performance was mid blowing and Marcia gay Hayden's scenes were also nice. overall this movie is symbol f hard performances by Tim Robbin's and Clint Eastwood that makes this movie really really great.

"Mystic River, starring Sean Penn, Lawrence Fishburne, Tim Robbins, and Joan Cusack","Sean Penn is one of my absolutely favorite actors, writers, producer and director.

powerhouse performances power Mystic River,"With an ensemble as strong as Mystic River's, one would presume greatness, though we have definitely seen movies where the sum of its parts does not quite equal the potential whole (""The Hours"" comes to mind).  Mystic River, however, delivers. Eastwood's film, masterfully and--excitingly enough--subtlety directed, barrels out of the gate and doesn't stop for breath until well into the final act.  Sean Penn is stunning; one of the most vivid portrayals of grief on celluloid in recent memory.  It is almost painful to watch him cope with the murder of his daughter.  Everyone in the cast, in fact, is at the top of their game.  Tim Robbins turns in his best work in years, and it is good to see Linney and Harden  doing some strong work (in supporting roles). Linney's final monologue is dynamite. Though the film doesn't ""teach us a lesson"" per se when all is said and done, there is superb character dissection/examination going on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not as easy a watch as one would think,"I first saw Mystic River in 2003. I hated it. I found Sean Penn to be incredibly over the top and self congratulating in his performance (something I still think he is guilty of in almost every film I have seen of his) and the story was sinister high hokum.Now six years on return to the scene of the crime and find myself about turned. I was fourteen, or thereabouts, when I first saw Mystic River. I was yet to really learn the distinction between actors and superstars, and I thought that the film was a whodunit thriller entirely commonplace of Hollywood.It's not.As I said for my summary it is naive to watch this film thinking that it is about finding a killer. It most certainly isn't. It is a film about friendship, time and loyalty. The film makes way for female characters whom despite their domestic roles within the drama are entirely as important as the male ones in helping us to understand not just the characters, but the nature of the city the story is about. It is well acted for the most part and I found myself loving Sean Penn's performance, a rarity for me. It is rare that a film of this sort can turn the victim into the villain without it seeming like high hokum. Penn achieves this admirably, and while I still wish Bill Murray had won the 2003 Best Actor Oscar I am less enraged than I once was at his snub. Penn is certainly the second most deserving man of that year.Furthermore, the film is immersive in the detail of Boston as much as it is in us understanding how time changes friendship and family loyalties. Kevin Bacon superbly handles this. It is his now-outsider to the home he grew up in that emphasises the significance of the passage of time and how little childhood memories really affect the future.There are still problems with the film. Tim Robbins' performance just feels misplaced. Undeniably the most important character of the story somehow Robbins part on page and on screen don't feel fleshed out enough. There is so much more to this character than the film allows. His Oscar win was an undeserved one. Seek out Ken Watanabe's performance in The Last Samurai to see the true supporting performance of that year.Mystic River is a deeper, slower and more moving one than its placing within the thriller genre suggests. It is not as pacey as say Gone Baby Gone, another Lehane adaptation, nor as suspenseful as much of Eastwood's other work. But I do stand corrected.Mystic River is a very good, albeit flawed, film. See it and be rewarded, but be patient with it or you'll find yourself hating it for all the wrong reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Interesting Watch,"A haunting movie with two of Hollywood's A star actors Sean Penn & Kevin Bacon. The movie tells the tale of vigilante justice in a tough neighbourhood. Personally I found the movie slow and the narrative hard to get into but the scenes with the Investigators are the best part of the film.Movies like this tend to expose the mob element of the major characters. As such your attention is distracted by the behaviours of these characters and not on any central plot which was missing in this movie. This movie tries to replicate a book and for me it was not an enjoyable movie. It was however expertly acted.As always when focusing on the mature themes of the movie you have to be very delicate in handling this subject matter. The movie continues like so many other mob shows like the Godfather, Sopranos & The Goodfellas in glamorising the Mafia.Despite my dislike of this aspect of the story I am glad that I watched the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Icy and Dangerous Waters Ahead.,"Three adolescents (Jason Kelly, Connor Paolo and Cameron Bowen) in the 1975 Boston area fall to tragedy when Bowen (who grows to become Tim Robbins) is abducted by two pedophiles posing as beat cops. The event is chilling and leaves all three going down different routes of life. Kelly (who grows to become Sean Penn) became a hood, a trouble-maker who finally got his life straight after being in and out of jail as a young adult. Paolo (who ages to become Kevin Bacon) has become a police detective who is much better with his work than he is with a personal life spinning out of control (he continuously gets strange phone calls from his wife who has left him with little explanation). Soon the three childhood friends are brought back together when Penn's oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered near their home in a park. Simultaneously Robbins (who is not all there mentally obviously) comes home one dark and cold night covered in blood and having a rather deep cut in the middle of his gut. Wife Marcia Gay Harden is really worried about what may have occurred. Robbins tells her a story of a botched mugging and a fearsome street-fight between himself and an unknown assailant. However news of the event never hits the papers and Harden begins to wonder if Robbins may have had something to do with the gruesome murder of Rossum. While all this happens Bacon and fellow detective Laurence Fishburne are trying to solve the case. Emotions start to run high as Penn becomes suspicious of Rossum's secret boyfriend (Tom Guiry) and Robbin's bruised hand raises more questions. Guiry, who is constantly seen around the neighborhood with his younger mute brother (Spencer Tracy Clark), has always been on Penn's short list due to Guiry's father's mysterious past. And as all this transpires Penn's wife/Rossum's stepmother/Harden's cousin (Laura Linney) tries to be the rock that the entire family desperately needs while Harden herself starts to unravel emotionally. Penn, still hanging around with miscreants Kevin Chapman, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg (all brothers), begins to let anger overtake his sorrow and you wonder what is really going on in his chaotic mind. ""Mystic River"" is probably Clint Eastwood's finest film (acting or directing). He has his finger not only on the Brian Helgeland (who also adapted ""L.A. Confidential"") script, but also on the landmark performances across the board. As good as everyone is, Penn (who is on another plateau from most other actors right now in his career) and Robbins are the ones who end up making you feel very cold and tense throughout. They both give their finest performances in this intimate and emotional character study. The movie never lets up its grip and then has a surprising ending that will give you chill bumps on top of chill bumps. ""Mystic River"" never quite reached perfection with me, but its elements are something that are truly remarkable in this day of silly explosions and stupid screenplays in motion pictures. Watch for Eli Wallach in an uncredited cameo as a liquor store owner. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"There, but for the grace of God, go I.","Clint Eastwood seems to like irony, and how well he tells us about it! In Mystic River, as in Unforgiven, we see damaged characters doing their best to cope with their memories of the past. Three childhood friends were scarred by an incident that occurred while they were playing street hockey. Chance brings them all back together again about thirty years later, basically to show us all the pall that childhood incident cast on the rest of their lives. Ordinary reality is distorted by their respective consciences, and we see how each one struggles to come to terms with the memory that will not go away.This is not a feel good movie, but it is a good movie. It is a movie about what happens when life has dealt us the Queen of Spades. There are no heroes here, only people doing the best they can at what they know.

Awards should be forthcoming on this one...,"A great story and trophies should be in the offing. Brian Helgeland should get Best Screenplay and Best Adaptation consideration during awards season; Eastwood will be an easy pick and the sentimental favorite-even though his work merits any honor it should receive. On screen, Robbins and Penn will likely get nominations, though their being blowhards offscreen might trip them up in long haul. Still, none of that should matter when considering their work in Mystic River, because they both gave career performances. If I had to pick between the two, I would go with Robbins, because of his staid, disaffected affectation of a chronic victim. Penn, meanwhile, altered between being wonderful and a DeNiro indicator (what his fixation with Bobby D is, I'll never know but it often undoes his own greatness). Marcia Gay Harden will likely get consideration but I think this film was primarily a ""guy flick."" Laura Linney, like Penn, had moments but was uneven, seeming to struggle with a Boston brogue. In a fair world, Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne would also get consideration for their efforts, because they were fantastic in keeping the narrative moving. I don't like Robbins or Penn but their effort here made me forget my prejudice and watch them for what they really are: highly talented actors who were very lucky to get work on this great film. I just hope they remember that if their names are called during award ceremony and don't go off on some Michael Moore-esque rant.

This movie is DEEP.First Layer: The superb crime mystery/thriller aspect of the movie. Who killed Katie Markum? Everyone suspects Dave, who has been acting strange and came home to Celeste at 3am covered in blood the same night Katie Markum died. But this is a Hollywood movie, so everything is not as it seems. Or is it?Next Layer: Characters. This movie has great acting. It received Academy Awards for best actor (Sean Penn) and best supporting actor (Tim Robbins) the year it came out. Their performances are so gripping, and deal with such difficult characters, 3-dimensionally, that it would be hard to disagree with the Academy's choice. This isn't a good-vs.-evil story, with a hero cop rushing to stop a sociopathic villain. This is a story in which everyone is human, they all make choices, and those choices have consequences. Very Shakespearian.A Deeper Layer: Philosophical/Intellectual. Like all great movies and pieces of art, this movie deals with the weighty questions of human nature. How far should a man go to avenge the death of his loved ones? How much of our lives are made up of our own choices, and how much of our lives are influenced by the choices of others? How much does fate play a role? I suppose that the movie's title, ""MYSTIC RIVER"" is also the strongest metaphor in the film. It can stand for many things.Without a doubt, this film is Tragic.

Kind of predicatalbe,"First of all the acting was amazing even the first time around. But still, after reading the book it was as if the characters gained one more level of depth. I have always felt that Tim Robbins is the true gem in this movie. His pained portrayal of the lost soul Dave Boyle is pure magic, seldom has an Oscar been so well deserved. Sean Penn is predictably great in his portrayal of Jimmy Markum. It's a difficult character, a person you really don't know what to think about. In one respect he is a worried father, in another respect he is a cold-blooded man with few things to like about him. The rest of the cast is solid, with Kevin Bacon the brightest star among them.When it comes to the plot itself this was where much was changed from reading the book. The trick is not to watch this as a crime-drama. Rather it's a movie about behavioral patterns, about humans. What they are capable of and what dictates their actions. There are huge amounts of sadness and melancholy to this story. Of people unable to break out of the path it seems life has chosen for them.

OK,"The main problem I had with Mystic River was that it had trouble deciding if it was a murder mystery or a film about human nature.  The movie's strength is when it is focusing on its characters and the decisions they make based on trust and instinct.  More importantly, it is about the path one takes after making these decisions.  However, there is too much time focused on the whodunit part of the movie.  Maybe I concentrated too much on the mystery and a second viewing will change my mind.  But to be fair, once I was pretty confident with who I thought the murderer was, it was early on in the movie.  I had enough time to understand the film's meaning and to take in the performances without trying to play detective.  It just never reeled me in.  Eastwood does a good job of providing a depressing atmosphere and Penn does deliver a fine performance.  The rest of the cast holds its own and there is nothing offensive about the movie.  However, with all of the hype surrounding the movie, I came out of the theatre thinking it was just okay.  I think that Mystic River would have been more powerful and worthy of its praise if it had stuck with the evaluation of its characters rather than dedicating so much time to being a mystery.  7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Very well-directed and well-acted, but the script is flat","Dennis Lehane's ""Mystic River"" is unquestionably flawed as a novel, with many long passages of indulgent, unnecessary, and not very good prose taking away from the detailed characters and intricate plotting. It is, therefore, a perfect novel to turn into a film, as the film could focus on the characters, story, and thematic content. In the hands of a director as great as Clint Eastwood, with a cast perfectly suited for the material, I expected more than I got from ""Mystic River"", a movie that is never boring but never becomes anything more than passable as a script. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland is completely flat and lacking in confident handling of the themes and ideas present in Lehane's novel, with Dave Boyle's character reduced to little more than a cliché, and the central theme of the character reduced to two or three unbelievably predictable scenes.""Mystic River"" is a long movie, but it still feels rushed. Helgeland is simply poor at adapting literature, as he chooses to pack in as much of the novel's labyrinthine plot into the film, forsaking the much more important character development necessary for the plot to be interesting. Perhaps it's just me, but I would much rather see this trend of trying to be 'faithful' to a novel when adapting it by simply including as much of the plot as usual. That's not the case. I don't even care if Helgeland wrote this as a straightforward thriller, forsaking all the character development and thematic content of the novel. What he has done here is that he has written a character-centric drama with flat, uninteresting characters, and the film simply does not work as a result. It works as passable entertainment, but it is also very frustrating.I cannot fault ""Mystic River"" on a technical level. Clint Eastwood is among the best living directors, and this film is handled very well by him and his crew. Photographer Tom Stern's work is outstanding and the sound work here is also very good. Eastwood's score is certainly worth mentioning, a CD I enjoy a lot and actually listened to many times well before I saw this film. The film thankfully moves at a decent pace, keeping it from being as boring as reading Helgeland's script surely would be. The acting is excellent, although I thought Sean Penn was among the less impressive members of the cast.A film severely flawed as a result of its flat, bland screenplay, ""Mystic River"" is worth seeing if you are a fan of the cast or director, but it is certainly far from being the great film it so easily could have been.6/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
So real it's scary.,"Twentyfive years later, a horrible event brings three old friends back together. Jimmy's daughter has been brutally murdered. Celeste suspects her husband Dave because of his suspicious behavior and Sean is assigned to the case as detective. Slowly and surprisingly the truth emerges.At first sight, Mystic River appears to be a thriller in the tradition of Seven, however it is essentially a completely different movie. As opposed to other thrillers, the emphasis was not put on solving the mystery, but on the influence the crimes have on the people involved. The effect on their family members and their environment. This is being perfectly illustrated by Mr. Eastwood. You can actually feel Jimmy's harrowing pain when he discovers his daughter has been murdered. This goes on the entire movie, feel, feel, feel. Obviously the acting performance of the protagonists is the crucial ingredient. It was hard to remember they were actors and not those sad people from Boston.Every separate frame looks like a beautiful picture with a beautiful composition and eye for detail, which make the events seem very ""real"". Even the accents of the protagonists are flawless. From start to finish, you feel as if you're in the quiet neighborhood of Boston.All in all, an incredibly well made movie with a surprising story.

This River runs deep,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsGoing to back to my comments on Blood Work,where I said that perhaps it was time for Clint to retire.I'd now like to edit that a little,if I may.Perhaps he should take a back seater to leading parts in films,but if he can still manage to helm fine quality filmic material such as this,perhaps total senility hasn't kicked in.This is the tale of three childhood friends,Jimmy,Dave and Sean.One day,an unfortunate encounter leads to Dave being abducted and mentally scared for the rest of his life.Just under thirty years later,the trio,still living in their childhood home town of Boston,Massachusetts,are reunited under more tragic circumstances.Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Dave (Tim Robbins) have remained close friends but Sean (Kevin Bacon) has drifted apart from the gang and become a homicide detective.His job position,however,is about to play a pivitol role in the tragic circumstances that are about to unfold,when Sean's teenage daughter is viciously murdered.This has a devastating effect not only directly on Sean and his family,but on the local community as a whole.More devastating revelations are made,however,as Sean and his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) conduct their investigations and uncover evidence that ends up pointing the finger directly at Dave.As Sean struggles to contend with these new findings,the three childhood best friends find themselves inexplicably drawn back together once more to confront not only the present nightmare engulfing all their lives,but events from the past that start to crop their ugly heads up once more.This is a very deep and intelligent film,which puts a whole new slant on the modern variation of the murder mystery genre and,perhaps unsurprisingly,has found itself the subject of only a limited release in amongst all the bloated,insincere eye candy 2003 has found itself laden with (just shows how much audiences respect their own intelligence,don't it?).Eastwood's direction is stylish and absorbing,another film of his from the legendary Malpaso company,who produced that unforgettable hit of his so many years ago.The performances from all concerned are brilliant and highly emotive.The ending is unpredictable,well scripted and powerfully raw.Much like the majority of the film,really,just especially so.It's perhaps one notch off perfect.The trauma Dave suffered as a child perhaps could have been played on a bit more.But it is a hugely brilliant idea for a film,very inspired and highly worth your time.And,as an aside,so deep you could probably end up drowning in it.****",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perfect Eastwood dialectics,"The incredible potency of Eastwood's visual metaphysics (see how the camera so often in his work hovers from above like some perverted God's eyeview that watches but never interferes) meets the substantial (both existential and political) crosscutting (the aesthetic breakthrough of this entry of his) of children/adults perpetually engulfed in their sins.
The nightmarish web is further complexed by the no less than four females of the story (and the ghosts of two more, adding to an amazing number of characters for a 138-minute film), building a challenging case of a feminist, anti-feminist and tragedy-like reading of the impossibly dense text.

"Muddled, overrated mess","I came in expecting some kind of transcendent cinematic experience (like chinatown, the godfather, or on a lesser scale, unforgiven) but instead sat through 137 minutes of blue collar east coast cliches, improbable plot twists, and juvenile lines utttered by throwaway characters capped off by a totally predictable ending.  The excellent character actor john doman sullies his career by appearing in the first 10 minutes of the film as a violent pedophile. Would that Tim robbins had followed his lead, even his outstanding effort couldn't rise above material, and I watched his film demise with sense of relief.Sean Penn spends lots time screaming and drinking in this film, undoubtedly as a form of protest over his fetishistic tattoo and hairstyles. Note to eastwood: next time you want to add regional ethnic sensibilities to a film, watch a season of the sopranos. (and can the make up artist with the prison fantasies)Laura Linney is utterly unconvincing as penn's shrewish second wife. I was embarrassed for her and averted my eyes at the end when she combined a little lady macbeth with a lot of angela lansbury. I could go on, but the overwhelming sense of ennui mystic river evokes is coming back so I'll stop. I really wonder about the critics who loved this movie. Did they walk out early?

"""We bury our sins here, Dave. We wash them clean.""","Mystic River is still my topmost choice for psychological thriller movie. It does not only challenge our intuition in whodunnit quest, but also embraces an outlook for inviting audiences into discussion about morals and human motives. The three men as main characters have internal conflicts as they wrestle with psychological demons they uncover. The apparent reality of their shared childhood tragedy sort of leeches through little by little as their lives moves along, hinged on the well crafted scenes of grief and trauma.

Mystic Tragedy,"Mystic River is a very mysterious and tragic film. The mood of the movie is very dark, suspenseful, and chilling. The movie starts out with three boys playing stickball in a rough section of Boston, known as East Buckingham. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) always did what most boys do in their neighborhood. Nothing exciting ever happened until one day Dave was forced to take the ride that would change all their lives forever. The boys all stopped spending time together and eventually grew apart. Their lives all turned in different directions.Now twenty-five years later, yet another life-altering event, the murder of Jimmy's daughter, brings them all back together again. Sean has become a cop, and he and his partner are now assigned to unravel this mysterious crime. Jimmy, now full of rage, wants to find his daughters murderer. Sean must stay a couple steps ahead of him so no one gets killed.Dave comes home late one night with blood all over him. The same night Jimmy's daughter, Katie, was murdered. Dave's wife, Celeste, helps him clean everything up. The next day Dave starts to act weird and becomes distant. Celeste now thinks that something's up and he may be the killer of Katie. Because of Dave's terrifying past, he is now a suspect in the mysterious crime.I loved the film. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job directing it. The scenes, setting and story plot are fantastic. The music keeps you on your toes and was perfect for this movie. Mystic River is full of suspense and mystery.For me the film was a little to long. There is not to much I would change about it though. This was my favorite movie out of all the films we have seen so far. I really did not like how the movie ended.I believe all the actors did a phenomenal job playing their roles. Sean Penn did an excellent job playing the enraged father, Jimmy. Tim Robbins did fantastic as the disturbed Dave. Kevin Bacon did amazing playing the role as the determined cop Sean. Marcia Gay Harden played the role as Celeste. Celeste is Dave's wife in the movie, and did a fantastic job acting scared, nervous, and suspicious of Dave's late night out. Laura Linney as the role of Annabeth. In the film, Annabeth is Jimmy's wife, and does an amazing job acting strong, tough, and very protective. Then playing the role as Sean's partner Whitey is Laurence Fishburne. In the movie she is a homicide detective and stands by Sean's side trying to unravel the murder.Anyone who enjoys suspenseful, mysterious movies should watch this one. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job not only getting the right actors for this film, but an awesome job directing it. You could not ask for a better movie. It has its twists and turn to keep you guessing on who murdered Katie. This is one of my favorite movies. I can't believe how the movie ended. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10!!

Clint Eastwood delivers a intense thriller!,"I recently revisited this Eastwood masterpiece and it still remains one of my favourite films of all time. Mystic River is a brilliant murder mystery full of layers but it's also so much more than that. Each character is delicately weaved so that we know their personalities and why they are how they are to a tee. It's stunningly shot and directed with a beautiful score with a wicked script. On the surface it appears to be about the three men and their innocence lost mixed in with ideas about power, retribution and family bonds. The women in mystic river are in fact arguably the more integral part Annabeth, cold in her manner seems to support whatever Jimmy does, she seems ruthless. Celeste seems to be losing her husband and turns from one of the most stable to the most unstable from start to finish and Sean's wife leaves him at breaking point whilst navigating the case.

What were they thinking?,"Is there such an animal as a script reader in Hollywood these days?First off, this is MY kind of movie. Kind of a psycho thriller who-done-it mystery. I've seen TV shows pull it off better.The acting? The Characters were written well so pretty much anyone decent would have done a good job. Tim Robbins probably had the only really good performance yet he was the only one given a challenging role. I don't really buy the ""guy crying"" or ""physically challenged"" best actor awards Hollywood gives out. One scene you'll hear an actor with a brooklyn accent, the next with a california accent and the next with a Boston accent. And how much did they get paid?The plot? This could have been a GREAT movie. With just a few little changes. There were enough twists and turns to make you wonder a little but after having to battle through the flaws, I didn't really care who did it at the end and was ultimately disappointed at the unconvincing attempt to name a killer. So weak and powerless.The Direction? Eastwood must be getting really old because there were so many obvious flaws it was distracting. Maybe if he'd come off his high horse and let someone with talent direct it (like someone his grandsons age) it would have at least let the cameras do some talking so the actors didn't have to do the ""wink wink"" thing.The Ending . LOL!!. When I thought the movie was going to end, I was thinking ""ok, not a bad ending, I get it, mystic river. Not bad."" That was before they actually said the words Mystic river and before the real ending came. I'm still in awe that they ended the movie that way.

There are no winners or heroes to be found,"""Mystic River"" (2003): Talent all around. Directed, produced, and scored (!) by Clint Eastwood, with many of the actors I admire most: Sean Penn, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburn, & Tim Robbins. Add a strong suspense/crime story (with a few plot line ""holes"" that were probably explained in the original novel) composed from the history and psyches of three childhood friends, use great photography, supportive music...and you have one serious, high quality drama. It is not a pretty sight, and there are no winners or heroes to be found, but it rings of Truth - lives that circle and circle around shared and private histories, that never get clarified, that never utter what needs to be spoken. The meanings and characters of this story are larger than the little lives depicted. This is the stuff of epics.

truly intense and anti-hollywood movie of the year,"I had to comment on that movie not because of the terrific oscar-worthy performances of the trio: Penn, Robbins, Bacon as this is the fact that everyone seems to notice. What is strange, many of you here don't like the ending which seems to be untrue and strange. I was even misled by the movie magazine that presented some irrational explanation of the final scene (Penn's talk with his wife and the parade)that turned out to be completely pointless after I saw the film.It's, of course, my personal opinion but everything necessary to understand it is covered in the film's tagline: We bury our sins, we wash them clean. There is no catharsis in this movie. Nobody seems to change one's life or admit to one's sins. Everything is hidden and deliberately forgotten. The characters clearly need the feeling of stability in their life. After the storm the sun must rise. Linney's character lives with supportive husband and two daughters. The daughters need their father, the wife needs her husband. The dark days are over now - there comes a time to rest and forget. She simply defends the family from collapsing at the same time disclosing the sad but true character of humans reaction. We don't have to agree with her but there is a truth in her attitude. Penn's character in the scene of the murder also wants to believe that he has the right person despite the fact that there is no hard evidence. He immediately wants to finish everything and knows only one solution. The waiting is killing him and he wants to believe that this night everything is to end. The film comes to the shocking point of humans' emotional character - when sth beautiful - pure, strong love to the beloved daugther is the main reason of sth horrible - it leads the murder.And the scene of parade - ""light-hearted"" Americans are watching the parade - children are laughing, music is playing, sun is shining and the whole afternoon seems almost idyllic. All the secrets and dark events are buried and the characters can start to pretend in front of everyone than nothing happened although it's a mystery for us what's happening in their souls.Very pessimistic and anti-hollywood film that uses the typical themes of abuse,loss in the family and vengeance and mix them into a new, intense movie quality with deep and captivating performances. I don't believe in Academy Awards anymore but still I do hope that they will notice everything that Eastwood put into his latest effort and the film will gather the well-deserved collection of oscars.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A tragedy without solution,"Clint Eastwood is one of the last classic directors today and in 2003 he ventured to adapt Dennis Lehane's book 'Mystic River'.
The plot begins with a tragic event, where a group of children are playing on the street and one of them is kidnapped. After that the story makes a temporary jump and shows children and adults.
Eastwood's vision of this story is captured throughout the film with his great mastery. A dark story with elements of film noir and police film marks the atmosphere and the characters in the story. Characters completely broken and marked by a traumatic event that occurred in their childhood, which will always accompany them, therefore we are facing a tragedy or drama without solution, which makes the story extremely sad.
The final message that Clint Eastwood delivers is completely explicit, those three children were kidnapped in their childhood, their innocence was stolen and they could never escape it. Even in his adult life, where each one has been influenced in one way or another by that fact. And the director tells this sad story in the most brilliant way possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Although the performances are strong, this is a very flawed and overrated picture.","I was quite underwhelmed by this film. There are many who consider this to be among the greatest films to be created by director Clint Eastwood, on the level of 'Unforgiven' or 'Gran Torino'. I sadly did not see a great film here, I mostly saw a decent but ultimately flawed and uninspired character drama.Firstly, the films biggest asset is it's cast of actors. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne all give great performances and it is quite interesting to see their varied acting styles interact. Tim Robbins probably gives the most impressive performance here, totally worthy of an Academy Award. However, the acting is dragged down by an uninspired and formulaic script. Many of the lines are tedious and cliché', and others are almost nonsensical and stupid. This does not apply for every exchange, however it is prominent enough to be an annoyance.The plot is fairly standard fare. There are no shocking twists or particularly daring ways of presenting the story here. It is far from incompetent or laughable, however it almost becomes boring in it's predictability. The film's strongest narrative feature is it's solid pacing, allowing the actors room to showcase their acting talent, in fact much of the film appears centred around creating the perfect conditions for these actors to demonstrate their talents. The film's pacing is sadly ruined towards the end, when the film's plot is wrapped up and an overlong epilogue sequence does it's best to ruin as much of the good which came before as possible. Not only in terms of pacing, but also in terms of character and the film's thematic content, This ending was quite terrible and did much to destroy the film for me, specifically the moronic 'King' monologue.The cinematography and set design is very nice, nothing outstanding but defiantly strong. It has a very well defined look and can get downright gorgeous at times, specifically in it's impressively shot opening sequence. However this good visual work is often undermined by a poorly used and highly repetitive soundtrack. Often wildly out of place with the actions on screen, and sounding quite cheap and melodramatic in places.Overall, although the performances are good, I was quite underwhelmed by this picture. I could not look past it's gaping flaws and did not find it much above decent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
When Bad Things Happen to Bad People,"Director Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" is a well-performed, but ugly and disturbing film. When it opens, the characters who grow up to be Sean Penn (as Jimmy Markum), Tim Robbins (as Dave Boyle), and Kevin Bacon (as Sean Devine) are pre-teenage boys. Young ""Dave"" is abducted, after the three play hockey on a Massachusetts street. First of all, the actors playing young ""Jimmy"" (Jason Kelly) and ""Sean"" (Connor Paolo) seem to be reversed; possibly, this is because Mr. Bacon's character's name is also Mr. Penn's first name? Secondly, the confusing abduction is of a sexual nature; later, when the story temporarily becomes an intriguing drama, this is clarified. By the third act, the film has fallen apart.****** Mystic River (2003) Clint Eastwood ~ Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An accurate character study,"Clint Eastwood is known, in my mind, for directing films that show humanity, primarily the male segment, as it really is.  And that is exactly what you get when you make an outing to see Mystic River.  He achieves this with the help of unfailingly excellent acting from all fronts.The film is not a failure at mashing together a number of different genres. It is a genreless story, which includes all the aspects of the murder case as they need to be shown, so that you can sympathize with Bacon, Penn, and Robbins' characters to the fullest.  You feel suspense when the characters do, and are intrigued when they seek the answer to a question.The primary controversy in this film is its ending.  This is partially because what actually happens at the end is controversial, and Eastwood is not willing to let us know what he had in mind.  We are expected to look at what we have learned about the characters throughout the story, and look at their final actions, and decide what has happened to them, and why they did what they did.  It is up to us to judge their decisions, and we don't have any narrated monologues to help us.

Changing review.,"I watched the movie probably three or four times in my life (I'm not great at remembering plots and twists and I always remember the twist is big).The first couple of times I watched this, probably ten years ago or so, I rated it a 9. I was 21 at the time and the twist bought my high rating.I watched this with more mature adult eyes now and introduced a friend to this. I rated it 6 now.Things I liked:-* Character development, drama. Bit like Prisoners (another favourite of mine) it's a slow build up and you get to understand their worlds.* Twist* Theme of decisions we make, G-d, destiny changing our lives.Things I didn't like (now):-* Weird plot holes. (What's with Devine's wife?; What's with this Just-Ray guy? Is Brandon Jimmy's love-child?)* Length of film* No clear motive for what happened. You're just told 'there it is, because it is.'

"Unbelievably disappointing, over praised and ridiculous!","""Mystic River"" has received rave reviews around the world. It's been called one of the best pictures of the year and it's likely to get the Oscar. Why? I'd say it's because ""Mystic River' with its fake power fooled people and critics as usually bad movies do. The perfect example is `A Beautiful Mind', `Forrest Gump', ""Titanic"", etc. `Mystic River' is fake and disappointing. Aside from the predictability and triviality, I found the acting unconvincing.I can honestly say that ""Mystic River"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It pretends to be so moving, dramatic and powerful, but it fails in all counts.`Mystic River' tells the story of three men who had a difficult childhood. One of them was `supposedly' raped, and the others had different problems. As time went on, one of them had problems with his missing wife and the other with penal antecedents.Let's begin by the countless mistakes: 1. At the beginning of the movie we see these three men in their childhood. 25 years go by, but the characters look terribly old, especially Sean Penn's. It's ridiculous they'd get so old, while Kevin Bacon's character looks rather young. In fact much younger than his friends.2. The movie is overdone. There wasn't a scene that I found powerful or completely believable. Sean Penn is annoying. His performance is over the top, without his showing any real feelings. He tries so hard and makes it what it is `A mess'.3. Tim Robbins also overacts. He is too ridiculous and his lack of seriousness as an actor is evident. He was `supposedly' abused as a child, but eventually he marries and has a child. He keeps his frustration inside himself, but then he shows his anger by killing a man who was abusing another child. That's too much easy and farfetched. Oddly enough it happens the same day, in which Penn's character's daughter is brutally killed.4. The wives are completely disagreeable. They just keep sobbing and hugging each other making this an annoying flick. I'd have felt for them, but the story is so contrived and pointless that it's hard to do so.5. The score is dull and lacks liveliness or even a dramatic touch to make it at least more powerful, but it's the same foolish music over and over again.6. Kevin Bacon's character is a waste of time. I don't see the point of his being in the movie at all. The whole movie would've been the same without his presence. It's contrived that he's a murder investigator and that he has a missing wife with a child and at the ending they just appear again like a fairy tale.7. The ending is terribly weak, predictable, bad and laughable. It left me with the feeling as if it were good to take the law into your hands and kill the suspects of the murder of your daughter, and then feel proud of doing so. Then at a parade Kevin Bacon's character with his wife and child happily smiles at Mr. Penn's character. It's just corny and completely annoying. In a way it reminds me of the triviality of `The Hours', but in a masculine version. They are both disappointing and gushy and they're both over praised.`Mystic River' without a doubt is a huge disappointing. The fact that it was shot in 39 days says so. It was a haste effort with no depth and accuracy looking contrived and unbelievably trite. 3/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Really depressing.,"A dark, moody, depressing movie. Raw at times, and heart breaking.  Excellent acting with a tough raw look at vigilantism.   As a work of art it's just too depressing.  A good lesson in this film... if that's what you go to the movies for you'll love it.  If you go to movies to be uplifted, to feel like you can accomplish whatever you set your mind to... go see something else.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Why does this remind me of a Stephen King story?,"It really feels like one. Anyway, MYSTIC RIVER is about a small town who reacts to the horrible murder of the daughter of one of it's residents Jimmy Malcom (Sean Penn). Interestingly enough, his two childhood friends Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are both very much involved in the case. Sean is a state policeman investigating the crime with his partner Morpheous...I mean Whitey (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave is one of the prime suspects. The true wonder of this movie isn't really the plot, but the performances. Penn, Robbins, Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden (who plays Dave's wife, Celeste) are all fine actors that really make watching this movie fun. Most notably Harden's portrayal of a wife that is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her duty as a citizen to uphold the law. The movie has a great beginning and a fine ending. But the middle is a bit sloppy. It could have used some better editing to make the middle of the movie more taut. Other than that, the movie is pretty good. The mystery of who killed Jimmy's daughter is intriguing, but really makes for a tense thriller toward the 3rd act. People and critics are saying that this is the best movie of 2003. I don't really get that. It's a good movie. Just not a great movie. It isn't as good as some of my favorites of 2003, such as MATCHSTICK MEN or WHALE RIDER. Or even some of the popcorn flicks like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. But still, I recommend this. See it if just for the performances.RATING: *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
modern Greek Tragedy,"3 childhood friends Jimmy, Dan & Sean drifted apart after a terrible tragedy & grew up in the same city. Destiny pitted them again & it's brutal tragedy again. Jimmy's 19 year old daughter murdered & Dave is the strong suspect. Sean is a cop trying to solve the crime before something unusual done by uncontrollable with situational fix. Its superb script & screen play & I must praise Dennis Lehane for it. But the real laudable act is done by old macho cowboy named Clint Eastwood. This is Clint Eastwood's finest achievement as a director along with his other Oscar winning nuggets like Unforgiven & Million Dollar Baby. With awesome cast & finest performances of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins &Kevin Bacon he shapes a master crime thriller. Pendulum of Brooding thrilling suspense & heightened tension as film is progressing towards climax is just rock solid with awesome performances of Sean Penn & Tim Robbins & both of them got academy trophies for that. Marcia Gay Harden has done amazing justice to her role as psychologically confused wife of Tim Robbins. Must watch if you haven't seen it because this is Modern Greek tragedy.Ratings- 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Haunting; the best film of 2003.,"Since Dennis Lehane is my favorite author and I adore all of his stories, it's pretty clear that Mystic River is a film that compels me from start to finish. The story is one of my favorites of all time and is filled with intricately detailed characters full of flaws and backstory. Lehane took care in crafting all of these people so that all of them feel natural and none are completely unlikeable, but none of them come without flaws. He has a talent for making human characters and Mystic River is where this is best on display.The mystery of the film is conveyed perfectly; we are never so focused on figuring out who did it so we can be engaged in the lives of these people, but always in the back of our mind we are trying to unravel the plot. When the answer finally comes, it stuns me. Lehane's Boston roots show again as he immerses us into this city and how everything stems from the King that is Jimmy Markum. This dark, mysterious story is perfectly structured until the wrenching and painfully haunting finale. All three of these characters collide twenty-five years after an event that would destroy anyone's childhood. We see how their lives have built over the years and how each has come to be in this devastating story. Lehane's detail in this is incredible.When looking at the cast you can expect some phenomenal performances, and that's exactly what you get. Sean Penn gives one of the best of the decade in his intense and emotional portrayal of Markum. Tim Robbins also deserved his Oscar win and Kevin Bacon deserved much more critical acclaim for his subtle portrayal as the Detective trying to put all of the pieces together. An incredible, gut wrenching story that sticks with me well after the credits are through. It's Eastwood's best film by a long shot and the best film of 2003.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Ruined by Robbins,"Obviously, this was an interesting film that dealt with some intense characters. The exploration of the roots of violent behaviour was somewhat complex and nuanced. The relationships between the different characters were also drawn out by excellent direction and performances. However, I found Robbins' performance the least believable. He came across more as dull and simple minded rather than as a tortured soul dealing with severe childhood trauma. Fortunately, every other member of the cast were able to create and maintain the serious tragic tone required.Eastwood doesn't really take chances, so his work often reads as fairly conventional. Still, the performances in Mystic River and Unforgiven make up for these shortcomings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Sober, but good film with excellent acting.","I thought this was a good but sober film without many colour. I don't mean anything negative by that, because that sober, grayish atmosphere certainly doesn't work negative. You could also notice that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, however for once, he doesn't act in a film that he directed. The films grabs your attention from the first minute until the end. Mystic River is good, especially because of the excellent acting by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Also Kevin Bacon and the rest of the cast did a good job. The music (also written by Clint Eastwood) is quite good, but as I said, this is a sober film, so there's also not so much music in it.

"A big-budget ""Movie of the Week""","If 'Mystic River' is this year's leading Oscar contender, cinema is in deep trouble. Simply put, there is nothing in this film that you don't see in your typical NBC ""Movie of the Week."" It's that generic.This is one of those movies that thinks it's more important than it really is. The problems don't lay in the direction, but the writing. This small-community-murder-mystery story is something we've seen 100,000 times over. Every plot point you can see coming miles away. The characters are all over-emotional Lifetime TV cardboard cut-outs. And the dialogue? It only exists to spoon-feed the film's subtext to the audience (""Sometimes I think all three of us got in that car"" Oy.)So why does material this cliched attract such an A-list cast? Easy. Because such emotionally-charged (yet under-developed) characters give these actors the spotlight. It's an ego-trip. Nothing more.Just because a film tells a tragic story, doesn't make it subversive or Shakespearean. Sorry, but I'm not fooled by this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Acting; dismal movie.,"This is indeed a dark, disturbing film, that somehow is going every which way with emotions that are not quite harvested as a great director would do. Great acting, specially by Penn and Bacon, not crazy about Tom Robbins playing a basket case. Laura Linney hangs in there, you would think a woman that married Jimmy would have a bit more personality. Again, good acting, I don't think for a minute the movie is as greatly directed as the Hollywood machinery wants you to believe.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Powerful, just powerful...!","A good film is as good as a good book. Just as a good book lingers in your mind long after reading it - so much so that you are almost living in the world of the book - the images and the characters linger on long after watching a good movie... Clint Eastwood, from Dennis Lehane's book, and Brian Helgeland's writing has powerfully narrated a pathos-ridden story with a very palpable emotional impact... The film, with its issues of mistaken identity and perceptions, emotional trauma and loss and a rich characterization is indeed reminiscent of the unforgettable literary characters of George Eliot, Victor Hugo and Hardy...it is a story, had they seen/read it, would have met with their unanimous approval!Eastwood's almost documentary style and use of minimal music add to the total effect of the movie. Unlike what some people feel, the real denouement of this tale is not Dave's murder or the apprehension of the real killers of Katie, it is Sean Devine telling Jimmy about the truth - the impact of each word poignant and devastating, it is Jimmy's reaction (""the last time I saw Dave...was 25 years ago...""), it is Celeste's haggard appearance - having not only lost her husband, but also her son...we leave Mystic River anxiously wondering what will happen next...  What will be Celeste's redemption? Will, as Sean Devine wonders, redemption for Jimmy be to send Celeste 500$ per month? Leaving the theatre after watching a film like this, is like leaving the home of some really close friends whom you had visited that day on account of some tragedy that had befallen them and whom, before leaving, you keep on reminding, ""If there's anything I can do, let me know..."" knowing full-well that there is NOTHING that you can do...only eventuality can rectify these fatal errors...Hats off to the stellar performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. They both truly deserved all the praise and awards heaped on them. I was very glad that Sean Penn, after SO many memorable performances finally got acknowledged for his oeuvre! And Tim Robbins, with that haunted look in his eyes, his awkward gait and meek stance gave one of the most memorable performances by any actor on screen...This film is a powerful reminder that we as humans often negate the line between truth and falsehood, illusion and reality, although both are so mutually exclusive. It is a reminder to us to be vary of being swayed by prejudice, just believing in how things ""appear"" than how they actually are...This is a powerful piece of filmmaking...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Hard-hitting, gritty and great","Shame on me for not knowing that Mystic River was directed by Clint Eastwood until AFTER I'd watched it (yes, somehow I must have missed his name in the opening credits - shame on me, I know). I was just watching it because of its pretty impressive ensemble cast, including Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.We meet the three when they're just boys and Tim Robbins gets abducted by two men. He later escapes, but carries the scars with him right the way into adulthood. When they're grown up and have families of their own, Sean Penn's nineteen-year old daughter is murdered and Tim Robbins is the primary suspect.Not only did I not know about Clint Eastwood's involvement, but I also didn't know that it was based on a book. I haven't read this, so I can't compare the film to this. All I can say is that it's a pretty intense ride. You need to be in the mood for something pretty heavy as there's no 'light-relief' to be found here.All the characters play their respective parts well (Laurence Fishburne should get a special mention as he has the least character development and yet still brings more than a few nice touches to his role as supporting detective) and it was no wonder that it eventually went on to win Oscars.I won't give too much away about the plot, but I can't imagine many people will be disappointed with what they've watched.

"Mystic Chilling, So Intense","An instant jewel. To those that didn't see it I recommend it movingly. If you are elder, or if you enjoy smart, smooth and complex thought movies rent this one.Besides the flawless task of the cast (and flawless all the way), and enjoying the giant passion that brings forth Sean Penn, the quiet, full composition of Tim Robbins and the realism by Kevin Bacon, the movie is delightfully chilling, like sitting in a field covered on mist: just the watching of a beautiful scenario but at the same time feel a cold on the spine. I get this with mist and ""Mystic River"". A graceful, ghostly charm. That's what it gets you. A cold on the spine, wet sweat and not from terror; but from Intensity. The use of grey, dampened and humid spaces give the film a melancholic yet surreal atmosphere, where the real story is somewhat violent but incredibly intense and heartbreaking.This movie is super emotional, as I highlighted, very intense.

A profound and tragic story,"This dark, brooding film is a murder mystery that unfolds against the backdrop of early trauma in the lives of three boys in a Boston suburb. The unnamed location, perhaps Chelsea, evokes the clannish, guarded nature typical of Boston neighborhoods that tolerates without welcoming outsiders. The lives of the three main characters diverge with the passage of time, then come together again during the unfolding of the tragic events in the story. Each of the principals has issues they must grapple with each day and their lives and history are woven into an unstable, tattered quilt that threatens to unravel at any time. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are all excellent in portraying the emotional strains and the shifting tides that bring them together in this somber character study. Lawrence Fishburne is good as a detective on the periphery of his partner's personal ups and downs and is sympathetic but professional in his pursuit of suspects in the case.

Not Eastwood's finest but has it's advantages 7/10,"""Mystic River"" is a complex movie, about grief, loss, troubled life and childhood tragedy.

Sean Penn is wonderful and delivers a great performance. Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne have a great dynamic during the movie and are great actors. I felt really sorry for Tim Robbins's character. Seeing him suffer like that throughout the whole film made me feel bad for him towards the ending. There is a fabulous cinematography, with shadows over the characters and dark light during the tense moments. I loved the movie's dark tone but I feel in the same time that it is depressing.

Uses sexual child abuse to advance a violent and dark plot,"This movie uses the topic of sexual child abuse to advance a violent and dark plot.  It never explores what really happens to the victims after the abuse is over nor what motivates the abusers.  Nor does it involve the most common kinds of child abuse cases, abuse by family members, step-parents, or close family friends.  Instead it employs a Silence-of-the-Lambs type of abduction/abuse scenario to achieve maximum melodramatic effect.  It depicts child molestation as only happening out on the street rather than in our homes.  That is, in fact, a much more disturbing reality.  If the director, Clint Eastwood, is capable to showing the fragilities of children and the permanent damage that this abuse can cause, he failed in this case.  The string of coincidences in the plot coupled with improbable dialog makes the movie a depressing and stupid exercise in depicting the darkest of human emotions.  Example: When Jimmy (Sean Penn) says he does not believe Dave's (Tim Robbins) confession that he murdered a child molester and not Jimmy's daughter, Dave never tells Jimmy where he hid the molester's body which would have proved he did not kill Jimmy's daughter, been easily checked as it was only a few blocks away and would have saved his life from Jimmy's vengeance.  This simply did not make sense.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Blue-eyed and pitiless,"Mystic River involves abduction, sexual abuse, murder and vigilante justice, but by far the most frightening thing about it is Laura Linney. As the second wife of reformed criminal Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), we have seen her smiling as her daughter collects her first Communion and winced at her husband's constant reference to his first wife, but right at the end she emerges as a social Darwinist and endorser of violent means, any means, to protect the family home. You may have killed the wrong man, she says, but you did it for our daughters, so it was the right thing to do. She stands blue-eyed and pitiless, regal, at a street parade awash with American flags.The film is set in Boston, a grey New England city. Clint Eastwood directed: he maintains a steady pace, and a stately distance from his actors. Eastwood has an extraordinary feeling for flesh: every member of the cast has an indelible physical presence. The story centres on three childhood friends: Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins). As children, they are one day on the street when a mysterious car halts, and a man pretending to be a figure of authority abducts Dave. He is held in a cellar for four days before getting away. The movie jumps forward thirty years: Jimmy's nineteen year-old daughter is murdered, and Dave falls under suspicion. Sean is the investigating officer.The actors are extraordinary. As a man who cannot get away from early trauma, Robbins' eyes are simultaneously cloudy and brimming, twin bright orbs of darkness. He shuffles, shoulders hunched, and talks in a disabled mumble. Bacon is concise: there is no excess flesh on his face, even in his cheeks. Penn grows more rugged with time: his gathering wrinkles give him a sense of solidity. (His grief is contrasted with that of his daughter's boyfriend (Brendan Harris). Tears come easily to his smooth-skinned face, round like a doll. No matter how genuine, Harris' feelings do not have the same sense of gravity.) Then there is Linney, with her terrible blue eyes.It emerges that Jimmy was an underworld king, an Irish-Catholic don. In the course of Mystic River he re-assumes that role: he has two thickset thugs carry on an investigation into the murder, and acts on their findings. Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden, a twitching, fearful contrast to Linney) makes a confession to Jimmy and he hugs her, as though absolving her of any wrongdoing. Finally, he makes a delayed entrance into a deserted bar where an intended victim is already hemmed in by the thugs. The film might be subtitled: How a reformed crime boss might justifiably take back his mantle. Eastwood relies on the heavy feeling of dread that hangs about the movie like a fog to steer us to a conclusion not justified by the material. We return again and again to the sidewalk where Dave was abducted (The boys scrawled their names there in wet cement.), as if to say: in a world where something like this can occur, anything goes. I disagree.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Clint's greatest work,"This movie is the ultimate proof of mr. Eastwood's directorial skill and a career highlight for Sean Penn, who gives one of his three best performances here. Clint's impeccable style includes some marvellous touches such as the quiet, but ever-present sound of wind which adds to the chilling and eerily suspenseful atmosphere and several helicopter shots (his trademark) of the Mystic River at night. The overall mood is so darkly captivating and it really draws you in. The first scene is perhaps the most impressive one.Tim Robbins plays yet another disturbed and rather frightening character as Dave, the man with a dark and troubled past who ultimately turns out to be the greatest victim. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as his supportive wife and Laura Linney equally effective as her opposite, the surprisingly cold wife of Jimmy Markum (Penn). Eli Wallach, always a delight to watch, makes a thrilling cameo as mr. Loony the shop owner.What else is there to say?

Not much fun,"Three Hollywood powerhouses spar for screen time in this worthy but essentially cheerless yarn from director Clint Eastwood.Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon have racked up some impressive credits between them over the years so to cast them all together in a lugubrious, narrative-driven drama smacks a little of over-indulgence. These guys dominate every scene, squeezing out even their distinguished co-stars: Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden won't have found themselves on the support card very often in recent years. Clint, it seems, really knows how to drum up a decent cast. He has also well and truly hung up his spurs and holstered his .44 Magnum. Mystic River is a million miles from Dirty Harry or Unforgiven - this is slow and thoughtful fare that offers little in the way of audience satisfaction.Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave (Robbins) are childhood chums in Boston. After Dave survives a four-day ordeal of rape and torture at the hands of a local paedophile, the three drift apart. Their paths cross again years later when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Dave, still suffering from the mental scars of his own tortuous past and now a paranoid schizophrenic, is fingered as a leading suspect, while Sean is the detective leading the investigation.Jimmy, a reformed gangster, trusts more in his own methods of retribution than those of the authorities and clashes with Sean who wants to do things by the book.Nothing original there  childhood friendships jeopardised by more complicated adult scenarios  the whole 'wouldn't it be easier if we could just put all our differences aside and have a nice game of street hockey like the old days' routine has been done to death over the years and much better than this, frankly.Stand By Me is probably the best example of the knowledge-through-experience idea, where kids are coloured by significant incidents in their youth and grow up subconsciously gripped by the past.Likewise, other films have dealt with child abuse more thoroughly than Mystic River: Sleepers, for example, is quite evidently a film of two halves: First come the pathos-driven scenes of cruelty and torture and then the predictable score-settling.This is where Eastwood is perhaps too subtle for his own good. The scenes of the young buddies, these comrades-in-arms, are all too brief. We know they are 'friends forever' because they write their names in the unset cement; we also know that Dave is pretty comprehensively screwed-up by his ordeal, and that his mates suffer from a form of survivor's guilt because it was him and not them. But we aren't shown enough to really care. Perhaps some of the poignancy is lost by not allowing the audience to empathise deeply with the characters' younger selves.Still, there is plenty to sit back and admire. Robbins' breakdown is slow and skilfully played while Penn's despair is graphically and intensely studied. For a good part of this movie, the two of them seem hell-bent on out-gurning each other. Penn cleans up on the anguished sobs and tearful resentment stakes, while Robbins delivers a masterclass in staring dolefully out of windows. It would be almost comical if it weren't so darn depressing.Naturally things build to a bitter and inevitably grim conclusion that Eastwood seems pretty pleased with as he drags it out way beyond what is strictly necessary.The whole affair is suitably gripping, well acted and commendably free from sentimentality. Indeed, there is a startling lack of incidental music throughout (which is a big bonus in my book). Instead, silence is used to great effect and gives a slightly sinister edge when scenes are teetering on the brink of melodrama.Well crafted it may be  but a barrel of laughs it ain't.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I wish they had just let characters sit with the events at the end- not spoiling what happened- instead of trying to force a cheesy, artificial closure.Other than that, worth watching even though it's quite lengthy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mystic River is a Sean Penn & Clint eastwood tour de force,"Mystic River Director: Clint Eastwood Jimmy: Sean Penn Dave: Tim Robbins Sean: Kevin BaconYou know it took a while, a long while. The first three quarters of this year produced very few movies that rose above ""entertaining"". Hell going into October there were only three movies I had seen which I would qualify as great, Phone Booth, X2 and Dirty Pretty Things(T3 came close). Then came Kill Bill. It blew everything away and was my lock for movie of the year...that lock lasted an entire week. Mystic River is THE best picture of 2003 so far. Better than Lost in Translation, better than Th13teen, better than Phone Booth and, yes, better than Kill Bill.Mystic River takes you on an emotional ride through a small neighborhood and a murder which brings very ugly memories, and even uglier futures. I won't go over the plot, cause really it's pointless. Plus I don't wnat to spoil anything although it really doens't matter. This aint about a big twist ending or a big shoot-out ending, Mystic River's ending is just another step in life and it's heart wrenching getting there.I must first commend the great Clint Eastwood(one of the most underrated movie makes of our time IMO). This movie features no quick cuts or camera tricks. No special effects or action set pieces. It features realism(and soemtimes graphic realism), it features real characters gonig through troubles and trying to find real solutions. Eastwood has a sure hand in all this and stages the film perfectly. Not one shot is wasted and it is all Eastwood's vision, all the way down to the beautiful score.The acting, just by the actors names, you know is good. But I never expected it to be this good. Sean Penn wins the Oscar already with his performance. If he is not rewarded with the best actor statuette it's ultimate proof of the Academy's bias and BS. Penn is gut wrenchingly powerful in the early part of the film but in other parts is coldly sadistic but with a reason and thus even in his more sadistic scenes there is a sense of truth and tragedy towards Jimmy, making this Penn's greatest performance of his great career.Tim Robbins puts in, arguably although only Shawshank comes close, the best performance of his career as his lack of emotional range fits perfect for Dave's traumatic state. Laura Linney, Marci Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon provide ample support to the leads making this the best ensemble cast of the year.Overall there isn't much to say about Mystic River except this will move you and it will make you feel. It could possibly be classified a Shakesperean tragedy rewritten in modern time. The guilt, the revenge, the inner struggle it's all there. The acting is the best of any movie this year.

There are people who thought this was a good movie?,"A dreadful movie experience.  If you like movies where no one is at all likable and the story is depressing and has an unsatisfying ending, then this is the movie for you.  One has to wonder what people saw in it.The story is ostensibly about a hunt for a murderer.  The past is weaved into the story, leading to all kinds of blind alleys and an attempt to lead the audience to draw the wrong conclusion.  This might have worked except that the attempt was too obvious, sort of telling us that the director (Eastwood) has little respect for our intelligence. Then to find out the whole murder was just happenstance and all of the past that is introduced is actually irrelevant is annoying. .We are supposed to buy the premise of the movie that once you are traumatized you are a hopeless case and unworthy of respect, dignity, or even life.  It is kinder to just be put out of your misery.  Sort of like shooting a lame horse.If all of this sounds like fun to you, then rent this movie and ENJOY!(But, just to show that I'm being fair, I will say that Eastwood's score is great.

An ocean of Mysticism,"I watched this movie quite some time ago . But , every time I come across a brutality committed against Innocence , I come to think of Dave Boyle(played by Tim Robbins). A child's innocence should only fade away with time and by no means should it be corrupted, and especially not when the child is on the brink of maturity . The poignant turn of events towards the end of this movie so clearly evinces why. Agreed, its a well written book , but its the genius of Clint Eastwood which makes the adaptation so incredibly engrossing and emotionally charged . This movie is so full of subtle messages like a husband-wife relationship and the trust that should encompass such a relationship . The River itself is a brilliant metaphor . It really lies in the realm beyond perceptual apprehension . Its only apt they should call it ""Mystic"" . Of course , none of these without the supreme performances by the entire crew and especially Sean Penn and Tim Robbins . Sean Penn makes me wonder if he actually wrote the book . I couldn't otherwise possibly explain such wonderful immersion inside the character with so much intensity. All in all , Mystic River is one of the best movies I have ever watched . Watch the movie and you will not have something to lament about .10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Clint Eastwood, the movie maker","Something tragic has happened in the past.Three boys, Sean Devine, Jimmy Markum and Dave Boyle played outside when a car pulled up and took one of the kids, Dave, into the car.He got locked inside a basement where he was kept by some pedophiles.About thirty years an other tragedy occurs.Jimmy's daughter Katie is murdered and Dave, now haunted by the childhood trauma, becomes the primary suspect.Clint Eastwood, the director of Mystic River (2003), also behind the original music.He has made a really fine movie that is based on the novel by Dennis Lehane.There is the touching plot alongside the murder mystery.All the right actors can be found from this movie.Sean Penn is Jimmy Markum.Tim Robbins is Dave Boyle.Kevin Bacon is Sean Devine.Those are the three main stars.Also fine performances are in the other parts as well.There's Laurence Fishburne (Sgt.

A Masterpiece,"This Mr. Clint Eastwood film is a masterpiece. The actors have such a distinct mood about how and what is happening in the twisting plot. The pain in the face of Jimmy (Mr. Penn) is unreal and definitely deserving of his Oscar on many other levels as well. Mr. Tim Robbins has a fascinating character that he took by the horns and lead it right where it needed to go, onto the stage of the academy awards to receive an Oscar for best supporting actor. This film puts the viewer through the undeniably painful loss of a daughter and shows the true heart of a father that cares for revenge at no ones cost. Absolutely undeniably a great film that will surly last through movie history to become a classic tale of love and revenge.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A trend is developing Mr Eastwood,"MYSTIC RIVER Our video shop has a great deal Monday-Wednesday (by the way, when will ""video shops"" become ""DVD shops""). Hire a new release for $3.95 and get a free weekly. Great money for value.I'd been wanting to see this for a while, but knew the Mrs wouldn't be too keen. But due to the limited options in the store, I went for it.As the title suggests, there's a lot of mystique in the movie. In what seems to be an Eastwood trend, the story takes a while to get going, draws you in then surprises you and finishes with an all-too-familiar ending. The cast is superb, especially Penn. When Lawrence Fishburne is about the fifth billed actor, you know the acting will be A1. It's a good story too. So why did I only give it a 6? For me, the story just went too long, was way too drawn out and had nothing to surprise. And I gotta ask- would it have killed Clint to put a wacky guy in the movie, like that kid in ""Million Dollar Baby"", without the bad bit.

I really wanted to like it but...,"With such great actors (What a cast) and a great book, I really had high hopes for this film. I think though that Mr. Eastwood encouraged his actors to overact way beyond what was necessary. Yes, what happened to Dave was tragic, we can tell that just by looking at him. But Mr. Eastwood managed to turn a lot of the characters into caricatures, which I didn't like. The usually fantastic Laura Linney basically was rendered into a dragon lady stereotype. Tim Robbins couldn't have possibly said victim more, unless he was wearing a sign around his neck.Beyond the cliché heavy script, the camera work was dull, and there was nothing much to move this beyond a two-dimensional cautionary tale, supposedly about redemption.A director is supposed to show, not tell. Mr. Eastwood should have shown more and told less.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Especially at the end when him and Kevin Bacon's character Sean are sitting on the curb of the street, his words and his acting practically gives me chills. Another wonderful but chilling part is at the end when Celeste Boyle (played by Marcia Gay Harden) is at the parade at the end of the movie, just the look in her eyes tells us the despair she is feeling.

Very good! Great acting and well-directed.,"I really enjoyed this movie! I normally don't watch many dramas but lately I've been trying to catch up on this genre and in particular award-winning films of recent years.This movie grabs you right from the beginning. It is amazingly efficient in creating an atmosphere and establishing the main characters and their feelings surrounding an event that occurred when they were young. It is engaging the whole way through and it generally focuses on the emotions of the characters and situations rather than technical plot developments and exposition. It's about the why as opposed to the how, when, what, where and who. That's not to say there isn't any mystery - there is plenty.What really seemed to make the movie work was the acting. All the main actors were great. The performances brought the characters to life and their emotions for the most part felt real. The movie explored ideas I had not really seen before in a movie and I found these very interesting.Most importantly for me, the movie was very engaging and rewarding. It was far from predictable or clichéd and explored some very interesting and intense ideas and emotions. Everything is held together by the excellent directing and solid script. I liked the music a lot as well and was very surprised to find out Clint Eastwood composed it himself!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Eastwood's Directorial Masterpiece that Vividly Brings to Life the Riveting Book it was based on...,"For my money, Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement as a director, MYSTIC RIVER is his breathtaking and powerful film adaption of the equally powerful novel by Dennis Lehane that examines lost youth and other kinds of loss that sweep their way through a small Massachusetts town where everyone knows everyone. This story opens on a quiet day in Mystic River when three young boys, Jimmy, Dave, and Sean are approached by a pedophile, they force Dave into their car and he is sexually abused for several days before escaping. The story then finds these childhood friends as adults still living in the same town, though their lives have drifted away from each other somewhat. Jimmy (Sean Penn)is now a small business owner content in his 2nd marriage (Laura Linney)and raising three daughters. Dave (Tim Robbins) is also married and raising a son. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is now a Mystic River police officer whose wife left him, but likes to call him on the phone and not say anything. The three men's lives reconnect when Jimmy eldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) is brutally murdered and, as Sean investigates the crime, Dave begins to come into focus as the primary suspect. Clint Eastwood won a richly deserved Oscar for Best Director as he has incorporated rich detail in painting this intimate story of troubled small town Americana on an epic canvas and pulled remarkable performances from his hand-picked cast. Sean Penn finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his powerhouse performance and Tim Robbins' Dave earned a Supporting Actor statue. They receive rock solid support from Bacon, Linney, Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's wife, and Laurence Fishburne as Sean's partner. One of those rare and beautiful occurrences where a film turns out to be just as riveting as the book it's based on. An instant classic not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A SHOWCASE FOR ACTORS...,"As a film Mystic River is a good one. it has an interesting story and is directed well. The film is involving despite it's overly clichéd subject matter, it seems to present it in a fresh way. What makes this film the draw that it was, is the performances. Wow the performances!!!!!!! Sean Penn is amazing as the murdered young girl's father. His pain shows remarkably through his facade through each and every tear inducing scene. Marcia gay harden and Laura Linney make fine as the supporting wives. delivering meaningful and gut wrenchingly realistic performances. The film catches the desperation and guilt of all of it's characters not just the key players. although Tim Robbins is effective in his role he pales in comparison to the attractive young man whom plays the victims boyfriend. I dson't know who he is, but I know that guy is going places. The film dark and gloomy it's morbid texture never gives up letting in and inch of happiness. it's truly a delight to see a movie take itself so seriously and succeed. But I have to say that just having recently seen the film I think it wa somewhat over-hyped. Despite the acting, and clean cut direction the film sports mediocre touch ups. the story is interesting but somewhat formulaic and the score and cinematographic fit the film well but there's just nothing special there. alkl in all I must say it makes an interesting nights viewing. But this film is purely an actors showcase it gives them material and characters to work with. so that they can just throw themselves into the scenario and breathe life into mediocrity. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An overhyped movie,"This movie lacks the vital element - emotions. It is like an ordinary item, packed in a very attractive wrapper, and advertised in very efficient manner. But when at the end of the movie,you blame yourself for relying on the critics for unworthy praise. For the whole movie, you remain detached to every character, and by the time you are out of the auditorium, you have forgotten the movie. You do not sympathetize for any character - not even for the murder victim.Most of the incidents in movie are unrelated. The friendship between three boys, or the mental anguish Dave suffers due to kidnapping, has nothing to do with the theme of movie. Even if they would not have been friends in childhood, the story could still hold ground, as no hint of friendship is visible in current relationship.Even the character backgrounds are quite irrelevant. Jimmy is a convenience store owner, but also a mafia. Sean is separated from his wife. I wonder if this aspect really helped the movie anyway. As for Dave, I wonder, if he ever worked to sustain his family. All the time, he is seen walking on the street like a drunk man.The movie tries too heavily to create a feeling analogus to ""Road To Perdition"". Typical grey looks, old buildings, no glamorous characters, a pessimistic feeling throughout the movie. However, it ends up like a body without a soul.An overrated film, but looks more like unrelated incidents coupled together. There is a scene where Jimmy goes to morgue to look at dead body of his daughter. You can clearly see the girl breathing, with the dress on her body going up and down to breathing. I wonder, how director can make such mistake",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Chilling, Cringe Worthy Tale!","The film is about the relationships among three men from childhood after one of them is abducted by two men and kept a prisoner for four days in the woods. The beginning scene where he gets in the car made me cringe. Thankfully, we never see the abuse but we know with it being just as horrifying. Decades later, the men like Jimmy runs a neighborhood deli; Sean does homicide cases for the state; and Dave is battling his demons from childhood when he was abducted and tortured by two grown middle aged men. Sean and Jimmy feel guilt and pain about the time Dave was taken away. When Jimmy's 19 year old daughter, Katie, is found murdered, we see an Oscar winning performance by Sean Penn. Dave is played by Tim Robbins in an equally moving Oscar winning performance in the supporting actor category. Marcia Gay Harden earned her second Oscar nomination for supporting actress for playing Dave's long suffering wife. The end of the film has some twists and turns. Sometimes, karma takes place. Jimmy is not always the family man and has his own secrets. I wondered about Kate's funeral scene. Laura Linney does a fine job playing Jimmy's second wife. The film was directed by legendary Clint Eastwood on location in Boston. The supporting cast is excellent particularly Jenny O'Hara as Estelle Harris and Susan Willis who played Mrs. Prior. Emmy Rossum does a memorable turn as Katie Markum. Kevin Chapman is memorable as one of the Savage brothers. Laurence Fishburne was great as Sean's police partner in investigating Katie's homicide.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Three boyhood friends,"Clint Eastwood shows clearly with this film that he is at the top of his craft; he is indeed a very talented man. Anyone doubting about his abilities to produce a worthwhile picture such as ""Mystic River"", should be ordered to witness what he has accomplished in this picture.Of course, Mr. Eastwood is greatly helped by the adaptation of the original novel that Brian Helgeland has written. The Dennis Lehane book was a very deep study in what life has given the three original friends in their working class neighborhood in Boston and how they dealt with life, as they lived it.It is obvious the film belongs to Sean Penn. As Jimmy, he went to become a good for nothing, until he wakes up in jail, leaving a sick wife and small daughter behind. After he serves his time, he becomes a grocery store owner in the same area where he has spent all his life. Jimmy is dealt a severe blow when his daughter disappears. He goes to pieces as he finds out that his worst fears have materialized; all he wants then is revenge. Sean Penn's take on Jimmy goes from grief and despair, to cool planning of how to deal with his tragedy.Tim Robbins' take on Dave shows us a tormented soul who has never recuperated from his horrible childhood experience. He is a live wire who will explode at the least amount of provocation. There is a scene where Dave and Jimmy talk at the back of the house where both actors shine in it. In fact, Sean Penn seems more effective in those quiet moments than at the height of his grief.Kevin Bacon, the third friend, Sean, is now a federal investigator. His life has changed completely. He is the only one of the friends that has made something with his life. The ongoing problem with his estranged wife doesn't add anything to the story.The only weak links in this otherwise well rounded cast are the women. Annabeth, played by Laura Linney, is not convincing the way her role was written. Her last scene with Jimmy doesn't make sense. Throughout the film she has been in the background and now, at the end, we are seeing a totally changed woman. It comes too fast for the viewer to adjust to the fact that she has become a ruthless woman. Marcia Gay Harden, as Celeste, Dave's wife, is all nerves. In fact, she probably never heard that song ""Stand by your man""... It would have made sense if she would have heard it and sang it to herself.This was a very superior film done by a very good director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great movie,"I had read the book, I have never been a Sean Penn fan, so I didn't go to see it in the movie theater because I didn't think I would like it. But I caught it on HBO when I was channel surfing, and I thought it was very well done. I can't understand the all negative comments. Maybe people are so used to stereotypes and formula flicks they just didn't ""get it."" Lady MacBeth instigated murders, Annabeth didn't, but she was 100% on Jimmy's side, right or wrong. There are still people like that. Jimmy was sinking into depression and falling apart after killing Dave, and she wasn't going to let him self-destruct. What was done couldn't be undone, and she still had two kids to raise, what would she do if he disintegrated? What's so hard to understand about that? I thought Penn did an excellent job portraying all of Jimmy's conflicting emotions. People are rarely all good or all bad, most of us are a bundle of conflicts. I personally didn't relate to the performance of Dave's wife, such a weak, neurotic character was out of place in a lower middle class community. A person like that would have never survived to adulthood. As for all the clever observations about DNA, and was Jimmy arrested, etc., come on, this wasn't CSI where everything is neatly tied up at the end of the hour. In real life lots of wrongs are never righted, and lots of crimes go unsolved, and justice is often all in the perception. It was unremittingly heavy, just like the lives of the people portrayed in that community in Boston's underbelly. The sound was bad, but all in all I thought it was an excellent dramatic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Didn't get it,"I've just watched the movie and couldn't make sense of the ending. Linney's character seems to change dramatically, turning into a more ruthless and (maybe) domineering person. Bacon's loses his strength, his sense of right and wrong or whatever it is called; something is missing. He also manages to make amends with his wife, but it is not very clear why and how. The line ""the last time I saw Dave was 25 years ago..."" sounds like a cliche. Celeste should know what happened, considering she told Johnny her suspicion, and yet it seems she's not doing anything about it. I couldn't reconstruct anything from the last scenes.The greatest asset of this movie is actors. Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent; I even wonder how critics managed to ""see"" Sean Penn around these two performers at their peak. Even when Penn is great in his performance of a father torn between sadness and revenge, they completely outshone him. The whole cast was very good (Fishburne, Bacon).

Good Movie,"First off, I am just an average guy that likes action or sci-fi movies and even occasional comedies. It's rare I ever get in a mood to watch a drama of any kind. So I've had Mystic River on my shelf for a few weeks before I got into one of those moods. The reason I got it was because of all the acclaim...so I thought it would be a good flick to watch on a stormy night. I am not going to pretend to know all the symbolisms or story telling devices or just the plain psycho-babble that so many people point out on these comments...(you know, the ones who opened a dictionary and looked up the most sophisticated words they could find to feel educated) or those that say you have be be an ""intellectual"" to understand and enjoy this movie which is absolutely arrogant. But anyway, like i said, from a viewpoint of an average guy I felt this movie was very good. Easily something to recommend to a friend or family member. A good murder drama that has twists and suspicion to go around. Sure there are going to be some things that you are going to question, disbelieve or even feel obvious but I think no matter what the case, it keeps you hanging out to find out the conclusion with mild suspense. The acting is good all around, especially Robbins, which I laughed to myself because I thought he had a speech impediment in the beginning but realized..oh wait..thats not his speech..that's just Boston! The story is very familiar (Sleepers), but it still kept me interested with all the dot-connecting that unravels. The only complaint I would give is the ending which was, in my opinion, discouraging but hey sometimes that what makes people talk about after it is done so it was no biggie. Over all, it is a good popcorn and soda movie at night to just enjoy and maybe think about afterwards, but since i am just an action/sci-fi buff, I just the leave the thinking and analyzing at work and the entertainment and fun to the movie.... 7 out of 10!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Three men suffer the effects of the childhood trauma of one of them,"Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are three men who have known each other since childhood in ""Mystic River,"" a 2003 film directed by Clint Eastwood and also starring Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. When Jimmy, Sean, and Dave were boys, they were approached by a plainclothes policeman and admonished for writing in a cement sidewalk - the cop demands that they get into the car. One boy, Dave, does, and the two others watch the car go down the street. Dave is held in a cave-like room and repeatedly molested until he manages to escape. From then on, he goes through the motions of life, deeply disturbed, not dead and not alive. Jimmy's guilt and self-hatred drives him to live on crime's edge; and Sean, trying to make the world right, joins the police department, though his personal life is in ruins. When Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered, the three men are re-united, as Sean is now a detective. The results are tragic.This is one of the most brilliantly acted, directed, and staggering films ever made; were it not for an unnecessarily-prolonged ending, I would have given it a 10. There is no doubt that, while he lacks the versatility and movie star aura of Johnny Depp, Sean Penn has emerged as one of our greatest American actors, giving an unforgettable performance of a tough guy crazed by grief. At times, as Jimmy controls his anger, we can literally feel him seething inside. A remarkable performance. And he's not alone. Tim Robbins delivers a characterization that is beyond shattering, fully capturing a man damaged in childhood. The brilliant script by Brian Helgeland doesn't have to tell we baby boomers and we Catholics what can easily be surmised - Dave came home to his family, they probably never spoke about what he endured, and he never got the help he needed. Kevin Bacon has the least showy role but he is no less wonderful as his character, Sean, tries to cope with a horrible case and his wife who has left him and now calls him but keeps silent on the phone. Like the childhood incident, her silence is a constant reminder of a life he lost.Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, is phenomenal as a confused, terrified woman who is totally unable to understand the man she married as he unravels. Laura Linney is Jimmy's wife whose character develops as the film goes along. She starts out as sweet and supportive; later, we see that she is a perfect match for Jimmy. There is no performance here that isn't Oscar-worthy. I should add - the hardest accents to do and sound believable are the New York and Boston accents. You can easily believe that every single actor in this production is Boston born and bred.Clint Eastwood has proved himself a first-class director and also a man who is attracted to tough material. The Boston atmosphere and depiction of these lower middle-class characters, from one who lived there and knows these people, is perfection, and the images he leaves us with are haunting. The problem - which is the same problem Eastwood had in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" - is that he can't seem to end it. The film continues past several scenes that would have made stunning endings.""Mystic River"" is a must-see. Warning: it won't leave you, not for a long, long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Interesting irony.,"A great film with great actors. If Sean Penn have never shown before that he can act, then this is proof. Sad to say I have never really noticed before although he is great playing the asshole. And Tim Robbins is as always great I think. I remember being stuck looking at a sad face ín ""The Shawshank Redepmtion"" and saw the same face here. The great Kevin Bacon! It's been some time since I last saw him on the screen. But both ""Hollow Man"" and ""Trapped"" showed his talent quite good I think. Kevin Bacon is a man with many talents. Both bad or nice guy works just fine for him. This is great acting from a director who is also a great actor. I must say that I have never seen anything quite like it, but I'm impressed. Clint Eastwood has created a film that gets you thinking. Who is your best friend? Is your neighbor really your friend? Do you even know any of them?

Powerfully Compelling Film,"I always look forward to getting to see films in the Top 250... they're generally voted there for a reason (besides the Lord of the Rings films). This one was so well put together, the characters so intricately intertwined... I was glued to my screen in suspense.Clint Eastwood is not a name I associate with directing, but this view is changing. I would rather watch something he directed these days than some film where he just shoots people (with all due respect to Dirty Harry). Can anyone else put together a tale of Boston kids together like this and expose the gritty reality of life? Because Matt Damon is not going to do it.As kids, Jimmy, Sean and Dave were playing when one of them (Dave) is kidnapped. Years later, Jimmy is in a mob, Sean is a cop and Dave is mentally unstable. When the mob man 's daughter is killed, evidence points to Dave. Will the cop be able to solve the crime before the mafia kills Dave? And is Dave even really the killer, or is he telling the truth about the mugger? (If you're confused, just watch. It makes more sense.)Sean Penn is always walking a fine line with me, but he is excellent in this film. More mob roles should be in his future and less military roles. Kevin Bacon is Kevin Bacon, which for me is a good thing. Tim Robbins excels. He has always been great, but this time he really outdoes himself.Watch three lives come together and slowly get torn apart. It's gritty, it's real and it's amazing. A special shout-out to Emmy Rossum who was great and should be in more big films (but probably won't be), and Laura Linney who is always great. After ""Kinsey"" and ""Life of David Gale"", it's nice to see her in something less erotic.Rent this film... don't be fooled by the title, it has nothing to do with ""Mystic Pizza"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Excellent crime/mystery drama,"I haven't seen too many of Clint Eastwood's films, at least not the ones he's directed himself, but after seeing this I will probably check his other work out. The plot is great; it shows how deeply peoples actions can affect each other, even over many years, actions they thought would make little to no difference for their future. The acting is all great; Sean Penn is amazing, and the other actors are all great too, especially the actors who portray the main characters. The cinematography is great. The story is captivating, it gets your attention and keeps it, for every single scene of the movie, in it's 2 hour 15 minutes runtime. This is a great emotional drama, topped off with an exciting criminal mystery that keeps you guessing the final outcome of the movie for the entire time. I never lost interest in the movie. I doubt that it could have been a lot better, the only thing I didn't really like about it was one scene at the very end, in which a character gives a long monologue, that neither I, nor the two people I saw the movie with, could make very good sense of. Apart from that, it was nearly perfect. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good drama or an interesting criminal mystery. It's worth watching. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"some good things, some bad","Not a bad movie. Good tension, good emotions, good acting, but all together not quite....good enough. Perhaps the Sean/wife calling subplot could have been forsaken for a bit more on the relationship between the two brothers. I thought Tim Robbins had the hardest, and did the best, acting job in the film. Could not believe that Jimmy's character would get away with what he did....nothing in the film led me to believe he should have. The feel...the surroundings. That I thought was done well. The music was okay...only a few scenes where it seemed overbearing. I notice Clint himself wrote it. Not a bad theme, but little exposition. On the other hand, it wasn't a movie that I would greatly concern myself with in that category. I'm just interested in that area of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Scum in haute couture is still scum,"Mystic River has two large pluses.  One, it is beautifully produced.   I've rarely seen such wonderful camera work, lighting, and music.  Mystic River is lovely to watch.  Two, it is beautifully acted.  Sean Penn (who looks more like DeNiro all the time) rules the screen.  I don't follow Penn particularly, but this is the finest performance I've ever seen from him. Laura Linney's supporting performance is excellent, as are several others. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden were adequate, though all have done better work, and their considerable talents appear to have been limited by Eastwood's direction.But Mystic River's two large pluses don't come close to outweighing its one gaping minus: the ending shows its characters to be utterly amoral.  The fate of Dave Boyle -- who, it turns out, is the most moral person in this bunch -- is tragic and completely unnecessary.  Yet Sean the cop lets it go, Jimmy's wife talks Jimmy out of his brief qualms over what he did, and Jimmy lets himself be persuaded.  All three of them seem to believe that The Horrible Incident From The Boys' Childhood somehow entitles Jimmy to do what he did to Dave, entitles Jimmy's wife and Sean to abet it, and entitles all three of them to leave Dave's wife and son in agonized limbo over his fate. Jimmy is the only one with any remorse at all ... but a good night's sleep seems to get him comfortably over it.There isn't anything to be learned from Mystic River.  There's no moral, there's no useful lesson, there's no insight into the human condition.  My tolerance for artistic expression and the portrayal of human depravity is wider than that of nearly anyone I know, but this film is repugnant.  Why did I spend my time and money to watch characters who inspire me only to protect civilization by locking them up and throwing away the key?  Why did any of the people involved in this movie spend THEIR time making it?Mystic River is scum, and dressing it up with good acting and production values doesn't make it beautiful.  It just makes it scum in haute couture.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Sarcasm is not wisdom,"This was a terrific movie. There were shades of Shakespeare throughout. I am disappointed in the reviews which spiraled into sarcasm. I don't want to further add similar appreciative comments to the justifiably awed reviews by others. I would like to suggest a few things. As to the comment that the movie was homophobic, I find that skewed, if in reference to Dave's abductors. Homosexuals are not automatically child molesters. That assumption is homophobic. The questions regarding motives are too demanding. Human beings are, above all else, unpredictable. There are no neat and tidy explanations in the real world, and I think this movie captures that. Fear of reprisal has made people do seriously violent things, even things they would not have dreamed they were capable of. I would like to suggest Silent Ray's friend actually beat Jimmy's daughter to death, his wild behavior, swinging a gun at the end, shows an unstable character. It is actually believable. I am not surprised a cop would mingle with the underworld equally as well as the ""right side of the law"". I am not surprised Kevin Bacon's character does not arrest Jimmy, Dave's murderer. You can think many things: sadness, lack of evidence, regret or a personal choice based on a myriad of emotions. The end of the movie left a suggestion that Jimmy's eventual turn in life would lead him to seek a better position in the underworld, a world over which ""he could be king"", to quote his wife. Something in Jimmy died, during the days of his daughter's death and his choice to murder a childhood friend. You can see it in the coolness of his stance when he sees Kevin Bacon, and both of them know all secrets between them. I think I see things this way because I am nearly forty and I have seen many, many awful and beautiful things. Based on my personal experience, this movie is quite, unfortunately, believable. As for Kevin's wife, well her character is only there to suggest that Kevin's life is filled with his own problems. When Dave dies, she comes home, a little spiritual parallel to a new beginning, with leaving all life's evil behind. Well done.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Outstanding,This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is one of those movies that stick in your head and you have to talk about it.

Quite possibly one of the finest American films of the past decade.,"Think back on the best movies of the previous ten years. Films like `Pulp Fiction,' `Fargo,' and `American Beauty' probably come to mind. Now, consider adding `Mystic River,' the new film from Clint Eastwood, to that list. It is one of the most stirring and enthralling American movies of 2003! This can be attributed to its fantastic cast including Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and to the impeccable direction of Eastwood. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, `Mystic River' tells a story that is so riveting that the audience cannot pull themselves away from it.`Mystic River' tells the story of three childhood friends whose lives are forever changed by appalling events. While children playing in the streets of a Boston suburb, one of the boys named Dave Boyle is kidnapped and abused for four days. Twenty-five years later, another one of the three friends, Jimmy Markum (Penn), is devastated by the murder of his nineteen-year-old daughter. The murder unites Jimmy and Dave (Robbins), as well as their friend Sean (Bacon), the detective assigned to the case. With the help of fellow detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne), Sean uncovers past secrets about both Jimmy and Dave, from Jimmy's time spent in prison to Dave's emotional stress relating back to his childhood abduction. The end result reveals fact and faux pas about each man that they all hoped would be buried forever. The amazing aspect of `Mystic River' is that it shows how one event can lead to future personal flaws. Indeed the event of the Dave's kidnapping as a child wounded all of the boys. Both Jimmy and Sean both comment, `imagine how life would be if I had gotten in that car instead of Dave.' Dave's scares are apparent in his disillusionment of the reality around him. He can't seem to connect with anybody except his son who he feels a need to keep life innocent for since Dave's childhood innocence was so horribly taken away. Jimmy spent time behind bars for a robbery and now he's become a crime boss that everybody respects in the Boston suburb. As for Sean, he's managed to ruin his marriage because he shut his wife out of his own feelings and needs. 	The performances are extraordinary! Penn gives a stellar performance that will undoubtedly garnish him a nomination for the Best Actor Oscar.  He leaves the audience shaken in so many scenes. Particularly the scene where he finds about his daughter's death: one, for the very fact that she was murdered and two, because she was only nineteen. After all, what parent would want to bury their child? It should be the other way around.Robbins gives an excellent performance as Dave, the troubled man dealing with his past by not dealing with reality. It's troubling to watch this tragic character and his emotions unfold. You can't help but feel his pain. At the same point, you realize that he is not dealing with reality completely and he needs help. 	Bacon and Fishburne are equally incredible for their roles as detectives. Since Bacon's character, Sean, has a past with Jimmy and Dave, Fishbune's character, Whitey, acts as a voice of reason. He reminds Sean to look past the loyalties of friendship and to conduct the case in a proper manner.Eastwood has crafted a film filled with intrigue for its troubled characters and for its absorbing story. Undoubtedly this film will be considered at Oscar time. What's more, it is quite possibly one of the finest American films of the past decade. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Intense slow burner, with a chilling plot, yet puzzling ending!","The idea of this movie is fantastic. Three young boys meet again in adulthood when one of their daughters is murdered - one is the father, one is the detective, and one is the suspect, this film had all the makings of a great crime thriller. Sean Penn is thoroughly convincing as Jimmy and his scenes certainly stir up the greatest emotions, particularly the harrowing scene near the end with Robbins, on the shores of the ""Mystic River"". Bacon is typically good, not outstanding, but he does a good enough job. Laurence Fishbourne was rather wasted in this movie, i couldnt help thinking his part could have been played by any actor of semi-good calibre - it's hard to not think of him in his Matrix role. This movie had a lot to offer, and some good plot twists which you could only really predict near the end, but for some reason it seemed to drag - I put this down to the director. Eastwood seems to always go for the intense facial shots and never allow a moment to relax and prepare for the tension to come - it certainly wasn't the movie to take popcorn into! The tension was superbly done in the big scenes with the lead actors, particularly when Penn finds out his daughter is dead, but i felt a little more variation in tension would have made the film easier to watch. I struggle to think of the point the movie was trying to make. Here's my shot: it was saying that a man will do what he has to in order to protect his family, and this is the way they are brought up - hence the slightly disturbing conversation between Jimmy and his wife at the end. A slightly weak point to make in my opinion, and certainly one that you would not want to encourage. You leave the theatre feeling dissatisfied at the injustice of the movie. All that should not take away from the fact that it was certainly worth a watch, and it is a great plot, with some fine acting performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Clint Eastwood Delivers a Taut, Tough, Burning Morality Play","A good morality play shouldn't end with a maxim.  It should leave those watching it troubled and questioning and, perhaps, pointed in a good if not a right direction.Taking Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, director Clint Eastwood has, with ""Mystic River,""  blazed through issues of love, loyalty, responsibility and the dilemma of unshakable experiences that haunt not only those who experienced them but that reach into the next generation.At the beginning of ""Mystic River"" three boys, not yet teens, play a street game and then divert to carve their names into just hardening sidewalk cement.  A car stops and an almost obviously bogus cop berates the kids before ordering one into his car.  Without explicit depiction, flashbacks clearly show that Dave, the abducted boy, was sexually brutalized before escaping.Fast forward to the present in a dreary, near-Boston, blue collar neighborhood hard by the Mystic River.  Dave (Tim Robbins) is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and they have a little boy who is as devoted to his dad as the father is to him.  Dave doesn't smile much, he sort of shuffles, his mind and body the unwilling curators of indelible indecencies experienced in early life.Jimmy (Sean Penn) runs a corner candy and variety store, his days of serving time for robbery long past.  Is he reformed?  One wonders as his life unfolds.  Jimmy is married to Annabeth (Laura Linney).  They have three daughters and before the film gets very far the oldest, Katie, is brutally murdered.  A departure from the usual plot, she clearly isn't the victim of a sex crime.  A senseless murder?Laura Linney starts as an apparently average, not too interesting spouse. In one scene near the end of the film she unleashes an emotional passion that brings the moral quagmire of Jimmy's actions to a boil.Returning to the tried and true theme of boys growing up in a tough place and one becomes a cop while the others lead ordinary but hopefully not criminal lives, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a Massachusetts State Police homicide detective who works with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne).  Sean's the one of the trio who went to college.As the story unfolds the detectives, having made a simple but crucial mistake, search for the killer while Jimmy, clearly a capo in the hood, starts his own inquiry, one somewhat less restrained by law than that of the police.Dave emerges as a suspect not only for the police but to his increasingly confused and distraught wife. She confides in Jimmy, not knowing that his announced plan for the killer, if he finds him, does not include turning that person over to his old friend, Sean.So much for the plot.  What is portrayed here are some of the most angry and tortured expressions in recent film.  Sean Penn invests his role with a range running from tenderness to anguish to methodical and cold calculation. Initially sympathetic because of his loss, his character's increasing complexity calls for viewers to try to understand a personality that has also been ravaged by decades of a troubled life.Marcia Gay Harden gives a haunting performance as a loyal wife whose suspicions lead her to do something she must know erodes her loyalty to Dave and whose consequences slowly dawn on her.  A stellar performance.Bacon and Fishburne make a good cop team.There's a clue, fairly early in the film, as to what happened to Katie.  I won't reveal it and I suspect ninety percent, at least, of the audience in a packed theater missed it.A little boy on a parade float at the end of the film painfully shows how the cycle of evil and loss experienced by one generation infects the young of the next.  That scene shook me up.""Mystic River"" is a certain Oscar contender.  Clint Eastwood also composed some of the score but he deserves enormous credit for using music sparingly. This is a drama that would have been very damaged by an intrusive musical presence.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perfect in every aspect.,"I was skeptical about this movie after seeing the previews a few months ago. I like Clint Eastwood and I think he has both acted in and directed many superb films over the last 40+ years; his last few films have not lived up to his high standards though.  Blood Work, Space Cowboys and True Crime...you've seen, or at least heard of, the evidence.  I honestly believed he was finished making movies one could consider great.  I thought Unforgiven would be remembered as his swan song.  I was very wrong.Mystic River has to be the best Hollywood movie this year.  If I see one that tops it it would have to be great on the level ofLawrence of Arabia or Dr. Strangelove.  While this film is not on par with Lean or Kubrick's masterpieces, it is definitely one of Eastwood's finest and may surpass Unforgiven, one of the finest Western's I've seen.I can't think of much I can write about the story or plot that wouldn't betray something of importance.  Every piece of information given to the audience somehow seems vital to the story's weaving and unravelling.  The story unfolds over what seems to be four or five days at the most.  It involves three men who were once best friends in their youth until an horrific event splinters their tight cell.  They remain in Boston as adults and thirty years later they are reunited by a single event that pits one against the other.This synopsis is a little vague--for a reason though.  Once you see it you will realize why the previews were just as ambiguous in their revalations. Trust me.  You should see it.  It will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Major problems with this movie,"I apparrently stand amoung a small crowd who disliked this film.

Still, I'm confused by everyone's reaction.I was enraptured by this film through the first 3/4 of it. But by the end I was so irritated that I wanted to confront the people around me who were applauding.The ending of this film has characters acting out of nowhere, without any establishment for their behavior earlier in the film. The murderer's wife, for example. And ofcourse the detective who completely ""forgets about"" the identity of the murderer once he's found out... completely out of touch with his character that was so bent on bringing the killer to justice even if it was a friend of his.It is full of dropped themes, where glints of treasure you see in the beginning and expect to be fleshed out later are completely forgotten (take, for example, the crosses on the second molester's ring and necklace that receive so much focus in the beginning.)I actually left this movie angry!

"Fabulous film in every way, including its source material by Dennis Lehane","In a rougher area of Boston 30 years ago, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are playing street hockey when the puck goes down the drain. Now without ""game"", the trio starts writing their names in wet cement on a public sidewalk. Suddenly, a car pulls up....its the cops! Well, they have a badge anyway. Scaring the kids, Sean points out that he lives across the street. But, Dave, who lives one street over, is ordered to get in the car so they can talk to his parents. Crying, Dave does. However, its soon obvious to the neighbors that Dave has been abducted; he escapes four days later. Now, flashing forward, Dave and Jimmy still live in the neighborhood, with Jimmy owning a corner store and Dave doing odd jobs. Both are married and parents. Jimmy's oldest, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is nineteen and from a previous marriage. With second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) he has two other daughters, one who is going to have her first communion the next day. Katie works at the store and is going out on the town with two galpals. Concerned about late hours, Jimmy reminds Katie that its an important day for her sister tomorrow. Yes, Dad. But, the next day, she doesn't come to the store for the early shift and she doesn't make it to the church. Unhappily, she has been murdered and the detective on the case is Sean, who moved to a different part of Boston but is with the BPD. Naturally, Jimmy is distraught and has a gang of goons, his wife's brothers, doing their own detective work while Sean tries to reason with his former friend. There are other secrets, too. Dave, who has never been ""normal"" after his abduction and molestation, came home the night of Katie's death with blood on his person. Wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) doesn't quite believe his story that he beat up a mugger. Also, Katie, unknown to all, was planning to elope with a man named Brendan Harris, who her father despises. So, what really happened one fateful night and who will pay for the crime or crimes? This fabulous movie is based on an equally fabulous novel by Dennis Lehane. Its Boston setting is seedy and beautiful at the same time and has a ring of authenticity few stories have, as Lehane was born and raised in Boston. Then, too, the actors are superb, with Penn terrifying as the tough guy Jimmy, Robbins touching as the ""damaged goods"" man, and Bacon rounding out the trio in a quiet, somber performance of power. Harden, Rossum, Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and the rest are great, too.

Get yourself thrown into the Mystic River!,"This is without a doubt one of the best films of the decade, coming from the extremely talented Clint Eastwood. The Mystic River is a cinematic experience to last a lifetime. It is based around a murder mystery which leads to a tragic outcome. The murder summons childhood friends and their dark memories.

This film depicts the unexpected consequences of redemption, regret and all the deeply-rooted feelings of the human mind. All these things have been told in a very thrilling way, yet allowing you to dig into the deeper layers of this masterful film.Unforgettable performances come from the whole cast, especially from Penn and Robbins who become the victims of the tragedy, and from Bacon who is torn apart between them. Harden also skillfully portrays her hysterical betrayal of her husband, a mistake which defines the ending of the story.This film left me with a feeling similar to that I had after watching Godfather, perhaps because of the way the movie ended.

My belief is that Americans love murder and violence, or at least love to see it and read about it. That's why we have so much of it in the news, it makes for good entertainment. A soft, warm-hearted film like Lost in Translation will never be considered better next to murder and dementia, regardless of the fact that Bill Murray's performance was better than Sean Penn's.

In the Shadows of Mystic River,"Mystic River, a labyrinth of secrets and shadows, directed by Clint Eastwood, unfurls a haunting tale of fractured lives and buried secrets within the gritty streets of Boston. The film revolves around three childhood friends, Sean, Jimmy, and Dave, whose lives intertwine after a tragedy resurfaces. It's not merely a crime drama; it's a raw exploration of the enduring impact of childhood trauma on the fragile threads that bind them together.Mystic River is a symphony of dark tones and chilling atmospheres. The cinematography encapsulates the grim underbelly of the working-class neighborhood. The visuals are stark and unflinching, much like the harsh realities the characters confront. The narrative unfolds with the precision of a well-crafted mystery, keeping the audience in suspense as it unravels the interconnected lives of its characters with the subtle clues, the intricacies of motive, and the haunting silence that speaks volumes. The characters grapple with the ghosts of their past, reflecting the enduring scars of abuse and the insidious nature of the secrets we all carry within us. They find solace, strength, and redemption through the relationships they forge. And their wives, though not always in the spotlight, emerge as crucial players in this intricate game of life and consequence.In the world of Mystic River, justice is elusive, and the boundaries between right and wrong blur into a chilling gray.

SHAKESPEARE IN BOSTON,"Were he alive today, Shakespeare could do no better than the novelist, Lehane, and screenwriter, Helgeland, have done with MYSTIC RIVER. Shakespeare would also have done well to have hired Sean Penn and Tim Robbins to act in his work and employ Clint Eastwood to direct it and write the score.Clint Eastwood's directorial work, at its finest, and believe me, this is at its absolute best, manages to separate the viewer from the sense that he is in a movie theatre. But this is not merely the result of the man's mastery of his craft, it is the result of Eastwood's ability to uncover the emotional connection, in the viewer, between what he sees on the screen and what he sees, though usually ignores, in real life. Horrific events occur in everyone's life - and though the events may not be newsworthy (such as the death of a loved one from a lingering disease), the impact is historic for our inner emotional lives. Eastwood has managed,in MYSTIC RIVER, to create a world so personal, so much like our own, everyday lives, that virtually anyone will be able to read themselves into the characters - if not, the actual circumstances of the crimes depicted. When the viewer leaves the theatre, therefore, he leaves it to see his own, everyday life, in a new, sometimes unbearable, light.It's not ""just a movie"" as much as you may want it to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Excellent!!!,"Mystic River (From director Clint Eastwood) is definitely a masterpiece of crime genre. This intense drama about the investigation of the murder of a young woman will give you a ride on the emotion spectrum with the same intensity as in a roller-coaster. Slowly paced, beautiful shady photography, unforgettable performances by almost the whole cast will keep you entertained from the beginning to the end.The story is about three guys, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon), friends during their childhood days, not quite so after a horrible incident happen to one of them in their youngster's days. All of them lead completely different lives and although the live in the same neighborhood, they hardly talk to each other. Jimmy became a thieve and did some time in jail. Dave, who was raped by two pedophiles, now lives a quiet, insignificant life together with his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). Sean has a troublesome life since his wife abandon him, taking his newborn daughter along with her, though Sean's wife call him very often, she does not say a word to him on the phone, just listen Sean's voice. The night Katie, Jimmy's daughter, is murdered, she had visited the same bar as Dave, who later on the same night arrive home all freaked out with blood all over him and with a knife cut in his abdomen. When Celeste ask him what has happen to him, he only replies that he has been mugged and that he thinks he had killed the mugger. Dave, which I believe is one of the best performances of Robbins since the Shawshank redemption, becomes the audience's prime suspect but not so to detectives Sean Devine and Whitey Powers (Lawrence Fishburn) who are assigned to the case.As you already might guess, the movie is all about Sean and Whitey (ironically Afro-American) trying to crack the case. Nonetheless, Eastwood shows that he has the knack for directing flicks, and for storytelling.

He seems desperate to grow up and become Robert De Niro someday; but his worst mistake is that he steals all the cheap schtick that De Niro has unfortunately learned to rely on (and repeat in every recent film) and not the early honest, raw work that De Niro used to do.Robbins is excellent, Marcia Gay Harden is heartbreaking.

"""Maybe Some Day You Forget What It's Like to be Human and Maybe Then, It's OK.""","Clint Eastwood's powerful comeback as director, continuing one of American cinema's most extensive and most intriguing observations of masculinity, Mystic River is a gloomy, foreboding scowl about a present-day crime internally connected to a past crime. It concerns three boyhood friends in an Irish Boston neighborhood, who were eternally scarred when one of them was snatched by a child molester. As men, their lives have quelled into uptight daily grinds that are disturbed by the freshest emotionally cataclysmic crime. Written by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the movie features a league of phenomenal actors adept at unearthing genuine human feelings in a plot that could've been a thriller if its gaze weren't so much more grave, if it didn't summon so much authentic anguish.The film focuses on the three friends: Jimmy, now an ex-con running the corner store; Dave, a working stiff, and Sean, a homicide detective. All are married; Jimmy to a second wife, Annabeth, who helps raise his oldest daughter and two of their own; Dave to Celeste, who's given him a son; Sean to an AWOL pregnant wife who calls him now and then yet never says anything. The other prominent character is Whitey, Sean's partner. Jimmy watches like a hawk his 19-year-old daughter Katie, who works with him at the store. She's in love with Brendan. Theirs is a sugary flame. Jimmy bitterly objects. They plot to run away together. Alas, before that can happen Katie's discovered mangled and dead. Sean and Whitey are assigned to the case. Brendan is of course a suspect, but so is Dave, who came home late that night, spattered with blood, talking to his wife in distress about a mugger he resisted, may have killed.While major aspects of Mystic River work in keeping with the style of a police procedural, it's about more than the mere yes-or-no answer of blame, though Jimmy claims he will murder the person who murdered his daughter, and we have no cause to question him, mainly after he enlists neighborhood goons to lead their own investigation. It's about anguish descending through the decades, about unuttered closet skeletons, silent distrust. And it's very much about the individual honor of husbands and wives. Annabeth has a scene where she identifies with Jimmy's compulsion for revenge, and it's not far-fetched to parallel her character to Lady Macbeth. Celeste gradually starts to suspect Dave's story about the mugger and communicates her suspicions. We see one wife brutally allegiant, another who feels she has been excluded from some abysmal cell of her husband's heart.While the plot ultimately reaches a definite resolution, it's not about the resolution. It's about the venture there. It supplies each of its actors with scenes that measure their boundaries. Both Penn and Robbins generate desperate and stunning tension as they are interrogated by the police. Most memorable is their first man-to-man talk in years after Katie's death. There's a definite strand of suspense between Whitey, who believes Dave clearly responsible, and Sean, who's disinclined to doubt a childhood friend. There are such abysmal lagoons of bitterness and murderous feelings surrounding the funeral that we anticipate an eruption at any instant, but the simmering of the characters is all deep-seated. And forever that day in the past drifts as a voice from their collective past. Compounding Dave's agony was the apprehension the other two boys always had about him. Perhaps they didn't completely grasp what happened to him---how could they?---but somehow they no longer felt the same about their defiled friend, a life arrested in midstream.Penn's performance is one of the unequivocal engravings of the apex of a realist masculine tradition that engendered Brando, Dean, Pacino, De Niro. He has rid his technique of any breath of staginess or window dressing while absorbing all the straightforwardness and power that the Method's brought into American movies. Bacon, flirting with apathy, is excellent, as is Fishburne, whose drollery and questioning keep us from being submerged in the dark. Whitey's the one main character who's not associated with the insulated lineage of the neighborhood, and his wisecracks and seasoned comments are in some sense visitations from the outside world. Robbins, in some ways, confronts the ultimate assignment because he must play a man whose violated identity is an erratic composite of emotional nakedness and ferocity, innocence and deception. We feel crushingly, unfathomably sorry for him, but he puts others off, including Marcia Gay Harden, who as Celeste gives the film its most disconcerting portrait of horror and despair, just as Laura Linney, as Annabeth, arising from the abyss later on, expresses with devastating certainty the viciousness that functions as justice in their collapsed domain.This is Clint Eastwood's 24th film as director, and one of the handful of them where he doesn't also cast himself. He asserts here a full-toned unity with the characters and their actors, who are given wounding moments of truth. Invariably a downplaying actor himself, he unearths in his three actors watersheds of solitude and repression. Robbins grieves within his own despair, watches vampire movies on TV to identify analogies for his state of mind. Bacon aches all the time due to the void his wife has left. Penn's a brutal man who fixes to react brutally but has not, we see, found much relief that way in the past. To see potent acting like this is invigorating and breathtaking. It's vital to be continually reminded that movies can see, hear and conscientiously relate to their characters. Directors reach the top drawer by withholding, not embellishing: Eastwood does nothing for ornament, everything for impact.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Artifice of a great movie,"All the elements are in place - the grand orchestral music, the emotional intensity and serious performances of the actors, the handsome cinematography - even Clint Eastwood directing.So what went wrong? Well, the problem is everyone is pretending to be in a great movie. Once you look past its artifice, the painfully contrived storyline, the inflated sense of importance, and the pretense of depth come into plain view. Every scene oozes with Oscar-pandering Acting and Directing. You leave with the sense you just watched a film whose Oscar campaign must have begun from the moment it was greenlit.

An excellent film....,"Clint Eastwood indicates that he's much more than a cliché Western actor in his direction of ""Mystic River"", through the immense skill he exuberates while weaving a poignant and emotional tale of personal redemption, greed, love and the brutal loss of innocence that so consistently plagues society.As usual, Eastwood's unique directorial ability lies within his insane ability to get the very best out of his performers (typified by the Oscar wins for both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins) and furthermore his simplicity. No emotional scene is over-done with dramatic choir music to effectively tell the audience how they should feel, and instead Eastwood indicates a respect for the audience in that he allows them, in every scene, to make up their own mind as to how they feel. Simple cinematography and simple editing allow Eastwood to merely SHOW us what's going on without relying on the basic clichés of an intense drama that are so enthusiastically used and abused within modern day Hollywood.The acting, as alluded to in the previous paragraph, is absolutely top notch. Sean Penn is amazing as Jimmy Markum, a man with a hope of personal redemption but who internally struggles following the brutal death of his beloved daughter as he attempts to come to grips with his darker and more menacing side. Tim Robbins is excellent as the emotionally traumatised Dave Boyle, a man who is robbed of his youth following a tragic sexual molestation case. Indeed, Kevin Bacon shines in one of his simpler performances as Sean Devine - a man who works on the apparently ""good"" side of the law and has to struggle with his professional responsibilities as well as juggling the personal responsibility of an estranged relationship and an unknown child. All of these complex characters, with multi-dimensional sides, are portrayed excellently by the three main cast members and cement all three of them as some of the finer actors within modern Hollywood.Eastwood's direction possesses an emotional subtlety that is so rare within modern day Hollywood, and furthermore indicates a strong grasp of a complex medium - made all the more harder by the difficult task of bringing such an elusive novel to the firelight in a way that is both refreshing and new whilst simultaneously remaining true to the core and the heart of the initial concepts themselves.With satisfying editing and cinematography in conjunction with an excellent supporting cast including Laura Linney, Lawrence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden, this film was ALMOST perfect were it not for such a dramatic alteration of directorial style in the final 15-20 minutes of an otherwise flawless picture. When the plot knuckles down to who actually was the perpetrator of the vicious crime, Eastwood seems to forget his responsibility to the audience and merely sit back without any input, overall resulting in a messy final 20 minutes and one that, not only confuses the audience, but only provides a limited resolution to a question that has been so brilliantly alluded to in the first two hours of the film. Clearly, a change of pace was intended and subsequently Eastwood needs to change his directorial style a little bit, however the final twenty minutes seems to merely be a jumble of scenes rather than a flowing text - the way that the first component of the film so brilliantly was.However, all things considered, this is a beautiful picture that will have you thinking about its major concepts for a long time to come. From its consistent questioning about love, friendship and loss, as well as a technical simplicity that Eastwood creates to allow more empathy and emotional input from the audience, this is a masterpiece above most others and full deserving of its various Oscar nominations and its two victories for the consistent Tim Robbins and the absolutely brilliant Sean Penn.A practically flawless picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The mood is also maintained stable by having balanced emotions of the characters, even the ones who are not the main characters.The story is built well to develop suspicion to all the possible characters involved, and also the reluctance to act to face the consequences of actions of others.The acting is good from some of the preferred actors at their time.

Good not Great,"The Good: 1. The acting is amazing. I actually like Kevin Bacon as an actor in this movie and thats saying a lot. I liked Larry Fishburne's preformance but I think Sean Penn steals the movie with the most beilevable of the preformances. 2. Eastwood does a good job of directing the movie. Most scenes don't have bright colors until the end. I liked this it gave the movie a grittier feel than having it filmed with bright colors. 3. The plot was pretty good, it keeps you watching the entire movie, sometimes it drags on but I didn't think it was too predictable.The Bad: 1. The audience never really feels for Tim Robbins character I don't think. After him escaping in the beginning I felt for him but Robbins preformance through me off, I don't know what he was going for with it. 2. At the end I felt sort of like I watched a 2 hour law and order episode. There are the same type elements, a crime, then the 2 detectives putting it all together by interviewing people.

Don't be fooled by the rating or its place on the top 250,"Terrible, Terrible movie. I still don't see a point to it. Sure, the characters are developed well.....but they are developed towards the most ridiculous plot I've witnessed in a movie to date.The story itself as a mystery is satisfying to start, but in efforts to effect emotion in the viewer, is taken to absurd levels. Many argue that the acting is believable, I think its so overdone that it can't be taken seriously, especially if you keep in mind the ludicrous nature of the plot. Sean Penn is once again lauded by many, in a violent role that is apparently also supposed to show angst and feelings of being torn, he instead in my opinion comes across as an irrational person.The only acting job worth commending is that of Robbins, who plays his character to perfection. Out of any in the cast, he definitely comes the closest to a real performance.Clint Eastwood was given praise for his directorial work, which, given the intentions of the film, is also unworthy. It seems that the actors live in their own little worlds.....from what i've read, apparently this is because it makes the viewer more involved in the story....but really, it doesn't.My major gripe with this movie is this: it doesn't achieve its goal. I don't complain if I know the movie is aiming low beforehand, and fulfills those expectations. Mystic River is promoted and talked about as an intellectual, dramatic work, with some kind of emotion to be drawn from it in the end. In reality, I was treated to absurdity.Don't waste your time:D-",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Eastwood at his best,"Mystic River is a powerful movie with a tour de force performance by Sean Penn. He, along with Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins play three childhood friends whose lives are laced with tragedy. With an intelligent, insightful screenplay and a riveting key performance, Eastwood has combined his cinematic ingredients in a mixture that is sure to get applauded. Mystic River is haunting and melancholy, and the portraits it paints of Jimmy, Dave, and Sean will stay with you after you have left the theater. In a time when the goal of most movies is to offer instant gratification with no aftertaste, this quality should be both valued and praised. Mystic River has only one misstep, and that occurs at the conclusion (and is reflective of problems with the book's final pages). Instead of ending cleanly, at the point when everything is in place for the rolling of the credits, the movie drags on for two unfortunate, unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, this is a top movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Boston is Boston,"An intense film founded on the slow character and plot development of the Dennis Lehane novel of the same name, Clint Eastwood and the cast convey an emotional depth rarely seen in cinema. The mystery film concerns itself more with the inner depths and mysterious developments of the small community, reflected in the Mystic River, rather than the large overarching case that catalyzes the ensuing events. This is what makes the cinematic masterpiece so beautiful. Each character, each event, each scene, and each tiny detail exist for a reason, paralleling the enormous themes of the film. Mystic River is bigger than the movie itself; it conveys meaning directly to the viewer with vivid emotion.Eastwood works to slowly build his film from the bottom up with carefully constructed tiers: plot, character, time-line, etc. Masterfully inserted flashbacks effectively connect the past to the present in a community where the present is the past. But the powerful performances from the entirety of the cast finish Eastwood's emotional drama. Sean Penn and Laura Linney form the powerful duo of a hurt couple full of love, hope, and purpose. Penn, Robbins, and Bacon make up the childhood trio tied together by an unforgettable past; an emotion seen in the atmosphere of their scenes together. And Penn and Robbins deliver spectacularly in their awkward, suspenseful, misinterpreted, fateful scenes together that shape the entirety of the film and the relationships of the characters in it.Helgeland masterfully adapted Lehane's immense novel into a brief two hours of intensity. The majority of the novel's theme, characterization, and nuance were transferred into the film through dialogue and acting. The characters came alive and the actors became the characters. The fateful story playing out in the piece transcended the screen, taking refuge in the rivers of reality, slowly washing over and then, breaking wave after wave on the viewer.Mystic River is a cinematic masterpiece to be remembered for centuries. It provides a piercing view into community, fate, love, and the effect of the past. It makes simple statements engulfed in reality to create an artistic perfection. The final product is art; the post-production was art; the filming was art; the development was art. And it simply says that fate is fate and Boston is Boston.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Oh What Dreary Lives,"Three young boys in Boston grow up to live in the same general neighborhood. As adults their lives go in different directions, but a murder reunites them, and causes them to reflect on a shared childhood incident important in the life journey of each of the three men. It's not a bad premise for a film. But as adults, the characters and their wives are doleful, downtrodden, grungy, and generally not very interesting. Their environment is drab. The film contains little humor. And the pacing is very slow.""Mystic River"" tries to be a character study of the three men, and a whodunit murder mystery, concurrently. But the film is overly wrought with back-story details about the characters. And the plot blends these details into the murder mystery, which results in a story that is muddled. The solution to the murder mystery is both implausible and contrived. The film's story is so convoluted that it suggests that the writer couldn't decide what to focus on, or what to cut out.The film's ending provides some interesting ironies, and has a lot to say about the issue of fate. But with a runtime of well over two hours, and all that tedious detail, the film's theme tends to get lost in the meandering and unnecessarily complex plot. It's a common problem in today's big-budget Hollywood productions.Some of the viewers who rate ""Mystic River"" so highly may be basing their evaluations on hype, generated from the big name cast, Eastwood as Director, and promotional considerations. The inherent merits, and demerits, of this film suggest to me that it is mediocre, at best.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An Extraordinary Masterpiece, Yet A Bitter Fruit","The usual Hollywood fare of violence in movies consists of serial car crashes, shootings, beatings, and knifings that most people are pretty much inured to emotionally.  Mystic River, however, directed by Clint Eastwood, does not allow your senses to get off that easily.  For many, there may be a disturbing price to pay. The movie focuses on three men who live, love and die in the blue-collar old neighborhood of East Buckingham in Boston.  The film opens on the trio as eleven-year old boys playing stickball in the streets.  SEAN PENN plays tough-guy Jimmy Markum, KEVIN BACON is Sean Devine, and TIM ROBBINS is Dave Boyle, who is forced to take a ride with two pedophiles who would change all their lives forever.  Dave ultimately escapes after a four-day ordeal, however, the emotional scars are there to stay. Twenty-five years later, the three friends are thrust back together by another trauma-the murder of Jimmy's 19-year old daughter.  Sean, now a cop and his partner Whitey (LAURENCE FISHBURNE) are charged with solving this brutal crime.  They must also stay one step ahead of Jimmy, now an ex-con, who is driven to find his daughter's murderer. Dave, now barely coping in a fragile marriage to Celeste (MARCIA GAY HARDEN), cannot exorcise the demons of his childhood ordeal.  Sean is torn by old loyalties to Jimmy and Dave, yet doggedly gives no quarter in his quest for the truth. The complex interweaving of the characters as we delve deeper and deeper into their psyches is both riveting and chilling at the same time. Eastwood brilliantly crafts such a heightened sensitivity and emotional involvement, that the effect soon evolves to become like an acid bath upon our nerve endings. Jimmy's wife, Annabeth (LAURA LINNEY) presents a chilling performance as a wife standing behind her man against all rational morality.  Dave's wife Celeste carries off much of the conveyed emotion by a simple nod or distressed look that is expertly communicated by this versatile actress. Every actor, irrespective as to the minority of his or her role, is amazingly well performed and vividly portrayed.  All this attention to detail adds immensely to the realism and emotional connection to each of the players.  As the drama heightens to its climax, the brutality presented, although tame by objective contemporary cinematic standards, scorches the very fibers of one's soul, feeling much like falling into ice water in the dead of winter.  This is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking, however, for a sensitive and compassionate human being, a searing excursion into the bowels of angst and torment.  I would certainly keep the gentle hearted and the children at home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good piece of drama.,"A good drama beautifully presented by Mr. Eastwood. The movie ponders on the total randomness of life, and shows that nothing is really forgotten no matter how hard we try or pretend. In my opinion, Sean Penn's performance was mediocre and very artificial. Actually, I think he didn't deserve the Oscar he grabbed! The real hero of this movie was Tim Robbins; such a complicated character and such an amazing performance! Boyle is a vivid example of a man motivated by fear and living in his own world of dreams; all because of a horrible tragedy he has been subjected to as a child. This tragedy plays the role of the ghost that haunts the characters throughout their lives. Some are haunted by fear, others by guilt and deception. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did a wonderful job, but I think their characters needed more elaboration to justify their deeds. As for Kevin Bacon, he simply had what it takes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pure emotion,"A dark movie that stays somber despite its depressing turns. Mystic River builds up slowly its tragic final act with captivating characters that are quickly well-established in the story. You learn, up to their first apparition, who they are and what they capable of once they are pushing too far which eventually happens. The movie really evolves around each characters that follows on their own the main mystery and starts to connect the dots. Between a detective, a local criminal and an unstable man, each of them deeply bruised, it's hard to look away once such interesting characters break loose.This movie is just pure emotion, how a human has so much hate in itself, how revenge takes over a humans body and that love will be stronger then anything else. Clint Eastwood gives a raw movie, no crazy over the top cinematography, but an incredible screenplay and a movie filled with brilliant performances. This will be one to remember.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is where we bury our sins...,"If someone had told me what a great director Clint Eastwood is, I would have rented all of the films he directed and watched them in an entire day. I just couldn't believe (as I was watching this film) that this man was behind the camera in all this process. Behind everything. He has created an environment for his characters, a place and time for their development. This doesn't come much often.An event happens, and it establishes the bases for the rest of the story. But it's not just about that event, I thought myself as I heard the words said from Brian Helgeland's real screenplay. It's about the people involved in that event. It's about the lives these people carry with. There is so much focus on the characters that in occasions we let the event aside.Sean Penn made two great performances in 2003. One was the man he portrayed in ""21 Grams"". The other one is Jimmy Markum, and I can't tell which of these performances is greater. So many words are trapped in his eyes when he is crying. Jimmy wants everything to be alright, and he would do anything to achieve that goal. Penn is the kind of actor that makes you feel the way he does.Tim Robbins found the note here. Well, he always finds it, but this one sounds better than any other. Maybe this is just the character he was looking for. Dave Boyle is the person that could become a phantom. He could not know where he is. He could have been somewhere else for too long. He could be in a trance. And to know that, you just need to look at Robbins's face.About Sean we sense loneliness. He is waiting for his second chance, and doesn't mind to wait. He would wait a whole life. Bacon has never been recognized for his work. I don't know if he had the chance with Sean's role. But I can give him the fact that he is a risky actor. He doesn't mind going deep.And women, always there, for men. They don't seem to be that important for their husbands. But they really are. Celeste loves Dave, and trusts him. But she can't do that when some other things are happening, although she wants to. There's a limit. Marcia Gay Harden is great. She shows a lot of emotion always, you can't keep your eyes off her. Her performance here could be, or is, as good as the one in ""Pollock"". There are also those wives who know all, and wait until things happen. Annabeth is that kind of wife, and Laura Linney shows it in most of the film's key moments.The cinematography is wonderful, as the music and the details in each frame.But these three friends, I mean: ¿What has happened between them? ¿In who they've become? ¿What do they feel for each other? There's a strong string that unites them. They have been in the same places and they truly understand why they do what they do. They grew together, and know that some things changed them. Maybe they are not the same persons anymore, but how could they find out.How.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Complex Plot with some solid performances,"Not much revealing about the plot this mystery drama is about 3 friends followed by an incident happened to them at their childhood and then film showcases their middle age life's where they have families and some earnings to do.

That's One Gloomy River,"I feel the way about ""Mystic River"" that I do about a lot of Clint Eastwood's movies: they seem really good while I'm in the middle of watching them, but they fall apart when I think back on them.""Mystic River"" suffers from Eastwood's at times too heavy hand. The acting is stellar and the atmosphere is effective. But the whole thing is sold too hard as an epic tragedy to completely work. It would have to be much more stylized overall to make that tone work, but Eastwood's straight-forward approach as a director is the exact opposite of stylized, and the whole thing is too morose and gloomy to be credible.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins received all the attention and acclaim for their performances, but I most remember Kevin Bacon as a one-time childhood friend turned cop, and Laura Linney, briefly terrifying as a gangster moll wannabe.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pedestrian,"This movie was marginal at best. The story, I am not sure how closely it resembles the novel, was stereotypical and all in all pretty flat. The cast seemed to walk through their roles, aside from Tim Robbins (playing the only character with any dynamic), who seemed to be the only one acting in this movie. Sorry, Sean Penn playing the 'tough uneducated thug' does not branch out of his proverbial palette any. There was a complete lack of chemistry between Fishburne and Bacon, and I feel the parts could have been filled in by any card carrying SAG member. The ADR was blatant at times, having the audio dip so out of the scene really removes the viewer and hurts the performance of the actors. Also there were so many non-matching editing cuts I thought I was watching an episode of Friends. On the up side, the cinematography was very nice, and some of the shot compositions were fantastic, but thats really all the movie had going for it. I feel like the last 20 minutes (it may have been less than 20 minutes, but it certainly felt like 30) of the movie could have just been lopped off because no additional information given or resolution was achieved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Dark, Brooding, and Brilliant","I could tell you Clint Eastwood adds sure-handed direction for this film, and while that is true, it doesn't actually tell you anything. What I can tell you is to watch the eyes. This is a story told by the eyes, and the subject matter couldn't have been approached any better.The plot is fantastically construed, but I believe a slight disclaimer is in order. This is a dark film. Don't come in with expectations to be cheered up after a rough Saturday night when Jimmy left you for hot Chris or whatever-- this isn't that film. And hey, a lot of the best films are very dark in nature. If you end up watching Mystic River and think to yourself, ""Wow, that is such an awesome film!"" then I also highly recommend the more recent Prisoners. That movie absolutely deserves a review, but not now.Anyways, we are introduced to the 3 principle characters-- Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon-- when they were kids and loved street hockey. Two ""officers"" come up to them and take Dave (Robbins) in their car. It's never shown but rather highly implied of what they do to poor Dave. Flash forward to their adult lives, and all three of them have issues. Robbins is still uneasy from the childhood experience, Bacon is a detective whose wife left without a word and calls frequently (without any words either), and Penn is an ex-con. Within the first 30 minutes, Penn's 19-year-old daughter is murdered, Bacon is assigned to the case, and Robbins becomes a suspect. It's a compelling setup with all the ingredients mixed in for a great mystery, and it achieves that but with added emotional punch as well.Anybody who says their heartbeat was normal after viewing this film is flat out lying. Penn is dynamic and on edge, Robbins is a very disturbed character whose own wife questions his sanity, and Bacon rounds it out as the sympathetic old friend. In other hands the film could have even turned sappy with all the crossing paths, but this movie is the exact opposite. It is intense in its calmness. All this combines with a score Eastwood did himself with help from his son and an orchestra.Mystic River. It's a pretty ambiguous title that fits perfectly. There's closure to the film, but so much is left open for interpretation to the audience. And that's what Christopher Nolan films and Lost in Translation, among others, do so well that become my favorite types of movies. Throughout Mystic River is well-developed, well-thought out scene after scene that doesn't want you to see it again the next day or even the next week, but in a year or so, you will be dragged back to the film with the eagerness and anticipation to understand the puzzle fully even if it's missing one piece. Perhaps I have not said enough about the film, or did I give just enough context to make you watch it? Who knows, I'll leave it up to you.

"Four legends, three in front of camera and one behind makes this movie a must watch","Mystic River is a neo-noir, mystery crime drama movie directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney in the leads.Eastwood is a pure talent which doesn't need any introduction be it acting or direction and in my opinion he has mastered in both the fields with perfection.The movie is based on the novel by the same name and the movie will always be considered great for it's stupendous acting and beautiful screenplay.The actors chosen in the movie are full of talent and needs no introduction, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won the much deserving Oscar for the movie and the way they had portrayed their respective characters in my opinion no one could've portrayed any better then this. Kevin Bacon was equally impressive. Out of the three main leads I would like to vote for Tim Robbins best amongst the three followed by Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.Screenplay of the movie is evenly paced and despite of being slow never loosen the grip from the viewer. The main reason is acting as I was so engrossed and mesmerized by the acting of the characters that I didn't realize the pace of the movie and was totally engaged to the movie.Cinematography is great and climax of the movie is very strong.

Some people just has some memories they just want to forget,"This movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, not book to novel is rarely all that successful. And the novel is usually better than the movie, but this movie is a excellent adaptation to novel. It has great acting with believable emotions and is directed very well with dark and blue/cold like cinematography. So the plot revolves around three character Jimmy(Sean Penn), Sean(Kevin Bacon) and Dave(Tim Robbins). When they were kids and was playing Dave gets kidnapped and had horrendous things done to him. Which damages him mentally and emotionally. And than the movie goes to when they are adults now and Jimmy's daughter goes missing...Clint Eastwood did a excellent job with the casting cause all the actors put there A game with the roles they are given. Kevin Bacon is basically Kevin Bacon. But Sean Penn now he brings out a believable character who is a tough guy that doesn't take crap from anyone. So you can only imagine what happens when his daughter goes missing. Well until you watch this movie. He is a very emotional tough guy that is all I can say. Now when it comes to Tim Robbins he was just perfect for this role, he played a character that is suppose to be damaged very very well. It was just all believable all around, even if it can get a bit too melodramatic near the end. There is a lot of detective work that goes on in this and everything is so engaging with some amazing acting to the point you start to sort of feel for the characters. It just makes you want to focus more and more as this movie progresses. It just has some crazy and yet plausible twist and turns that you as the audience probably won't be able to predict. Overall this is a Clint Eastwood thriller masterpiece.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Frustrating Movie with a Great Sean Penn Performance,"I love slow movies that build, particularly if the writing and direction are sharp and the acting propelling the movie along.  Mystic River started off being that kind of movie.  There's a tragic flashback, and a leisurely look at a fairly typical Saturday in the present day in an urban area near Boston (unclear where - probably Charlestown based on its proximity to the city). Suddenly, Saturday becomes Sunday and the day is in no way typical.  Senn Penn does a great job at playing the grief-stricken father.However...Kevin Conway has a great (and uncredited!) bit part as Annabeth's father, appears briefly in one (or maybe two scenes) then disappears off the face of the earth.One character pretty much arranges to have another character killed.One character (a person without much money) has managed to anonymously pay someone $500 a month for about 12 years.  How does that work exactly?The dark lighting effects are sometimes handled brilliantly (when Dave is telling his son about the boy running away from the wolves) and sometimes render the actors invisible.Another character shows a steely spine after being something of a mess for most of the movie.The ending is just so scattered you wonder how it happened, after the movie starting off so promisingly.I don't hate this movie.  I'm glad I went.  I don't know if it's just very faithful to a muddled book or what.

I believe that must've been Eastwood's intent, though.  Otherwise, I'd say his character was awful. Bacon and Fishburn do fine, but I was confused why Bacon's marital troubles were tossed in here.

The acting is fine given the material, but the characters are too flat to create fully rounded performances.  It's a decent pot-boiler, but hardly a work of art.I wish that critics recognized that great acting is not about crying, histrionics and prosthetics.

A personal triumph for all involved. One of 2003's best.,"A film of shattering, emotional wallop and brevity.

Good... But not that good.,"I had heard that this movie was really good, long before I saw it. When I rented it, I had some high expectations, but nothing that really defied how I would view it. I was more interesting at how it would turn out. I mean, there are some really good homocide/mystery movies (and TV series) out there. Would this be one of them? Well, there was only one way for me to find out. To rent it!Jimmy, Sean and Dave are three friends who are out playing one day. They're just having fun, when suddenly a man dressed a police officer shows up. They take Dave away, telling him they're gonna go talk to his parents. But what they don't know is that these men are child molesters... Dave eventually manages to escape, but the child molesters are never caught.Many years later, when they are all grown up and married and have gone their own separate way: Tragedy strikes. Jimmy's daughter is found dead in a park, and a homocide investigation starts off, with Sean in the lead. It turns out that on the same night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered, Dave did something bad... Noone knows what, except for Dave, but his wife saw him come home all covered with blood. So, something is definitely up.Clint Eastwood directs nicely, different angles, nice colors and everything. The whole thing is very nice set up. Production design, photography, script and so on and so on. The dialoge is convincing, and the actors all do their part well. It's always nice to see Sean Penn in a role, but to have Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins in there as well, is almost to much.I have two grudges with this film: Firstly, it's somewhat slow. At least the latter part of the film. The film ends at about 2 hours and 10 minutes, but it could easily have been 20 minutes shorter than that. My second grudge is when the killer is finally caught, it's not who you suspect it to be. But the reason for that, is because it's a very underdeveloped character who only popped up in two or three scenes prior to that, and there were absolutely no clues about it. It makes the investigation feel a bit ""anti-climactic"". But I'm willing to forgive that. You see, something else happens in the end, and I think this is what we're supposed to focus on. I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to see it for yourself. That is the real end to the film, and not the solve of the crime.All in all, it's a pretty good film, that drags on after awhile. I think that being slow is the worst crime a movie can commit, but it's not that bad in this film. You might not want to watch it more than once tho, so I'd say this is mostly a ""rent"" film and not a ""buy"" film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The best Eastwood film since UNFORGIVEN!,"Ever since I saw UNFORGIVEN, I was conformed with my thoughts on Clint Eastwood.  I always thought of Eastwood as the ""action-packed,"" gun carrying superstar who said tough-guy lines like ""Do ya feel lucky punk?"" and the classic, ""Go ahead, make my day.""  Then after watching UNFORGIVEN, I was blown away on how different of a western it was, aging gunfighters, who are past their prime, now are going to be doing one more job.  Now I am a strong devotee of Clint Eastwood, watching and buying DVD copies of all of his films (that includes the hokey EVERY WHICH WAY and ANY WHICH WAY films with ""Clyde""). With MYSTIC RIVER, I was a little disappointed not seeing Clint in front of the camera, which I always do enjoy.  Yes, he's pushing 73, but still, it's a nice familar face.  But after watching MYSTIC RIVER, I got past not seeing Clint's face, yet his work as a filmmaker showed. MYSTIC RIVER is based on the Dennis Lehane best seller, which takes place in a certain section of Boston, near the river.  Three boys are playing on the street and decide to use a stick to write their names in the wet cement. A car pulls up and a tough looking man comes out saying he's a cop, and is threatening to arrest the boys for defacing property.  After the officer asks where the three boys live (two lived on that street, one lived a few blocks away), the boy who lived a few blocks away is ordered by the man to get into the back of his car to ""take him home.""  The scary and sad thing is that the boy wasn't taken home right away... Flash-forward to 25 years later, where the three boys are adults. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a business owner of a corner store, he served some time in prison, got out and is trying to make a new life. Jimmy is in his second marriage to Annabeth (Laura Linney) and has three daughters, Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is 18 and works for Jimmy at his store. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a Boston homicide officer who still gets phone calls from his ex-wife who doesn't say a word, yet Sean knows it's her and talks to her still with no response.  Then there's Dave (Tim Robbins) the adult who still is suffering emotionally from the time he went into the backseat of the police officer's car. On a Saturday night before Jimmy's daughter's communion, Katie goes out driking with some friends.  Later that night, Dave came home with blood on his hands and shrit, Dave's wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) is worried on what happend to her husband.  When Jimmy and Annabeth go to their daughter's communion, Jimmy is upset that Katie didn't show up.  Sean along with his homicide partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburn) get a call about a car sitting in the middle of the road with blood.  It turns out that the car was Katie's, with Katie's body found not far from the car.  The story has several conflicts and revealing information about the character's of the film as the plot continues. I was highly impressed and pleased with MYSTIC RIVER.  After watching this film, KILL BILL Vol. 1, SCHOOL OF ROCK, and LOST IN TRANSLATION; the last four weeks of movies have been much better than the last ten months. It is obvious why critics are calling this one of the best pictures of the year, it's because its true! I was hooked on the mystery of both the character's past that was involved with the plot, as well as the mystery about the murder of Katie. It's no surprise why the mystery for MYSTIC RIVER works so well, the screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar along with Curtis Hanson for his adaptation for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, the best crime-noir film since CHINATOWN.  The film manages to give full rich detail on the three characters and even gives detailed information of the supporting characters as well. Another important factor in which Eastwood should be applauded for is shooting the film in the actual location in which the story takes place, outside of Boston.  If there is a film or story where the location becomes part of the character, then it's critical to have the story take place in that location, otherwise it won't have right feel for the movie.  Think of Michael Mann's HEAT taking place in L.A. but shot in Chicago, it would take away the impact of the film.  With MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood demanded that the film needed to be shot Charlestown, Boston instead of the studio's decision of Toronto (because it's cheeper). The acting by Sean Penn is along with Bill Murry, as one of the best this year.  I have always enjoyed Mr. Penn's work (I've can see Penn being the most talented young actor under 50 (along with Edward Norton and Johnny Depp).  Penn gives a very fantastic performance in this film, you could actually feel his grief when he finds out that his daughter was killed. Yet kudos should also go out to Tim Robbins for his performance of Dave, the man who is still scarred by the actions that happened to him 25 years eariler. Robbins manages to have a convincing look of emotional scars that have been haunting him for years, and it shows in his eyes.  I also enjoyed the performances and the investigating plot of Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne's characters.  Bacon can be a great actor in a bad movie (HOLLOW MAN for example) yet Bacon proves that he can even carry his own performance along with Robbins and Penn.  And Fishburne shows that he is one of the most powerful supporting actors working in Hollywood with this film. I would finally have to give credit to Eastwood himself.  No longer being seen as the man who is use to carrying a .44 magnium shooting bad guys. Now he's the figure who thinks about even questions on why did he shoot that man, like he discussed in UNFORGIVEN and in this film as well.  Eastwood manages to tell a story in which the characters might appear fine, yet they have ghosts inside of them that will haunt them forever.  And before I forget, Eastwood's brauva talent shows again by being the score composure for this film!  I expected the usual great music by Eastwood regular Lennie Neihaus, but when I saw that Eastwood composed the music, I was pleasently surprised.  Also, for those other Eastwood fans out there, a familar face makes a unexpected yet highly enjoyable cameo appearance.  I'm not going to say who it is, but when you see this familar actor and make the connection, it is a nice treat. MYSTIC RIVER proves once again that Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors still working. Sadly, most people can't imagine Eastwood as anything else but Dirty Harry; and when Eastwood passes away, people will then say, ""oh wow, he did do a lot of work.""  Well, I'm saying it now, Eastwood is a underappreciated director, watch his other directed films: BIRD, BRONCO BILLY, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD & EVIL, and you too would hopefully agree with me that Eastwood is a darn great director! There is no doubt that MYSTIC RIVER is going to be remembered come Feburary when the Oscars are announced.  I can see this film having nominations in several catagories, especially Best Actor (for Penn), Best Supporting Actor (Robbins), Best Director, and Best Picture.  This film was even nominated for Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival, which in my opinion is the more suitable Academy Awards.  Look what won Best Picture at Cannes last year- Polanski's THE PIANIST.  I rest my case.  One of the best films this year! ***** (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good to see you, Theo","Greetings again from the darkness.  The first thing that hit me after this movie is, why doesn't Sean Penn make more movies?  He reminds of Deniro from 10-15 years ago.  Very powerful screen presence and so much emotion without the hystronics of lessor actors.  The next thing is that this is no whodunnit!  The answer to that is given away very early in the process, so for me it became a study of blue collar northeastern family and friendship. Very strong ties for this area.  No other geographic part of the U.S. compares.  Watching the Savage brothers ""serve"" Penn's character is chilling, all the while knowing he would do the same for them, if the tables were turned.  Other than the lack of suspense for the killer, the film's next biggest flaw is Timothy Robbins.  He tromps around like a psycho-Herman Munster.  I never believe this is a grown-up version of the boy who survived the tragic childhood incident.  In every scene, Robbins is over the top and almost laughably awful.  The incident itself actually seems secondary to how the 3 boys grow into adults.  What could have been the defining storyline is actually a weakness in the script.  All that said, Clint Eastwood again directs a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  His pace, color and music is near incomparable.  Only Scorcese is better.  First movie in awhile where Kevin Bacon is actually not some idiot in an unbelievable situation.  As a police detective, he turns in a very realistic cop in a tough situation.  His partner, Laurence Fishburne, is at times too aggressive, but it plays well against Bacon's pent up frustration with the case and his wife.   What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Clint's buddy from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as a years-later witness to a liquor store hold-up.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from Unbreakable and Gladiator) has a key non-speaking role and Marcia Gay Harden performs well as the what to do wife of Robbin's character. Although, seemingly out of place, I really enjoyed super-actress Laura Linney's final two scenes.  The bedroom scene with Sean Penn was very powerful and her exceedingly cold stare down of Harden at the parade gave me the willies!!  It almost seems there must have been another Linney scene left on the cutting room floor, as her character gave no indication of this inner strength prior to this.  Overall, another well made Eastwood movie with a weak script and terrific acting by Penn and Linney.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Save your time and money, and avoid this one","A very, very poorly directed interpretation of a very, very poorly written book. Many may point to the fact that this movie is ranked in the IMDb top 250 of all time as evidence that my opinion is incorrect. And, perhaps they're right; after all it is just an opinion. However, I would not use this movie's (or any movie's, for that matter) popularity with the masses as evidence that it's ""good."" After all, it was the masses that made Independence Day one of the highest grossing movies of all time, The Macarena one of the most popular dances of all time, and John Grisham one of the most successful authors of all time. At this point you may be thinking ""Hey, I enjoyed Indepence Day, and I love Grisham."" Well, then by all means, go see this crappy movie; you'll probably love it.

It's the echo of karma...,"This is a truly emotionally haunting, complex and disturbing film that seems to want to remind us that violence begets never-ending violence. The happenings seem to conjure up the concept of karma as I follow the lives of the characters, especially as in the case of Sean Penn's Jimmy. Excellent performances from Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon! Their characters  three friends - draw me deep into the analytical observation of their traits, behavior and circumstances. I was kept bouncing between the good and evil of their souls. With this film, Penn has become my No. 1 favorite for the Oscar statuette! I'd be surprised if this film isn't nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay award. Tim Robins, with his Dave's facial demeanor, grips at my heart. What a perfect actor for the Dave role! Marcia Gay Hayden's performance credibly becomes the solid bridge between the incredible depth of interaction between the Dave and Jimmy characters. The story flows wonderfully on screen and stays true and loyal to Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title.Is the film drawing a fine line between revenge and the psychological weight of suffering? Should I be wondering who is purportedly the real victim of the story? Should I be looking at the rippling effects of guilt that never seem to leave the victim(s)? Under the brilliant direction of Clint Eastwood and the remarkably superb performances of the whole cast ensemble, the awful truth about twisted and profound human psyches develop beautifully, layer by layer. I was literally holding my breath, puffing out soft gasps at intervals, as I followed each character and each event. Yep, this film is filled with exceedingly touching elements.A real tough and phenomenally intense movie to watch! Eastwood has given the audience a very dark film in which every actor delivers an essentially awesome part to make the whole soulful and captivating. I choked with grief as the final tragic twist unfolds  exactly as how I had choked when I finished reading the novel.  It's an unforgettable film. I'd be surprised if I don't get to see the names of Eastwood, Penn, Robbins and Hayden in the coming Oscar nominations.

"Mystic River certainly is not a movie for everyone. A film about abuse and violence with no happy endings, fiction is naked, raw and eerily similar to our reality","Clint Eastwood's cinema has always been close to tragedy: his characters seem to operate in a cruel and apparently meaningless universe, where some endings are still inescapable. And perhaps in none of his films is this as clear as in Mystic River. Based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends - Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave - who have grown apart over the years and are brought together again due to a tragedy that happens to Jimmy, whose daughter was murdered one night under violent circumstances. Sean, now a police officer, takes on the case with his partner Whitey (Fishburne), and with each sequence we are introduced into a spiral that is intended not to tell us about what is happening on screen, but off.The film itself does not tell us about the murder of Jimmy's daughter or the abuse that Dave suffered as a child, but exactly about the period between the two events and about the consequences caused in their characters. It is difficult, but interesting to gradually unravel the complex personality of each of them. What Helgeland's script aims to do is set the stage for the next reveal. Every page is crucial, there is no synthesis, we are bathed in information at every moment, but we always stop to think about what happened in the previous scene or what happened in all those years between the abuse and the murder.Clint Eastwood is so aware of the potential controversy and fragility that the subject of his film addresses, that he is not afraid at all in trying to find the emotional discomfort of his audience to the point of shaking him in every possible emotional and psychological way, but still manage to be enchanted with what is formed on the screen. Which is arguably one of the best thrillers/police dramas of recent years, and why not one of the greats of all time.The director manages to play with the audience's emotions with great praise, Brian Helgeland's script is so good to the point of being able to build realism in the characters' dialogues and an aura almost of a dark and heavy dream, provided by the always safe Eastwood's direction completely painstakingly with the help of his longtime partner Tom Stern in photography giving this heavy, depressive and almost claustrophobic atmosphere of imprisonment in this small universe of characters covered in trauma and violence. The pace never rushes, as it knows exactly at what points to undertake to develop each piece of the detective plot that is sewn together full of intriguing mystery, and still deal with the psychological and dramatic consequences in each of the also mysterious and complex characters, but constructed in an extremely palpable way!Evil and goodness are part of the human being equally. Everything we experience, good or bad, contributes to it. Dave, a boy, spent 4 days in captivity being abused by two men, what he realized in those 4 days is that he needed to get rid of what he was so he could escape. It wouldn't make sense that Dave would have done what the script was accusing him of, since we're conditioned to believe he committed the murder. But if we draw a parallel between the real responsible and Dave himself, we observe something interesting: both did what they did with the intention of protecting someone weaker. Brendan (Guiry) is just a child, despite his 19 years, what his younger brother (Harris) has done is protect him from madness.Abuse and Murder: These are frightening words. Even more frightening is noticing the details that are present in each scene. Clint Eastwood to tell us that the man in the car that took Dave was a member of the church, simply has him turn to the boy in the back seat revealing a ring on his hand with a crucifix. But the real sadness of Sobre Meninos e Lobos lies in the character and personality of each of its characters. It is simple and shallow to say that everyone goes on with their lives normally. Dave with his son is overprotective for obvious reasons. And soon we can see the melancholy in Sean's eyes, who despite being dedicated to solving the case, as if he was in debt to Jimmy in some way; It's interesting that, despite appearing to be the most structured of the three, it is revealed to us that his wife left him pregnant, and cleverly, the film only shows us parts of his wife's face when she calls him and is mute at the same time. Phone, as if he was just imagining that moment, as if she didn't really exist.Jimmy, brilliantly played by Sean Penn, appears at first glance as a simple grocer, who seems to lead a boring life and who loves his family, but who soon proves to be an unpredictable man. And we see this when, in the preparations for his daughter's wake, he asks to see her again, and on the table where her body is lying, he swears that he will kill the one who did this. And in truth, what Jimmy was doing here was a pure and failed attempt to delay grief.It's curious to think that those people, whatever the mistakes they made, are essentially good, and at the same time they don't necessarily show it. Let's take Jimmy's wife, Annabeth (Linney), as an example of this, who is already clear that she is not Katie's (Emmy) mother at the first moment in which she appears only because of the tone with which she treats the girl's figure. And we can still mention the arrogance with which he treats Celeste (Harden) in the last minutes of the film, Dave's wife. Still, we cannot say that she is a bad person or that she deserves to go through what she is going through. Still, it would be hard to say whether or not Jimmy deserves what happened to him, for as we're shown, he's far more than a quiet grocer. The point is: something always happens, causing fate to bring the three together again, so that they return to the starting point, in this case, the street with their names.When Jimmy confronts Dave for what he supposedly did, there is a parallel montage where we simultaneously see Brendan also confronting his brother. Dave reverts back to being a boy before Jimmy while Brendan reveals himself to be a wolf with his younger brother, to the point of nearly killing him and his friend. And at the end, Jimmy tells Sean that he sometimes thinks that maybe they too got into that car when they were kids, that they're trapped in those men's basement and that everything they're living is just a figment of their imaginations, of what it would be like if one-day escape. Well, they never really escaped, their lives always return to the starting point, as has been said, and to represent this, at the end of a parade, we see the two on opposite sides. Sean makes a gun gesture at Jimmy, as if warning him that from now on, after what he did to Dave, they could never be on the same side again, and Jimmy just gestures, implying that he's not. His choice to be there is just a consequence.From a psychological point of view, we can see the relationships between boys and wolves. At first glance, it might seem that the boys and wolves of the story are already determined. However, the great asset of the film is not to fall into Manichaeism. Jimmy Marcus, even an adult and a family man, walks around with his gang spreading authoritarianism around the neighborhood like a teenager. Dave Boyle is the eternal boy trapped in the wound of childhood, but who runs from himself, his biggest wolf. Yet he finds time to be his wife's predator.And here we have another interesting topic, wives. Mystic River is, in a way, a film about men that ends up reflecting on women. Sometimes they are sensitive and smart, sometimes they are naive. Sometimes they manage to get inside their husbands' minds, sometimes they are foolish and innocent. But in the end, we find that each couple perfectly complements each other in their weaknesses and strengths; there were not just men, but couples who mirrored themselves. Boys were married to girls.Perhaps the way Eastwood reveals his true layers at the end with unexpected twists will be confused with mere manipulative narrative artifice, something that is far from being part of Clint Eastwood's storytelling technique, which he always does in a different way. Masterful. And as I said, it manipulates all the possible perceptions that we the public can have within this story and its resourcefulness, to in the end surprise us and maybe leave a void of hope inside us, that same feeling of frustration after such an unfair and unjust nightmare. Macabre. But surely the feeling of having seen a great work here is instantaneous. This is certainly not a movie for everyone. There are no happy endings, fiction is naked, raw and eerily similar to our reality. Proof of the competence and sensitivity of director Clint Eastwood, this film deserves to be seen by everyone from the perspective of life in society. A true essay on ourselves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""Good to see you Theo""","Greetings again from the darkness.  I walked out of this movie feeling cheated. It had almost nothing to do with ""Mystic River"", but everything to do with Sean Penn.  This guy is such a great actor that I feel cheated he doesn't work more often.  He is Deniro from 15-20 years ago, before Deniro started parodying himself (SNL and Meet the Parents). Director Clint Eastwood delivers what we have come to expect from him - a wonderfully crafted, beautiful film that we mostly surrender to from our theatre seats.  Eastwood's style make you feel like you are a passenger on a car trip, watching as things happen outside your window.  ""Mystic River"" is not a whodunnit, as the answer to that question is given away very early on. What it is a study in human frailty, no matter the form.  The 3 childhood friends grow to be quite different adults, yet the horrific incident they share, is the foundation for who they have become.  While Sean Penn should act more often, I believe Tim Robbins (a fine filmmaker in his own right) should act less.  In goes through his role as some psycho-Herman Munster. Yes, he is tortured by the childhood incident, but if reality is such a foreign place to him, wouldn't his wife or co-workers have suggested therapy?  His role, while crucial to the film, had the weakest structure and performance.  Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn, on the other hand, shine in their roles.  For one of the few times, Bacon is not playing some freak that we love to hate.  Eastwood (in the Woody Allen tradition) has assembled a cast of acting professionals.  Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden all lend realism to their tough roles.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from ""Unbreakable"" and ""Gladiator"") has a key role without uttering a word. What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Eastwood's buddy from ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as the liquor store owner and witness to a past crime ... although he should have been listed in the credits!

A Masterpiece,"Recently I was asked what ""Mystic River"" was about.  I couldn't really say. If I tried to get in to all the plot intricacies it would take me a half hour to tell the basic storyline, but otherwise there was no way to give a real feel for the movie.  ""You have to watch it,"" I said.  I think this movie is on so many levels and with so much happening, a simple little summary doesn't do the film justice.Sean Penn, while I'm not completely convinced deserved an Oscar, did a wonderful job portraying the angst and desperation that Jimmy Markum feels. Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins are spectacular in their supporting roles.  The cinematography from director Clint Eastwood is beautiful and the story is great.  There are so many things to like about this film that I found it impossible to not love it.The film is centered around three friends.  We see them in the movie's opening as boys playing street hockey in Boston.  Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are just being boys when a man posing as a policeman comes and takes Dave away.  Dave is left in a cellar with only a sleeping bag and abused for who knows how long until he can escape. When Dave returns to the neighborhood one on-looker refers to him as ""damaged goods.""Twenty five years later all three men still live in Boston, but their lives have taken them in different directions.  It takes a tragic event to bring them back together, when Jimmy's daughter is found dead.  Sean, now a cop, is working on the case and Dave, one of only a few people to see Jimmy's daughter that fateful night, is a prime suspect.Kevin Bacon does a great job portraying Sean, who doesn't let anyone into the inner turmoil of his life.  Occasionally you get a glimpse in, but that is it.  He pushes people away, including his wife.  Dave is portrayed by Tim Robbins who is able to play Dave perfectly.  Dave seems to have a burden on him at all times.  A man who was robbed of his childhood, it never seems as if Dave is always there.  Robbins is able to show how Dave is in a different world from everyone else.  He plays wiffleball with his son every day, and his son is the only one who doesn't see him as damaged.Overall this is a great film.  It's not typical Hollywood happy endings and makes you think long after the credits roll.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Clint Eastwood's masterpiece; one of the year's best - truly exceptional acting and an instant classic in the making,"MYSTIC RIVER (2003) **** Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Laurence Fishburne, Emmy Rossum, Tom Guiry, Eli Wallach, Kevin Conway. Absorbing adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel about three childhood friends (Penn, Robbins and Bacon, all giving career high performances) reunited by the tragic killing of Penn's eldest daughter set in the gritty Boston surroundings that culminates with a shared past involving the abduction and molestation of Robbins' character  and ultimately the prime suspect of the murder investigation conducted by Bacon's homicide cop. Director Clint Eastwood superbly guides his stellar cast (including some exceptional work by Harden as the brittle wife of Robbins and Linney as a staid spouse of Penn) with a dignified élan that incorporates every possible emotion  grief, loss, pain, anger, redemption, vengeance, and eventually betrayal  with shrewd storytelling thanks to Brian Helgeland's smart, sharp script and the wise decision to shoot on location to give the film a sense of urgency and poignancy. Eastwood is at the top of his game and delivers a subtle masterpiece as does his principals  all who deserve Oscar recognition  especially the three principals  Penn's explosiveness, Robbin's implosiveness and Bacon's simmering doubts about everything in his life.

A rare film (in that it remains true to Dennis Lehane's superb novel) is blessed with superior acting.,"After seeing Eastwood's treatment of Michael Connelly's BLOODWORK, I wasn't holding my breath on this one.

The acting is superb (especially Sean Penn's and Kevin Bacon's, but I found Tim Robbin's portrayal hauntingly realistic, in spite of the earlier criticisms of his role which I had encountered). Lawrence Fishburne was engagingly real, and the Chapman & Nelson duo as the Savage Brothers was riveting. And what a nice tip-of-the-hat cameo by Eastwood's old amigo, Eli Wallach, who gave 210% in his 3-minute role. Eastwood has elevated himself to the level of mastery on this one.

Overbearing!,"Highly overrated and much too long.  I looked forward to a better story, but the music and acting held my interest to almost to the  very end when I had to GO.  To me it was such an overbearing story with 3 too many victims in a murder mystery.  A ""who-done-it"" with too many gory problems.  The 3 are childhood friends who grow up with such hatreds you'd never believe, altho we the audience know from flashbacks ""who-done-it"".  Best acting job was Tim Robbins who I hardly recognized.-- 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
not a masterpiece but a real come back,"After Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Eastwood seemed to have made less personal movies. But with Mystic River he's directed a movie reminding us that he was the guy who directed movies such as Bird, Unforgiven or the Bridges of Madison County. Mystic River is not a masterpiece but it's vintage Eastwood and it owes it to two things: the movie is shot with a real sense of what great classic filming is and the screenplay by Brian Helgeland. This screenplay develops lots of intersting themes: the transmission of evil through the links of blood and friendship, the way violence and the desire for revenge is reproducing eternally, the observation of small towns, their rumours, their boredom. The pessimism of the movie towards the part of evil there's in every human being is reminiscent of Fritz Lang. Overall, the tone is very dark but there's some funny moments, especially the cameo of Eli Wallach. But what prevents the movie from equalling Unforgiven is the interpretation of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins which look too much ""trying to make an Actor's studio performance"" and an uneven score. Anyway, it should have won the Best Screenplay award in Cannes rather than horrible ""les Invasions Barbares"". Recommended. 8,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An Intriguing Mystery Thriller With Mostly Good Performances,"Mystic River follows three men who were friends as children and are reunited in adulthood when the child of one of them is suddenly murdered.I've always been a sucker for a good murder mystery, and this is no exception. The way the story is presented is intriguing and often a little unsettling. It's got plenty of character and emotion to drive the story, making it all the more compelling.The characters themselves are pretty well-developed. Each one is quite different, and they all work really well together. They all, more or less, feel like real people.The acting is mostly good. Kevin Bacon is great as the head detective leading the search for the murderer, but Tim Robbins is definitely the standout of the movie. He plays a much more troubled character in the movie, and he's both the most compelling character and the most compelling actor. As for Sean Penn, he's alright. I have no idea how he won an Oscar for this movie, his performance was acceptable at best. He's very bland for the entirety of the movie. His character is the most emotionally affected in the movie, yet he portrays the least amount of emotion in the movie.Overall Mystic River is pretty great. The story is engaging and most every actor manages to portray compelling characters. In the end I'd recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
When great movie-making  keeps you glued to the chair,"Clint Eastwood shows (once again) with this movie that he is a great director. Everything in this movies - from a cinematic point of view - is excellent: the cinematography is beautiful (the gloomy use of colours like grey, silver, browns and blacks are very suitable for a tragedy), the actors are also excellent at a point that you don't believe that they are performing but actually living the situations - the Oscars to Sean Penn and Tim Robins are well deserved) and of course not enough can be told about Clint Eastwood's direction and music score... simply PERFECT!!! You think that after all this I would rate this movie with 10 but I rate it with 9 due to the story... The story is a modern tragedy reminiscent to ancient Greek tragedies. It is also very good but I believe it lacks somewhere that I actually can not pin-point exactly... It just leaves you with a bit of a bitter after-taste - i.e. it fills your mind with questions of doubt of how this story could actually be real... It is shown to you in a very realistic way through very realistic characters and so you'd expect a very realistic story... Probably I'm not very clear in what I'm trying to say but maybe after seeing it you'll understand what I'm trying to say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Finally A REAL Movie,"Clint Eastwood really yanked the best out of all of these actors. Sean Penn has finally come of age,with a burn like scotch not wine. Clearly Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon just needed juicy characters to chomp on because they're unrecognizable in this film...the best they've been in years.Laurence Fishburne can actually act without sunglasses on and he's tastefully understated.The womens characters played by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are powerful and sneak up on you, but the story does too, which again speaks to Eastwoods abilities.If your sick of those silly juvenile joke flicks you'll really like this story movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A proper crime thriller drama,"Most of the movies of Clint Eastwood are worth watching including this one. The story shown was simple but what made this movie different was the performance of the cast. Everyone including Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave their best, for which they also got Oscars.Work needed to be done for pacing and runtime but that will not effect your experience.

A Place Where Violence Repeats Itself...,"Its a story of three childhood friends, one of whose daughter gets murdered and how sinister secrets start getting unraveled. Directed by Clint Eastwood, Mystic River is a solid crime drama with deep emotional layers. Its main theme of how Violence has a way of revolving in cycles and comes back to haunt people is expressed masterfully with great dialogues. Amazing performances from everyone especially Sean Penn as the distraught father with dark past & Tim Robbins as a man carrying the scars of Childhood Trauma, both deservedly won Oscars.

Liked the book better,"I thought the movie really captured the feeling of the book. Especially the neighborhood and the interaction between the characters. I had just finished the book though, and it was close to the book, but a lot was left out. The book developed the characters much deeper and I felt that if you hadn't read the book you would have missed too much of the story. My husband hadn't read the book and he said he didn't see a lot of the connections between the characters in the move. I loved the kind of noir feeling the movie had, I liked Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn as the main characters. They all did a wonderful job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A gritty and powerful tale.,"Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is quite mystical for the simple fact that there is so much more going on underneath than above the surface, just like the river. There is a lot of symbolism here and that only adds to the complexity and power of the story. The acting is terrific with Penn and Robbins both giving Oscar-worthy performances. Bacon is underrated and Fishburne, Harden, and Linney all holding their own. This is heavy material and not easy to deal with, but director Eastwood handles it superbly, never delving too deep into unnecessary plots and not always going for the tearjerker. This is a straightforward, thought-provoking film that takes multiple viewings to understand it all. In my opinion, it isn't as good as Unforgiven or Million Dollar Baby, but it is still better than what most directors are churning put today, and I hope Clint Eastwood continues to do much of the same work that he did here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mumble Mumble Mumble,"Pretty good movie. Even though I do not care for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. But why was there so much  mumbling in the picture.

Mystified by all the praise,"Ugh.  What a repugnant piece of work this is-patronising and full of pretension; it feels as if Eastwood were filming Titanic in a bathtub and fancied himself James Cameron.  But that's the least of it.  Mystic River arrives on a tidal wave of prestige:  an Oscar winning director, Oscar winning screenwriter, the majority of its cast Oscar nominees and/or winners.  It's an impressive package.  The actors make a mighty effort-none more so than Laura Linney, alternately mastering and mangling a Boston dialect-but Eastwood falls on his sword, aided in part by a lacklustre screenplay contributed by Brian Helgeland.Ostensibly a character piece-at least in pace-Eastwood lacks either the confidence, skill or instinct to let go of the superficial trappings of a thriller, which this potentially searing drama most certainly is not. There are no thrills here, folks, no mystery, no suspense and the only mysticism is in the title.  This isn't a whodunit.  Eastwood makes sure of that by telegraphing the outcome through his use of obvious, clumsy symbolism. This is a human tragedy of imperfect people struggling with extraordinary circumstances; but the workings of that tragedy have to be achieved before they can be elevated to such a grand scale.  On the one hand, you could see where the story of a community of friends and relatives torn apart by random criminal acts would resonant for the director and star of-how else to put this?-westerns.  But therein lies the trouble.  The demands of dramatising a contemporary, convincing urban community in distress are far greater than the prefabricated iconography of the western.  Demands that Eastwood appears to be blissfully unaware of; Mystic River presents a directorial challenge to which he simply never rises.It's actually a little worse than that.  Eastwood demonstrates an uncertain sense of tone-and not just in his self-penned score which surely sounded better when he composed it on his Casio keyboard than it does in the cinema. Delicate, sensitive elements of this story-child abuse, abduction and murder, to name a few-are handled, mishandled or just plain overexposed to the point of verging on exploitation, mostly because he thinks this film is about the narrative as opposed to the obvious, overwhelming grief of a father who's daughter doesn't come home one night or the young boy who was left to rescue himself from his abductors-an abduction that, as staged by Eastwood, his two best friends are more or less complicit in.  (Not that this merits any investigation from the director.)  This is just one of several awkward stagings; others would include his ghastly, unnecessary overhead shot of a victim in a park that pushes the audience away from the characters and into the position of voyeurs, as well as another act of violence, later in the film that gives way to a complete white out of the screen as Eastwood misjudges the moment (or distrusts the drama) and reaches for a kind of majesty where none exists.  In fact, both scenes end in white outs-a technique that flags Eastwood's overall discomfort with this material.And what material it is.but Eastwood's adherence to genre in what emerges as an anti-thriller, stifles the potential catharsis this drama might have. He seems to understand that Mystic River is about a larger, human tragedy-hence, the portentous and superficial epic quality he applies so liberally, as if he's actually earned it-but gives into the contrivances of a thriller at every turn.  Perhaps most disappointingly, Eastwood strains to withhold from the audience the characters and circumstances-the very heart of this story-that would make it at all edifying.  This ultimately severely lessens the impact of the drama as Eastwood tries unsuccessfully to solve the crime and heighten the tragedy simultaneously-so much effort when just allowing the audience to see the characters and the action for who and what they are would've been much more compelling, allowing the audience to compose the tragedy for themselves and engage in it fully as an inevitability as opposed to some surprise plot twist.First and foremost, this is a film about men, and a rather insulting one at that considering Eastwood's narrow view of them.  In Mystic River, boys are not allowed to be boys, fathers are not allowed to be fathers because everyone-even the women-have to be like men, manly with a capital m.  This presents itself not so much as stoicism as it does broad caricature, particularly when Penn, a bad guy who in the last nineteen years has undergone a reformation of sorts, shows up around 11 o'clock in full leathers, including gloves.  Not since Olivia Newton-John in Grease has a performer made such an obvious, attention-getting entrance.  Penn invests his character, Jimmy, with a hefty humanity but Helgeland's script isn't written to Penn's strengths-ultimately, Jimmy just seems an ignorant lout despite Penn's graceful intimations that he is so much more.  One missed opportunity on a tote board of many.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, the homicide gumshoes on the case, give what they can but Eastwood and his screenwriter overlook the fact that even in a mystery/thriller, the drama usually rests with the investigator(s) on the case and what compels them personally to solve it.  Here, they simply move the plot along as we are asked to believe that Bacon has been carrying on a relationship for six months with his mobile phone and a disembodied pair of lips (his estranged wife that Eastwood rather inexplicably shoots from above the chin and below the nose-go figure).  It's not big and it's not clever-both this conceit and the abduction in the opening scenes feel like the kind of scenarios that work better in novels where the payoff might be bigger.  Here, they are simply unbelievable, at least as Eastwood presents them.  Robbins is strait-jacketed into a sort of homage to Boo Radley; his is, by far, the most interesting character but Eastwood is content to just indicate this character's sorrows rather than investigate them.  As is born out in the end, Robbins' character is in a completely different movie altogether and merely wanders around the sets of Mystic River, his pain and dislocation just so much red herring, played as so much bait to Eastwood's would be morality play or further Oscar mongering, a rather tasteless dramatisation of child abduction, paedophilia and murder.The women each get one opportunity a piece to audition for the part of Lady MacBeth, presumably in some future Eastwood production (or Mel Gibson's). Which is a shame really considering the women are Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney; one playing a  woman who thinks her husband is a murderer, the other secretly pleased at the absence of her stepdaughter, regardless of how brutal her demise.  Both are rich with possibilities, both reduced to abrupt snapshots.Ultimately, what really rankles is Eastwood's `honour among men' ending; again, reaching for some kind of majesty-fingers running amok over the Casio keyboard-Eastwood posits that men do what they have to do, blah, blah, blah, in some lame elevation of the importance of the American family above all else-truth, justice-it's the American way.  However, what one is left with-in this day and age-is that Americans, ignorant and lacking ethics, will protect their cosy way of life at any cost, no matter whose blood is flowing down the mystical or otherwise polluted river.  It couldn't end on a less empathic note.Eastwood's supporters are more than happy to do the work for him and applaud this ambitious effort but what appears on screen in Mystic River is a muddle of missed opportunities and clumsy, unchallenging storytelling; Eastwood seems assured enough but allows too much of Mystic River to fall between the cracks.Tom Guiry does impressive work as the boyfriend of the missing girl.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An instant classic, who's mastery will grow exponentially with the passing of time","This is most definitely a situation of comment where less is more. One could espouse for many an hour on the multitude of  virtues this film conveys. I will simply identify two. Eastwoods direction is so complete that the manner in which the characters communicate their emotions to the audience one could swear that it is your conscience he is directing not the actors. Secondly, to further enhance the first point there is one particular scene early in the film featuring Penn in which I was brought to tears. Never have I cried in a film that is not an emotionally contrived tear-jerker (the ETs of this world etc). Even in those situations I was very young and that was merely sobbing not full blown crying. In conclusion there are two points that prevent me from hailing this film as perfect. Firstly, I don't think that Fishburnes character was given quite the degree of emotional depth and communication as other significant characters. Secondly as I'm only 28 there are many films that are yet to be made that I will see over the next 40-50 years of my life that could be a little better and I feel that dispensing ""perfects"" too frequently will reduce the actual description of perfection. Suffice to say that if I were to die tomorrow this film would be an uneqivocal 10/10 as a better film I'm yet to see. Ever. There are very few absolutes in life, as human beings by their very construction are emotional and those emotions are more often than not fickle and are massively influenced by the past and how we perceive the here and now. Clint Eastwood is into his 8th decade of living-who better to perfectly illustrate the complexities our existence and the real meaning for our living? He offers very few answers but poses many questions that will leave you wondering for many a moon once you have vacated his domain and and more pertinently our domain he, such is the films emotional penetration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Eastwood at his best,"Mystic River is a masterpiece, one which Clint Eastwood made sure that after watching you will feel messed up and elevated at the same time. The thing that catches you is the acting proficiency of the principal actors; they took their time to study their characters, with Tim Robbins to me, being the most effective of them all.Eastwood directorial prowess is showcased in this flick; he takes you on a Journey of social decadence, the pains of betrayal and the unlikely implication of child molestation.Mystic River was shot in Boston, and it is an adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The book and movie plot is about three boys who grow up as friends in Boston, Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and Jimmy (Sean Penn). While the boys were playing around in the neighbourhood street Dave was abducted by child molesters who were pretending to be police officers.After days of regular molestation Dave escapes and finds his way back home, but the trauma of the molestation messed him up emotionally and mentally making him a little unstable and hard to understand.25 years in to the future Sean has grown to become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently runs a convenience store, and Dave has a blue collar job, still haunted by his abduction. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, with Dave marrying Jimmy's sister.Jimmy's daughter disappears one night and her body is found brutally murdered, coincidentally Dave comes home to his wife covered in blood and rattling that he fought off a mugger and ""bashed his head into the concrete"", and possibly killed him. Sean is then assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends meet up again.Nominated for six Academy Awards, which Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor (those where the two awards the movie went home with), making Mystic River the first film to win both awards since Ben-Hur in 1959.The movie also won two Golden Globe Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, in the Best Actor and Best supporting Actor category. With Penn and Robbins wining many more accolades from other not so notable awardees.Mystic River is a classic movie, that holds its own in the collation of greats, and it is one that I advice any movie lover to go buy this off the shelf.

Eastwood's ultimate masterpiece.,"I don't know how Mr. Eastwood makes it possible to upgrade such a simple basic plot to this shocking yet heartbreaking ending or how he puts such intensity to every single word the characters speak or how he shows scenes of a usual downtown neighborhood that feels so much personal yet alien to the actions in the film. I don't know how he takes out the career-best performances from each and every actor in this film, even Kevin 'Tremors' Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne. With enough respect to Peter Jackson, I don't know how the Academy denied his Oscar that year.I don't know how Sean Penn puts so much passion in a character that's so against his type. His performance as Jimmy is not only one of the most honest performances I've ever seen, it's perhaps one of the most versatile, most contrasting one till date. His other masterful works like in Dead Man Walking or The Asassination of Richard Nixon are simply no comparison. This acting one does once in a lifetime.And, I don't know how Tim Robbins could regain such acting ability after all these years. I don't know why his role was nominated in the supporting actor category. I'd very much like to see them competing for one award. Surely that'd make some hairs gray.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the best films of the last decade,"When you mix powerhouse performers like Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon under the direction of the legendary Eastwood together, you'll get a cocktail that will surprise, shock and thrill you during its two hours runtime before the day after kicks in with full force.The narrative evolves around three childhood friends that were torn apart due to a tragedy, and are getting reunited after 30+ years when one of them finds his daughter murdered and mutilated. One of them (Kevin Bacon) has become a cop, one (Sean Penn) has become a notorious criminal and the last one (Tim Robbins) is still recovering from the horrific tragedy years earlier. We can already see that their different roles are in conflict, and the tension escalates dramatically when one of them is connected to the murder somehow. During the main plot, captivating smaller stories are being dug up during Bacon's police investigation, all of the them connects somehow towards the breathtaking end of the flick. It's well-made drama at its very core, masterful.Eastwood directs the movie gently and well. The camera is steady and shows some amazing landscape-shots of Boston, its quite beautiful.What is there to say about the performances except ""wow""? Penn and Robbins' Oscars were very well deserved. Penn manages to catch the fragile balance between a tough mobster and a grieving father, one scene in particular on a porch shows why he's one of the greatest living actors today. Robbins manages to catch the emotionally conflicted character so well that your heart goes out to him. Honorable mentions goes to the amazing supporting cast, especially Harden and Linney's portrayals as grieving and confused wives.If you haven't seen this movie, do so. Eastwood catches man's raw, brutal nature and leaves with a conclusion so satisfying and shocking that makes ""Mystic River"" a movie you'll never forget.-MB",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A raw film about crime from the street neighborhoods of Boston,"""Mystic River"" is a raw crime film about growing up and living in the street neighborhoods of Boston. It's based on a 2001 novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane. The story gets its name from the Mystic River that runs through the Northwest of the city and empties into Boston Harbor.From an opening short scene of boyhood, the movie quickly jumps 25 years. Three boyhood friends have drifted apart, with far different lives. One is an ex-con who's become a king of the old neighborhood in which he owns a mom and pop grocery store. Another is a homicide detective. And the third is a blue-collar worker who still suffers quietly from sexual abuse as a boy at the hands of two men. One wore the Roman collar of a priest, the other was a plain-clothes policeman. The boy was abducted for four days. This incident isn't discussed any more in the film, but it comes back in a big way in the events that follow these many years later.Clint Eastwood co-produced, directed and wrote the score for this film. It has his mark of a dark side of life. It's a story about dysfunctional families, child abuse, crime, hatred, homosexuality, murder, revenge, teen prostitution, vengeance and secrets. The film is a furtive look at vigilante justice, blind revenge, distrust of innocence, criminal denial of guilt and injustice.It's a powerful, sad film that ends without resolution. This has become a trademark of Eastwood films. He brings a story to an end, but the characters will go on living without a satisfactory conclusion to the story. This is a hard movie to sit through for its violence, meanness, and frequent obscenities and vulgar language. The R rating fits, except that it might have another label - for mature adults. This is the type of film that can badly influence immature adults as well as young people.The acting is superb throughout the film. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins received double awards - Oscars and Golden Globes, for their roles. Penn won the best actor awards and Robbins won the best supporting actor awards.Although it received critical praise, ""Mystic River"" isn't a film for every adult.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Copshow pilot with Hollywood stars,"A slow-burning, semi-intelligent and extremely traditional thriller about three childhood friends reunited as adults through a murder.

It's perhaps worth catching this well-crafted film on TV, but it is definitely not a cinematic film.The oscars awarded to Sean Penn and Tim Robbins for what is, at base, a humdrum copshow pilot with Hollywood stars, suggest that Clint Eastwood, who directed, has a lot of friends in the Academy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The script was superb and the dialouge was very crisp. I remember renting this movie and my family got to see it and I didn't. So about 6 months later, I finally got to see the movie on TV. Besides of all those positives of the movie, there were barely any negatives, but I had one and I had to say that the movie got pretty slow at times.

There are a lot of very good things about the movie, but I don't really see what is the point of it.  Just life?I gave it 7 out of 10. It had the potential for a higher score.

The movie also has a great supporting cast such as Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Bacon. Director Clint Eastwood has crafted the best movie about a midlife crisis since Robert Benton's 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer. Especially featuring a great script by Brian Helgeland, and great photography by Tom Stern.

An average but stylish who is the killer movie.,"The movie proceeds sluggishly. The film is not hectic, and events advance sequentially. As the audience, we experience events alongside the characters, which is the main factor providing immersion and acting comes along with this of course. Mystic River is about three men who were friends as children, and one day, an abduction occurs that serves as a turning point for them. One of them is kidnapped and raped. He manages to escape from his abductors and returns home, but his life will never be the same again. As time passes, they grow up and only remember each other from the past.

Heartless and demoralizing,"I think that who ever signed on to work with this crap must be looking to retire soon. At least, they SHOULD BE after this embarrassment. An extremely implausible plot is only worsened by characters drawn so poorly, you want to vomit.The story is about how a murder effects three old friends. Unfortunately, we only really feel how it effects one character, Jimmy, the father of the deceased. The other two characters feel to be very contrived, almost as if they are being pulled into the plot against their will. The only emotional connection between these three friends is a traumatic experience they shared in their childhood, which left at least one of the three permanantly scarred. However, as adults, they grew apart, living very different lifestyles.The fact that one of the ""former"" friends becomes a suspect in the murder, seeds the inevitable conflict between Jimmy and his old friend. There could be lots of drama and tension built up, but that would actually require the writer to sketch out the relationship between these two characters.Instead, we are merely left with a did-he-do-it or did-he-not-do-it mystery, which lasts way too long for the little amount of suspense it carries. If he ""didn't do it"", then we should at least be left with some reason to care who did do it. Maybe, the killer will strike again? No, not likely in this movie (though there will be more than one murder before the curtain closes). And if he did ""do it"", then we probably don't care anyway, because his character is so inconsistent and vague to begin with.The reality for the pathetic murder mystery turns out to be so pointless and unbelievable, that all potential dramatic irony gets flushed down the toilet. Then the final sin is committed: we realize that the one decently portrayed character, the one character that we thought we understood in this movie, this loving and compassionate father, is not even who we thought he was. Up to the point where we thought we understood his motives, we leave in bitter disgust. Horrible!Finally, I do not understand why the movie insists on depicting a stereotypical reference between Catholicism and pedophilia when this has no link to the plot what-so-ever.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of Eastwood's best,"Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, also known for penning the novels upon which ""Gone, Baby, Gone"" & ""Shutter Island"" were based. Adapting the novel for the screen was Brian Helgeland, who previously won an Oscar for co-writing ""L.A. Confidential"". So, from a writing perspective, the movie certainly had all of the ingredients for a gripping crime drama.The multi-layered story is set in Boston and concerns a group of childhood friends whose lives intersect once again when one of their daughters is murdered. The screenplay expertly balances mystery and drama in a manner that evokes Greek tragedy moreso than a typical potboiler. It was nominated for (and probably should have won) the Oscar for best adapted screenplay.When it comes to the cast, it's definitely one that justifies the adjective 'all-star'. Sean Penn & Tim Robbins gave remarkable, Oscar-winning performances and the rest of the main cast was scarcely less impressive. Kevin Bacon & Laurence Fishburne played a pair of cops and contributed characteristically solid performances. Laura Linney & Marcia Gay Harden gave two very different portrayals of spouses, with Harden's particularly impressive performance garnering an Oscar nomination. The remainder of the cast was uniformly reliable as well.Eastwood's direction is generally unobtrusive and gives the actors plenty of room to shine. This results in a film that is attractive but not distractingly so. Eastwood also provided the film's score, which features a memorable motif that recurs throughout.Altogether, ""Mystic River"" represents one of Clint Eastwood's best films as a director. The stellar cast, workmanlike production and compelling story combine to produce what is arguably the best movie of 2003.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Brilliant acting.,"It would be hard to go wrong with Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne leading the way, wouldn't it?So, enough said for the talent department!And a good story based on a macabre scenario gives rise to much vacillation and theories of guilt - and degrees of guilt - in one's own whodunnit factory.In other words, it's well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Mystic River: Darkness, Depth, and Despair","Mystic River is a film. Mystic River is directed by Clint Eastwood. Mystic River stars Sean Penn. Yeah, I was always gonna love this one...After the brutal murder of nineteen year old Katie, her ex-con cum businessman father Jimmy becomes reunited with childhood friends Sean, one of the detectives investigating, and Dave, one of the last people to have seen her alive. The disbanded trio are each haunted by a childhood trauma, the after-effects of which hang ominously over their shared modern horror.We begin with the aforementioned trauma, its unfolding simplistic yet harrowing. Almost before we have time to react, we find ourselves in the modern day, being introduced gradually to the grown up alternatives to the children we have just left behind, seeing their lives and what they have become. It's not long before what eventually transpire to be the highlights of the film make themselves abundantly clear: the concomitant undercurrent of darkness to every scene; the gloriously austere, subtle, almost incidental performance of Robbins; the characteristically exquisite excellence of Penn. The primary plot, that of the murder mystery, is nothing exceptionally compelling in itself, the film's appeal lying rather in those involved. The question of culpability takes a backseat, Eastwood trading the tension he could create for a wonderful depth and complexity of character which sets his film apart from the other less interesting displays of cheap fast-food-film which one despairingly finds throttling the genre. Under Eastwood's firm grip, the very fine script is guided to a perfect fulfillment of its potential, the ugly dankness of his more recent works rife within the film. The performances are nothing short of amazing, each actor bringing memorable elements to the film and not a single one of them out of step. The film's sole flaw is that Eastwood has done better. If almost anyone but he had made this, it would be career defining.Abound with astounding performances, darkness, depth, and despair, Mystic River is yet another medal of honour on the lapel that is Eastwood's career. An entertaining, if not always comfortable, viewing experience, it is not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Execptional acting - unexceptional story,"I have always found Clint Eastwood a largely dull screen presence. His famed looks apart, as an actor he displays a minuscule range. In the light of this undoubtedly minority opinion, it comes as something of a surprise that he should have developed into such a fine director.True he has a top notch cast to work with. But they are not simply performing at the level to which they owe their reputations. Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Harden and Linney all manage to reach the very cores of their characters and the result is a genuinely stunning array of performances. Eastwood is clearly a director of immense sensitivity. For this alone, ""Mystic River"" is essential viewing.The pity of it all is that the material itself is way below the characters that people this pretty lame whodunit. The resolution of the murder borders on the insulting. While the characters are extremely well drawn, the problematic storyline severely hinders the movie. Excellently filmed, brilliantly acted, the end result should have been a far more memorable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"powerful drama with extensive suspense and mystery, but a very underwhelming ending","I'm closer to giving this an 8 than a 9 but given how immersed and emotionally invested I was in the first 90% of it, I'm ""rounding up."" I'll start with the praise, which is very due. How it's filmed from the get go, and the building of characters and everything they've gone through and will go through, is just great. The tragedy that spurs the investigation hits hard and deep and Sean Penn deserved the Oscar, as did Tim Robbins. Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden are great, too, with the script - unsurprisingly based on a book - superiorly directed by Clint Eastwood. The investigative aspect of the movie really drew me in, and they do a great job at sustaining curiosity to the end. The end. Ah, yes. My least favorite fifteen minutes. So very underwhelming; I don't want to give anything away, although I'm sure most people have seen this film by now, but it really was so ""meh"" to me. The scene that was absolutely torturous to watch was a speech given by Laura Linney, who plays Penn's wife, a character who was more or less mute the entire movie, suddenly has this questionably-unethical, sinister, dramatic tone that literally comes out of nowhere. I love her but it felt far too contrived, abrupt, and robotic. It sapped the ending of any emotion for me, despite the emotional rollercoaster that the movie was throughout. The only other gripe I have is that I think the murder should have been filmed toward the end, once it's revealed who did it and how, instead of summarizing it in two indifferent lines of dialogue that's shrugged off. But I imagine most people just buy into it given what they've gone through, the incredible movie that it was...up until the last 15 minutes, for me at least.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Promising start, botched ending.","Mystic River starts with a gripping and dramatic scene, and this tone persists throughout most of the film.  This is by no means an ""enjoyable"" film in the literal sense.  It deals with troubling subjects such as pedophilia, murder, and revenge.  However, for most of the film, the story is absorbing and believable, the acting is superlative, and the personalities and motivations of the major characters are well developed. About mid-way through the film, I was agreeing with most of the other reviewers who have praised the film and recommended it for Oscar consideration.However, with the long, drawn-out, ant-climatic, and even dishonest ending; my assessment of the film crashed from ""outstanding"" to ""mediocre"".  In the third-last scene, there is a horrifying moment when two of the characters are speaking, and the resolution of the murder and revenge plot-lines become clear to both.  THIS is the true climax of the film, and it should have ended there..... even the setting of this scene ties back to the start of the film.  However, it appears that either the author of the book or the screenwriter was so pleased with his work, that he didn't want to see it end; because there are two totally superfluous scenes which not only add nothing to the story, but they also effect an unbelievable, depressing, and unexpected ""morality shift"" in two of the major characters.  There is also a ""side-story"" throughout the film involving one of the major characters and his absent wife.  This subplot is also somewhat resolved at the end, but the problem is, who cares?  The subplot was one of the few weak points of the first part of the film, and focusing on it at the end simply degrades the whole experience.Nice try Clint, but 10 minutes lopped off the end would have resulted in an outstanding, moving, and thought-provoking film.As-is, it rates 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"This River flows magnificently; a lesson in direction as a variety of raw, human emotions surface causing tensions and sensations to simmer.","I suppose the poster for Clint Eastwood's 2003 film Mystic River wants us to read into it in a way that pre-ordains us for the film proper. The reflections of three anonymous men catch our eye, the shimmering and disjointed figures making themselves apparent in the water as we realise, half way through the film, that the notion of looking at one's self; looking into one's self; realising that one is the way one is and must negotiate it is prominent. Such is the tone of Mystic River, a one-part detective story; one-part vigilante tale with a twist. It is a film that kick-started the sort of run of form for a contemporary era American director that had not been seen since Oliver Stone got all angry at the back end of the eighties and went on an invigorated 'spree' of pent-up film-making which saw him attack mostly everything of what America thought made it 'great'.Penned by American screenwriter Brian Helgeland, from a book of the same name written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is driven by Helegeland's rather deeply infused screen writing roots in working in pulpy, criminal orientated material (from 1995's Assassins to 1997's L.A. Confidential and then 1999's Payback) with his ability to pepper his scripts with distinct characters, some of whom are harder; weaker and wormier than others. It is this, combined with Eastwood's style of directing; that odd mixture of films with rich cinematography that carry a confrontational and knowing tone, as facts and situations are presented in stark but slick fashion, most of his films focusing on those given a voice when the chips are either on the way or already firmly down.One character in Mystic River wants a voice, he's looking for a way to just communicate what he went through as a young boy in 1950s Boston so as to lay to rest why it is most people think he's a little strange. He is David Boyle (Robbins), a man who grew up with fellow Boston citizens Jimmy Markum (Penn) and Sean Devine (Bacon), with each of these three taking to very different paths as they grew up: Sean is a police officer; Markum a local gangster big-shot with David sort of landing half way as a guy we're led to believe is capable of some pretty terrible things on top of the fact he himself is a victim of gross wrong-doing. Mystic River has plots going on on top of, and below, other plots. The relations characters have between one another are deep and layered, as things kick off on a number of strands, all of which carry sub-plots; character motivations and developments.The film sees Eastwood revisit ground made more famous by his Dirty Harry exploits in the exploring of the role of the vigilante as three different plights of searching for their own version of justice are juggled: a justice of a righteous nature for Devine; one of a personal nature running on love and respect for a family member for Markum and of an ill-advised nature running on hatred and prior wrong-doing for Boyle. It is Devine who captures what I think most of the characters feel most often in Mystic River: he stands on the bridge into the city following the looking at the aftermath of a car crash, gazing over the distant skyline in a rueful and knowing manner, making do with his role tackling the city's more grizzlier goings-on and a failed relationship in which a woman will not even talk to him down the phone despite calling him.The event which binds everyone and rekindles past acquaintances leading to this exploration of fate, exemplified in Boyle's rueful reminiscing as to what everything might have been like had one of the other two boys got into a makeshift police officer's car whilst they were all young, is the death of Katie Markum (Rossum); Jimmy's young daughter. Penn plays a man attempting to deal with the grief of such a loss, in doing so balancing the fact that he didn't really know her with the hunt for her killer, whom he wants before the police find him, with the close ties within his own network that threaten to fall apart: an altercation at one point with a friend and confidant named Theo is an example of how one event can ripple down into the lives of others, capturing what keeps the core of Mystic River beating – and Penn plays it wonderfully. But everything is finely distributed, the crux of Boyle's story coming out when his wife walks in on him watching a horror film and the notion of being a vampire is hit upon by Boyle as something that would see you along the lines of being ""Undead, but still sort of alive on the outside"", echoing his own predicament in life as someone who once felt alive until something terrible befell him. The use of lighting as Eastwood blots out half of Boyle's face in darkness works well given his entire arc, that notion of 'just' and 'unjust' co-existing as one.Eastwood manages to balance the respective plights of these three men brilliantly, with the grief on one stand and the searching for the truth on another whilst a pot-boiler simmers on a third level; neither one overwhelming the other nor presented as spectacle. So often now is the way, predominantly due to the influence from a number of TV detective shows, that police officers need to be exploring grandeur cases and shooting around the place under the guise of an energetic aesthetic. Eastwood substitutes this with character study and a burning tension, the likes of which are so much easier to invest in. The opening scene shows three boys and their want for names and identification to remain etched forever; Mystic River then provides a tragic story of how names may well stick but leashing one's identity is an altogether different task.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Very well written and acted.,"The film is an excellent mystery, but like all great mysteries, it gives away the ending at the beginning, if only the viewer could see. The entire premise of the movie is that a young girl is brutally murdered. Though shot, the cause of death is repeated blows to the head from a blunt object, likely a stick or a pipe. An early scene in the movie tells the astute viewer who the killer is. The murder weapon is further prominently featured elsewhere in the movie, only in a different incarnation, and with great irony. Only when the murderer is finally revealed does the viewer see how he has been inattentive. Such is the stuff of true compelling mystery.Another feature of the movie is it's moral: the hideousness and moral self-imprisonment of vigilante justice. At the end of the movie, a fair viewer acknowledges the absolute necessity of having and trusting a judicial system, even one as flawed as our own.Sean Penn is especially effective in the role of Jimmy. He is another of those great actors shamefully underused by Hollywood. He makes the viewer feel his anguish, and though his actions are appalling, we still feel empathy for him, and he emerges as a kind of anti-hero in spite of himself.Once again, Clint Eastwood has demonstrated that he is as good behind the camera as in front. The story is well developed, and the cinematography captures the essence of life in the neighbourhoods of New York: though all the streets lead out of the city, nobody is able to escape them, or the past they constantly thrust into in the minds of their prisoners.One critical note: I thought the sound quality was poor. Far too often I could not make out what the characters were saying. When using New York accents, it is essential that the director ensure crisp, sharp sound. I didn't realize the kids were reporting that there was ""blood in a car"" and not ""blood on a cop"" until much later in the movie. Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Outstanding,"Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic. Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...All too human.He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring. Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor. Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police. He also does a great job. His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal. Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.The story itself is riveting. Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric. The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing. This movie is that good. It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.A couple of other things set this film apart. One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in. Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter. Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why. And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers. The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Lacks subtlety,"A stellar cast and solemn direction by Clint Eastwood lay the foundation for this adaptation of Dennis Lehane's bestselling crime novel - a critical and commercial success when it was released in 2003. The film has an intriguing premise, as we are introduced to three young kids from Charlestown, Boston, on the day of a traumatic event in 1975, before reuniting with them 25 years later, when their lives have taken different turns, all more or less revolving around crime and guilt. The devices Eastwood employs in order to elevate the story beyond familiar crime fiction tropes are slow pacing and overly expressive acting, which unfortunately aren't the right recipe to disguise the script's weaknesses and contrivances. Eastwood aims to create an all-encompassing piece about loss, guilt, and original sin, but the overemphasised themes and humourless sentimentality merely underline the film's ultimate lack of subtlety.

The best American movie i have ever seen,"""We bury our sins""Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" is a tragic story about the past and how it can come back to haunt those again. Yet what is so interesting about Clint Eastwood's movies is that we can study the characters and actually relate to them. I think back on ""Unforgiven"" where Eastwood's character William Munny was forced to do what he did after money and the death of his best friend where involved.The film's prologue shows three young boys from Boston; Jimmy, David and Sean as they play street hockey in the middle of the neighborhood, they lose the ball in the sewer and see a sidewalk filled with cement that hasn't dried and decide to write their names on the cement as a trademark. A car arrives as two old men who are pedophiles pose as cops to the three young boys and threaten to arrest them unless they go back to their parents. The cops ask young Davis on where he lives, and tells them that he lives on the other side. As a threat, they'll arrest him unless he goes with them to drop him off. The old men kidnap David for four weeks until he escapes from their cell, leaving him a burden he will carry for the rest of his life.All three men are grown up now and have different lives.Jimmy (Sean Pean) is the crook who has gone to jail already. He runs a mom and pop's store in the neighborhood where his oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) works with him. He is also the neighborhood tough guy where two cousins from his wife (Laura Linney) are in his gang.Sean (Kevin Bacon) is on the opposite side of the law where he is a detective who can't seemed to figure out why his wife left him while she was pregnant and doesn't want to say a word over the phone.David (Tim Robbins) is still living the burden he carried when he was abused. His wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) can never seem to figure out what is wrong with him as well, just the fact that he comes home one night with a wound and a hole in the middle of his shirt.All three characters are re-united after the death of Jimmy's daughter in which Sean is the detective working on the case with his partner (Laurence Fishburne); David is consider a suspect in the murder case while Jimmy himself gets his wife's cousins to ask everybody in the neighborhood if they know anything about his daughter's murder.""Mystic River"" is a story about the past coming back to haunt those who experience the pain, and now coming back to those who didn't deserve it.

A masterpiece,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. With great cast (Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon) this movie excels in every aspect.

Throughout the course of the movie, the three friends reunite when Jimmys's (Penn) daughter is murdered. Bacon plays a detective, while Robbins is the lead suspect for some time.

Too long,"Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter is found murdered and his childhood friend Sean (Kevin Bacon) leads the murder investigation. Who is the murderer?The film starts interestingly enough with the three young boys in the first scene. However, the momentum is quickly lost as we fast forward to the future and have to work out what is going on and who is who. We then have a drawn out section of the film where nothing happens for about half an hour other than Sean Penn brooding. The cast are good - Sean Penn looks and acts like Robert de Niro, Kevin Bacon is his usual likable self while Tim Robbins gives the most interesting performance as Dave.The film doesn't need to show the violence so graphically at the end where there is also a piece of philosophical nonsense between Penn and Bacon about what would have happened if either of them had got into the car with the stranger at the beginning of the film when they were boys. It's obvious that no-one connected with the film had actually been kidnapped as a youngster. They are talking crap. Clint Eastwood directs so there is a predictable ""vigilante wins"" theme to the story. But why should Penn's vigilante antics be any more acceptable than Dave's? There is also an unnecessary storyline concerning Bacon and his wife which adds nothing to the film.It was left to a friend of mine to explain to me what happens after the film has finished, ie, Bacon's character finally gets Penn.

"Cliché-ridden, ham-fisted, coma-inducing waste of time!!!","That Sean Penn won the Oscar for this overblown bore-fest is bad enough, but that it was over the truly great performance of Bill Murray in LOST IN TRANSLATION (a film that isn't a waste of time), makes it all the more painful. Penn has had some great acting moments (SWEET AND LOWDOWN for one), and so has Tim Robbins (THE PLAYER, SHORT CUTS and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for three), but the only worthwhile acting in this film belongs to the relative unknowns portraying the younger roles. Clint Eastwood is a talented director, who has contributed some great films (UNFORGIVEN is the top of it's genre, and BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY stomped any other pocketbook romance adaptation), but this is real amateur night. The script is an unrealistic (bad) joke. Penn's character looks like Michael Douglas' hit-man from ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOLS (not a serious film, but still leagues higher than M.R.), and acts like some by-the-numbers thug, complete with his own circle of goons, that do super-cool macho things like charging through police lines and ordering cops around. I recommend randomly standing in line instead of watching this drek (at least with standing in line you may get something worthwhile for your time).

great acting,"Why is Tim Robins considered supporting and Sean Penn leading actor???,they both are leading to me.

A haunting storyline that keeps you gripped from the moment the film starts.,"A Clint Eastwood directed masterpiece, which brings Sean Penn to his very best to achieve his best actor Oscar. A very moving and convincing performance from Penn overshadows what really are outstanding performances from both Kevin Bacon and Tim Robins in their own rights. This is a star studded spectacle which consumes its viewers until the very climax when the truth reveals itself. Three childhood friends go their separate ways when a tragic incident breaks the fabric of their friendship. Fast forward a couple of decades and the three are reunited under once more, tragic circumstances. Penn's daughter has been murdered, Robbins is the prime suspect and Bacon is the detective investigating the murder. The plot though also has room to involve such stars as Laura Linney as Penns wife, Marcia Gay harden as Robbins' wife and Laurence Fishbourne as Bacons' partner. The plot is full of twists and turns and is on par with such classics as The usual suspects for the gripping suspense that drives you mad with the guess work you undertake watching the film trying to foresee the conclusion of the film before you reach it. This masterpiece truly is a must see for all film fans, it has a great cast and a haunting storyline, what more could you want?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Innocence Lost,"When asked what an actor should do to develop his craft, on ""In the Actor's Studio"" guest Actor/ Director Clint Eastwood said that one should master ""the art of listening."" Watching Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" we get a sense that we are ease-dropping on a private conversation. ""Mystic River"" is the work of the director who has a mastery of his craft. Eastwood is also directing actors who are at the top of their game: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden. This is an extraordinary accomplishment given the nature of the story-- it is difficult to sit through. Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") wrote the compelling screenplay from the novel by Dennis Lehane. ""Mystic River"" tells the story of three childhood friends, Jimmy Markham (Penn), Dave Boyle (Robbins), and Sean Devine (Bacon) growing up in Boston. As the story begins Dave is abducted by two men posing as police officers, and is molested. Jumping to the present day, Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered, and the homicide detective investigating the case is Sean (Bacon). At the same time the very scarred and repressed Dave (Robbins) has a suspicious incident with a mugger that he confesses to his wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). Hence, boyhood friends are reunited as grown men who are somewhat broken. Jimmy, a drugstore owner, has apparent mob ties. Dave, who is now married with a son, is shell of a man. Sean has been estranged from his wife and son-- he does not know where they are. So Sean along with his partner Whitey Powers (Fishburne) must find Katie Markham's murderer in a case that seems inherently linked to the past.This is by definition a difficult story to tell, and Eastwood keeps us enthralled and moves us. The intensity of the movie comes from its simplicity and eloquence. Its power derives from Eastwood's use of silence, and his confidence in his actors' mastery of listening. Sean Penn as Jimmy is absolutely powerful. There is a scene in the movie where he cries about his daughter with Robbins's Dave that is electrifying. Jimmy is clearly the marquee role. Penn should deservedly receive an Oscar nomination, and even perhaps win. Though Kevin Bacon's performance as Sean, the less showy of the lead characters, is simply stunning. It is great to be reminded what a powerful actor Kevin Bacon is. You never catch him acting-- he is just being. As Sean he is doing his best, solving a murder case while completing his past and his present. Bacon possesses a quiet power, and restrained vulnerability. In a scene near the end, Sean just listens and does not say a word, and it is haunting. We are watching an actor who is truly generating and creating art. Tim Robbins as Dave gives a heart-felt performance as broken man clumsily regaining his nobility.""Mystic River"" is a rough journey, and it ends surprisingly quietly. I guess much like Wordsworth said in ""The Prelude"" that we can never return to innocence, it's just life. And it goes on. ""Mystic River"" is one the year's best. Clint Eastwood, and writer Brian Helgeland along with Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins show that when you have a master director, a solid story, and the best actors around you have art. And props to Clint for demonstrating that simplicity is an element of mastery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Beautiful,"There is no doubt in the fact Clint Eastwood is slowly rising from an actor in Westerns to the director of some of the most powerful films made. First, Eastwood made Unforgiven, which was praised by viewers and critics everywhere. It was a good thing Eastwood was able to follow it up.Sure, Mystic River may have been at least a decade past Unforgiven, but it is still a masterpiece cinema.After a misfortune happened in their childhood, three boys: Sean, Dave and Jimmy are separated from each other. Dave becomes the victim of child molestation, and grows up being paranoid. Sean grows up to be a detective. Jimmy grows up to have a daughter. After Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean is on the case, and suspects Dave.Here is a warning for all you viewers who are ready to watch it. Mystic River is not a light film. Mystic River is a dark tragedy about murder, paranoia and suspicion. Even the scenery has a dark a feel to it. It looks like the cameraman put something dark over the lens to make the scenery seem more gray. The characters all talk very quietly most of the time (put on captions if you can) and all have childhood secrets hidden in them.Sean, Jimmy and Dave are all well-crafted and deep characters. That's a necessary addition to this film.Sean, Dave and Jimmy slowly learn to mistrust each other and the outcome is dramatic and tragic. The darkness slowly embraces you, and let you get a feel for the film. It takes the tragedy of a single death, and lets it cause a whole lot of pain and trouble. Mystic River will move you, and will keep you watching until the very end.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I truly wanted to like it.,"This is my first written review on IMDb ever, I didn't want to write it, as I never do, but this deserves it. This movie disappointed me a lot. I was expecting too much of it, I think.Turns out, this was a very poorly written screenplay, incredibly bad directed acting. I'm in shock at knowing it got two Oscars for acting. I mean, no fault to the actors, they did as the script and directing told them to, they had the potential to be amazing. Sean Penn really dedicates himslef for this role, as well as Tim Robins. Kevin Bacon was very good as well, in my opinion, the best actor in this movie, just because he was the most believable. But, oh man, Eastwood didn't direct that acting at all. The script really didn't help either, it actually screwed everything. The dialogues are very poorly built, it very badly explores the characters past, without setting up an emotional bonding beween them and the viewers. I didn't care about anything happening on screen. The characters were dull, shallow, but had the potential of being amazing. That's the difference: the story had a good concept and skeleton to be worked on, but the screenplay completely blew it. The progression of incidents throughout the movie is incredibly bad, so awfully told. If this had a solid script, I mean, it could be a three hour long movie, no problems, a script that cared about shaping properly these characters' past, taking its time to give details on how it influenced the future we perceive, an actually misterious plot, that didn't induce you to jumping to obvious conclusions, if it cared about telling the stories of the many different characters that just serve as puppets to the narrative and are in no way explored, but, at the same time, are huge pieces of the storytelling, and only if it was directed by either Scorsese or David Fincher (the two directors I kept thinking would make this a directorial masterpiece), this would definitely get a ten.I'm truly disappointed. This could have been an incredible film. It wasn't.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perhaps Eastwood's best as a producer/director.,"Clint Eastwood uses his trademarked helicopter shots better then he ever has in Mystic River, and their meaning has extra portent here: God watches over us all, but is ironically not always present.  Easily the director's best work since 1992's Unforgiven, it asks a parade of important questions about fate, which make it perfect movie-material, since films are all about, in Lars Von Trier's words, `the God's-eye-view.'  Shot by Tom Stern in a burnished, nostalgic style that, even in its mostly present-day sequences, suggests that its characters are permanently mired down by the past, it begins with young Boston punk Jimmy Markum enticing his buddies Dave and Sean into scratching their names into freshly-poured cement.  Dave is the last to print, but before he's done, he'll be lured by fear and insecurity into a car ride that changes his life for the worse.Suddenly, before the horror of this situation fully sinks in, we're vaulted thirty years later into the boys' adult lives.   Jimmy (Sean Penn), hair streaked gray and skin prison-weathered, is now the owner of a corner store, a longtime widower of a woman who bore him one daughter, Katie (Emily Rossum), then promptly died of cancer before she could see her husband free from a liquor store robbery rap.  Now remarried to Annabeth (a tough Laura Linney), and with a new passel of children, Jimmy seems to have found equilibrium in his life.  Meanwhile, Dave (Tim Robbins) is the haunted father of a boy who himself carries the weight of Dave's troubled past, who can't find the joy in simply playing baseball because he feels that his failures weigh on his dad even further.   Dave is now married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), a shell-shocked housewife who dances as fast as she can to keep up with Dave's neuroses, but is soon to be overcome by an event that tests her faith in her husband's sanity.The third in the triumvirate, Sean (Kevin Bacon), along with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne, excellent as the film's one detached, reasonable character), is called out to a Boston crime scene.   Sean has long since lost contact with his old friends, but the past is constantly hectoring him. Bedeviled by a damaged wife who ran away with their child and makes silent long-distance phone calls to her emotionally needy but distant husband (in the film's one overly-sentimental device), Sean has thrown himself wholly into his detective work as a way of forgetting all he's been through. When he and Whitey are called into his old neighborhood, Buckingham Flats, on a murder investigation, Sean knows this can't be good; Bacon's face shows the gravity of a life lived experiencing death in a myriad of forms.Thus begins an overcast story that mirrors Unforgiven in profound ways. Whereas the Oscar-winning western explored the mercenary past of perpetrators who are constantly lying to each other and themselves, Mystic River takes the more difficult road in examining the indefensible crimes of victims: the crime of making wrong choices, of not fighting back, of not taking a stand and following long-held faiths in gods and loved ones. Because of this, Mystic River is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, a whooshing, screaming peer into the lycanthropic existence of nightcrawlers who've been bitten by violence and betrayal.Certainly the centerpiece of the film is a scene between Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden, where Dave's demons come raring to the surface in a room illuminated only by the flickering image of a horror film on the television. Robbin's eyes burn through the screen as he brings us into Dave's firefly-ridden world of werewolves, vampires, and aliens.   The allegory is quite apt, and heartbreaking, just as the stories of such horror characters often are; once infected, victims like Dave only have to wait for the soul's full moon before they are once again transformed into a monster that knows not what he or she does.  Robbins' performance is a standout in his career, and certainly marks him as the frontrunner for a slew of yearend awards. He is tortured, panicked, darkened, confused, and dead inside.  Harden, too, stands out in this cast, with a character that's buffeted between truth and fiction, between perceived loyalty to a husband she's starting to mistrust, and a larger morality that demands she do the right thing, even if it might be the wrong thing.Eastwood is lucky to have Stern's shadowy yet sun-drenched photography at his disposal-it makes Mystic River into a sullen tone poem.   Eastwood's longtime collaborators also make essential contributions:  Joel Cox's editing is tensely precise, particularly in the film's final third; production designer extraordinaire Henry Bumstead (whose credits, incredibly, include Vertigo, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Sting, and Slaughterhouse-Five) produces a Boston that is palpably real, and closing in on its inhabitants; and composer Lennie Niehaus, who takes second billing to Eastwood for the (mostly) subtle, piano-driven score that hardly ever pushes our buttons.  And we must pay tribute to Brian Helgeland's driven script, his best since his dealings with Curtis Hanson on L.A. Confidential. Working from novelist Dennis Lehane's best-selling source material, he and Eastwood have fleshed out an intimate, tasteful, cynical look at those who let themselves be whisked away and ruined by wickedness, and those follow but refuse to feel bad about it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Cinematic Achievement of the Grandest Scale,"The argument could be made that Penn's performance is a little over the top but at the same time can you remember a scene as powerful as the one in the park where he finds out his daughter is dead and has to be restrained. He absolutely commands the screen, he is a man among boys and he knows it. Unless your heart is made of rock it is impossible not to be moved by this story. That's what makes it so beautiful is that it's just a story about people and the dark side that can sometimes come out. We hear stories like this all the time and it never really registers with us that these events do happen and they have devastating effects on the individuals involved. This film brings that home.

"Awful, awful movie","Overwrought, pointlessly stylistic, and really really bad. No matter how hard I try I can not think of one positive comment to make about this movie.

The second hand begins to roll along and promises that maybe something interesting will be revealed, but as the movie hits its climax you realize it has nothing to offer. At best it is a good portrayal of a particular kind of neighborhood and family life that may be fading.The interesting thing is that very good actors are sunk by the script or the direction.

Is it a movie about child abuse, a movie about husbands and wives, a movie about a father's love to his daughter, a movie about violence? All these pretty extreme topics are introduced and not one of them is resolved in the end - the audience is left with a huge pile of unresolved themes.This movie is highly overrated, and the only reason for that is the very talented group of actors who really struggle to give this River a flow - without any success.This is where bad directing comes in - Here's a hollywood icon that puts a very epic- like score into a film that wants to be independent. He fills it up with several themes, shoots scenes that are so unnecessary, not even a film student would make such mistakes (Paraphrase: Penn: I know you death has something to do with my past but I don't know what it is).

The Best Film of 2003,"""Mystic River"" is one of those magical cinematic moments--such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Casablanca""--where story, screenplay, director and actors combine to make a film that is truly perfect.  Clint Eastwood's direction has never been better, and Oscar nominees Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden all turn in the finest performances of their respective careers.The story begins in 1976, when three 12-year-old boys--Jimmy, Sean and Dave--are writing their names in wet concrete when a middle-aged man flashing an official-looking badge steps out of an official-looking Ford LTD and tells the kids to stop.  The man learns that Jimmy & Sean live on the block, but Dave doesn't, so he tells Dave to get into the car and he will drive Dave home.  Only the man doesn't drive Dave home because the man is not really a cop.  He is a pedophile who--along with his partner--keeps Dave locked in a basement for four days while they have their way with him.  On the fourth day, Dave escapes.The story flashes forward to 2001.  The boys are now 37.Jimmy (Penn) is now an ex-con (the extent of his criminality is not revealed until the end of the film) who runs a convenience store.  He has three daughters: two by his current wife Anabeth (Laura Linney), and 19-year-old Katie (Emmy Rossum) by his dead first wife.  Jimmy makes no secret that Katie is the favorite daughter.Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide detective with the Massachusetts State Police whose wife (who does not appear until the end of the film) has left him and moved to New York, where she has given birth to Sean's baby, who he has never seen.Dave (Robbins) has grown into a deeply damaged adult who walks around the neighborhood, staring into space and talking to himself.  He is married to Jimmy's cousin Celeste (Harden), and they have an 8-year-old son Michael (Cayden Boyd).The trouble begins when Dave comes home and Celeste finds him covered in blood & refusing to go to the hospital.  The next day she learns that Katie has been murdered.  Sean and his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) are called to investigate.  And Jimmy--not content to let the police handle the case--asks his ex-partners in crime, the symbolically named Savage brothers (Kevin Chapman and Adam Nelson), to find Katie's murderer so Jimmy can kill him.What I really like is that--unlike the usual murder mystery--the focus is not on the investigation.  The few scenes concerning the police work are pretty much cribbed from ""Law & Order"".  Eastwood is more concerned about how such a thing affects the victim's loved ones.  In particular, the focus is on Jimmy--and to a lesser extent, his relationship with Dave.A few words must be said here about Sean Penn's performance.  About once a decade a truly magnificent performance is filmed that changes the art of acting forever.  In the '40's it was Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"".  In the '50's it was Marlon Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".  In the '60's it was Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"".  In the '70's it was Robert De Niro in ""Taxi Driver"".  In the '90's it was Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  And for this decade it is Sean Penn in ""Mystic River"".  Jimmy is at turns overwrought, depressed, surly, outraged, and finally just plain scary.  But Penn--even at his least subtle--never hits a wrong note.  His performance is the best thing about a nearly perfect movie.There might be a few quibbles here and there.  As I said, the scenes of police work seem merely routine; and Penn and Robbins both look a good deal older than 37.  But those pale in comparison to the film's strengths.  I liked the device of Dave being victimized each time he rides in the back of a car.  And the dialog written for Dave and the other character's dialog about Dave is almost poetic.  And Eastwood's sure hand as a director--particularly his expressionistic use of people in shadow rather than full light--show that, contrary to reviews of his work of the last 5 or 6 years, his talent has not dried up by a long shot.""Mystic River"" is up for multiple Oscars this year and it deserves nearly all of them.

Non-mystic dissappointment,"The movie drags, the plot line makes no sense,and even though the acting was above par, the casting was abysmal. Unfortunately, these are the highlights of Mystic River. I came away totally confused by a simplistic (we figured out who done it about 20 minutes into the movie) and moving target of a plot. The correlations presented as clues to the plot were poorly placed and lacked continuity.Penn, Bacon and Robbins as three childhood buddies who went their separate ways after Robbins abduction and sexual assault and whose paths conveniently cross as a result of Penn's daughters murder is weak at best and unconvincing at worst. It's just too convenient to be coincidental.

Fantastic,"Mystic River is a fantastic movie. It's a very untraditional American film, and has the European movie spirit. The acting is especially good.

haunted memory,"This picture was not what I expected at all. It was much more. The more I got into it, the more I fell into it. I think it's going to stay with me a long time. In this film, at least for me, it brings back dark memories of childhood that haunt one. It's a very visceral film, almost Jungian in it's approach.I'd recommend it to anyone mature enough to handle it. Another resounding success from Clint Eastwood and my congratulations to the actors and the whole crew, and of course, the writer Denis Lehane with such an in depth look into the shadows we all harbor. I see he has worked with abused children. This to is part of my job. The pain of it all comes through so clearly in this superb psycho drama which is so absorbing and repulsive at the same time.

Heartbreaking tale,"Clint Eastwood serves up my favorite film of 2003.  Heartbreaking and full of stunning performances.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are particularly amazing.  Hollywood has given up on making classic human ""dramas"" and this film draws me back to a time when more films like this one were made.Eastwood's use of classic themes mixed into a story of the damage caused by the abuse of a child is massive and at once groundbreaking and an ode to the types of important films I wished American audiences could be treated to more often.  Real stories about real people rather than the cartoon characters that film our screens weekly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Best Movie of All TIme,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. The characters, the plot, the sub-characters, and sub-plots all fit together perfect. I also read the book, and the movie tells the story just as good if not better. Sean Penn's performance in this movie was flawless, and I believe the Oscar was deserved. The complex story is so emotional, and really hits deep within the soul. To me everything in the movie was justified, and was done with emotion. This will go down as one of the best movies of all time. I also believe it was robbed of the best picture Oscar. The performances really carried the movie, but this emotional roller-coaster will always be with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dramatic,"I am surprised how deep the characters are developed in this psychological thriller. Especially the role of Tim Robbins took a very dramatic end. I hoped that some things wouldn´t happen but my fears came true. It is not a fast paced thriller but the story creates step by step suspense until the end. I learned from that film that sometimes our prejudices could be wrong and that we have to accept and to respect every person. I think this is the message in this movie. I missed some mystery as the name of the film is titled. Anyway, it shows us that we have to protect our children better from criminality or pedophiles. All in all a great film and two Oscars to Sean Penn and Tom Robbins that they really earned. See it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"great acting by Penn, convoluted plot with too many loose ends","Great acting makes this movie.  Penn and Robbins are just great.  Bacon is well.... bacon.(but we can still play 5 degrees of separation).  I have not read the book but can only imagine that the book was much better than the movie.  I understand Eastwood wanted to do the movie because of the complexity of each character.  Duely noted.  I am sure the book clearly develops each character and clearly examines the plot. Unfortunately the plot in the movie is too convoluted and leaves too many loose ends.  As the movie fades to black we are still left wondering about Bacon's character and his marriage.  So as not to spoil the movie I will stay rather vague, but the murder plotline is really weak.  All and all a good movie (7/10).  I guess Eastwood can be forgiven for his ""Unforgiven"" plot.  Penn should get an Oscar nom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Not Bad, But Overrated","If I had just come across this movie on TV, I probably would have liked it. But with all the Oscar buzz and four-star reviews I expected something better. The story is about three guys in Boston: Dave, Sean, and Jimmy. They were best friends until about the age of 12, when Dave (who grows up to be Tim Robbins) was kidnapped by pedophiles masking as cops. This, I thought, was the best part of the movie. Sadly it's the first few minutes.Cut to 25 years later, when Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter is murdered. Dave, who despite having a wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and son is still in a regressed state from his horrific childhood experience, begins to attract his wife's suspicion. He shows up after the murder with blood on his clothes, claiming to have fought off a mugger. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has become a cop and of course is assigned to the case. The main suspect, besides Robbins, is the murdered girl's boyfriend (Tom Guiry). But Sean's partner ""Whitey"" (Laurence Fishburne) starts to look suspiciously at Dave instead.There's all sorts of other stuff too; mob connections and old grudges and, believe it or not, a couple of mute characters. Too long to explain here. As for the acting: Penn is very good at parts and terribly over the top in others. Watch him react to his daughter's death and see if he doesn't remind you of his retarded character in ""I Am Sam."" Robbins mostly does well, but overacts at times. He gives a good sense of Dave's arrested development, except where the script requires him to be suddenly cunning or insightful. Bacon and Fishburne both do good subtle work with trite ""cop buddy movie"" dialogue. Harden is moving at times but too one-note. Guiry does well, especially towards the end.The biggest waste is Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, the murdered girl's stepmother. She is barely in the film until the end, when she makes a big Lady Macbeth-like speech. I hope the screenwriter, Brian Helgeland, didn't see that as a subtle allusion. Eastwood does a good job with setting and pacing, but could have directed his actors better.There were several moments here that clearly weren't intended to be funny, but provoked a fair amount of laughter in the theatre. Be forewarned: if someone's making a moral decision in this film, you can bet there's a cross nearby. It's that kind of picture.Conclusion: It might be worth seeing, but wait for video. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I felt sorry for Tim Robbins' character and I felt Sean Penn played himself again, so no surprises there.

Almost had me and then boom,"Just saw it last night and thought it was worth the investment of time until the end of the Bacon/Penn curb-side scene. I haven't looked at others' posts but for me, the POV shot of the car pulling away down the street with the young Tim Robins character looking out the back window just completely blew a heretofore enjoyable film. The whole emotional tone shifted sideways in an unpleasant way and everything after that came off like a studio add-on to neatly wrap everything up with a bow. Didn't need Laura Linney doing Lady Macbeth, didn't need the parade scene (although I'll grant that it did add in the sense of showing the isolation and desperation of Marcia Gay Harden's character).Everything could have been wrapped up in an emotionally satisfying way with Kevin Bacon driving off with his suppressed suspicions of his childhood friend and Sean Penn to deal with his actions.It's like someone at the studio put a gun to Eastwood's and Cox's head and said ""you're going to add this because I don't get the ending"".I'm normally forgiving of films but this one disappointed me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A possible great film but comes up short,"This movie what it takes to be a great film but comes up slightly short. The acting was for the most part great. Sean Penn does a great job with the exceptions of a few scenes where he overdoes it. Tim Robbins is back on the top of his game (reminds me of his performance in Jacob's Ladder). And Kevin Bacon well he is the same as he was in `Wild Things' ... Ok but not great. The supporting cast for the most part did an excellent job. Fishburne acted well but not great. And the kids didn't mess up the film with terrible acting either (always a plus).What are the shortcomings of this film? Simply put: it could have been adapted from the book much better. The movie is about 2.5 hours. Yet, the movies would have to be at least 3.5 hours long to correctly cover all of the points it attempted to hit. They should have dropped certain elements that they tried to touch on and focused more on the necessary ones. On a last note the ending could have been better. Much better. It wasn't terrible, but definitely not good.Recommended to all drama fans.

Strong story but overall lacking bite,"Directed by Clint Eastwood, Mystic River is about the murder of a teenage girl, and the hunt to find her killer. An all-star cast of Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishbourne and Sean Penn appear in this one, with a good selection of character actors also featured. Consequently the performances are universally extremely good, and mutual respect is going on with no one attempting to upstage anyone else - no egos on display here. The story is good, with decent enough plot progression which does start to plod a little in the middle but which does enough to keep you interested. The main problem with this movie is Eastwood's direction, which is really very bland. The cinematography is very insipid, and there are a few aerial shots which seem contrived and unnecessary. The general look of the film is a bit uninspiring. Eastwood needs to develop his own style rather than being so generic.Overall it's a decent enough story, but lacks killer punch due to a combination of the plod in the middle and Eastwood's direction. Not as magnificent as we've been led to believe, but worthy nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A disturbing and suspenseful emotional journey - amongst Eastwood's best,"Some people lock their bad memories deeply inside their minds so that they don't come across them again. They have erased truths to live without worries. They have closed the doors of their traumas and thrown them to the bottom of a river. But it is useless because sooner or later, something, no matter how small it may seem, will bring them to the surface and re-open those memories.In ""Mystic River"" based on the novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted by Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential), Clint Eastwood establishes the camera as the key to those secrets and the characters as the victims of its unlocking. The characters are three childhood friends. Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) whose relationship broke after the brief kidnapping of one of them - Dave. But now, 25 years later, their lives cross again after another horrible incident: the murder of Jimmy's daughter.Brendan (Thomas Guiry), a boy Jimmy does not approve of and wanted to run away with his daughter is a suspect. But so is Dave who came home the night of the murder covered in blood and was somewhat hysterical in the presence of his wife (Marcia Gay Harden). Sean, alongside Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are assigned to the case. We remember that the three were once childhood friends shaken by that tragic event that lead to the decline of their friendship and now a similar things threatens to to so once again. Sean, returning to his childhood place, must face situations he never knew and emotions he pretends never existed.Jimmy vows to kill his daughter's assassin hiring some neighbourhood criminals to help him in the investigation. Then there is Whitey who thinks that Daqve is obviously guilty after all, everything seems to point in that direction. But Sean is unwilling to suspect a childhood friend.At the centre of ""Mystic River"" is the idea that many things that occur in the past do not always vanish with the passage of time. Every act has a big price that can pursue you for good. If the innocence and dreams from childhood are violently shaken the affected individuals may never be cured because traumas can be hidden inside victims even though they ignore it. But does everything count if it serves as a base to hide all the wounds? Every friend has to show his support and hope because in an atmosphere united with the similar sad objective, there is no room for doubts. But if one member (or friend) questions the honesty or truth of the others, probably the group of friends will be wounded to death (not literally).But ""Mystic River"" is not only a thriller about men dominated by their past or shaking their heads in disbelief due to their destinies. No, that is to simplistic. This is a character study of the highest order. A brutal analysis in the dissection of tragedy. A film about the importance of the devotion of wives. An emotional puzzle that goes along with the plot only to later throw away all the pieces. A study of innocence, guilt, revenge, paranoia and forgiveness. A film engulfed in incredible tension and sadness. In terms of its moral lesson, ""Mystic River"" is more cautious than ""Unforgiven"" and in terms of drama on par (or even above) with ""The Bridges of Madison County."" I'm not sure where I would rank ""Mystic River"" amongst Eastwood's other masterpieces but I no for certain he has never united a better cast nor produced more powerful performances. Sean Penn is so intimately violent, angered yet undeniably touching. Tim Robbins transmits all the hopelessness and pain of Dave ad Kevin Bacon, in the best performance I can remember from him, attains the balance and coldness Sean needs to become the judge between his two friends (Dave and Sean). The female performances are also wonderful.The title ""Mystic River"" says it all. Although Mystic is a river that passes through Boston, the title is a metaphor of the film's emotional journey. Even though we arrive at a conclusion, the film is about the emotional journey we experience with the deeply fractured characters. With the simple yet commonly ignored idea that films should use real human emotions and take time to reveal the characters, Eastwood has created an elegant but disturbing notion of human nature that is fiercely ironic, filled with frustrations and regrets. When you leave the theatre feeling pain somewhere without knowing why and where don't worry, that is exactly the state you are meant to be in; a bit like the characters.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Brilliant Rage,"Perhaps Mel Gibson should be crying foul at all the negative attention he's gotten when he can easily point to Clint Eastwood's `Mystic River' as a film with perhaps a dimmer view of a religious culture, this one Catholicism. Expertly using a variety of sacred icons, Eastwood's harrowing tale (based on a Dennis Lehane novel, unread) of the interaction between three childhood friends who cross paths after the murder of one of their children finds its true culprit in the systematic repression and abuse of children and women by their faith. Perhaps unsettled by current events, Eastwood, through Tom Stern's careful cinematography, can barely conceal his rage: the gliding camera consistently pans upwards to the sky, seemingly searching for answers but coming to the conclusion that love in the Catholic Church has been perverted into cruelty and discrimination (presided over by an indifferent God). Usually Eastwood the director exerts direct control over his emotions but here it's impossible not to be aware of the moral revulsion of a man shaken of his convictions and his anguish as he reacts to the world around him. The performances are nothing short of astounding: as the grieving, vengeful father of a murdered daughter, Sean Penn is alternately moving and terrifying and delivers an emotionally thorough performance; Tim Robbins, as the abused child grown into a shattered adult--and the instant natural suspect--abandons his usual smugness and, by deliberately underplaying, galvanizes; and Kevin Bacon, the friend who has become the detective on the case, is intelligent and complicated as a man haunted by memories of a childhood altered by a single, horrifying act and how that act has affected his ability to connect with the wife who has left him; the women, played flawlessly by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, represent both extremes of where their faith has relegated them, with Harden rejected by it and Linney brainwashed by its male supremacy. The script by Brian Helgeland is a model of concision. A masterpiece--perhaps, when all is said and done, this decade's most potent commentary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Highly Watchable Movie On The Human Condition.,"This movie has really restored my faith in 'Mainstream' American movies. After a decade of some really bad movies winning Oscars and being Hyped as good film, it is refreshing to watch a movie that respects an audience as adults with a concentration span of longer than 15 minutes. A story that engrosses from the start and can let the individual make their own interpretation of a motion picture. Like sculpture or any art form it is lovely to be allowed to form one's opinion without some 'Exec' wanting everybody with views as bland as themselves. Art should encourage debate and Mystic River caused my girlfriend and I to agree on some points and disagree on others. So enjoyable to discuss the more subtle aspects of movie making. Well, back to the movie. What were people thinking giving The Two Towers Oscar for best movie? I think in fairness it was a visual triumph, but does this not have more to do with the availability of CGI rather than the true vision of directing? John Ford and Huston both would have turned in their respective graves. I mention these men as I feel they were true storytellers. Clint Eastwood extracts wonderful performances from all the cast. Both Oscar winners are tremendous and I felt Penn gave a thoughtful, intense performance similar to that of the very underrated 'State Of Grace'. The same compliment can be given to Tim Robbins also and Kevin Bacon impressed as he usually does. Particulary good I thought was Laurence Fishbourne as the cynical cop who gives a beautifully understated performance when less actually means more. Not since 'In The Bedroom' have I seen such a thoughtful well put together piece of film. Congrats to all involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A river runs through it?,"Mystic River is slow and clunky to say the least - it moves with grandeur but at a snail's pace and really only delivers in the acting department. Sean Penn is excellent, as is Tim Robbins, whereas as everyone else seems to be putting in an appearance to earn the cheque at the end of the day.It's saved from being a predictable film by the level of acting. Even when you know what's ahead you're pretty much engrossed by some emotional bludgeoning from some character or other. The underlying tension - the events, unshockingly portrayed at the beginning of the film, slowly burn inside of Tim Robin's head but we never really get to sample the uncertainty he holds within. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the messed-up nature of the character but it simply comes across as confused.The end is strange too - as if it was added to please someone - and it really gives nothing to the previous events. A worthy film that says more about family ties and laying ghosts to rest than any other subject matter it may have thought it was explaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""Maybe some day you forget what it's like to be human and maybe then, it's OK. "" - Dave Boyle","# 2 Film of 2003Mystic River' was one of those films where I was really excited about it, but also afraid about it. You see, prior to 'Mystic River' Clint Eastwood hasn't made a decent film in six years. He's a tremendously talented film director (he's very multi-talented too - he directs, produces, performs the musical score and sometimes even acts in his movies), but 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil', 'True Crime', 'Space Cowboys' and 'Blood Work' all flopped impetuously. Even 1997's 'Absolute Power' wasn't anything great (it was good, nothing to hand out any kind of award for, though.) Eastwood's new film featured remarkably talented actors like Sean Penn (Oscar Nominee), Tim Robbins (Oscar Nominee), Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden (Oscar Winner), Laura Linney (Oscar Nominee) and Laurence Fishburne (Oscar Nominee). It was even based on a great novel, and the screenplay was written by Academy Award Winning screenwriter, Brian Helgeland, but still I had my skepticism. Well, I can tell you that 'Mystic River' was not only a masterpiece, it's one of the best films ever made.The film, adapted from Dennis Lehane's praiseworthy dramatic novel by the same name, follows three childhood friends, Jimmy Markum, Dave Boyle and Sean Devine. One normal gloomy Boston afternoon the boys are playing a game of street hockey and are stopped by two local cops (one of which played by The Wire's John Doman  a show in which Dennis Lehane writes for). The cops badger the boys and eventually take Dave off in the car. Sean and Jimmy tell their parents, and later it is known that the two were es who molested Dave. Dave managed to escape the dark and creepy basement in the middle of the woods where the two es were keeping him, and make it home. After that day, Dave was emotionally scarred and drifted apart from his friends Jimmy and Sean. Eighteen years later, Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a hardened ex-con who owns and runs the local convenience market and is married to a tough broad, Annabeth (Laura Linney), Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective with the Boston police department, and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker with a wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and a son (Cayden Boyd). The three have drifted far apart, when the of Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum  The Phantom of the Opera) brings them all together, with Sean leading the investigation with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) and Dave being unfortunately a prime suspect. The non-stop emotional roller-coaster that is 'Mystic River' begins.First of all, Clint Eastwood does an unquestionably superlative job directing this masterfully crafted slice of cinema heaven. Eastwood provides us with an authentic, vivacious and experienced vision, making 'Mystic River' his finest achievement yet. Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) provides an Oscar worthy screenplay with rich character development and some of the finest dialogue film has ever seen. The acting is also extraordinary in 'Mystic River', with not two, but three actors giving the best performances of their career. Sean Penn plays his character with such indignation, frustration and raging emotion it stands as one of the ten best screen performances of all time. Tim Robbins is almost equally as brilliant in his greatest performance to date, as the conflicted, haunted soul that is Dave Boyle, while Marcia Gay Harden (also in the best performance of her career) is nothing short of meritorious as Dave's concerned wife. Kevin Bacon is almost faultless, Laura Linney never ceases to impress with her very limited screen time, and Laurence Fishburne is rock solid as Sean Devine's clever partner, Whitey. 'Mystic River' also features a haunting yet beautiful musical score (composed by none other then Clint himself) and a very powerful ending that will no doubt choke you up.The picture may drag a little bit towards the middle, but the film very much plays like a splice of life in that it is not always fair, not always climatic and never, ever sappy. Like '21 Grams', 'Mystic River' is a very realistic picture when relating to real life, but it's not quite as dark as '21 Grams', neither as jumbled (which in this case is definitely a positive thing.)

Mystic River: I give it a 7 out of 10.,"Mystic RiverMystic River is a psychological thriller that looks at a murder case from the points of view of three main characters: Sean (Kevin Bacon) a cop, trying to solve the case, Jimmy (Sean Penn), the father of the victim, and Dave (Tim Robins), an old friend of the two who might be hiding something about the murder. The movie begins by showing us those three characters when they were kids playing street hockey on the street, followed by an event that will change Dave's life forever. It is due to the distress this event has brought upon on Dave's character that will later draw suspicions on him about the murder. When we are brought back to present time, we see that Jimmy is running a grocery store and has a daughter; Dave is also married and has a kid. After the murder, we are introduced to present-time Sean, who is the investigator on the case.Mystic River succeeds in keeping the audience guessing until the end while questioning the concepts of prejudice, justice and karma. Jimmy's insistence on taking the matters into his own hands to punish the killer reveals his aggressive side which, combined with his obstinate prejudice and criminal tendency, makes us gradually lose our sympathy for him despite the tragedy. Jimmy's first suspect is her daughter's secret boyfriend, son of Just Ray, with whom Jimmy had a feud with in his criminal past. But our attention quickly turns to Dave as his alleged story about the confrontation with the mugger at the night of the murder looks less credible due to his deeply troubled and disturbed character. Instead of feeling sorry for Jimmy, who lost his daughter, we find ourselves feeling sorry for Dave who might have something to do with the murder.The first thing that stands out about `Mystic River' is the Oscar-caliber performances of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Performances of Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney are also worth mentioning. Second thing that caught my attention was that it rightly gives you the feeling that is adapted from a powerful book. Clint Eastwood does a good job of directing but it is not his directing that makes the movie work. It is the performances of the actors and the strength of the book the movie is based on that makes it work.Having said that, I also must say that there are some parts of the movie which, in my opinion, do not work as well as they are intended to. The phone calls from Sean's wife fail to rouse any feeling, probably due to the fact that we are not familiar enough with both characters or the nature of their dispute. It might have been better if the introduction (act 1) of the movie were stretched just a little longer to give us some familiarity with all of the characters. Instead, most attention is given to the act 2, the investigation. However, what bothered me the most was the Sean's reaction to the revelation by Jimmy in the end because it appeared to be in conflict with the portrayal of his character. I guess the signals were there during the interrogation scenes, where Sean played the `good cop' for his friend Dave, but the bad cop for the boyfriend, that Sean was moved by his emotions. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to not carry out his duties like a rational police officer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A+ film,"I sat down this afternoon when Madison was asleep to watch a movie. Morgan was out playing and Amy was at work. I was bored. I could have logged onto my National University class and done my stupid responses to other people's posts, but I didn't feel like it (I still gotta do it by midnight though).I have had the DVD for Mystic River for a week or so. I kept putting it off because I thought it was some ""acting"" movie. You know the ones. The ones that everyone says was acted well but nobody ever says anything about the plot. Acting is secondary, if you ask me. A good movie will be helped by good acting, and most good movies are still pretty good even with bad acting. But bad movies are still bad, even with good acting.So I popped in Mystic River. I didn't even know what it was about before it began. I was hooked from the start.This movie was never dumb. All the characters acted in the way they were supposed to at all times. And it looked like real life, in every way. Every pretense flowed into the next and was thought-provoking and rich with meaning. Yet it did not tell you what to feel. The clues and motives naturally allowed your mind to fill it in. This movie was simple yet never seemed to think the audience a dummy. Yeah, and the acting was good. All the top stars turned in great performances.Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job too. This movie could have been screwed up. This movie could have just been some B movie flop, even with the grade A talent. It seemed to me that Eastwood could have directed my ninth graders into a fine movie with this one. So this is a case where good acting helped an already good movie.As I sit here staring at the screen, I want to say more about it. But I can't. I honestly see now why I didn't know what the movie was about: no one wanted to spoil it for me. I want to talk about the way the twisting plot twisted me, but that would give too much away.A+ film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This horrible film hits harder than a hammer to the forehead. Definitely a shattering experience.,"Clint Eastwood has crafted a truly sinister masterpiece. What he has done here is that he not only took the time to develop a very involving and emotional film about childhood trauma and how it can truly screw up a person's life, but has also made a very engaging murder mystery with a lot of horror, suspense, and great dialogue. This is a film, not only about friendship and loyalty, but also paranoia, love, suspicion, and the perils of vigilante justice. The story just draws the viewer in like a good novel. The viewer just doesn't know how the story will play out and what kind of direction it will go in. As a result, when the characters really start showing what they are capable of, the viewer will be shocked by the outcome of it all. The ending to the film will most likely get to many viewers. In truth, it made me want to rip my hair out by the sickening nature of it. However, the viewer should have been aware that it wasn't going to be a pleasant film watching experience from the beginning. Sure, the result of the story is upsetting and gross, but at least it didn't lie to us. It is an honest, effective, and thought provoking film. It's one of the most uncommonly effective films I've seen in years. When I think about how all these characters came to such a conclusion, I understood what the purpose of it all was. In return for watching this, I was told a great story that was involving and unfolded in a really unique way.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dirty Harry the Director,"I thought Mystic River was just OK.  I'm fine with the message and the metaphors to inspire thinking, but when the movie is over-exaggerated and relies on shock and violence to carry it's point, it seems like a simple vehicle rather than art.  Clint Eastwood directs like Dirty Harry; he crashes his car through the front window of your house, when a subtle peek through the curtains would have been more powerful.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
How can there be so many stupid moviegoers?,"This is the question plaguing me after seeing the reviews posted here and on other message boards about this movie.  How did audiences get so stupid? When did character studies become too complicated for the average person to follow?Folks, this isn't a murder mystery.  This movie could have been about raising soybeans.  This movie is about PEOPLE.  What makes them good, what makes them bad, what makes them who they are, and how fallible human beings do stupid things that haunt them for the rest of their lives.  Good people do bad things, evil people live among us without being held accountable, bad guys don't get caught and there is no rhyme or reason for what happens in the world.The reason Larry Fishburne wanted to be in this film is probably because he wanted to be part of an experience that looks as though it was one of the more satisfying ones careerwise for just about everyone in it.  I agree, he is not used much, but it was nice to see him and Laura Linney even if it wasn't to great effect.Speaking of Laura Linney, her speech at the end is her attempt to justify her life and her place in it.  She judges her own cousin for her disloyalty instead of feeling anguish and compassion.  She is a woman who is committed to ignoring the sins of the past and of the present to protect her future. This is a theme throughout the film.  Many people have things in the past that bother them, and the film explores the consequences each person has to face--or chooses to ignore--because of what fate has visited upon them in their lives.This is a delicate, tiny film told in epic style in a very old-fashioned manner that credits YOU with having intelligence and patience.  Instead of whining that the ending is ambiguous, maybe take a minute and try to understand why the most deliberate and methodical of directors would choose to end the film in that way.  What is he trying to say?  That life is uncertain...that nothing is as it seems...that people are mysteries, that nothing can be taken for granted...it is a revelatory ending, in my opinion, completely perfect and utterly in keeping with the vagaries of the movie. You don't know what these people are going to do because they are REAL PEOPLE, not cardboard cutouts in a Hollywood studio executive's office being moved around to suit the plot.  This movie is a MIRACLE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie,"Mystic River was an amazing movie - it's possible that Clint Eastwood is better at directing than he is acting. The story line was great, the plot twists were incredible, and ""Mystic River"" was the most thrilling movie I've seen in a long time. The characters in this movie were realistic - which is much more than some movies these days... I honestly felt empathic toward these three men and their situations. I'm not really a fan of Sean Penn but he was truly superb in this film. While this story is somewhat disturbing - the tormented childhood, the bittersweet memories of a lost loved one, and all the other plot lines are touching... ""Mystic River"" is a sad, beautiful portrayal of the darkness in life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"it was ok, but over rated","This movie is not a bad movie at all, but at the same time it's not a great movie either.The problem I had with this movie it lags way too long. If the movie was done in quicker pace, I will probably give it a 7/10 or even an 8/10.The acting was good, but I don't think that Sean Penn deserve to win the Oscar for best actor (Johnny Depp was awesome in Pirates of the Caribbean). Sean Penn is a great actor, but he has done better work with movies in the past. Tim Robbins in the other hand, stole the show from Sean Penn, he did an outstanding job.This movie was ok, and the acting was done pretty well. But it was too long, and the movie was over rated, and I think it didn't deserve all the attention it got in the Oscars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Jon Monsarrat review:  murder interferes with serious drama,"Mystic River is a serious drama, where the murder is secondary and just serves as a plot device. Which makes me wonder, couldn't they have thought of a more everyday plot device? I mean, if you're aiming for realism, murder sort of knocks you out of the average person's experience. There are a few coincidences in the film that didn't make sense to me, and the ending didn't really tie it up.Despite all that, I have to admit it was an incredible film. Such acting! Really amazing, all around. Gripping, interesting, well-paced.Who should see Mystic River:-- Drama fans, definitely. Oh, and see Cutter's Way, too.-- Action flick guys like me who see the occasional drama, this one's safe but see it on a rainy day when you've nothing better to do.I'll give Mystic River a 7 out of 10, nearly an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic Movie with Outstanding Acting,"When I watched this movie, it turned out to be something I never expected it to be.  But that was the least of the things left in my mind, first and foremost the quality of acting in this film is outstanding.  Tim Robbins is unbelievable in his role as Dave and Sean Penn plays Jimmy very well too. However I do feel that Sean was better in the more recent 21 Grams.The movie is very well produced and structured, I really got into the story and the characters of Dave and Jimmy as well as the general murder mystery story.  I rate this movie very highly and recommend seeing it if not for its quality, then definately for Tim Robbins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Gulp... Wow?,"This movie shocked the hell out of me. The brutal realism combined with fabulous acting, make this movie one of the most memorable I have seen in a long time. The story is not pretty, and Eastwood makes no effort to sugar-coat anything, but this is what makes the movie so perfect. Mystic River will leave you in shock, but after you recover you will be deeply grateful that you saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
