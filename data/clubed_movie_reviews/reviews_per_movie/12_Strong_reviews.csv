B for effort - read the book!!!,"The book and story upon which this Hollywood flock is based is awesome, and even important. The movie is a fairly standard Hollywood-version military exercise, and I can't fully fault the production team or actors because they have to tell a big story in 2 hours about a major event that should be well known to Americans and Afghans alike, let alone the rest of the world. Plus, no one behind the special effects or acting or script or direction were there. Much like Lone Survivor it's a pretty decent depiction of a true story for a film production, but also much like Lone Survivor, I wish it had taken the source material a tad more seriously, and attached much more telling and brutal realism (like Saving Private Ryan and The Hurt Locker) in terms of mood and dialog and acting, and even equipment and battle scenes. I don't want a Tears Of The Sun fairy tale with my war movies. I want something that transports us there. More realistic tactics, weapons that fire and report realistically, bombs that aren't full of fireballs all the time, etc... All could have been done here. But many would have lost interest in the drama... It's been dumbed down, and 90% of the audience will have no idea.Maybe I demand too much, or am too picky, or just don't accept the ""average"" like ""average"" Americans who don't look any deeper at stuff like war other than action films and headlines. I feel like our veterans deserve better.Meanwhile, the negative reviews here are by folks who really have no idea what they're talking about, especially when they call it ""propaganda"". Politics produce propaganda. This is a story based on actual accounts...as in: it happened. Doesn't matter what your politics are. Read the book Horse Soldiers. Talk to more vets. Talk to some Afghani people who know a bit about their own country and the Taliban.This movie could have been WAY better, but it was sinply ""good"" as what we've come to expect from Hollywood most of the time. I think it was wasted on misguided and detached production values and sensationalism that can only be provided by limited knowledge and devotion. Had Spielberg made this flick? Might have been an all-time great. And I say MIGHT, because it would be almost impossible to bring the reality and education to the screen that the book was able to portray and provide, and the reality on the ground these men experienced. Why we settle for pop culture education on important matters and historical events as our ONLY education is beyond me. But it seems the American audience wouldn't know the difference if REALITY ran over them in the form of a stampede of horses with a team of US special forces and Afghan militia on their backs. So I guess there's no real hard done, right?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Much Better Than The Negative Reviews,"12 Strong is based on truth and it would seem that in itself goes a long way as it took until a decade later for this story to become known through the book on which it was based. Quite simply it deserves the big screen treatment as it was a first victory in a war which goes on as I write this. The heroism is off the charts as everything changed the minute the 12 dropped in. Importantly the movie gets this point across. If it often seems like a lunatic's gamble as the small group of 12 immediately were split due the lack of trust by the Northern Alliance's war lord. Again the movie pulls no Hollywood bombast in depicting this. It seems like even our supposed allies are so distrustful the operation is doomed. As far as the battle scenes go there's that suspicion it may have received some of the Hollywood action movie push. I say don't over analyze this as it gets the point across of how desperate the situation really was and how focused, disciplined, and well trained our brave 12 were. The bottom line is this is a good homage based on real events and that always hovers large. If it could have been better depicted I'm certainly not sure exactly how as the victory was near impossible and that is captured on film quite realistically. I have nothing but praise for these fearless 12 warriors and I'm proud their story is now displayed for all of us who they put it over the line for. See the film and don't pick it apart, rather, be proud there is another great generation and just be glad we have soldiers like these 12.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Decent retelling of a true story almost too good to be true,"But it is true, this really did happen. Obviously the movie makes some artistic, social and political changes but it seems like a mostly faithful retelling of the story.Now, true story aside, the movie itself was very enjoyable, the actors made believable SF soldiers, the locations, the equipment, everything looked good.I am so glad that they did not make a Lone Survivor clone, this is a movie that can stand up in it´s own.Some other reviews here are saying that they are disappointed that it is predictable story. I suppose that they don´t realise that it is a true story, such is the epic and frankly absurd bravery of these men in the field, it´s almost too good to be true.It´s a great story and it is well told in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Granite jawed jingoism,"Now I'm not doubting these guys existed or downplaying their killing abilities but that is really all you get.The basic plot of US special forces/green berets going to Afghanistan immediately after
9/11 and joining up with an Afghan commander (General Dostrum) to defeat the Taliban is simple enough and that bare outline is true enough it would seem.Left to it's own devices this could have been a worthy testament to the skills of the Americans and a rare chance to focus on the Afghans fighting alongside them and doing the dying, instead we have Hemsworth being, well, Hemsworth, spouting some pretty poor duty and honour dialogue which in some scenes is just cringeworthy. We have no real idea what this guy is about or why his men follow him, similarly with Shannon's grizzled veteran who is obviously placed there as some kind of counter point but his considerable acting abilities are just wasted. As for everyone else, they are just walking through a series of constructs aiming for the pay cheque at the end. The real failure is to recognise who the hell General Dostrum was and his place in modern Afghan history, instead we have a caricature that belongs to a different era of film making.In terms of the battles it starts well and does at least show that the real battle winner was the ability of these guys to call in massive air support. However in the final battle where we have Hemsworth leading a cavalry charge of Dostrum's men against truck borne rocket launchers ""before they reload"" is ludicrous these things fire into the sky, they can't be levelled so charge whenever you like. In fact this whole overly long final act is what spoilt the film for me, it is riddled with cliches and inaccuracies; we have Russian BMP's referred to as tanks when they're not, we have actual tanks referred to as T72's when there were no T72's in Afghanistan, we have Hemsworth firing an M4A1 single handed from horse back and hitting everytime including at a guy firing a tank turret machine gun straight at him, the scenes of Hemsworth and co' up close on charging horses are clearly on rigs not horses, really embarrassing and in the aftermath of the battle the amount of destroyed armour littering the field is just way over the top and to some extent devalues the victory.If you want a bit of flag waving and bonding and stuff blowing up then go for it but there are better films set in this conflict out there.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Good picture. Doesn't tell the whole story.,","The 12 Special Forces (SF) men who went into Afghanistan were accompanied by USAF Combat Controllers (CCT) who were the actual men calling in the decisive air strikes. For some reason they were excluded, though they were right there, on the horses, riding with their Army brethren. To leave them out turns this story into more of a fictional portrayal of what really occurred. The courage that the SF troops showed was indeed worthy of telling in this format, but it is remiss in not telling the whole story and recognizing all the men on the ground. I enjoyed the movie but couldn't get past the parts where the SF troops were calling in air strikes. I give it 6 stars for the action though.On a side note, the CCT personnel accompanying the A teams are highly trained in many facets of special operations, and complete a 2 year training program, which includes required graduation from Military Freefall and Combat Diver, among numerous other courses. These men also earned the right to be recognized for their contributions in breaking the back of the Taliban.",,Anonymous,History
giddyup,"Greetings again from the darkness. During the movie, Afghanistan is referred to as ""the graveyard of many empires"". Traditionally, January is the graveyard of most new movie releases, so it's a pleasant surprise when we see an entertaining, well-made and historically interesting film, and it's still mid-January! Doug Stanton's book ""Horse Soldiers"" is the source material for director Nicolai Fuglsig's first feature film, and it's anything but a disappointment.The film opens on September 11, 2001 and subjects us, yet again, to those horrific images seared into the minds of anyone alive on that day. What most of us didn't know, was that about a month later, a team of U.S. Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) were being dropped into the rough and mostly unfriendly terrain of Afghanistan. This ridiculously courageous team of 12 men had one mission: secure Mazar-i-Sharif to prevent a takeover by the Taliban.An early scene tells us this won't be the usual blind patriotism we often see on screen. One of the soldiers, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), is told (with a bit of anger) by his wife, ""I'll love you when you get back."" This contrasts to the usual loyal and stiff-upper-lip military wife we see in most war movies. Another wife scrubs the oven rather than snuggle with her man, while yet another coerces a taboo pledge to come home to her.Chris Hemsworth (THOR) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, the intelligent but not-yet-battle-tested leader of a special ops team. The plan is for Nelson and his team to connect with General Dostum, an Afghan War Lord in charge of the Northern Alliance, and fight together to gain control of Mazar. After arriving at a local outpost nicknamed ""The Alamo"" (34 miles from town), the team gets their first surprise ... they must split up and cover the ground on horseback. Filmed in New Mexico, the journey is miserable and filled with danger - an ambush could occur at any moment, or perhaps they are being set-up by those they have been ordered to trust.Horseback riding, caves, the weather, and the elements of the terrain are all challenges, but none of it compares to facing the Taliban forces which number in the thousands, and feature tanks, rocket launchers and an endless supply of weaponry. Director Fuglsig utilizes a ""Days in Country"" counter so that we can get some semblance of time and ongoing misery being fought through by the Americans. But no day is normal when the soldiers are on horseback while being attacked by tanks. The odds seem insurmountable.One of the more fascinating aspects of the story and welcome approaches of the film is back-and-forth between Captain Nelson and General Dostum. Initially, Dostum shows little respect by telling the young officer that he lacks ""the eyes of a killer"" and isn't yet a warrior, and he spends a great deal of time lecturing and philosophizing on Nelson's behalf. Of course, the lessons may be frustrating in the moment, but aren't lost on Nelson as there is a huge payoff at the peak of the key battle.The battle scenes come in all sizes - small skirmishes and massive, large scale assaults. Each is intense and dramatic and well-staged, though there are some moments where we shake our head in disbelief. At least we do until we remember that this is a true story, and despite that, it is truly unbelievable.
The supporting cast includes Michael Pena and his snappy punchlines, Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT), William Fichtner with a shaved head, Elsa Pataky - Hemsworth's real life wife as his screen wife, Taylor Sheridan, Geoff Stults and Jack Kesy. Rob Riggle plays Colonel Max Bowers, who was Riggle's commanding officer when he served in the Marines. The previously mentioned Michael Shannon is a bit underutilized, but the film's best moments are those with Hemsworth and Navid Negahban (as General Dostum). You likely recognize Negahban as Abu Nazir from ""Homeland"". It's their exchanges that show how the line between allies and enemies is not always crystal clear - even if they are fighting for the same thing.Writers Peter Craig (THE TOWN) and Ted Tally (Oscar winner for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) do a nice job of character development, and the camaraderie of the 12 men of ODA 595 seems authentic - despite some schmaltzy moments over their 23 days of Task Force Dagger. Early on, we are informed that the most important thing to take to war is ""a reason why"", and then towards the end, Dostum explains that the United States is in a no-win situation: we are cowards if we go, and enemies if we stay. It's chilling commentary on a war that has dragged on much too long ... despite the heroic efforts of the 12 horse soldiers.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Amazing story, but...","The basis of the movie is great. Assuming there was a ""little"" artistic freedom exercised to make it better for Hollywood, some of it was a little over the top.

Perhaps just not quite strong enough,"12 StrongStory was ordinary. Nothing you haven't seen thousand times before. Pretty straightforward from the beginning till the end, but it worked. Dialogue was mostly sharp and clever, with a few missteps here and there. As it was yet another ""based on a true story"" there were moments, quite a few, that felt way overly glorified. Artificial even. But perhaps that was a necessary evil to create more meaning for characters. Which, speaking about the devil, brings me to the compulsory over the top villain, because bad guys have to be maxed out on all aspects of vile behaviour.Acting was solid for the most part. Great cast all around. Hemsworth pulls his weight and the team follows. At times even blindly, which is fine, because the enemy (because they're bad) shoot like stormtroopers. However, the next time I'd recommend taking more cover, and wearing a helmet couldn't hurt either. Perhaps they're too pretty and wanted to show it off?Which brings me to visuals. Action was engaging and tense, nothing bad to say about that. Some key explosions felt a little flat though. Camerawork was enjoyable. Nothing too fancy and therefore unnecessary. No crazy ""shaky cam"" during the chaotic battle scenes, but a mandatory shell-shock sequence, which seemed a tad too familar.The score and sound is decent. Both serving their purpose, but don't really go that extra mile. In a film such as this there probably isn't any need to. Unless one likes to challenge themselves to find out exactly how many guns are firing all at once during a scene or a take. If that's even possible. No memorable song to listen to when riding into a battle either. Well. It really wouldn't be much of a covert operation, crawling between the rocks, ""Valkyries"" blasting from the boom-box.Same goes for directing. It's a job done well. All in all. And despite some minor gripes, the film is enjoyable for the most part. But I cannot help but feel like it fell a tad short. It seemed a bit too clean and cut out. What was coloured in was kept exactly within the lines. I guess that's that ""based on"" aspect. Life itself is much more colourful, it doesn't care about borders. It's ragged, jagged and jaunty. Quite like the truth. And there are many true sides to any true story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"An adequate interpretation of events, but lacks depth","The story of the Horse Soldiers, a group of twelve Special Forces soldiers who were sent into Afghanistan in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks to lay the groundwork for the Taliban's downfall, forced to ride horses against tanks and rockets, is an extraordinary tale of heroism against inconceivable odds and a proud moment in the history of our armed forces.While this film tries, and mostly succeeds in retelling these events, there's just something off in the way the whole thing is packaged.First off, there's the characters, mainly the three big names: Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson, Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spenser, and Michael Peña as Sergeant First Class Sam Diller. Their motivations and development is done only to the bare minimum, with Hemsworth being the only one with a true character arc. Of the other nine soldiers in the team, only three or four actually get their names spoken more than a couple of times throughout the film.The main supporting character is Navid Negahban as Afghan General Dostum, who provides most of the character drive for Hemsworth's Nelson to change. He has a couple of powerful moments, but he is sopposed to be portraying one of three Afghan commanders who are fighting the Taliban, but also would fight each other if the chance arose. This conflict is only brought up in passing, though it is built up multiple times.Then there's the main reason the story of the Horse Soldiers is so extraordinary: the fact that these twelve soldiers and a few hundred Afghan tribal warriors had to face fifty thousand Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, facing off tanks and artillery on horseback.The battle scenes are well shot, with only a handful of scenes with excessive cuts. The final horse charge is especially well done and feels earned. However, they don't seem to convey these overwhelming odds as well as they could.With all of this being said, this film leaves me with the same feeling that World Trade Center (2006) did. Both of these films portray events and people under extraordinary circumstances accurately, more or less, but it just feels like those involved in both films were just going through the motions, trying to replicate feelings around events that may never be able to be truly replicated.All in all, 12 Strong is a thoroughly average depiction of extraordinary events, not bad but not great. You're probably better off reading the book on which this film is based.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Incredible Story, Forgettable Film","It's always amazing to me when I see another non-fiction war story that I was previously unaware of. It makes me wonder how many incredible stories we never hear about because there wasn't a book or a screenplay. 12 Strong, about the 12 Soldiers first to enter Afghanistan after 9/11, is yet another impressive true tale even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's real life counterparts.
The most gratifying aspect to 12 Strong is the interesting bond and relationship between Chris Hemsworth's Captain Nelson and Navid Negahban's General Dostum. The two have such different viewpoints on the conflict in Afghanistan and without much context a few weeks after 9/11, the moral dilemmas the two face are clearly the staple of the film. Even with a mediocre script and direction, there's enough back and forth between the two to keep my attention.
In terms of the actual war aspect to 12 Strong, it's a less than subpar affair. In a day when battles may certainly be more difficult to differentiate between sides, it seems 12 Strong accidentally played into that. While the dialogue indicates clearly to me who is ""in the right"", the shootouts in the desert and mountains are sporadically shot and chaotically structured. It really makes it difficult to tell what is happening where and who is getting shot or bombed. Perhaps that's exactly what the director intended because it could be closer to how the war actually is, but it doesn't play as well on film.
Overall, small character moments are what makes 12 Strong worth it, but it ultimately is a forgettable war film with a real life story that is better than what was put to screen.

Pretty Good,"'12 Strong' was an insightful look into the lives of 12 soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan following the horrific 9/11 terrorist attack. They were a small group sent on a seemingly impossible mission but selflessly ignored the odds for their country. After watching this film, I have an even greater respect and admiration for our military and the sacrifices they make to secure the freedom and safety of this great nation. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying the real-life men who embarked on this mission, particularly Chris Hemsworth (I call him Captain Ameri-Thor, because in this film he plays a captain in the U.S. Army, and he also plays Thor). The action scenes were very intense, although they were a little confusing to watch at times because I couldn't always tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Otherwise, it felt like I was right there on the battlefield with them. It's also worth noting that the scenes where the soldiers were on horseback were very cool to watch. It's amazing that the horses never tried to run away from the danger, but kept running towards it. I think those horses deserve extra carrots! In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this film if you want to see what real-life heroes look like and the lengths they'll go for our country.

2 Long,"This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Hardcore Battle Scenes,"12 STRONG has some of the most hardcore battle scenes in any war movie. It's soldiers carrying weapons while riding horses, that definitely makes this one unique. And if you're animal lovers, you are right to be concerned about the horses' safety, I'm sure the production went above and beyond to ensure that but to me what's more impressive is the fact that these guys actually storm into battle like that, with bullets flying everywhere, riding a horse isn't exactly taking a cover, it's very very vulnerable, you're out in the open, impressive stuff.Starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pena and Trevante Rhodes, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, based on Doug Stanton's book, 12 STRONG is the true story of a U.S. Special forces team led by their new captain, Mitch Nelson, played by Chris Hemsworth, and after 9/11 they're sent to be the first troops into Afghanistan to retaliate. There they form alliance with a local general, played by Navid Negahban in order to fight their common enemy, the Taliban. The special forces team has to adapt to the terrain and some of the tactics there which means they have to use Afghani horses to go places. They're outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy who's driven by ideology.Without sounding too shallow, to be honest with you, the biggest reason why I enjoy 12 STRONG is that it's essentially about good guys kicking bad guys' ass. The war in Afghanistan is one of the longest wars in our country's history with no end in sight, it's still going, it's still happening, so seeing it from today's perspective is quite depressing. But something like this, where the characters are charged up because of 9/11, they go in, guns blazing, sending hell to enemy's territory, they go in they get the job done, boom, it definitely satisfies those of us moviegoers who like watching bad guys getting what's coming to them.And I'm glad that the movie is rated R and doesn't hold back, so what you get is a depiction that's not watered down. It's graphic, it's intense, it's brutal, it's in your face. And like I said earlier, the battle scenes are explosive and hardcore. You're really engaged the entire time. It's well staged, well choreographed and well-shot, with some excellent sound mix and sound editing work. There's a bit of drama they throw in there with the clash between how Chris Hemsworth's character does things versus how the local general Navid Negahban's character does things, so even though the bad guy is quite one dimensional, there's plenty to go around between those two commanding characters. The movie does a good job of emphasizing the reason why a group like the Taliban needs to be eliminated, it does a good job of pumping us up to keep rooting for the good guys to win. What a helluva film to honor those courageous horse soldiers.-- Rama's Screen --",8.0,Anonymous,History

Their first step in confronting the Taliban is to send in Special Forces teams to link up with the Northern Alliance, the enemies of the Taliban, help them in their fight against Taliban, including through coordinating air support, and reduce the Taliban's territory. The first team ""in country"" is Operational Detachment Alpha 595, lead by Captain Mitch Nelson. The 12 of them face overwhelming odds. This is their story.War movies generally fall into one of two buckets. First is the engaging, plot-and-character based, realistic, gritty type, e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Platoon. Second is the superficial, gung ho, all-action and nothing else type, e.g. this movie.Quite weak, formulaic and lacking in substance. From the outset the clichés start to flow and they never let up. The attempts at engagement are so badly done - the trite family life scenes, the clumsy attempts to create some sense of camaraderie - that you already know the director isn't much good and this isn't going to go well. Anything that's not a battle scene is generally eye-rollingly bad.The battle scenes, however, are quite well done and prevent this movie from being a total waste of time. A bit over-the-top at times but still interesting viewing.Overall, give it a miss. This is not to detract from the bravery and achievements of the actual ODA 595, whose feats are worth capturing in a film. Just not this film. They deserve better.",4.0,Anonymous,History

A Solid Flick With A Great Cast,"Everyone knows that once the Twin Towers were attacked on September 11, 2001, soldiers went into battle and wars have been occurring ever since. That part is well-known by everyone around the world. These wars will soon be talked about in history classes if they aren't already, so it goes without question that films will be made about certain aspects of the war, due to the significant impact that it has left and continues to leave. The story that 12 Strong presents is something that has been classified until recently, so it should be quite the surprise to many. There are many aspects about this film that follow the standard war film formula, but as long as it's supported by a solid cast, great sequences, and solid direction, the premise itself should be enough to carry its audience, and I believe it does just that. Now playing in theatres, here's why I think 12 Strong deserves a watch, even if not immediately.Following the first twelve men that stood up to make the first attacks after the collapse of the Twin Towers back in 2001, this movie explores the true story of courage and ambition that these men displayed for the world. As a film, it does feel slightly formulaic, due to the fact that it pretty much takes you from one location to another in a fairly simple way, but I can also see this being exactly what went down in reality, so I was able to forgive that flawed aspect pretty quickly. This is a film about intensity and the characters surrounding that intensity and for that, it succeeds with flying colors.From Chris Hemsworth to Michael Pena, Michael Shannon to a fair newcomer in Trevante Rhodes (whom I loved in 2016's Moonlight), this is a stacked film. I always appreciate when a movie delivers crazy amounts of action, while also finding the time to slow down and give each character their moments to shine. No, the character development here isn't anything to write home about, but I have to admit that I was wrapped up in each of their stories. Simple moments of characters sitting by a fire and reminiscing gets to me if it's done well, and 12 Strong accomplishes these feats quite well.This movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart in terms of gore or being turned off by too much action, because when this movie wishes to display its reign of terror on the people who have some sort of involvement in the terrorist attacks, 12 Strong does it in a very visceral manner. From showing executions to showing towns being bombed, I found this movie to be a fresh dose of reality to people who seem to forget about the horrors that go on around the world on a daily basis. As I said, there's nothing spectacular about this movie, but I think it's a little more important than people are making it out to be.Although director Michael Bay hit a high point in his career with the film 13 Hours (at least in my opinion), I feel that 12 Strong is a film that shows real promise for director Nicolai Fuglsig. This is his first mainstream outing, and I have to call it as I see it and say that I believe this man knows how to portray action on-screen and I can't wait to see the progression of his career as a filmmaker. In terms of action, I would recommend keeping an eye on this name for the future. Overall, 12 Strong is a solid and important war flick when it comes to the core story and I believe everyone should check it out at some point, but I could also recommend quite a few better movies in the same genre. Impressive filmmaking, but just good as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Better than I expected,"This military film exceeded my expectations. It's too bad that it got average reviews because Thor was the main character in a ""based on true events"" film. He did fine and did not ruin it for me although some people would say that he is just being used to get the women in the theater cause yea dude is one good looking dude. However, his acting was solid and not over the top 'Heroic' despite is casted role trend. For someone that has had family actually fight in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan; this is an amazing military story and makes me very proud. Well done 12 and thank you for your service.

THIS is what going to the theaters is all about!,"I have never seen a war movie on the big screen. I never cared to. I enjoy fantasy, sci-fi, and arthouse stuff. I recently saw and enjoyed The Shape Of Water, The Phantom Thread, Jumanji, and Paddington 2. Not into war films. I went to the theater to see The Post and it was sold out. So, I picked 12 Strong at random, seeing Chris Hemsworth on the poster. Hey, it's Thor!. I never saw any trailers for this movie so I went in blind.Based on a true story, 12 Strong gripped me from the beginning because it explained everything slow enough for people like me who aren't into warfare. You meet the characters, you know what they are about to get into, and because 9/11 happened in my lifetime, I was suddenly drawn into this movie, which depicts the first group of soldiers who attacked the Taliban.You are told how long this team of soldiers have to accomplish their mission. They say they can do it in half the time. Once the mission starts, you get a constant count of the days that they are on the mission throughout the film. It's a nice timer that helps give you a feel of their progress. It's sometimes tense, and when it's not, you get a lot of development between characters that creates sympathy. It's always entertaining.When the final scenes play out, it's very, very intense, with lots of terror, lots of anxiety-inducing moments, but all in all, an extremely satisfying conclusion. The bottom line is, this is based on a true story of a team of 12 soldiers whose story was classified until now. So only now are they getting praised for their heroic deeds.This movie delivered a great, uplifting story of soldiers who were not given credit when they came home from duty. This is their due. I promise you, if you like action films like Jumanji, which I thought was awesome... this movie will NOT dissapoint, and it's based on a true story. I will DEFINITELY see this again in the theater. It just won't be the same experience at home. See it in the theater if you can!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Really good tribute to heroism,"12 Strong proves they kinda still make them like they used to. It's certainly got the required patriotism and is probably a lot less problematic than many of its counterparts but it lacks the same level of technical bombast that the best of these never failed to deliver. Still, it's a well made tribute to heroism that remains investing right up to the end.Chris Hemsworth leads in stoic fashion. Proof he can be a dramatic lead with ease and along with the rest of his team there's a believable camaraderie between them all. As good as everyone else is, this is Navid Negahban's film. He's the most memorable by far and his greatest strength is how he's able to humanise his character/real life figure.Nicolai Fuglsig is clearly trying to direct with more than just technical competence. There's some impressively composed shots and the action has a level of intensity to it, he just can't compete with the greats in a way that's more noticeable than in other genres. Lorne Balfe's score on the other hand can easily match that same level of patriotic heroism and bombast.",7.0,Anonymous,History

What are these People Reviewing?,"As usual after I've seen a movie I check it out on IMDb. I was a little surprised to see the average review sitting at 6.6 so I started reading the reviews. The reviews are largely polarized with just a few in the middle. When you look at reviews under 5, and particularly the 1's and 2's, it's obvious that these lower reviews are, to a large extent, politically based. They tend to focus on negative portrayal of Afghans I didn't see that), overly positive portrayal of the special operators and cast doubts on the reliability of the plot. In other words, this movie, based on actual events, doesn't match the reviewers world view and therefore it must be a bad movie.Don't be taken it by this. It's actually a well done war movie that does a pretty good job of portraying the down in the dirt reality of war.

A standard patriotic war offering.,"12 Strong was the film that was released to capitalise on the reason trend of patriotic war being released for Middle-American audience: like Lone Survivor, 13 Hours and American Sniper. And within that standard 12 Strong isn't as visceral as Lone Survivor, but a lot better American Sniper that tries to celebrate someone who was a vile racist.12 Strong does have a solid premise, being about the first American Special Forces soldiers to fight in Afghanistan and how they fought with the Northern Alliance. It could easily have self as a modern version of Lawrence of Arabia due to the focus on the relationship between an American soldier and an Afghan warlord who have to work together.Sadly 12 Strong isn't as epic or memorable as Lawrence of Arabia and was really a standard Hollywood war film that had a decent final battle.

"Compelling Story, Average Execution","""12 Strong"" tells the story of the first Special Forces team deployed to Afghanistan after 9/11, as they work alongside an Afghan warlord to combat the Taliban. While the premise is compelling and the film is based on true events, it struggles to rise above being a standard war movie.The movie boasts solid performances, especially from Chris Hemsworth, whose charisma anchors the narrative. The action sequences are intense and visually striking, capturing the brutal reality of modern warfare. However, the script feels formulaic, with a predictable structure and underdeveloped supporting characters. The emotional beats, while present, often fail to hit as hard as they could due to a lack of deeper character exploration.The film also leans heavily on clichés, offering little fresh perspective on the complexities of war or the relationships between the soldiers and their Afghan allies. Despite its ambition, ""12 Strong"" plays it safe, delivering an entertaining yet forgettable experience.It's a decent watch for fans of military action dramas, but it lacks the depth or originality to truly stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Finally a war movie where you can root for the heroes,"Finally a heroic war movie with lots of action that is an interesting true story and the viewer can root for the hero because they are on the right side of history. There have been a lot of war movies recently that are on the depressing side where everyone but one is killed, or it's an anti war movie where the futility of war and being on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, or they are up against overwhelming odds and put up a valiant fight but fail. 12 Strong isn't one of those being set in 2001 before things got all muddied in Iraq.. The story is simple and clearly explained and the mission is easy to understand. They are the first force to go after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. As things progress the battles become more and more intense from planes dropping bombs then scary gun battles to tanks vs horses to a grand finale that is a true Western style horses and guns blazing all out battle. The cast is good - Chris Hemsworth doesn't overwhelm the screen so he is convincing enough. Michael Shannon plays a soldier quite well too.There are a few slightly cheap things about the beginning and ending, it's not as slickly done as a Peter Berg movie. Nevertheless it's a good solid almost old fashioned in concept war movie that leaves you with a good feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Rah-rah American militarism flick with redeeming qualities,"Yes, this is a morally simplistic go-America rah rah flick where the American cavalry gun down the metaphorical Indians in the wilds of the Afghan West, or in this case, the wilds of New Mexico. But it has two redeeming qualities, in order of value: first, it devotes a fair share of time depicting Army Special Forces wrestling with performing their primary mission -- establishing rapport with indigenous fighters, and then working with those native fighters as force multipliers; second, it featured above-average combat scenes that are thankfully becoming more common in war movies of the last decade, regardless of which country produces them.If you have a sensitive constitution for American military propaganda, you'll get nauseous over this one.

Also, since it's based on history, it's fun to see that we were in Afghanistan fighting a month after 9/11. Good acting, good reactions of the actors to the 9/11 events. Just the right amount of family, home stories. Likable military. Interesting seeing the terrain and what they dealt with, and the Arab culture there. Clean movie, too. No nudity or crass talk, really. One parting scene between a husband and wife, fully clothed, in which their dialogue would go over the heads of someone under age. Good, educational movie, even if some liberties were taken. I don't know what liberties those were.Just read some of the low ratings.

However with that said, it's entertainment, it's loosely based on a true story, enjoy the ride if you can. A few well-known actors and a lot of overacting clichés but otherwise entertaining.

"Nail-biting and thrilling film with spectacular warlike feats , frantic action , emotion and breathtaking battles","Acceptable War film based on the book ""Horse Soldiers"" , renamed ""12 Strong"", upon the pic's release written by Doug Stanton, concerning a motley team led by captain Mitch Nelson and his squadron who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines . Chris Hemsworth assumes the main character as commando leader in this ordinary wartime movie competent and professionally directed .12 Strong tells the story of the first Special Forces team deployed to Afghanistan after 9/11 ; under the leadership of a new captain , Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth married in the fiction and really to Elsa Pataky) and officer Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) along with the valiant team (Michael Peña , Trevante Rhodes , Geoff Stuffs , Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stonewell, among others) must work with an Afghan warlord called Gen. Dostum (Navid Negahban) to take off the bloody Taliban army by providing the necessary information to US bombers -the B-52s making the bombing run are from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana to Afghanistan- to execute massive air attacks against enemy . All of them under-commanding from Colonel Mulholl (William Fichtner) who as Delta Force leader provides them information enough about targets to attack and subsequently they take over the country and defeat the Taliban enemy , allowing other Special Forces and the rest of the conventional military to go on their long war against the fanatic enemies . On September 11, 2001 the world watched in terror . On September 12, 2001 they volunteered to fight.The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers . Inside every soldier hides a warrior.This is an entertaining and epic film concerning the true Story of the Army's Special Forces ""Green Berets"" , with Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson , he is a tough officer along with the ordinary team of brave US soldiers whose mission is to pull off an extremely dangerous assignment : to take down the Taliban and destruction the enemy position , as they are tasked by being transported by Chinook helicopter along the Afghan territory . As Chris/Mitch training and commanding a group of awesome and eclectic soldiers for a dangerous assault on the mountainous far desert . In the hands of hardboiled director Nicolai Fuglsig and a tough-as-leather cast , that's all the plot that's needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick . The movie is based on Doug Stanton's non-fiction book ""Horse Soldiers"", with interesting screenplay by Ted Tally who long time ago wrote the successful ¨The silence of the lambs¨, which tells the story of CIA paramilitary officers and U.S. Special Forces personnel in addition to USAF Combat Controllers, sent to Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks . This moving film packs frenetic thrills , perilous adventures , choreographed crossfire , sneering evil enemies , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence . However , it doesn't matter what they are after , because the point of the film is not to educate spectators about actual facts that their textbooks didn't cover , but to amuse people with an outrageous story , kinetic stunts , relentless feats , blowing up and goofy physical action . The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the defile , including some spectacular shootouts , bombing and explosion . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Chris/Mitch and his two-fisted squadron , the film is full of feats , suspense, intrigue and thrills . Highlights of the movie are the impressive and overwhelming horse raids carried out by the valiant ¨Horse Soldiers"" .This film belongs to the mini-genre dealing with the revenge carried out by the US that within weeks responded to the 9-11 attack, such as : ¨Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden¨ by John Stockwell and ¨Zero Dark Thirty¨ by Kathryn Bigelow . It displays a colorful and attractive cinematography by Rasmus Videbæk . Shot on location in Afghanistan , Uzbekistan , Mines Near Orogrande , Socorro,New Mexico Alamogordo, New Mexico, Santa Clarita, California, and much of the filming took place near White Sands Missile Range . As well as rousing and moving musical score by Lorne Balfe . Lavishly financed by the great producer Jerry Bruckheimer , an expert on Blockbusters , in fact its is Jerry Bruckheimer's second film to be released by Warner Bros Pictures and being well made by Nicolai Fuglsig in his only film .

Good But Could Have Been Better,"In short: ""12 Strong"" is based on the book ""Horse Soldiers"" by Doug Stanton. In the weeks following 9/11 an elite squad of soldiers from the Army's Fifth Special Forces Group were flown into Afghanistan and dropped behind enemy lines. Their mission: work with a local, CIA-paid warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, and his ""Northern Alliance forces"", defeat the Taliban, and secure the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif.Whoopsy, no one told this group of ""12 Strong"" American badasses, led by Captain Mitch Nelson (Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth), that the fight will have to be done on horseback. Oh, and ""you have six-weeks to do it."" Says Thor: ""We'll do it in three.""If you're expecting an action-packed two-hours, you'll be disappointed. When the action does eventually start, it moves quickly from location to location with carpet-bombing-B-52's doing most of the heavy-lifting. Sure, it's fun to watch American air-superiority blow the shit out of the Taliban, but I paid to see Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña and Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight) gallop and shoot their way to glory. But, this is a true story and the truth can be anti climactic sometimes.Two things you'll LIKE about ""12 Strong"": 1) Although the action scenes are short, they are awesomely intense and loud. 2) This is a guy movie. There isn't much in the way of romance, only bromance (if you're female, well, there is Chris Hemsworth but you may as well stay at home with the book version and a bottle of Chardonnay).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) There's a lot of reading to do. It seems like every five-minutes the team is going from Taliban stronghold to stronghold and apparently we need to know exactly who is who and where they are, in white bold, CAPS-LOCKED titles on the screen. 2) There's no emotion, and very little chemistry between the characters.",,Anonymous,History

incredible story,"This is the quasi-real story of the first days of the war in Afghanistan following 9/11, when a small team of special forces soldiers entered the country to support our new battle against the Taliban. I say quasi-real only because this is a Hollywood production, and there are almost inevitably changes made to amplify the drama and excitement no matter how exciting the real story was, but then again for all I know maybe it did go down exactly as depicted.In any case, the movie depicts how the American soldiers went in with very little information or planning and only a vague goal that boils down to ""support this guy because he's fighting these other guys"", and found themselves in a world where people are living with roughly the technological sophistication we had here about 150 years ago.It's not exact, of course, there are aspects of modern life here and there, but it's pretty stunning none the less. People live in structures without plumbing or electricity, travel on horseback, and communication is mostly done by face to face conversations or with walkies. In fact, the most common artifact of the modern world are the weapons.Speaking of, seeing the contrast between the so-called first world and life in Afghanistan the thing that struck me was just how much effort humanity has put into efficient ways of killing each other. Looking at a world where you live in a hut and keep a herd of sheep for clothing and food, now filled with tanks, surface to air rockets, grenades, machine guns, and bomber planes, I couldn't help but think of the monumental effort it took to create all of that. The tons of raw materials mined and refined, collected from around the world and passed through sophisticated factories where it was pressed and molded and assembled, the chemistry bent towards creating reliable mass-produced explosives, the advanced rocketry used to create handheld weapons capable of firing explosives thousands of feet with accuracy.It's kind of awe inspiring. Truly. It might actually be one of mankind's most impressive accomplishments. The ability to produce and transport such a bewildering array of lethal power, to bring it even here, about as far from anything resembling the modern world as it's possible to get, is pretty amazing.We tend not to think of war as an ""amazing"" thing because the effects are so horrifying, but when I saw this I wondered how many other areas we can say we've developed with such single-minded purpose. The cell phone is often held out as one of the main marvels of the modern world, but even that technology owes most of its existence to the military, where the core technology was built for more effective battlefield communication, as were most of the technologies it utilizes like GPS and the Internet.In any case, the movie is well made and paced, and it depicts a piece of the culture and history of a region many of us know very little about despite the fact that we've been engaged in a war there for years. I don't know if it was actually filmed in Afghanistan (my guess is probably not), but the cinematography is beautiful and seems authentic. Also, the stars are charismatic and engaging and the story is unique; it's worth a view.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The *killer eyes* of the Horse Soldiers,"In 12 Strong you follow the journey of 12 US soldiers, mostly their captain named Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth). A man who has never been to war, however that doesn't stop him to go headstrong to the battlefield. His men follow him with no hesitation, and they are good at firing a couple of jokes at times, considering where they are and what they are doing. This makes the movie nicer, as you can see how humor help loosening the mood up a bit.
Nelson has to work together with the Afghan General Dostum (Negahban), who isn't very good at cooperating. However one thing is sure, Dostum wants to take down the Taliban and he needs the help of the US army, as he doesn't have enough firearms on his own.The movie has a nice pace to it, as it starts out showing us the different soldiers, their reaction to the 9/11 attack, but also their wifes/families, who all have a different way to send off their men. When they get to Afghanistan it's Nelsons' job to convince his superiors that his team is ready to be sent out there. Luckily Nelson is an intelligent man who knows how to speak his mind and case.
Nelsons' first meeting with Dostum isn't the best, and because Nelson doesn't have those *Killer eyes*, as Dostum so nicely puts it, the trust takes a long time to build.
At the same that all of this is happening you get small glimpses of some of the things that the Taliban is doing, shown in the scenes with Razzan (Acar), someone who seems like the leader of one of the Taliban groups, and one with whom Dostum has a big grudge against.12 Strong is one of Fuglsig first movies, and he has done a good job. The images are very beautiful at times, and the explosions are quite realistic. I really like the casting too - and not just because of Hemsworth, even though he does make up most of the film - and characters such as Diller (Peña) the comedic one, and Spencer (Shannon) Nelsons' right-hand man are very important to the building of the story and characters, but also to lighten the mood.All in all I really liked this movie, and it's crazy to think that it's taking from a real story. Quite impressing.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Formerly classified Afghanistan invasion now told in this movie.,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library.It is about an Army Green Beret mission of 12 men about one month after the 9-11 attacks on the USA. They needed an elite team to go in, meet up with friendly Afghanistan militia, use coordinates to direct some bombing from B52 planes flying out of sight above.This mission was classified for years so few knew about it. As we now know the war in Afghanistan is still an issue but this mission showed how the spirit and cooperation of an elite team could accomplish so much.

Is this a joke? Like watching Seinfeld as an action hero.,"It is very, very hard to take this movie serious. Chris Hemsworth is better casted in a comedy. They even better had Seinfeld to play his part, that would be way more convincing. Furthermore, to make a movie believable, it's always in the details. Why do these soldiers, the best there are, do not have goggles on to prevent sand and shot of rocks from landing in their eyes? And then there are some poorly executed 'award-winning' scenes where Hemsworth does some sort of monologue where he does a speech about something, but the problem here in is that it's so unbelievable I even started laughing, totally not the meaning of the scene, but so unavoidable. Just like the scene in 'Babylon' where the main character get's laughs in the his most serious scene.Then the action scenes, average, to much closeups, nothing special.

Thor goes to to War in this solid action film,"Based on a little known true story and no doubt exaggerated for the Hollywood machine, 12 Strong is an effective war film and a solid debut feature from director Nicolai Fuglsig who delivers an experience that is engaging without becoming anything overly memorable as Thor himself heads into the battlegrounds of Afghanistan to take it to Al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001.Focussed around Chris Hemsworth's Captain Mitch Nelson and his 11 man squad that includes Michael Shannon's Hal Spencer and Michael Pena's Sam Diller heading into the war torn Afghani landscape mere days after the attacks on American soil and tasked with completing a highly important mission of support to a local militant whose looking to wipe out the terrorist threat in the country, 12 Strong gives Fuglsig and his cast ample chances to get involved in some explosive and intense battles as their horse filled entourage take it to the ""big bads"" and try clear a path towards liberation.Those seeking a fix of war infused thrills and spills will be left satisfied by the experience 12 Strong has to offer them as Fuglsig director handles the carnage and intense battles well as the bullets, RPG's and bombs fly across our screens and for a film with a somewhat limited budget, Fuglsig makes the most of the tools at his disposal to give the film a sense of danger and fierceness, even if there are a few too many scenes of our heroes flying headfirst into battle as countless enemies spray bullets everywhere but at them.Where 12 Strong isn't so strong is in its ability to connect us with this particular group of men and while Hemsworth and militant leader General Dostrum (played well by Navid Negahban) get decent set-ups and screen time, Fuglsig can't quite invest us more emotionally into the bond and backgrounds of the tight-knit Green Berets squad.The best war films manage to mix both the shock and awe of battle with the human ties and that's what differentiates 12 Strong from the leaders of the pack, despite its ability to capture the time and place of this story in a constantly capable way.Final Say -12 Strong offers up a solid if unremarkable war-set experience that features some above average battles and big screen spectacle but some unfortunately lacking human connections.3 supply drops out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,History

Great movie. 6.8 out of 10? Shame.,"Great movie. 6.8 out of 10? Shame.The movie might/will be criticized by the classic anti-American, anti-West, anti-occupation, anti-war and many many other ideology followers. Though the movie has great story and great battle scenes these will be ignored by them. They will vote it down for their stupid reasons. They dont have the cumulative overall knowledge to understand the movie.The movie goes on to show whole of battlefield. We are not focused on close shot to heroes who shoot somewhere to the opposite direction of the camera where we cant see (though these type of scenes exist too, its a level that its supposed to be). As viewers we exactly know what is going on there, we are whether directly told or we get to know it by the cinematography. We are informed of the battle tactics and formations. It will feel great for those among you who like to grasp everything down to its each iota. Not to mention the effects of rocket launches, it gives a chill down the spine.It's very different from the rest of the movies about Afghanistan. Our American heroes/soldiers dont just go out there and save everyone and save the day. It dives down to understand the conflict and tries to get answers to questions such as ""why is there a civil war in Afghanistan, why people of Afghanistan arent doing anything against Taliban/Al-Qaeda, why do we support warlords, isnt Afghan a language, isnt Afghan an ethnicity"" etc.
The viewers are directly let known that there are many ethnicities and languages in Afghanistan. The leader of Northern Alliance is Abdulrashid Dostum and our team goes to meet him and fight alongside him and clear out as much territory as they can from the Taliban rule. We learn that Dostum is a public leader who is ethnically Uzbek and he speaks Uzbek, Dari, Pashto, Tajik and Russian, then we also figure out he speaks English well as well. We are even introduced to Uzbek language and way of life briefly. Then we understand that the actually the Uzbeks and other minorities suffered more under Taliban (including Dostum's own family) so the main ally US can find in Afghanistan immediately is the Turkic peoples such as Uzbeks and Turkmens.I highly recommend you to watch this for the great battle scenes and tactics that were used during America's campaigns, better understanding to history and to realize the ethnic dynamics of the region to some degree.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A sub-par war movie,"Ever since I first heard about this movie almost a year ago, I have had high expectations for this movie. After all it's a war movie with Chris Hemsworth based on a true story. How could it go wrong? Right? ... Wrong.There are several things that war movies must have in order to be good and this movie failed in several categories. One facet of a war movie that absolutely must be present is realism. This is a category most war movies get right. This one did not. During the entire movie special forces troops blew away with their automatic weapons at Taliban bad guys and I only counted two times where a character reloaded. Now, I'm not going to complain if a movie like Fast and Furious is a little unrealistic with its reloading but in a movie like 12 Strong there needs to be frequent ammunition changes. Also, in the final battle Chris Hemsworth charges into the teeth of enemy tanks riding on horseback and somehow makes pin-point accuracy shots. The final battle scene felt very exaggerated and unrealistic. Now I realize that it is based on a ""true story"" but I guarantee that the movie touched up some things in an attempt to make a better movie. In a war movie, there needs to be a lot more gritty realism.A second thing that bothered me about the movie was that the bad guy was honestly lame. They pretty much slapped in one scene to make sure you know that he is a ruthless killer. There needed to be more development present.Finally, none of the action sequences were impressive or memorable and most of them centered around panning shots of B-52 bombing tanks which was pretty boring. I will never watch this again and I would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting a serious war movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History

12 Strong **,"The true life story of how after 9/11 the U.S government sent a group of 12 special forces members on a mission to take a Taliban hot spot within 3 weeks.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) leads the charge with a excellent supporting cast with Micheal Shannon (The Shape of Water),Micheal Pena (End Of Watch) and Navid Negahban (Homeland). 
 
The story itself is captivating but the mistake here is the telling the story as commercial as possible this could have a been a TV movie by the Producers Bruckhiemer's company that tel the film as if it was one. This is a American story the error is Americanising the telling of it in the usual fashion. If they could have told the story in a independent gritty way it could have been totally absorbing. 
 
Mel Gibson made big choices of how Hacksaw Ridge would have to play out in two halves and the second is full out absorbing horrific war. Spielberg made Saving Private Ryan visually 
 
12 Strong features almost TV coverage from the swirling aerials, pans and dolls shots by fails to have a distinctive independent style or vibe. 
 
The film's true life story is well worth telling and in the hands of someone like Joe Carnahan (Narc) for instance it could have really found it's tone.
 
By trying to look and feel like every other commercial film it loses chance to be truly original like it's source story. 
 
One sequence in particular where the soldiers charge the Taliban with missiles flying over their heads is a thrilling set piece. This shot POV or Normandy Beach style from Saving Private Ryan's opening could have been a masterpiece of a cinematic battle. 
 
A by the numbers style war film of a truly remarkable achievement. It's not a bad film by any means it just fails to be as remarkable as the achievement that was made in the story. If the filmmakers had been as fearless as the real life heroes who knows how daring this could have been.

The strength of 12 Strong lies simply in the raw intensity when all hell breaks loose.,"12 Strong shows you more of the raw aspects of war and you can't really compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan or similar war flicks. Here things are getting serious and there is no beautiful storyline that makes you feel for the personal lives of the soldiers. Sure, most of them have families, kids... people to go back home after the mission is finished, but these smaller details get brushed off in a very rushed way. All you, as the audience, have to care about are the soldiers fulfilling their duty to retaliate after 9/11 took place and kick some Taliban accross the field. To make it easier for us to relate to the characters we get Mr. Thor himself with Chris Hemsworth in the leading role, who does a great job on acting though. In this constant grind of war this movie slows down from time to time and tries to give some more depth to the other men of the 12 man strong team, but in many aspects this turns out very genereric and some of this fans of war movies have seen over and over again. The strength of 12 Strong lies simply in the raw intensity when all hell breaks loose and in these moments the movie scores big time. So if you only care for that you will love this movie. But if you want some more in depth character development and a rollercoaster of emotions, you might end up being slightly disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The problem with 'based on a true story' movies,"12 Strong stars Chris Hemsworth in a movie about a team of American Soldiers who attempt to take down the taliban. And i was....ok, a decent movie with great chemistry amongst the main cast, good individual performances and immersive war action. However, the narrative doesn't do anyone much favours, these bio-pics that are supposedly based on real events really do struggle with creating drama and intensity because the real events are often not that interesting. I am not doubting the significance and sacrifices of the real people behind this very real event but from an entertainment standpoint there really wasn't much source material to create a wholesome narrative.Like many films of the same tagline this movie has that one punchline that the rest of the narrative has to surround, in this case '12 men' vs the taliban. It is an interesting story but not enough to be a feature length film, and it was a long movie over 2 hours. I definitely felt that run time, a lot of filler and unnecessary parts that built little character and barely progressing the story.

Solid war flick,"This film has a solid cast. Chris Hemsworth in the lead role does a commendable job. The actual storytelling hangs on the interesting and conflict-filled relationship between Cap. Mitch and the Northern Alliance's leader A. R. Dostum which is good but it quickly became stale. the initial character set-ups involving family members and relationships are quite boring. I also find Sgt. Milo's befriending of an Afghani boy to be pointless. But the film is visually and technically stunning. The special effects and practical effects are superb in this flick. The action are intense and gripping; the battle sequences, the bombing runs and the teamwork displayed by the American troops are spectacular. They only have horses and a rifle-armed militia to fight the Taliban with tanks and rocket launchers. But they managed to outsmart them with aerial attacks and superior ground tactics. So much incessant gunfire, constant reloading, and RPG explosions. The film will keep the average viewer on the edge of their seat, with eyes fixed on the screen. Cinematographer Rasmus Videbæk makes frequent, effective use of filters to dampen hues and enhance the grittiness of the film's visual appearance. Lorne Balfe's score is generally effective, although there are times when it calls attention to itself a little too much.Overall, 12 strong, despite solid action, good visuals and performances, the script left much to be desired and doesn't make the most of the talent involved.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"OK, but too Hollywood","Saving Private Ryan set the gold standard for war movies. War, from a soldier's standpoint, is about watching the people next to you die randomly, and that zinging sound could be a bullet that will randomly select someone to die.Any specOps movie is already in the real danger of being a chest-thumping jingoistic movie. This was no exception. All the cliches were there: The soldier who promises his wife he'll return, the soldier who shows up to base unshaven and out of uniform ""because he wants to serve"", and don't get me started about the battle scene.In fairness, the logistics elements were well handled and the reality of war being about uncomfortable flights, unknown venues, not knowing what's next, that was well done. The principle ally was well portrayed.But this movie claims to honor some huge battle, and it does this how? Anyone remember the Lone Ranger TV show, where the LR would be riding Silver at full speed and firing away with his revolver, landing every shot? Anyone remember the show Man From Uncle, where the badguys with machineguns in a concrete position had elevated shots at the goodguys, who came charging in broad daylight shooting their brens from the hip, taking out all the badguys without losing a goodguy?That's this movie's final scene. Just awful.Oh, but with 100 goodguys on horses in a cavalry charge against 100 guys with AK-47s (who would do that?) a couple extras got shot off their horses... and thank goodness no horse got shot (sarcasm). It seems like Hollywood's ability to compose a battle scene hasn't improved much since John Ford's Stagecoach, where the passengers were able to pick off Indians.... Indigenous Americans, whilst the Indigenous Americans were totally unable to do anything to the passengers.Whoever had the job to choreograph the battle scenes was overpaid.This is a good movie for highschool students and right wingers, but it's little more than a shoot-em-up movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Fighting against tanks with horses. That's kind of unique.,"This is Afghanistan.
Graveyard of many empires.
Today you are our friend,tomorrow you are our enemy.
It won't be any different for you.
Soon America will become just another tribe here.
You will be cowards if you leave.
And you will be our enemies if you stay.I only asked myself one question, after seeing ""12 Strong"". Why didn't the American authorities send 1200 of those well-trained, experienced soldiers instead of this limited group of 12? Then in one fell swoop, they could have wiped out the entire Taliban and the scum that belongs to it. Now after more than 15 years, the American troops are still there and the living conditions and the political situation hasn't improved much. I can believe that these 12 elite soldiers have made a breakthrough in the fight against the Taliban there. That the entire film is based on true facts, I also want to believe. But I think that the event between dropping these soldiers and their homecoming should be taken with a fat grain of salt. It felt like a superhero movie at certain moments and it's the textbook example of displaying American patriotism. The latter a bit too much for my taste.Any idea how many Taliban fighters these 12 super-elite soldiers had a clear shot at? And how many were eventually sent to the afterlife, where they are awaited for by a harem of virgins, with a well-aimed shot? I lost count after a while. I'm sure that the automatic rifles of the American soldiers were equipped with an auto-aim function because the number of headshots was shockingly high. I suppose the Taliban fighters were equipped with obsolete Soviet arms or weapons from other parts of the world because their shooting skills left much to be desired. Or perhaps they had desert sand in the eyes. Or the American soldiers chose a perfect time to attack. Maybe these Muslim warriors were attacked the moment they rolled out their Persian carpet and knelt down towards Mecca for their prayers. I don't have another explanation. Either that or they are just extremely bad at shooting.I did admire these elite soldiers because they had to move on horseback through this country. Nothing special, you might say. But not when you find out only one person has experience in this discipline. It's surprising no one fell off an Afghan ridge. They also had an additional obstacle. Not only did the local warlords such as Dostum (David Negahban) thoroughly hate the Taliban regime. There was also the mutual rivalry between the various Afghan warlords. Afghans apparently all have a short fuse (stressful for suicide terrorists). However, I don't understand how they knew at a given moment who they should shoot at, because those Muslim fighters all look identical. ""12 Strong"" is a war film like so many others. Apart from the fact that they go to battle on horses against a force majeure with a hypermodern weapon arsenal. This gives us impressive but at the same time dubious images. It looked like ""The magnificent seven"" mixed with ""Hacksaw Ridge"".The honor of being the captain of these elite troops was given to Chris Hemsworth, who played it with bravado and conviction. Mitch Nelson is an officer without war experience but with a charisma and intellect that ensures that this impossible operation is fully successful. He manages to convince a general after he interrupted him several times during his briefing (apparently this is not done in the US Army). And he manages to persuade an Afghan warlord in a decisive manner so he forgets a year-long feud for a short time and buries the battle ax briefly. ""12 Strong"" is certainly exciting, contains a whole series of action-packed scenes and shows in a clear way how chaotic the political situation in that country is. My personal opinion about the whole problem is of a very different nature. And many will disagree with it. Let me put it this way. I am convinced that as long as there is money to be earned from these sad conflicts, with ordinary and innocent people being the victims, these tragic conflicts won't stop and nothing will change.

For me the film is just way too boring.,"'12 STRONG': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war film about CIA Paramilitary and U.S. Special Forces who were sent to Afghanistan, immediately after the September 11th attacks, to combat Taliban soldiers there. It's based on the non-fiction book 'Horse Soldiers' by Doug Stanton, and it was scripted by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. Sophomore feature filmmaker Nicolai Fuglsig directed the movie, which stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Navid Negahban, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, William Fichtner and Rob Riggle. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty dull and uninvolving.The story begins with the September 11th terrorist attacks being witnessed on TV by Captain Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth), and his family. Mitch is eager to retaliate against those responsible, and he begs his superior officers for his Captain position back, in order to do so. Mitch, along with Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spencer (Shannon), Sergeant First Class Sam Diller (Pena), and other U.S. soldiers, are then sent to Afghanistan to attack the Taliban forces there. Once there, they partner with the leader of the alliance, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Negahban), and quickly start to plot their revenge.The movie looks like a fun war action flick, and I like the premise to it, but for me the film is just way too boring. I couldn't even get into the action scenes (which I'll admit happens a lot for me with recent action flicks), but the whole story, and character development, is pretty weak and uninvolving. The performances are pretty dull and uninspired too, and it's definitely a talented cast. With the exception of Navid Negahban (he's a scene stealer in it), most of the actors seem to be just there for their paychecks. I could not wait for the movie to be over, for most of it's 2 hour and 10 minute running time, but I'll admit that I'm sure some action junkies, and war film fans, will probably enjoy it. Technically speaking, the movie isn't half bad.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Another 9/11 History Movie that Stands out to the Rest,"With countless movies about the tragedy that left America in shock and anger, 12 Strong follows a different story than most with the first attacking line against Osama Bin Laden.The A list cast consisting of Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, And Michael Pena along with others add a good and familiar face to this gritty war drama. Everyone giving good performances across the board even the minor characters and generic soldiers shown throughout the movie as well.The overall story is clear cut and set up within the first 20 minutes and holds strongly throughout. With some Cliches scattered throughout the film that could be clouded over since it is based off of true events. Some of the scenes did feel discriminating with its depictions of americans and the towns and locations throughout.Shockingly there weren't that many action/war as shown in the trailers and promotions for the film but the biggest battle is definitely the most intense with it's feeling of threat and danger most for our cast. But the big battle did have continuity errors throughout with recycled shots of headshots, missile firing and people coming in and out of cover shooting.Overall the movie did well with it's first time director and seeing Hemsworth get back into the uniform and Pena to be himself with his comical side that gave the audience a breath of fresh air in between tense scenes. The movie did pull of tension a lot better than most war movies especially ones that have come out in the past decade possibly and it's non-complicated story made it fun and interesting to allow the story to be driven mainly by the characters after the introduction.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Russian net trolls and bots hate it, so that tells you something","Firstly for those saying Afghanistan is a failure, that is laughable. the point of the action in Afghanistan was to reduce state level support and host terrorist groups with large scale international reach capable of killing thousands of American civilians at a time. That has been 100% successful. Erecting nonsense, strawman goals like making Afghanistan some kind of fully stable modern democracy, or fully ending islamacism is not a serious arguing point, since this was never a goal.Let's get to the film. If you know the book it has lots of license, and the film takes even more license: as do all war films. Is 12 strong as faithfully accurate on SO as Zero Dark Thirty? No.As far as acting and character development, there are some problems. Interestingly the most talented actor, Michael Shannon does terribly here, really showing no resemblance to anything I have seen in the military, he can't even hold a firearm properly. But I see that as mostly a casting mistake.Overall this is a very very well paced, well shot war film. It is not excessively jingoistic. That it celebrates some dramatic successes of the early SO operators, dropping into totally unknown territory, with little support, simply reflects the reality of the triumphs of our operators (although some credit should have been given to the spotters who also went in with the operators).",,Anonymous,History

"Entertaining, fairly accurate historical drama","An aside first. I don't generally like to react to other reviews, but most of the ""stinker"" reviews that I've read were either A) based on politics, or B) based on problems with the entire premise. Both result in grossly unfair and misleading 1 or 2 star reviews. It's not a binary system, e.g. the thumbs-up or down of Siskel and Ebert, so a movie should not be a ""1"" if you hate it, nor conversely, a ""10"" if you like it. /rantOn to the movie itself. I saw it on the guide the other night, decided to hit ""record"", and later found myself glad that I did. I had not heard of the movie, was unfamiliar with the story, and was unsure how Chris Hemsworth would pan out as an American soldier.Pleasantly surprised on all fronts. I give it a 7 out of 10.The story/accuracy: This is based on a true story, so lets dispense with the problems with the premise. Horses navigate the mountainous terrain much better than APV's and tanks, though they are somewhat lacking in the firepower department. According to those who were there, there are some sequences out of order, some artistic license applied, and some factors omitted entirely. I've heard much worse complaints from the real-life participants in other films.Acting: Capable. Hemsworth did a good job, as did Michael Pena, Michael Shannon, et al. I thought the chemistry with the team as a whole was very good, and the banter and joking came across as genuine. Better than average ensemble.I'll skip the discussion on politics, except to say that I never felt that I was watching a recruiting film. Yes, the US and allies are the good guys, and Al Qaeda and the Taliban are the bad guys, and the story is told from that point of view. If that bothers you, you probably shouldn't watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Thor vs the Taliban,"When I watch a film like '12 Strong,' i.e. one that's 'based on true events,' I always feel like I should research the true story before deciding on how good the film is. It tells the tale of the first group of American soldiers sent into Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks who paved the way for the Allied invasion and subsequent regime change for the Middle Eastern country. Naturally, it's all told from America's perspective, but with any Hollywood war movie, what did you expect? Anyway, it's naturally very patriotic and, although I can't confirm or deny on how close to the actual story this depiction is, it's still pretty good fun. And, dare I say that's mainly to do with its leading man, Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth.Hemsworth plays 'Captain Mitch Nelson' - the squad leader of the twelve special forces operatives sent in to meet up with various local tribes, all of which only too willing to help overthrow the Taliban. There are a couple of familiar faces thrown in there as well - the ones I recognised were Michael Shannon and William Fichtner, but, in my opinion, it's Hemsworth's show all the way. It's hardly controversial to say that he can carry a franchise with ease and here is an example of how he can generally take what is probably a bit of a mediocre and predictable film into something very watchable. He's just so damn easy to watch and somehow doesn't let his (annoyingly, in my bitter opinion!) good looks get in the way of him portraying a kind of 'everyman' soldier who you could just imagine leading a platoon of troops into battle.As you can probably imagine, the film centres around Hemsworth and his men. There is some attempt to show what's going on in the country at the time, but I did get the feeling that this was there for the added effect of showing how bad it was and therefore doubling down on justifying America's invasion of the region. They try to show the 'villain' of the film (i.e. the leader of the Taliban in the area they're attacking) and what he's up to, but the fact that the story dictates the fact that he's obviously never going to interact with our heroes, he's about as effectives as a villain as a bad guy in the Marvel Cinema Universe (excluding Loki, of course!).Besides Hemsworth, I thought the other stand-out performance came from Navid Negahban as local warlord/American ally, 'General Dostum.' He actually gets enough screen time to show us that not all residents of the country are our enemies and its good to see the bond develop between him and Hemsworth's characters. Naturally, there are also the obvious battles that you're going to get in any war film. Most of them seem pretty well done and realistic, but I think there were a few CGI explosions thrown in there as well. Like I say, I'm not sure how historically accurate this film is, but there is some text at the end (which I always go by!) that tells us a few facts and it does seem that the film-makers have done their best to tell the actual story, rather than just throwing out some US propaganda. So, if you're interested in the early days of the 'War on Terror,' like war movies, or are just a fan of Chris Hemsworth, this is actually a film that's better than I expected it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"entertaining, but not the highest quality","I thoroughly enjoyed watching pretty much all of this movie. That being said, this movie seems to be falling into the trend of alot of movies, similar to what happened with The Rings of Power. Loads of potential, but the execution of a great story to the screen was lacking. I do think this movie was better quality than ROP, but for a movie that is more than two hours, the character development, especially with the Afghan General was disappointing. In the first 45min of LOTR FOTR there was an immense amount of character development that is rarely matched by recent films. Heck, even The Big Green, a kids movie from the 90s had amazing character development in sub-2hrs. Other things that just blow my mind in our current era of movies, is stupid oversights like having a top tier special forces group NOT USE THEIR SIGHTS on their rifles when shooting?! This isn't the 80s where that is cool anymore. While a lot of people are not educated regarding how guns are shot, this seemed like a simple thing to mitigate that would bring more of a realistic and quality feel to the film for approx 40% of the country that generally knows how shooting a gun works. If the Olsen twin's younger sister, Elizabeth Olsen can have excellent firearms manipulation in Wind River(Seriously impressive, check it out), the lead actors in this film can look down their sights and perform reloads at least similar to how real operators would.",7.0,Anonymous,History

To that purpose, Nelson and his compatriots charge into battle on horseback, after calling in bombing runs from B52s cruising at 30,000 feet. The lack of psychological complexity and character development shouldn't bea factor to be held against 12 Strong, as the movie does a decent job at what it sets out and will likely please the target demographic (those who have appreciated other recent patriotic films like American Sniper and Lone Survivor). It's well made and, though not sufficiently deep , it gets to offer a salute to determination and braveness, and the importance of diplomacy in developing and cementing alliances.

Although to be fair, it would be an account from people involved and there probably would be some exaggeration or forgetting certain things.Having said that, what we do see here, is patriotism, but also heroism.

"Sloppy, Misguiding ; but don't understand all the extreme hate","12 strong at best, is a pretty ok above average war movie. As much as people wanna say that it is a good guy/bad guy movie and that it is a classic american propaganda movie, they should also realize that despite all these cons they did craft a more than a 'boring' or a 'dull' film.I, for one had very low expectations for this. Chris Hemsworth's casting for starters. Chris will forever be labelled as the guy who plays 'Thor' and that label hasn't gone off here too. Many critics and reviewers might undermine this film for the casting and general tone of this film alone. 12 Strong starts with the usual sequence that most war movies starts with. A more than predictable story and plot development makes the film a tad uninteresting throughout. With frequent interruptions of 'scholarly advice' and 'fight with heart' dialogues make us cringe and wonder whether this film has something redeeming ; to praise for. Chris's acting was a surprise. Never i would have expected to someone so typecasted to come out with some good piece of acting.12 strong never suffers from a lack of action or adrenaline rushing moments. In fact, it is one of the few pros that should be mentioned. The slick, undetermined action, but pretty predictable one at that makes it a good thing that stands out from a pile of bad thorns. The film, even produced as a true story never makes it believable. The screenplay looks like it was borrowed from a Chinese robot designed to produce cliched screenplays. The lack of character development, the pretty straightforward interactions and dialogues and a vague, boring reactions to development that rarely take place make the film look like a full on dump.With some right guidance on how a war film (a real incident at that) should be scripted and directed, 12 strong could have been, potentially a good flick. Even with all the cliches and no original content to produce 12 strong stands on its own as a stagnant, rock solid, sloppy flick.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Moderately strong,"This review of 12 Strong is spoiler free*** (3/5)BRAVERY, POWER AND strength take their hold through the plot of Jerry Bruckheimer's produced true telling war drama 12 Strong, based on the alleged declassified mission when CIA Paramilitants and American Special Forces would join forces and invade Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 to kill the Taliban. 
 
However those points aren't just the central nail for the plot, they're also what carries the film through its pulsating action. Sure this idea is often clankingly direct as the film progresses, yet it gives a scent of the decent layout through its 130 minute running time. However, despite the robustly delivered action and an interesting big-name cast helming it, this core idea sadly falls to the straightforward storytelling of patriotic heroism and a weak script which often has it's actors talking through bombastic poster taglines and not really much else. 
 
Saying that though, there's obviously a reason why Bruckheimer attached himself to the film, maybe it's the core material based on Doug Stanton's novel 12 Horses, or perhaps it's the bravery of a dirty dozen who take a chance and fight back - it could also be the chance to do something other than the recently botched plotting of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. It could, in fact, be all of them that gained his attraction, the attraction of Danish first-time director Nicolai Fuglsig and the talented cast. Chris Hemsworth (taking a break from the MCU) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, a man with limited combat experience, who's mostly bunged-up behind a desk, he and his trusty lieutenant (Michael Shannon) are given the task to fight in Afghanistan where they'll be tied with their foreign general (Navid Negahban). 
 
While the sandy dozen tour through the gorgeous desert backdrop, there are a few Sergio Leone-ish action scenes - of horse, guns, tanks and giant explosions clashing together. It's an entertaining war-drama which has keen intentions happily carried through its core performances - sadly the action, though stunning, especially with an explosion taking up half the screen, it isn't anything we haven't already seen before. And it's that thinking where the action often falls to repetition, it's almost as if the editor left during production and recycled the same material. 
 
Still, that said, 12 Strong boasts stunning cinematography, a big name producer and a hefty cast all with brilliant performances there's even a surprise dramatic turn by Rob Riggle. All are big with their intentions to grasp the powerful premise and to grasp the true intentions of bravery from the core material - yet the truth is the film sadly loses another point for lacking in characterization. Indeed it has problems through its forgettable plot it's an entirely brazen film that comes with power, the determination of odds and a strong heart. 
 
VERDICT Invigorating action and a solid cast lead in this fact-based war film that sadly loses its way from limited character a soft core and an underwhelming story.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Once more into the breach,"The easiest way to approach TWELVE STRONG is to note Jerry Bruckheimer's name on the credits and sit back and think ""It's only a movie, Ingrid."" It doesn't appear to have had a TOP GUN impact on the public or their perception of the Afghanistan war. The more I watched it, the more familiar it became. I found that I've been here before feeling disturbing.Valiant but ridiculously out numbered white guys sort out vicious Arab oppressors with a bit of help from the locals. That's the WW1 Dunsterforce, which Rudyard Kipling drew on for his ""Stalky & Company"" stories, or Lawrence of Arabia served up as Alec Guiness in Terence Rattigan's ""Ross"" or Peter O'Toole in the David Lean movie. Taking Mazar-i-Sharif from the undefended flank is particularly close. Does history repeat itself or is this a narrative that the ever diligent military message machine finds particularly convenient? The real outcome of the Afghanistan campaign is a bad match.This one starts off with the parallel of ruthless Taliban Commander Arshia Mandavi executing a hapless village woman, in the presence of the girl whose forbidden education she has continued beyond the age of eight, and the Twin Towers attack. Though he has completed his tour, right thinking Captain Chris Hemsworth abandons one of those nice, leafy homes and families, that admirable characters in U. S. TV drama seem to occupy, and has himself re-allocated to his Green Beret Team, after his battle hardened N. C. O. Michael Shannon has a word with hard ass Col. William Fichtner. The Brass say they've got six weeks to save the Northern Alliance but Captain Hemsworth has studied Russian campaign intelligence and knows that the winter will make the operation impossible after three. He flies out with his racially diverse crew (the unit photo on the end is notably more ethnically uniform).Once they get there, it is of course that same narrative - guys on horses vs. Machine guns, tanks and rocket launchers. Of course they can call on their air superiority. The film works in some nice incidental touches, probably lifted from the original Doug Stanton book. The Norther Alliance ally Navid Negahban taunts his Taliban opposite number on the walkie-talkie. The friendlies send a teenage boy with a carbine to look after the radio operator.Then we get to pay dirt, with the good guys joining the charge into battle, blazing away from the saddle with light machine guns, facing bad hats waiting furtively behind rocks and walls and loading the rocket launchers that are inflicting non fatal injuries on our heroes. I couldn't spot the animatronic horses. Scandinavian commercials director Nicolai Fuglsig is right on top of his game on his first film. Battle action panoramas are cheer worthy, mixing travellings and drone shots, with blasts throwing still writhing bodies in the air.We end with the heroic U. S. officer with the Australian accent burying a fragment of the Twin Towers in Afghan soil. I'm sure the draft-age boys who are the film's primary target are stirred. I wonder what the actual soldiers think of it. So, if it's is a suspect representation of history, this one can't be faulted as propaganda.However there is a third criterion. Despite all the admirable performance talent and great image making, dramatic form is lacking. Once again the action set pieces and thoughtful interludes (""this is Afghanistan. There are no right choices. You will be liberators if you leave and enemies if you stay"") could be re-arranged in most any order and be as coherent. 12 STRONG reaches us late night on Ethnic TV without anyone seemingly paying much attention. It ends up being a venture mainly of interest to thesis writers on about perceptions of the Twenty First Century, an audience for which the makers have no sympathy. I can't really feel sorry about that.",,Anonymous,History
old style war movie,"Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) had gotten a desk job for his family. When America is attacked on 9/11, he pushes to retract from his reassignment to lead his men into the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) is his veteran Chief Warrant Officer. The squad of twelve men joins one of the competing Northern Alliance leaders, Dostum.This is old style patriotic militarism and it does it well. Hemsworth plays the blonde godlike hero. There is plenty of war action. My biggest complaint is the constant need to get Mitch in the middle of the gun battles. Dostum is needlessly reckless to the point of suicidal. The fighting is geared to be cinematic rather than being realistic. They literally walk into traps more than once. There is one scene where dozen of men carry their weapons offering to surrender. For some unknown reason, the Americans stupidly walk out of their fighting positions into exposed ground. It makes the Americans look bad to do something so dumb. A better way is to have one child soldier surrendering and then set off the booby-trap.

It only happened in other countries.The attitude was that Afghanistan had to be taken and the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had to be dealt with. The goal was to get Bin Laden and correct the injustice the Taliban were inflicting onto their own people. The History Channel only broadcast shows about the Taliban every week, back when it was basically Pentagon propaganda and not a reality TV/bad history drama station.There was basically no effort to let anyone know this was 2001. Anything from CRT monitors, cellphones to cultural oddities, hairstyles, was left out.Unfortunately, like Black Hawk Down, the movie, I think this was basically another Pentagon sponsored movie focused on being Army recruiting and war promotion to the public than telling a truthful story. Nonfiction war novels are far more honest and gritty, unfortunately. Maybe I'll pick this book up, but this didn't pass the smell test.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie. Watch if you love America,"Accurate?-read for yourself the story. Pretty close but obviously a dramatization. Draws you in early with the emotions of 9/11.

"Much better than expected, though themes now awfully moot","I went into this movie with a high degree of trepidation as the title and casting of Hemsworth made me expect some braindead piece of jingoistic propaganda aimed at getting young people into the recruiting office. Instead, it's a fairly straightforward account of one of the least-discussed (and most successful, albeit temporarily) military operations in history, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM albeit with a strong moral stance running throughout.Somewhat fictionalized, especially in terms of the climactic charge against a Katyusha launcher in which the film gloriously tosses all realism it had built to that point completely out the window, 12 STRONG manages to retain some educational value. We get to learn how valuable the CIA intel collection and alliance management was during the first few months of the Afghan Invasion and how it was the Northern Alliance Militias doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of ground combat & losses. The overwhelming American advantage comes with bombs from the sky, though the film doesn't ever explain why close air support (ie. Helicopters and C130 gunships) never play a part in the fighting. Even so, there is some tension during the gun battles once the enemy finds American positions and gets in too close for bombs to help.My main complaint is that the cast and characters largely feel throwaway aside from Hemsworth and General Dostum. Thankfully once Dostum enters the film, it largely orbits the relationship between the two. Dostom gets in one really nice line toward the end about the choice between being a coward and an enemy, and overall the actor's performance feels on-target and genuine. Without his character, the film would get a few stars deducted for sure.The sad thing about this film is that all the heroism (on the part of the soldiers and militia) and villainy (on the part of the Taliban) on display, due to more recent historical events, feels completely wasted and moot at this point. 20 years after the events depicted, the anti-Taliban militias now are in a far worse place than they were before the conflict with all its commanders in exile, in hiding, or apprehended. The context puts a sour taste in the mouth of the viewer, understanding that not only was all this sacrifice for nothing, but ultimately left America's enemies far stronger than they otherwise would have been. I suppose you could say that for most Vietnam War movies as well, though generally those films try to be more anti-war and personal stories of character growth, rather than a celebration of freedom over tyranny.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The battle scenes are intense as well as captivating. They illicit true fear and emotion. Hemsworth and the cast do a great job. My only quibble comes from how the story was told. It's very procedural in its delivery. I wanted to learn more about these men as people and wanted to feel the rage of the era. Meaning, I wanted to feel/remember how the country was angry over the cowardly attacks of 9/11 and how everyone was willing to sacrifice anything to combat the dastardly attack and to make those responsible pay. I can't say the movie does a good job in either of those efforts. More set up was in order and more development of depth was needed to do these remarkable men justice. Yet, it's great to see this actual story receiving attention and the heroes being portrayed as such.",,Anonymous,History

I just wasn't sure how this could be any different than every other conflict-based movie in the Middle East.Turns out, it was worth my time.
Chris Hemsworth proves himself again as an actor that can do both serious and comedy roles in equal manner. The next step is to see him play the bad guy in a few roles. Shed that good-guy skin.Navid Negahban as General Dostum is also a main highlight. A very natural actor with lots of character.That this is based on true events is impressive, although I still think the end of the road showdown (with no American casualties) was a tad over the top.
Am I to believe that they managed to shoot every moving and stationary target while speeding on horseback through a heavily armed and outnumbered war zone? Especially as they've only been riding horses for just 2 weeks.

"Decent entertaining movie, but propaganda","If you leave aside politics, this movie is quite decent, entertaining and deserves the rating it currently has (6.6 out of 10.)However, if you keep in mind the political context (""war"" against terrorism, need to justify 2300+ deaths of american soldiers, 20k+ wounded soldiers, 2.1 trillions USD spent on this war, racism that is increasing in the US, the need to ""make America great again"", the need to recruit soldiers, and difficulties to do it) you must admit that the way this movie narrates this part of history is pure propaganda.Don't be fooled, this movie is an excellent example of how entertainment can be used to brainwash the population of a country. US people need strong and invincible heroes and need to see their soldiers come back from hell unharmed. This will allow the army to recruit new soldiers, justify past, current political decisions and futures ones.If you don't agree with this opinion, fine. But then tell me why they choose to have a black actor and a hispanic one to play ODA 595 soldiers.

America's self-delusions in a nutshell,"It's fortunate, in a way, that this came out before the American and Allied withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Going in to other people's countries and bombing them flat - which, for all the horse schtick, is essentially what happens - is not a good look. It's like if Lawrence of Arabia had been a corn-fed American football player, with no knowledge of local language or customs, a B-52 up his sleeve, and no interest in what happened to the country after he left.

Wonderful true story film.,"12 Strong is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie based on true events that took place days following the World Trade Center collapse where US military men were sent to launch an attack against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The 12 special forces unit were the first on the ground to gain momentum in the war and retake couple cities under their control. The team is headed by Captain Mitch Nelson played by Chris Hemsworth who befriends General Destum played by Navid Negahban. Destum is now the VP of his country and to this day both men have remained friends. US military thought they would be able to take the cities in three years but Captain Nelson got it done in less than six weeks and he didn't lose a soldier in any of the battles.

Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Morning - 12 Strong. This is the true story of the first special forces unit inserted deep into enemy territory in Afghanistan after the events of 9-11. Forced to work with an Afghan Warlord who is part of the Northern Alliance, Captain Mitch Nelson leads his team into hell. Superbly shot this film tells us of the soldiers on horses who fight against tanks and rocket launchers in a desperate tale of defence, attack and revenge. Once again I'm drawn into thinking about the role the horse plays in societies around the world and through the ages. This wasn't War Horse, these horses didn't even have names, but you have to admire the way they gallop headlong down mountains on the roughest terrain into battles not of their making, yet time and time again they give their all. A superb cast led by Chris Hemsworth as Mitch, this is not a story of any one hero, this is a team of 12 who went into combat determined to return home together. This kind of action film is the best, because it's based on a true story it makes you think more about the images you see on the screen.

Soldiers who have just retired from active service for an office job demanding they be let back to active service after 9/11. Spouses unhappy that their husbands are going into a dangerous situation etc...It does keep you interested, although my attention struggled near to the end.

Does justice in many flattering levels,"'12 strong' is truly iconic in its own way of paying homage to the war heroes who are famously known as 'Horse soldiers'
The film also serves as a portrait for how a religion will be manipulated by evil willed people to justify the fake minded toxic manipulative realities.
The film is layered with good performances by its cast.
Navid Negahban who plays General Dostum manages to outshine the main lead Captain Nelson played by Chris Hemsworth particularly with an effortless investive performance.
The first quarter of the film might feel like a bit too slow paced where the war strategies are formulated but hang in there because the film would definitely serve as a good enough War film leading up to the climax with as many as shooting sequences that you would expect.
Apart from the fact that the flow of the plot takes too much time in the first half to show the viewers how the war strategies are laid out where it almost loses the consistent momentum I didn't come across any other place where the delivery of this heroic story fell flat.

Yet another war movie about a manly men doing manly things. Yay! Yay. Yay?,"Where have all the real men gone, some have asked. Well, they have moved onto the silver screen, to star in movies about modern American war, of course.There has been a notable number of these lately, so the real men are almost constantly busy. And here comes another one, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer no less.""12 Strong"" starts, well, strong and has all the hallmarks of what has made him the legendary Hollywood action producer that he has been for more than 30 years now.To state it more clearly, it's so Bruckheimer, it will bite you in the ass. No one does this patriotic shit quite as well as Bruck! All the American warriors going to Afghanistan are so patriotic and macho in a good way (yet tender and loving to their families) than you can't help but like and respect them.The cast is very nice too, starting with the star Chris Hemsworth who has gathered fame with all these hot ""Thor"" superhero movies and always makes a good action man because of his buffed-up body and tendency to look slightly mad when his face is covered by dust, grease and/or blood... which tends to happen in war movies.There can only be one hero, of course, but we have also Michael Peña and William Fichtner (the always solid supporting men), and, er, all the other ones making up the American or local armed forces.And then there's Michael Shannon, thinking man's Hollywood star. As an actor, he's always had the best of both worlds really - this larger than life presence that just commands the attention when he's on screen but he's also smart and intelligent, being able to do any kind of project he damn well pleases.There's not enough of him in ""12 Strong"", because producers think Hemsworth needs to be central to everything, but then again, is there ever?Having watched some, you may notice that for a war movie, there's not a lot of action. In fact, you don't get any battles some 55 minutes have passed from the beginning.It's not just that war movies are notoriously expensive, the story is also character-based, so the emphasis is on the team members, their state of mind and relationship with local allied warriors who fight the same war but for very different reasons and with a different attitude.We see how being in a battlefield is, all this dust and mostly waiting and sitting around in your army pants, waiting for something to happen (which sounds a lot like my 20's, minus the dust and army pants).Then the battles happen, and I gotta say, they turn out to be not the strongest part of ""12 Strong"". I mean, they are as visually attractive as they come these days, but not standing out in any significant way, except maybe the good work of make-up department creating wounds on the bodies of actors. In short, nothing we haven't seen before enough times.The suspension never rises high enough because the American soldiers are mostly invulnerable and don't carry heavy losses.How invested can you be in a firefight where you just know that ""our guys"" are gonna be left standing? It feels like a videogame, not a authentic chaos of war.Sadly, the story which is meant to be the strongest part of ""12 Strong"" is actually not that strong too. It's always a'ight, but not delving deep enough into the characters or their relationships with local allies (although the contrast of two sides is one of the most important points in the story). Which makes it surprising to see how friendly they are in the end.Ultimately, it's perfectly OK war movie but it doesn't distinguish itself enough in any significant way, to really offer more than two hours worth of passive watching.The stakes might have been high in real life (it's based on true story), but they sure are only middling on the screen.I wish they'd used the original title ""Horse Soldiers"", it's more intriguing. But I guess ""12 Strong"" is a cleaner and better fit for a mainstream project.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A missed opportunity,"12 STRONG had an interesting premise going for it - the true life, just released, top secret mission of the first Special Forces unit to be deployed in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attack. All set to conduct ""traditional"" warfare, these soldiers must learn to adapt to a different sort of war being waged in the caves and cliffs surrounding them - including fighting tanks while on horseback!And...with charismatic screen performers like Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, and (especially) Michael Shannon, the ingredients were there for a strong film.Unfortunately, Director Nicolai Fuglsig (in what is, in essence, his big screen debut as a Director) and Writers Ted Tally and Peter Craig squander this opportunity and present a fairly bland, fairly generic action/adventure flick reminiscent of the Chuck Norris Vietnam flicks of the 1980's (like MISSING IN ACTION or THE DELTA FORCE).Not only that, but with a film entitled 12 STRONG, you would expect the 12 soldiers to be an interesting group of characters (a la THE DIRTY DOZEN or ALIENS), unfortunately, this should have been called Chris Hemsworth plus 3 and a bunch of glorified extras. The lion's share of this film follows Hemsworth's rookie Captain develop into a ""warrior"". This is an interesting character played by a charismatic actor and would have been more interesting had we not spent a vast majority of the film with him. After awhile I wanted to yell at the screen - ""All right! I get it! He has to learn how to kill without losing his humanity"". Also featured in this group are Michael Pena as the ""Gung-Ho GI"" of the group (with a smart mouth, of course) and Trevante Rhodes (following his breakout performance in MOONLIGHT) who befriends a young, local boy (you can guess how that goes). Both of these character arcs play out rather predictably. But the biggest sin in this film is the misuse of the great Michael Shannon as the 2nd in command. Perhaps Shannon's schedule did not allow more use of him, but he was barely in this film and what time he was used it was well below his abilities of an actor - a major disappointment.To this film some slack, the action is serviceable which makes it worth watching - an element that elevates this mediocre film to something just north of that.If you're looking for an escape from the January cold, you could do worse, an enjoyable - enough - 2 hours in the theater.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,History

Good actors appear here like Michael Shannon & Michael Pena but they're not given much to do but shoot their weapons & look like warriors doing it.

"Good but, it could have been so much better.","12 Strong tells the true story of a group of soldiers, who are part of an elite task force. Post the horrific events of 9/11, these soldiers are sent to Afghanistan. Now, Captain Mitch Nelson(Chris Hemsworth) & his comrades have to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. They take the help of an Afghan warlord.12 Strong is a great film. Director Nicolai Fuglsig has given us a thrilling war movie. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. The main flaw of the movie is, it takes some time to pick up the pace. It can get really slow, at times. The cast has done a memorable job. Chris Hemsworth is spectacular as Captain Mitch Nelson. It is refreshing to see Hemsworth play a regular character, after portraying Thor multiple times. Michael Shannon is outstanding as Hal Spencer. Michael Pena is brilliant as Sam Diller. Navid Negahban is superb as General Dostum. Trevante Rhodes is good as Ben Milo. Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbull, Austin Hebert, Austin Stowell, Ben O'Toole, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Rob Riggle & William Fichtner are fantastic as Sean Coffers, Vern Michaels, Pat Essex, Fred Falls, Scott Black, Kevin Jackson, Bill Bennett, Charles Jones, Lt.

an entertaining and compelling story of real-life heroism,"""12 Strong"" (R, 2:10), is also known as ""12 Strong: The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers"", which tells Movie Fans much of what they need to know in deciding whether or not to see the film. Here's the rest of what you probably need to know: These 12 Army special forces soldiers (played by, among others, Chris Hemsworth, Michael Peña, the great Michael Shannon, Trevante Rhodes and the underrated Geoff Stults) become the first American troops to strike back against the Taliban in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Barely a month after the Towers came down, two Army officers (Rob Riggle and William Fichtner) choose this group of men to link up with a northern Afghan warlord (Navid Negahban) to attack the important city of Mazar-e-Sharif. / This film has a lot in common (and compares very well with) another film released in mid-January of 2016, ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"". Both films give us heroes to cheer for and plenty of intense action, while mining the backgrounds of the men involved - and their complex interpersonal relationships - for considerable emotional impact. ""12 Strong"" is thrilling, entertaining, heart-felt and serves as a great reminder of the courage and determination of the men and women who defend the homeland by fighting overseas.

But it's so cliched and unrealistic I hardly got excited. Except for the horseback charges - it's always exciting to watch people on fast galloping horses, despite the stupidity of them all being bullet-proof under close automatic weapon fire, the most obvious silliness of the film.This is one of those movies with inane shoot-em-up scenes where six of our heroes run into open scenes under fire from hundreds of bad guys shooting, and bizarrely, the bad guys all die and the heroes never get hit. After ducking for cover, any one of our heroes is able to step out from behind cover and stand up and bang bang bang kill a whole lot of baddies who are firing at him. But we're so familiar with bullet-proof American gunslinger good-guy from 1950s Westerns, so you kind-of can ignore this as dramatic licence.But then our guys call in B52s to drop bombs from 32,000 feet that fall directly on the Afghan enemy, and watching from nearby (!), a few minutes later our guys walk in vicctoriously to peruse all the dead bad guys. In reality, the real ODA 595 special forces group ""in one 18-hour battle, ... destroyed over 20 armored and 20 support vehicles"". ""They guided hundreds of GPS-guided 2,000-pound JDAM precision-guided munitions dropped by... heavy bombers onto Taliban and Al-Qaeda positions near Mazar-i-Sharif"".

-Army Of OneWith the new year starting, 12 strong opens the gate for action movies this January. Fans of military dramas will be entertained by the fast pace of the film, outside the first hour, once the bombs and guns begin to roar. Interspersed between the battles, is a rich dialogue that is broken into categories that represent: natural conversation between teammates, military jargon to get you caught up in the action, and more importantly an honorable exchange of words that represent cultures well. The messages in this movie are charge up with the special effects of Hollywood, and with it a great presentation of the cultural dynamics in war. And of course, there is plenty of action to keep things intense and exciting, laden with all the war time theatrics that portray the American Hero we all love to see. 
 Sadly, 12 Strong suffers from too little editing and trying to get everything into one movie. Much of the length comes from trying to cover every detail of the war, including such small gimmicks as an air drop gone wrong. These moments are immersive, but add little to the movie that couldn't be read in a book. Any details of the soldiers' lives are rushed over, feeling incomplete and irrelevant to the story, a shame given that these components could have helped each member of the team stand out. Unfortunately, the cast of this movie look very similar, with only a few visual features to help them stand out from each other. Chris Hemsworth is the man who gets most of the attention, with the studio relying quite heavily on him in both character development and action fields. The other members got their pitches in, but they weren't as strong as the captain of the group. 
 While not the best war movie to grace the silver screen, it still has plenty of theater worthy qualities that make this worth a visit. It's an exciting, special effects spectacle complete with cultural prowess and band of brotherhood moments that you like to see in these movies. And while it paints the pictures of heroes, the movie needed some more fine tuning to really get all 12 heroes the portrayal they deserved. A little more development and a little less time at the opening may have further strengthened this movie, but ha good shot nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Solid And Satisfying,"We were going to see The Post but I changed my mind when I read that the story of the Pentagon Papers was basically presented as the WaPo owner's dilemma and not a journalism thriller. Meh. So we saw this because I like a good war movie based on a true story, which this is. It didn't disappoint. Is it Saving Private Ryan level good? No. While the battle scenes are intense, it isn't as unsparing and conflicted as SPR. They have a mission and you cheer them on to fulfill it, end of. The acting is very good, even if it seems the director could have asked more of them. The humor could have been a bit darker, but it's still deftly handled and genuine. I love the actor who plays the Northern Alliance leader, and how he and Hemsworth's character evolve in their relationship. And the final battle scene is crazy!!! Horses and modern weaponry together? Yeah, it's wild. Again, it's not a brilliant war film, but it is a well-done, engaging movie with rousing action scenes and heroes you can root for. Worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Can't understand the negative rates!,"I assume most of you didn't even hear about this TRUE STORY exactly after the ""9/11"" Disaster in NY.USA secretly gave the ""green light"" to instant response and the goal was to give a major blow to ""Al Kaida"" in Afganistan. The plot/plan was a massive military operation that would took place TWO YEARS in Afganistan - but President Bush wanted something faster/sooner. So the Pentagon had a SUICIDE mission plan - to send a tiny attack force of Special Forces to Afganistan and join the local warlords against ""Al Kaida"". They chose the notorious ""ODA 595"", the ""5th Special Forces Group"" (the most decorated Special Forces unit of USA).So, just a dozen ""Green Beret"" men, left to Afganistan and remained there for almost a month, to give this fast blow to the Talibans.It was a suicide mission; nobody thought just 12 guys (even Special Forces) they can do what... a TWO YEARS plan was about to do!But... against all odds, they did it!What's most funny or odd or hillarious... is watching these Special Forces men ...attacking/charging ON HORSES, like... cavalry!""Hollywood did it again"", right?

As well - I was not aware of this first effort in the US response to September 11 and the quasi collaborative approach to an attempt on Al Qaeda. Nice to know. 
Otherwise the plot is just a handwritten-on-a-napkin approach to a logistically complicated effort without any depth - Action! - special Forces Identified, 9/11 happens, sad goodbye to family, insertion to country, three campaigns to deliver air support, bad guy identified by killing women, good guy suffers sucking chest wound, bad guy gets it, everyone makes it out alive, warm hello to family, actual group photo during credits - scene! 
One hopes that eventually the likes of Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick and Coppola will bring their warcraft to these middle eastern operations - ( though we do have Three Kings, Zero Dark Thirty and Restrepo ) but this was never WWII or vietnam - this was ""war during pokemon and Halo II"" - a better story than 12 strong has been told by Phil Klay's ""redeployment"" and in such tales I believe we will find the seminal storylines of the Bush era wars.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Would've/Should've Been In Better Hands,"The devil is in the details, as is the magic that makes movies amazing, mesmerizing, and even classic. 12 Strong, while a serviceable movie, misses those marks by not lending to the project the care and respect that many OEF/OIF stories to film before it have. This story should have been put in better hands than it was and Jerry Bruckheimer should be near shame honestly.The writing is fairly spot on in squad/platoon/team banter and dynamics, but character development, or even background, is basically non-existent. The rest feels bland and uninspired, which given there is an actual book for source material seems a bit lazy, if not downright disrespectful. The acting is average to above average in spots. And you can certainly tell most of them were never given actual training on operator movements, weapon systems, mannerisms, etc. Bad guys die in exactly the same poses and animations multiple times over. Good guys seem to fire indiscriminately. And no one EVER reloads their damn weapon. Except one time an hour and forty five minutes in. Effects and cinematography both range from great to complete B-movie levels. And the editing is garbage. Inconsistent shot to shot makeup, adding/subtracting sounds where unnecessary, time dilation errors.. you name it and an editing sin was committed.Like I said, the details.This movie with someone like Peter Berg, or god forbid Michael Bay (13 Hours), at the helm would have been far higher on the pegs of critique.

"Biased, too long, western propaganda.","I'm a European, but this is a massive U.S. popaganda against Middle East and Islam. 
Literally everyone in 2018 knows that 9/11 was an inside job so now they come up with these stupid movies to make people think it was real.
As a movie it's definitely watchable, albeit a tad too long with somewhat under-developed characters and a predictable plot with a classic happy-ending.
Very biased and scripted to ""hit"" the audience with a clear message, although a fake one. Feeding the machine with an artificial threat.
All in all, another cover-up movie about The War on Terror scripted to justify U.S. invading Afganistan.
Woah, and that precise shooting from M4 in one hand while riding a horse.....
4-5/10, merely from movie perspective, ideologically and emotionally it'd be lower",5.0,Anonymous,History
Could have completely avoided Iraq and Afghanistan war.,Based on the most frustrating failed mission in US history.

Do not waste your time,"This movie is simply bad. Acting, direction,editing,FX is bad. Writing is abysmal.
They marketed it as another Black Hawk down but we got a Z rate movie about some SF dudes who came to Afghanistan, threw some bombs, did some sightseeing and that is it.

Brilliant action.,"This was a movie full of action and that's what the main agenda is, I think that Hemsworth maid a solid lead, and was phenomenal in a movie which mainly focused on the action.

Not Great,"I watched this recently and thought i was going to be in for a treat but unfortunately i was dissapointed.Before i watched this movie i did not read any reviews, however i did view the trailors available and i also thought with such a great cast i would be rating this film with at least a 7/10.I rated this film 5/10 because i thought the direction was poor, Michael Shannon who i am a big fan of done a decent job as did Chris Hemsworth too but i just felt there was something missing throughout this movie.I had a look at who directed this film and i have never heard of Nicolai Fugslig, moreover he has done practically nothing in the film industry compared to other directors so i,m a tad surprised he got this job.Its bad to think that i also reckon this movie might not even have made it to the theatre if it wasn't for seasoned actors like Michael Shannon.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Way better then the other reviews would have you believe,"Thoroughly enjoyable- you know what your in for- Patriotism and explosions, which were all well executed.

Great story ruined by comic book like action scenes,"I was looking forward to this and hoped it would be something beyond the typical Hollywood hooah. Americans are cast as superheroes and Taliban as easy targets. For me, having done a tour in Afghanistan, this kind of ruined the film and just made it all a bit of a joke. For example, the actors playing the Americans stand up every time they fire their rifle, walk into the enemy encampment without any sort of recon and do it all without can helmet. A bit laughable. Too bad because the story was good obviously and it could have been made into a really authentic and deeply patriotic movie. Check out 9th company if you want a production that tried to add some realism.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Technically brilliant action adventure movie,"I am old enough to have a vivid memory of the historic events that are described in this movie. I remember 9/11. I remember following the news every day after. That makes this movie interesting from a historic perspective. It kind of takes me behind the headlines I remember so well from back then. However, I think this movie is best viewed as an action adventure movie, rather than a documentary style war movie. If you expect the latter...then maybe you will be disappointed. If you expext the former, this movie will take you on a hell of a ride. The movie offers intense action sequences. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the cinematography and the brooding score. This movie looks amazing. Its interesting, because I had to look up who did the cinematography. And it turns out its the same guy who also did the cinematography for The Dark Tower, a movie I reviewed last week and where I also pointed out the stunning cinematography. This guy is amazing. Same goes for the director and music composer. What a talented group of people who created this movie. I think the bad reviews must be from people having the wrong expectations. Dont expect a war documentary. This is not Restrepo. Expect a technically brilliant action adventure war movie that will take you on a dark, intense, brooding and breathtaking ride to hell and back",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good actors let down by appalling dialogue,"This is another one for the flag wavers. 12 Strong is the story of a Green Beret unit which helped Afghani warlords defeat Taliban and Al Qaeda forces to take a strategically important town in the very early days of the US-Afghanistan war.First time director Nicolai Fuglsig was a war correspondent in Kosovo, so his experiences no doubt lend some realism to the action scenes; of which there are plenty. However, his inexperience as a director, or perhaps the producers' desire for a return on the budget, reduce this film to a forgettable mash of bombs, bullets and fragile egos.
 
Michael Shannon is IMO one of the best character actors since Philip Seymour Hoffman. He has no opportunity to show his skill here, with some of the worst lines he will probably utter in his entire career being his standout moments in this film.Michael Pena reprises the role he's been playing repeatedly since the early 90s: a gung-ho soldier who loves his country. Trevante Rhodes gets lumped with all the most cringeworthy scenes. Navid Negahban provides us with the Pashto version of ""Hasta la vista, baby"". And Chris Hemsworth is Chris Hemsworth.This sums to a film where instead of being immersed in the action, we are frequently reminded we a re watching a film when dumb characters say dumb lines. If you are a fan of Thor et al, then you will probably find this film enthralling. If you have never seen a good war film, I would recommend watching Gettysburg or Das Boot instead; two films which didn't treat the audience like morons.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Truly Laughable Cliché-fest,"I'm not usually a fan of 1 out of 10 ratings, especially for classic or well respected movies. It's perfectly reasoable to give low ratings to any movie based on reasoned criticism, but when people call Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, ""The worst movie of all time"", they lose all credibility. Even if you hate some critically acclaimed movie, it's ridiculous hyperbole to call it the worst movie. After watching 12 Strong ... maybe I was wrong.It's hard to believe that a modern, big budget action movie could be this bad. I'll leave it to knowledgeable military people to point out the almost silly portrayals of battle. The, oh so obvious ambushes that they would walk into, but somehow be victorious anyway.The dialogue is non-stop ""action movie"" cliché banter that never rises above adolescent humor. Like others have said, only simplistic portrayals of Americans as super cool, handsome, sharp shooters, filled with buckets of over confidence, bravery, and witty repartee. While Afghans are reluctant fighters who switch allegiance constantly, concerned only with self-preservation. Also, they are sneaky and can't be trusted.Oh, and just for good measure, civilians in the Defense Dept. don't know anything about real combat and make absurd comments. Of course, all the soldiers promised their wife and children that they would come home very soon and couldn't possibly get killed and, ""Dammit, I'm not gonna break that promise.""",2.0,Anonymous,History

Great final battle but the rest mehhhh!,"With A-Stars leading and B-Stars supporting 12 Strong looked like the movie of January sadly it ain't, had hopes from the great trailer but got let down by the movie itself, felt like those SUPER AMERICAN war movies but with no fighting at all. The whole 2hours is way too long with nothing actually really happening.... At least the 10 last minutes kind of saved the film, the big fight at the end was what we wanted from the movie, what we saw in the trailer but sadly this is the only great scenes we had. Was a great concept but let down because of how boring it was, too long not what the audience wanted and waste of great actors, the movie had potential but delivered it only in it last 10min, and you don't review a film for 10mins of it. So basically the cast are great but don't have that much screentime, only Hemsworth (Thor) has screentime and all he does of it is great yet what he asked to do in the movie is bad, his character is bad and doesn't do much interesting things just thinks and talks that's it! Don't go watch that movie if you're hoping for a big war movie it ain't it feels more like a documentary which isn't bad but wasn't what I wanted to see.

 I enjoy war movies, however, this movie is not on par with most other movies of this genre, they say based on a true story, but is overly exaggerated to the point of being unrealistic, and I doubt the falling of al Qaeda was relying on...12 soldiers...This movie could have and should have been a lot better, with better acting, (the acting was horrible and fake), more of a storyline, and even the fighting scenes were obvious cpu generated...really am disappointed and let down.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Every American war film is like every American war film.....,"Every American war film, in my experience, is like every other American war film. 
Its the same basic premise, with much the same context and underlying attitude. That is an exaggerated belief in the ""righteousness"" of the cause, married up to conceited obnoxious key characters who have a sense of ownership and entitlement, that puts them at odds with pretty much everyone they meet.12 Strong is no exception. The main characters are loud, rude and generally really, really unlikable. Its hard to empathise with them or feel any genuine interest in them, especially given the historical context used yet again to justify their presence in Afghanistan. 9/11 was a led by Saudi nationals not Afghans but because the US is inextricably tied to Saudi through the petro dollar the poor Afghans drew the short straw. Of course this is never mentioned.Instead our ""hero's"" go about their heroic business in formulaic style.The action scenes are predictable but well done but really there's little more on offer here. Of course, given there never seems to be any departure from the general script, that's to be expected.Take a look but don't expect anything you have not seen before. 5/10 from me.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Great actors in a TV movie,"There is no doubt that this is a good cast. If the story is true then I respect all involved.

Very lazy writing.The film is very dumbed down and the scenes clonk together. The action is dull and the scenes are messy and confusing. The logic is baffling and the tension is non-existent.After lots of pathetic non effective bombing runs you are left with a messy poorly filmed climax.
