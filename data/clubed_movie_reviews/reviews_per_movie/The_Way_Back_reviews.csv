Epic Survival Tale,"This is a film for people who appreciate epic landscapes and survivor stories. It has some engaging characters but not brilliant dialogue or complicated characters. Mostly, it is a visual film, displaying the vulnerability of a few people in a harsh, vast, beautiful landscape. They must depend on each other, and they develop an intimacy based on their shared struggle rather than on deep conversations and emotional revelations, or at least, not until a young girl joins them. Weir seems to be commenting on the yin yang of masculinity/femininity at times in this film. I also liked the subtle underlying commentary on the brutal oppression of the Soviet regime under Stalin.All of the actors were good; Farrell adds a touch of humor, Sturgess portrays anguish well, and Harris is a good tough old guy--his usual persona. By the way, Manohla Dargis in The New York Times complains that Farrell is too good-looking to be a Russian gangster. What this assessment is based on I can't imagine; doubt Dargis hangs with Russian gangsters.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"An epic, exquisitely shot and harrowing adventure about survival and the pursuit of freedom","So the book has been proved false. Does this mean that the ""true story"" isn't true after all? There have been many claims by others that it is fact instead of fiction. Whatever - it doesn't matter, Peter Weir's ""The Way Back"", this movie about that book, which tells the tale of gulag escapees and their harrowing journey to freedom, is a well-told and inspiring tale than anything else.All of the actors are terrific in their roles - Jim Sturgess as the de- facto leader of the bunch, showing a more improved and mature side to his acting since ""21""; Ed Harris as the gruff American Smith, who is hard-edged and iron-willed until he eventually befriends...; Saiorse Ronan as Irene, the runaway girl who joins them on their quest - Ronan here shows a perfect balance of various emotions while not overdoing it like many child stars her age... she definitely is one of the best young actresses today; Colin Farrell as the violent yet humorous soldier who protects the team from danger in Siberia and provides comic relief when needed - Farrell shows that he can be tough yet likable at the same time without being completely overblown and shows his versatility as an actor; European actors Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Potocean, Sebastian Urzendowsky and Gustaf Skarsgård round off the remaining escapees and they all acted great in their respective and differing roles. The chemistry between all of the actors at parts are great.Having said that, the film's only flaw is that it sacrificed substantial characterization for realism and visual spectacles. The characters are thinly but not overly so fleshed out, and the interactions between them are short before the next walking shot. But when it comes to realism and believability the film succeeds. I was surprised when I saw National Geographic was one of the co-producers of the film, but I wasn't as soon as I saw how realistic the depictions of survival the characters did in the film. Men will do anything to escape to freedom, and the determination and spirit to survive in a harsh and unforgiving natural world, is what Weir and his script is trying to say, but the walking parts are written in masterful detail that any line of dialog may ruin it, so silence is sometimes golden in these parts. The screenplay also challenges the usual Hollywood clichés that usually are found in this film genre, and it transforms them into better, more realistic and sometimes unsettling situations.Production-wise, the film is a triumph. The production design is great and makes extremely well use of real locations. The cinematography by Russell Boyd is dazzling, simply marvelous, it is wide, sweeping and epic, with lush scenery of forests, deserts and the snow-peaked Himalayas exquisitely shot throughout. The wide cinematography makes the experience even more harrowing thanks to Lee Smith's fluid and crisp editing and Burkhard Dallwitz's great music score and terrific music timing - Dallwitz and Weir know when and how music/sound can be used in a scene, and that sometimes, silence is crucial to certain moments. Here, Weir uses that silence to terrific and very intense effect, and with his extremely focused direction, manages to being out a very exhilarating and at the same time excruciating (in a good way) experience. So much so that I forgot about the controversy surrounding the ""true story"" and found myself hugely engrossed in the movie, not wanting it to end.In short, the film lightly suffers from lack of proper characterization, but is heavy on almost everything else - acting, directing, cinematography, production value and music. If it had proper characterization, it would have been an instant classic and a contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Still, as it stands, ""The Way Back"" is still an epic adventure; an inspiring, sometimes funny, and often intense and harrowing experience that also proves that Peter Weir is still an ambitious tour-de-force filmmaker.Overall rating: 77/100",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is how it´s done,"This is a wonderful film that is completely unpretentious, has no explosions, maltreated corpses or dramatic emotional outbursts, but a stringent and focused narrative, good camera work and above all great actors, all together as an ensemble. And even though we know that Ed Harris and Colin Farrell are always worth their money, especially Farrell as a Russian criminal is an absolute highlight. How he goes from being brutal, then self-doubting to a social being is very well directed by Peter Weir, but played by Farrell in a truly stunning way. Halfway through the film, a fresh, new color comes into play with Saoirse Ronan. Weir builds up the story well, maybe the hike through the Himalayas is a little too short, but at that point we already understood what drives the small troop of survivalists. A true gem.",8.0,Anonymous,History
love this movie highly recommend.,I think it's always difficult to portray hardship and endurance in films purely because you only experience it for a couple of hours or so. This had me understanding the terrible conditions for real....i think. The search for water in the Gobi desert had me thinking twice about attempting the same thing as a holiday. Make up was fantastic and the bleakness of the scenery was soo beautiful,,Anonymous,History
What an incredible story,"I mean these men escaped a Russian gulag and WALKED 4,000 miles from Siberia to India, come on...So this movie is based on the 1959 memoir ""The Long Walk"" (of which there is some debate over its validity). Regardless I really enjoyed it, the story is incredible and I'd been looking foreword to seeing what they would do in the movie version. Throw in a top notch cast as our Siberian gulag escapees (Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess) and this should have been fantastic. All I can say there is maybe my expectations were too high because honestly I came away a little disappointed, actually preferring the book.The movie itself was very long and kind of jumped around. Granted they had a lot of material to cover as our men escape under cover of a snowstorm and undertake a treacherous journey across thousands of miles of hostile terrain. They face freezing nights, lack of food and water, injuries, mosquitoes, an endless desert, the Himalayas, and moral questions of when to leave someone behind.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and everyone does a great job. Ed Harris is excellent as the American Mr. Smith (love him) and Colin Ferrell (love him a bit more) was awesome as a tattooed gang-style prisoner, with an amazing Russian accent. As a point of interest his character is not in the book. The scenes in the blizzard and the Gobi desert stand out to me and are brutal but well done. 08.11",7.0,Anonymous,History
I will never complain about going on a walk ever again!,"I went with my friends to see this the other day - we picked whatever film was on soonest at the cinema. The Way Back was on...and we went in. I had no idea what the film was about only that I'd heard that ""People walk out of Russia"".This film really had you captivated for the entire journey - and you really connect with the characters within it, so much so you experience their emotions with them - you laugh with them, you are on the verge of tears at moments, and you feel their determination.The acting was great - there were some familiar faces in the likes of Jim Sturgess (21) and Ed Harris (everything else)...and they do very well in their roles. Colin Farrell finds himself taking a respectable role in a respectable film - and does a very good job at it - and even manages to work a Russian accent, which he pulls off - and he pulls it off well. Surprisingly well, actually! Saoirse Ronan, at 15/16, is incredible in this. Given her youth, she manages to draw in the audience with her character's history and gravitas. The other actors within this, despite them being relatively unknown on the Hollywood stage, join the cast well, and the chemistry is there to make the journey and the true stamina of the group believable.The cinematography was immense, with shots overlooking parts of Russia, Mongolia, Tibet, and India - just helps you realise the vastness of the journey. Most of the journey is filmed looking closely at the characters, but this is what is crucial to the audience enjoying the story. You can't have 2hrs and 13 mins of beautiful scenery and see the intimate struggles with each of the characters...therefore the director does well to mix the two. The audience can see just what the struggles and difficulties are...but are treated to some amazing shots of the scenery, which make you realise how incredible this journey was. (I even got a map out later and routed the journey they took)I should expect that this film would receive some Oscar nominations, maybe for cinematography, director, perhaps even best picture, but I would love to see Jim Sturgess having a nomination for his role.",10.0,Anonymous,History
When Irish actors go all Polski,"Peter Weir's first film in seven years is another exercise in sturdy direction with strong social themes running through it - recalling many of his previous works in style and content. It follows a group of escaped prisoners from a Siberian gulag in 1940 as they brave the treacherous wilderness of Asia for freedom from the Soviet regime. It's tough viewing for the most part but there is a surprising amount of comic relief along the way, provided chiefly by Colin Farrell's salty character. The group scavenge for food, even fighting off wolves for the carcass of an animal at one point - but the constant bickering and relentless doom and gloom does begin to wear. The film picks up however once Saoirse Ronan enters the picture and her youthful feminine presence brings an interesting dynamic. Emoting with a flawless Polish accent (almost like a mini-Streep) her character is one of the more compelling and layered and gives this emerging young actress a chance to display her skills. The cinematography is serviceable but hardly spectacular - capturing a harsh, arid landscape as opposed to Malick-like celebration of nature.As the film wears on, the struggle to survive intensifies, particular when they reach the Ghobi desert - the scenes are very well done but viewing becomes quite grueling. Harris bring a certain integrity to his role in a rather unshowy performance with not much character introspection (I can see why his Oscar buzz has disappeared). In fact character development across the board is quite lacking, and watching the plot unfold, with the knowledge of the outcome of the story already provided in the opening titles - the narrative becomes quite arbitrary and the story doesn't always sustain interest. The final leg of the journey through the Himalayas almost seems rushed compared to the bloated second act. Still, it's a very well-made film with good acting and visuals - just don't expect to be inspired.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Superb,"This was a long film but I was unaware of the length because I was so thoroughly engrossed. The scenery and the photography were simply spell binding but more than that, this was a story about the indomitable spirit of people faced with desperate odds told with sensitivity and at times, humour. Others have commented on the quality of the acting, the accuracy of the story and the cinema-photography; I want to comment on a different aspect of the film. We hear and see a great deal about the crimes of the Nazis during this period but very little about the crimes of the Soviet system. This film is not a ""dull metaphor"" of the Cold War as one reviewer has said If this films sparks a little enquiry amongst its audiences it will have done a great service to the memory of Poles and other eastern Europeans who suffered the double tragedy of Nazi and then Communist occupation. When Nazism was defeated in 1945, half of Europe was just beginning a sentence in Communist bondage that was to last another thirty five years. This aspect of the story is all the more effective because it is told through the eyes of a small group of people and at a personal level. At the end of this film, the entire audience sat still for about fifteen seconds. There was not the usual end of film scrum. People just needed a moment to absorb what they had sen. This was the best film of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Engaging survival drama,"THE WAY BACK is a highly effective survival drama that tells the true story of a group of Siberian prison escapees who undertake an incredibly arduous trip to India after deciding to travel there by foot. The first half an hour of the movie sets up the prison camp scenario while the rest of it charts the almost impossible journey. Of course, much of the suspense arises from seeing as to whether any of the characters will actually make it.This film has the edge over something like THE GREY purely because it's more realistic. The characters are at the mercy of the elements and the story becomes a battle between humanity and nature. There's an epic, almost LAWRENCE OF ARABIA style feel to the movie at times. There's also a gritty edge to the proceedings which makes it feel very non-Hollywood, and the performances add to that. Colin Farrell is probably the best he's ever been as a rough Russian gambler while Ed Harris is almost unrecognisable as an elder member of the group. Newcomer Jim Sturgess is sympathetic as the erstwhile leader, and there's an oddly touching minor role for Mark Strong, who reminds you how good he can be when he's not typecast as a villain.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Impossible, Incredible, Freedom","Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir (""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""The Truman Show"") directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for ""The Way Back"" based on the book ""The Long Walk: A True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins, and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess (""21""), Ed Harris (""The Rock""), Colin Farrel (""In Bruges""), Saoirse Ronan (""The Lovely Bones""), and Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes""). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.The story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain, uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an open-ended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year; told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film, however, the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also, a lot can be said about the all-star cast concerning Jim Sturges, Ed Harris, Colin Farrel, Mark Strong, and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals; however, there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time.The outcomes to films within the ""jailbreak"" genre are inevitably easy to predict, therefore, causing films like ""The Way Back"" to work hard in order to be original. ""The Way Back"" does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography; however, great films such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Great Escape"" will always be on top of the genre. ""The Way Back"" isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed (not the montage, the montage is great).This is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure, release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up (well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements). A 4,000-mile true story taking place in the World War II era with excellent cinematography and great acting seems like the ideal candidate for the Oscars. So why was this must see film left in the shadows?",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Grim, But Beautiful","Having read several books about escapes from Siberia, I was interested in seeing one of them put on screen. I say this because the film is a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter. The film isn't boring - at least, to me - but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.The scenery is magnificent and some of the shots by director Peter Weir are jaw-dropping. This is Weir's first film since the 2003 ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World."" The man does quality work.Ed Harris one of the few, if not only, actors in here whose English you can clearly understand, so it's a good idea to play this DVD with subtitles. You get a fair of amount of subtitles with the Russian characters, anyway, but none are distracting from the scenery or story. The characters and acting in here are good, too.If this subject matter interests you, find the book, ""As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me,"" about a one-man escape from a Siberian Labor Camp following WWII.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir, amazing cinematography.","Director Peter Weir, who also wrote the screenplay and produced this movie, has managed to create an epic film with some marvelous landscapes where the main message here is the constant struggle for life and freedom. He explores extreme situations lived by the characters in a very effective way. You can almost feel all the desperation and the great effort to keep going even in so many radical circumstances like the climate changes and starvation. In addition, I found interesting that Weir focused more on the philosophical and reflexive state of the characters instead of just showing us their day-to-day relations and interactions.About the story, after being accused of espionage in Russia during the height of communism, Zoran (Dragos Balkur) finds himself wrongfully imprisoned in a gulag in the heart of Siberia, his only thoughts ones of escape. At the gulag he meets Valka (Farrell), a thug and gangster with a knife that Zoran needs to escape. He also enlists Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), the only American in the gulag, to help with the escape and together with a few others they manage to break free from the gulag, but that's only the start of the story. From there they need to travel, on foot, thousands of miles into India, the only communist free country anywhere near them. Ronan stars as Irena, a Russian girl the escapees pick up along the way.This is a moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir. The locations are gorgeous. From the harsh snow-covered trees of Siberia, a terrifying blizzard blowing through the trees, to the stark, barren landscape of the deserts between Russia and China as they travel over the sand. The viewer gets the full brunt of the harsh conditions these men needed to survive to get to safety.There are moments of rye humor, and deep emotion. And a quietly growing bond between men who have nothing in common but the journey, and their individual capacity to endure it. But some may find the film a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter. The film isn't boring, but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.The finale is the most intriguing part of the movie. Tricky almost but it resonates with the sadness of these broken humans, how the woman has stood in place punishing herself for a lifetime for her betrayal, the man having to wait a lifetime to absolve her. But everything said, I just felt the emotional factor was a bit less.The performances are also great. The director took a huge risk casting Sturgess as the main lead because he is new to this game, but he did an amazing job as a man that needs to escape inescapable odds to right a wrong he didn't even admit. Farell as Valka is as brilliant as always and shows his versatility again. His scary performance as a killer and psychopath that loves the people who put him in the prison he finds himself in, is a treat to watch. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. He and his distinguishable accent are remarkable. Ed Harris has also given a solid performance as always. Ronan is great as a girl who gets help from men that shouldn't be able to give it. She has the right balance of vulnerability and strength to make her great to watch. She is great actor and a worthy Oscar nominee for her performance in The Atonement. This great cast including every other supporting actors really makes you care about the slowly bonding group as they travel mile after mile through harsh conditions and dangerous environments.One should also mention the make-up done in the movie. The make-up crew did an incredible job on how the aspect of the human body changes along such a hard journey and they certainly deserved the Oscar nomination they received.All in all, this is great inspirational movie that anyone that who enjoys a good prison escape film should watch. Big production, excellent actors, big scenery, extremely cold weather, extremely hot weather, lots of suffering by everybody involved, it's worthy to watch this movie just because of the landscapes, so vast and majestic. After all these praises, some may find my rating a bit low but the movie just lacked the heart-wrenching emotional moments that this kind of movie should have. Besides that, its a must see the movie for the amazing cinematography and commendable performances. I rate it 7.5 out 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Made Me Feel the Cold,"I stumbled per chance over The Way Back, never heard or read anything about this movie before. The Way Back is based on the memoir/book of the former Polish prisoner of war Slawomir Rawicz, who claimed to have escaped from a Soviet Gulag and walked 4,000 miles to freedom during World War II. The production is fine, director and cast do well (Sturgess, Farrell, Harris, Strong, Ronan), the story captivating - I would recommend this one to everyone who likes movies a la The Grey, The Revenant, As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me and so on.

Peter Weir goes from ocean to desert,"Peter Weir's follow-up to Master & Commander (2003) is the unflinching, stark, & brilliant The Way Back, which takes on the weighty theme of man's struggle for freedom.At the dawn of WWII, several men escape from a Russian gulag. The film details their perilous & uncertain journey to freedom, as they cross deserts, mountains, & several nations.The cast is a clever mix of seasoned pros & relative newcomers. Ed Harris, in the role of the sole American, lends his usual gravitas. Colin Farrell borrows from his In Bruges character, but the addition of bad jailhouse tattoos is wildly amusing, & his Russian is quite passable. It's always nice to see Mister Farrell doing serious work, rather than bland fluff like Miami Vice or SWAT. Mark Strong's brief, but plot-essential appearance is joyous.Jim Sturgess gets a chance to redeem himself from the disastrous flop 21, & does a fine job here, as the central character. & the adolescent Saoirse Ronan belies her extensive & impressive resume with an understated performance that sparkles against the men's terse asperity.Breathtaking vistas that serve as the backdrop to the cast's efforts lend The Way Back an epic feel, echoed by mature editing, & mavellously restrained use of music.This is, quite possibly, the most serious film Peter Weir has ever directed, & the result is both thought-provoking & inspiring. We can only hope that it gets a proper release, & is allowed an opportunity to reach its grown-up audience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Solid story that looks great but is told with far too much reverence and respect – to the point of being hard to engage with emotionally,"A group of men break free from the security and barbed wire fence of a Siberian gulag in search of freedom, however the guards are very small beer to the real prison – the ravages of nature itself and the great distance which must be crossed before they can be truly free.Given that the focus of the film appeared to be one of endurance in the face of great suffering, this film is a bit of a hard sell for the casual viewer looking for something to watch of an evening; certainly for me this was part of the reason it took me a minute to decide to watch it. While it was an OK film, I'm not entirely sure if it was worth the two hours plus that it took to watch because it gives the viewer very little to engage with in doing so. The story is impressive in terms of the toll and also the sacrifice involved and accordingly the film wears it very seriously indeed. Hollywood excess is avoided and any crass sentimentality is absent, both of which I appreciated being omitted and restrained, and Weir documents the journey with a solemn air throughout. The first problem is that it feels like you're in a church – bowed with reverence witnessing things of importance but not really engaging with them because you're not really worthy. This feeling of worthiness really kept me at arms' length from the characters and the challenge they faced, to the point where it felt a little indifferent towards any specific one of them – not in a cruel way, but the feat appears to have been the focus rather than the people.This is still able to make an interesting film though, because the feat is quite a thing and, as I said, the film is very careful to do it justice and not sentimentalise or trivialise it. This is my second problem with it – it probably overdoes it in this regard considering that so much of the story is questionable. I try not to let ""facts"" get in the way of enjoying a good movie because as a Brit I am used to seeing Hollywood twist history to make it more sellable to the mid-West etc. Thing is though, it is hard to accept that this is a good story when the film emphasises that it is true and also treats it with such reverence and respect for fear of getting it ""wrong"". Quite how one can get it ""wrong"" when so much of it is in doubt is anyone's guess, but the film takes this route and it hurts it in the process. It still makes for a very sturdy film but there without caring about the characters or really feeling in their trial, it didn't do a terrible lot else for me and I was surprised by how much of it I was just able to watch with very little involvement other than my eyes and ears.One thing the film does do really well though is the delivery (visually speaking of course). The locations are immense and are put on the screen by director Peter Weir and cinematographer Russell Boyd in such a way that captures not only their natural beauty but also the sheer, uncompromising size of the places. It looks great throughout and I was surprised when I looked it up to find that Boyd didn't even merit an Oscar nomination for his work here (although it is an award category that has yet to give one to Roger Deakins so no surprise). It perhaps contributions to the ""look at this epic story"" worthiness that the film has, but in the case of the looks, it is worth it.The cast also match the worthy tone and don't have a lot of time for character in between portraying hardship and perseverance. Sturgess struggles to really make an impression but he is OK in a central role. He is fortunate though to have Harris, Strong and Farrell with him, because they both bring presence and charisma in a way that looks easy. The rest of the group are good as well, but they also struggle to make an impression in all the worthiness.The Way Back is an interesting film that looks great, but it is also overly worthy and serious to a point that it is hard to really engage with it because it is hard to reach the characters on the pedestal that Weir puts them on.",,Anonymous,History
A beautiful but very long walk,"The story of a small group of people escaping from a Siberian Soviet prison, part of the ""Gulag"" in wartime and walking 4000 miles to freedom looked a trifle grim in the trailer, but Peter Weir has managed to produce a rather beautiful film out of it, using Bulgaria and Morocco as locales rather than Siberia and the Gobi desert. Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both ""Mr Smith"" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.I know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.Strangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk, if starvation hadn't got me first.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Peter Weir returns with a masterpiece,"Anyone familiar with Peter Weir's incredible body of work - particularly his earlier Australian-produced movies - knows that a new Weir movie is an important event indeed. Almost all Weir's too-infrequent movies are at least noteworthy (Witness, Dead Poets Society) if not downright great (Year of Living Dangerously, The Last Wave).With The Way Back, Weir may have made his greatest film ever. An epic and unrushed (2 1/4 hours) trek from a Soviet Gulag to the green hills of India, this is a beautifully filmed and superbly acted piece. Let it take its time; it is thrilling and appalling, but also beautiful.The story, which Weir apparently has long wanted to film, is based on the account of a Polish army officer who later moved to England and wrote (with a ghost-writer) the book ""The Long Walk,"" describing the journey he took with seven others. The movie is quite true to the book, right down to the American ""Mr. Smith,"" Ed Harris' character. While the veracity of the story in the book has been questioned, that doesn't interfere with the great film-making.Harris is fine as always, as is Colin Farrell as a Russian thug, but it is Jim Sturgess, as the Polish leader of the expedition, who has the most bravura performance.Bravo to the cast, cinematographer, and most of all, Mr. Weir.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good performances,"A group of gulag prisoners escape from Siberia and walk all the way to India. Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a Polish prisoner. Valka (Colin Farrell) has a criminal past. Mr Smith (Ed Harris) is an American. Irena (Saoirse Ronan) is a girl they pick up along the way.There is an allusion to a true story of 3 prisoners emerging in India. That story is questionable, but more importantly, it distracts from the movie. The reality of the movie becomes a constant nagging question. It is probably better to just let the story be completely fictional. Irena is probably the hardest to believe. She's an obvious device to add drama.The best performance may be Colin Farrell. The accent can be excused. It's his intensity that stands out. And Jim Sturgess is compelling. All the acting is superb.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A rather amazing film.,"I am very surprised that this movie was ever made. After all, the world has seldom really talked about Soviet gulags and it's not like this is a fun or cinematic topic. In addition, it took a lot of trouble to create the sets and film in places such as Bulgaria, Mongolia and India.The story begins in 1940 in a prison camp in Siberia. The purpose of the camp is to essentially work the prisoners to death and hundreds of them were spread throughout the old Soviet Union. Knowing that they won't survive for long, a small group of prisoners plan an escape. The problem is that such an escape seems impossible, as it is many thousands of miles to freedom....through Siberia and the Gobi Desert in Mongolia AND the Himalayas to freedom in India.This story is based on a book by a person who claims to have done such an escape. However, the voracity of this account is highly questionable and so the film does not purport to be any one person's tale but a fictionalization of what could have occurred.The story is very slow and methodical but it also is never dull. I credit that with an excellent script as well as direction by Peter Weir. As for the acting, it was exceptional as well...gritty, realistic and tough. Overall, a rather amazing movie...well worth seeing and important because it brings to light the evil of the Soviet gulag system.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A grave injustice to Slavomir Rawicz,"Please go and buy a copy of Slavomir Rawicz book.
My father had the pleasure of meeting Slavomir many years ago (before he passed). They shared a cup of tea in his modest front room and for several hours he generously gave my father his time as they talked about the harrowing experiences and miraculous survival described in the accounts of the book.
Before my father left, he asked if Slavomir would sign his copy of the book and of course he graciously and humbly obliged, a kind, a humble, a modest and inspiring man. This is the copy I now have. It will always be one of my most treasured possessions.
The passion, the depth, the feeling in this book, it is like nothing else I have ever read. It has affected me and stayed with me from the first time I read it. It just captivated me and made my heart ache. No matter how many times I read it, I cannot stop myself from crying. You come to know each person Slavomir travels with, you come to know Slavomir himself and you feel his pain and you feel the pain of his losses and the pain of his struggles. You wonder how any person could survive one, yet alone all of the undertakings he describes. 
The writing just blows you away. You are left in awe. You are left wondering how you have ever complained in your life. After finishing the book you sit completely numb, completely humbled. You wish you could tell this man he is a hero. 
You are thankful for everything you have ever taken for granted and for everything you have. You will never forget this book.
Slavomir told my father, he did not want a movie. That it would be dramatising the terrible deaths of the people he described, who he thought of as family, and a dishonor to their memory.
The film was made after he died.
It is terrible. It misses whole miraculous accounts from the book that are crucial to its structure. It has no depth. It has no heart. It completely lacks the gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching feeling the books carves into your soul.
It is horribly American type dramatisation, empty, shallow, without feeling, without power, exactly what Slavomir feared. It bears no resemblance to the book.
I actually watched it by accident when my partner had it on and it wasn't for half an hour that I realized it was supposed to be an adaptation based on Slavomir's book. Please read the real story. If they ever made a film, I hoped it would be a masterpiece. The book was a masterpiece. Slavomir deserved a masterpiece. This is hollow, failing to encompass any emotion or any of the magic of the book. Read it. Then come back to the film and see it for what it is. Garbage.

A Soviet Schindler's List,"This film tells two stories. The literal one involves a group of Gulag escapees that cross the whole Eurasian continent in order to escape from Russian oppression.The scenery is amazing, the acting is solid, but, as it has already been noted in other reviews, the action isn't driven by dialogue. At first glance it could seem that some of the characters lack depth, it could seem that the supporting characters lack complexity and history that is so needed for emotional attachment.But to achieve full understanding of the film, some knowledge of the history of Europe is mandatory. When the metaphor provided by the literal storyline is understood, the characters light up in a completely different light. Suddenly the unrealistically long and hazardous trip takes the revealing shape of the 50-year-long European genocide, repressions, suffering and struggle for independence; a struggle that has been wrongfully forgotten by many in the West.Thank you for telling our story.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"The Long, Long Journey","Australian Peter Weir is one of the great artists and craftsmen in cinema of the past 40 years. As a storyteller he seems interested in the the plight of the stranger in a strange land, the man who stumbles into a world where he is totally out of his element and the rules of the society he knows and believes in no longer apply. The two films that brought him to the world stage, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (1975) and ""The Last Wave"" (1977) depict the fragility of our civilization as it crashes full tilt into a spiritual world that exists beyond time and space and rational comprehension. In the truly wonderful ""Witness"" (1985), violent cop Harrison Ford, wounded and pursued by crooked cops, hides out in an Amish community in Pennsylvania. A real fish out of water tale. I saw this film on its opening in a packed Toronto theatre. There was such a hush from the audience I swear you could hear a pin drop, and at the end the entire audience broke into spontaneous and prolonged applause. Okay, pardon my digression. I once knew someone knowledgeable who illuminated some of Weir's earlier films for me and helped to made that director a personal favourite.In ""The Way Back"" (2010) a group of political prisoners and one bona fide crook and con artist, in Stalin's Russia ca. 1948, escape from a prison camp in Siberia. Their journey takes them across frozen Siberia, the Gobi desert and the Himalayas to their ultimate destination, India and freedom. Some of them don't make it. The elements are the enemy. The film does a fine job of juxtaposing the most minuscule details with the vastness and harsh beauty of the landscapes (the photography is by Oscar-winner Russell Boyd). Along the way the men discover that the world they once took for granted has been recast in the molds of the hammer-and-sickle and the red star. Colin Farrell plays the hard-done-by con man who, nevertheless, will brook no mockery of his tattoo of Stalin. Ed Harris plays an American known simply as Mr. Smith, a grumpy old bear and an expert at survival, who harbours a deep hurt. He's the weight at the movie's core. Jim Sturgess is the new guy, a Polish army officer and resident artist, who has an especially compelling reason for making it back. Then there is the persistent, stray young woman (Saoirse Ronan) whom the men, some grudgingly (a laggard and another mouth to feed), allow to tag along. Observant, talkative and direct, she brings the healing power of conversation to the men and a much-appreciated softer texture to the movie.""The Way Back"" has a feel to it reminiscent of the epic films of David Lean (""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""A Passage to India"") and Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"". It's a nice change from the testosterone-charged epics currently ruling the box office. Weir hasn't culled a melodramatic storyline from the true-life material he is working from. The struggle to survive, physically and spiritually, seems dramatic enough, and the movie is never plodding or boring. It's been edited to just the right length, a trim two-and-a-quarter hours. The Himalayan leg of the journey is quickly dispensed with because, after all, the story that Peter Weir wanted to tell has been told by that point. Well, almost. The journey is not over. Using ""walking"" as the movie's predominant metaphor, there is a bold and thrilling final sequence that made me gasp with delight. It's a leap of the imagination that few movies manage to take.For anyone who likes ""The Way Back"" I can't recommend highly enough the 2003 mountain-climbing survival movie ""Touching the Void"", a dramatization of a true story. Go out of your way to get hold of it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A long determined journey,"The Way Back released in 2010 is a survival adventurous drama film directed by Peter Weir. The film is inspired by The Long Walk (1956), the memoir by former Polish prisoner of war Slawomir Rawicz who escaped from a Soviet Gulag along a group of 7 other men and walked 4,000 miles and continued across Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, ending finally months later in India for freedom in World War II. But through the movie we learn about only two or three walkers. Later they meet a women also on there way who added a small element of clamor in the film.The movie is beautiful with the aspect of locations shot, the acting was brilliant by every actor, the comedy is hilarious hardly whenever it's there and the story is damn inspiring. Director Peter Weir has crafted a film that's thoroughly involving and also leads the audience to struggle throughout to complete the long journey. The way the director portrayed two death scenes in the film were awesome and well acted. In whole, it is an entertaining deterministic and adventurous prison escape movie with a touch of the epic about it.After the starting scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not much drama, continued with monotonous survival attempts. Also there are many facts in which the movie seems to be lacking to provide: details of survival- How exactly did they survive death by exposure in subzero Mongolia? Why didn't some of their meat spoil? How did their footwear hold up along 4000 miles when it was not even good for 400 miles. This makes the movie a bit incomplete.The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup. The movie has lot to learn from it but at times the movie leads to bore down, so it would have been better if it was a bit shortened.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Long suffering, not only for the actors involved in this film.","Big production, excellent actors --all of them-- big scenery, extremely cold weather, extremely hot weather, lots of suffering by everybody involved during two long hours...(including this viewer), maybe --as many comments remarked-- it's worthy to watch this movie just because of the landscapes, so vast and majestic. That's all right if one watches the projection on a huge screen, not so impressive at home on a small screen. I don't know, it seemed to me like a lot of effort for not a great deal of a movie experience. We have seen this plot so many times before! in black and white, in color, in mono and in stereo and finally gets to be quite repetitive.

great computer graphics hard to tell what is real anymore,"The computer graphic images were very good--most people don't realize how much of the film is computer graphics...most of the scenery...the make up effects sunburns etc...even Irene's swollen feet. The scenes in the river--the snake--all of it anymore is suspect! It has gotten so good that most people are not even aware of it.Computer graphics work best in films like this which don't have a lot of indoor scenes--there is a tendency to make things too perfect that they need to fight and are most identifiable in city and indoor scenes. The real world is blander and more imperfect.Anyway finally to this film. It is all quite good and follows what I read years ago in Gulag Archipelago...the vast majority of prisoners were innocent. Stalin produced incalculable misery and murder--no unbiased person who reads Solzhenitsyn thinks other wise.The actual story itself (6 prisoners escaping) is not true not even as an embellished version. If you want that try As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me....but be warned! that film is highly embellished and this movie script although fiction covers details of the camp and Soviet ""ambiance"" much more accurately and is a much more enjoyable watch.

Good but runs out of steam at the end,"I had avoided seeing this movie for some time because the critics had not been too kind to it. But I finally gave it a chance and am glad I did. It's a long journey, but what kept me interested were the spectacular visuals and the fact that I liked the little group of disparate characters that had banded together. It didn't matter that individual character development was slight; I liked the ""group."" I was particularly pleased that the film didn't resort to the cliché of having a traitor emerge who sells out the group. This group were decent people (even Coin Farrell's criminal has some honor) and they didn't turn on each other. When members succumbed to the elements it was because they simply couldn't withstand the physical punishment anymore, not because the other group members had cheated them out of their share of food or left them behind. The most tender scene was when the lone female of the group is on her last legs and one of the men scoops her up in his arms and carries her while she pleads with them to simply leave her behind.The film can be divided into three parts--Gulag, forest & desert trek, and crossing the Himalyas to freedom in India. Unfortunately, the last part of the film feels rushed. Crossing the Himalyas on foot when you're already half starved and recovering from frostbite and other ailments is quite a feat and deserved more attention than was given here. In addition, the actual conclusion or ending is emotionally unsatisfying. We're told nothing about any of the survivors except the main character and even with him it's not much. He goes back to Poland once communism collapses in Europe in 1989--but what did he do after reaching India? Fight with the partisans; go to America? What did the others do? If the ""author"" of the book on which this is based didn't know, then say so. At least give us something to take away with us after following these characters on such a long and arduous journey.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Peter Weir's tale of man against the elements is a compelling tale of survival that is as harsh and sobering as it is heartening and uplifting,"Famed Australian director Peter Weir's first film in seven years is the survival yarn ""The Way Back""- based on the 1956 novel by Slavomir Raciwz- about a small group of prisoners who escape from a Soviet gulag in the 1940s and brave the elements across a 4,000 km trek from Siberia to India. The veracity of Raciwz's tale has been called into question since its publication, but let that not distract you from Weir's utterly compelling drama, harsh and sobering in its telling, yet thoroughly uplifting in its display of the indomitable will to live.Weir, who co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Clarke, begins his story through the incarceration of a young Polish cavalry officer Janusz (Jim Sturgess), sent to a Siberian camp after being accused of criticising the Communist party and spying for foreign powers. In case the bleak wintry surroundings haven't already smothered any hope Janusz and his fellow inmates may have had of escape, a Soviet official proclaims on the day of their arrival, ""Nature is your jailer. And she is without mercy"".History has taught us that there are two kinds of people under these circumstances - the first who would sit out their fate and wait for things to get better; and the second who are determined to take life by their own hands. Films like ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" and ""Life is Beautiful"" have told of the former, but Weir's film is about the latter, so Janusz will find like company in the form of an enigmatic American Smith (Ed Harris) and a vicious Russian gangster Valka (Colin Farrell).Weir makes their dreary prison environment come alive with details as Janusz slowly develops a routine for staying alive- saying as little as possible, staying away from Valka's gangster company and avoiding his innate kind inclinations towards other prisoners. Most of this he learns from Smith, who also warns him of another inmate Khabarov (Mark Strong) who may speak fervently of escape but has little real intention of doing so, instead using the hope of others to give his own miserable life purpose.Weir briefly touches on the psychology of prison life before moving on to the psychology of something much more elemental- mankind's basic will to live. Together with Smith and Valka, Janusz is also joined on his journey of escape by three other prisoners- an artist (Alexandru Potocean), a joker (Dragos Bucur), a mystic (Gustaf Skarsgård)- and later on a young Polish girl Irena (Saoirse Ronan). Aside from Janusz, Weir keeps most of the details about his characters to the trek itself, and their process of learning about each other becomes a mutual one for the audience.Nature however is a character of its own of many different faces whom our heroes will need to endure against all odds- first the dense subarctic forests where temperatures can dip below 40 at night; then the scorching plains where it can be hotter than 40 in the day, then the blazing Gobi desert with hardly a drop of water to be found for miles on end; and finally the daunting mountains of the Himalayas. Weir's depiction of Nature is vivid and startling, brought to life on location in India, Bulgaria and Morocco instead of some soundstage, and complemented by frequent collaborator Russell Boyd's stunning cinematography.Weir also does an excellent job of pacing the film, starting with a tense and gripping first hour as Janusz and his fellow inmates plot their escape, make their daring run for it, and are confronted head-on by the severity of the elements. The film seemingly loses some of its initial momentum after the halfway mark, but the more deliberate pace allows for the audience to appreciate the weariness and despair of our heroes journeying from one harsh environment to another.In this respect, the talented international cast go a long way to give their characters humanity. Ronan brings her signature tenderness to Irena, while Sturgess is restrained and thoughtful as the unofficial leader of the pack. Best of all is Ed Harris, whose natural screen charisma and gravitas is clearly evident in every shot he is in. Harris has always had a knack for playing such stoic strong-willed characters, but he makes Smith something different altogether when his character forms an unlikely bond with Irena.It is this display of kindness for one another that makes ""The Way Back"" an even more moving experience, as our heroes share what water they have with one another, make hats out of twigs and leaves for one another as shelter from the blazing sun, and carry each other's load when the other is tired- especially as it is amidst the harshest of circumstances. Indeed, Weir's film is humbling and uplifting at the same time, an epic tale of survival whose message of willpower and humanity will resonate long after the credits are over.www.moviexclusive.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
A beautifully photographed movie full of well acted characters!!!!!!,"Directed by six-time Academy Award (R) nominee Peter Weir, THE WAY BACK is an epic story of survival, solidarity and indomitable human will.

Escape tale by a man who never did it,"There are lots of nice ideas - more in suggestion than in the realisation by this film. Committed to a Gulag in deepest Siberia - apparently Nature will take its toll upon the prisoners rather than the conditions in the camp. This early statement strikes a wrong note right at the beginning and, unfortunately, this error is replicated for other overblown assertions in setting up the tale. The uneasy relationship between the escapees throughout their 4,000 mile journey also strikes a false note. Visually, there are some nice scenes but it doesn't make up for the thinness of the characterisations, the brevity of the detail in the survival skills necessary for this trek and the inevitable bonding that occurs - if only for the duration of the enforced comradeship. A tolerable film experience but not a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A survival story - based on real events,"Director Weir has accomplished a magnificent - and undoubtedly not a cheap task, due to the need for variety of landscapes. Although only Indian scenes were filmed in India, the geography and other background are very trustworthy. The route is harsh, its cause is dangerous, but the beauty is still there - even in an empty desert.The real stars of the movie are Farrell, Harris and Ronan (my ranking). It is really amazing how an Irishman (Farrell) looks like and speaks as a real Russian crook! The others, incl. Sturgess, have perhaps less interesting characters, at least they were not convincing to me.The only thing a bit distracting is the language issue - similar to other movies where events or characters are non-English. Combination of Russian actors and English-speaking actors speaking Russian is not always a success - though here some common rude Russian words are audible, which is seldom the case even in Russian movies :)PS It is a pity that, Stalinism-communism is still considered more decent than Nazism (portaits of Stalin and Lenin or hammer-and-sickle symbol not banned etc) although there have been far more victims and lost generations under communist eras.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing,"This film is awesome, the script on Stalin's regime and how they fought for survival is in doubt the biggest struggle. The scenery that was shot in this film was amazing. Peter Weir as the director is brilliant as he has brought this script and the theme and put it together really well. Colin Farrell and Ed Harris play both their parts really well as 2 of the best actors of our generation even Saoirse Ronan who I haven't seen before in film played a fantastic part as a young actress. The script brought the facts as how they should be portrayed well in the motion picture. This film is well worth watching, the courage that these strangers had is unbelievable and I think Peter weir shows in the direction how far we are able to achieve determination. The ending was brilliant it shows a fantastic outcome,a very fulfilling experience.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Shrunken,"Weir makes no claims to this story – about escapees from a Siberian gulag, and their 4,000-mile trek over the Himalayas – being true as he tells it. So it's fitting that the chameleonic craftsman has created something almost entirely unambiguous: none of Master and Commander's moral tug-of-war; none of the fable-like metaphor of The Truman Show; none of the ghostly near-surrealism of Picnic at Hanging Rock.The performances are very fine across the board. Farrell (as violent gang-leader Valka) and Harris (as the grizzled American Mr Smith) stand out particularly. Like Robert Duvall or Michael Caine, Harris has developed a face marked with history, etched by happiness and hardship. Like all the players, they enjoy a solid, unfussy script, and hurl themselves into native tongue with admirable vigour.My main issue with the film is probably lying on the cutting room floor. The work of Terrence Malick, John Hillcoat, Andrew Dominik et al shows that there are fine visionary, worldly, painterly directors out there producing work that is both crowd-pleasing and patient. The quality and relevance of the scenes in The Way Back are not in question – so why do so many of them feel truncated and thus hurried? For the escape itself to burst out of nothing makes sense as this could be argued to mirror the sudden confusion of the escapees and the guards. But too many sequences thereafter feel cursory, silencing their own reverberations. Too many shots of the vastness of this chilly hemisphere are all too brief, stealing away that vital sense of dismal isolation.Perhaps this was intentional. Perhaps Weir wanted to focus on the brutal close-up, rather than the romantic long shot. But if this is at the expense of the expanse, then I feel it does a disservice to the magnificence of the 4,000-mile task, and we're left with something that feels just a bit too small.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The scenes of angry Siberian snow storm, the beauty of the lake Baikal, the gruesome mosquitoes and horseflies of Mongolia, coldness of the Gobi desert, and the mightiness of the Himalayas are absolutely phenomenal.

Wow... was not expecting this!,"I know what you're thinking... the scene has been set up before so many times before in film history. A group of men held captive in a POW camp during World War 2... A covert plot amongst them to break out...Well, normally I would agree with you if I hadn't have just set through what is now my favourite movie of 2011 so far.I hadn't heard a lot about this film but I decided to see it seeing as Ed Harris is one of my favourite actors. The film is very well acted on all parts, and most impressively in my opinion the best actor nod would go to Colin Farrell! The film is a power house of emotion about a journey to freedom, and the trails and tribulations these brave men struggle through. The film is very well paced and the cinematography is simply break taking. I was also taken back by the fact that this film was inspired by a true story, and believe you me when the end credits role you will understand why they had to make this story into a movie.I love it when a film surprises me on all fronts and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent way to spend 2 hours in the cinema this weekend. All in all I would rate this movie 9.5 out of 10 and look forward to seeing it again on blue ray",9.0,Anonymous,History
A walk to remember.,"The Way Back is a drama about a group of prisoners and a teenage girl seeking to escape the reach of the communists in 1941.Loosely based on a true story, the movie follows the group from their escape from a Soviet gulag in Siberia, through the Gobi Desert and across the Himalayas...all on foot. It's was an incredibly perilous journey, and many of the characters do not make it to the end. Hunger, exposure, exhaustion, and dehydration were the almost constant companions of the group, and they took their toll.The great cast (including Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Saoirse Ronan, and Mark Strong) really makes you care about the slowly bonding group as they travel mile after mile through harsh conditions and dangerous environments. The Way Back may not have the thrills of an action blockbuster, but it kept my interest throughout. A good movie about a very interesting subject.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A beautifully shot film,"An enjoyable film of survival following the miserable days of escapees from the Siberian gulags in the Second World War. The unfortunate group have to brave the elements at their very extremes on their harsh trip to India - the harshest blizzards of the Siberian tundra to the blistering heat of the Mongolian desert are only a few of the torments the group must endure.Acting veterans Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Jim Sturgess do not disappoint, as well as Mark Strong (although I think he could have had a bigger role) and the talented young actress Saoirse Ronan pulls out a commanding performance that is impossible to miss.The cinematography in this film is breathtaking. The panoramic shots of the Mongolian steppe and Lake Baikal are beautiful. This film gives us an amazing tour of some of the world's less well known scenery but no less stunning, as well as giving a gripping story to view.The criticism I have is that the scriptwriters could have been a lot more creative with the challenges the escapees face, all of whichever were pretty generic. I think they missed an opportunity here, but I guess the film is supposedly based on a true story (although there has been a lot of doubt cast on its authenticity). An enjoyable film nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Epic Journey to Freedom of Spirit,"In 1939, the Polish military Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is accused of espionage by the Soviet Union. His wife is tortured and Janusz is sentenced to twenty years imprisoned in a Siberian gulag. When Janusz is assigned to work in the mines, he feels that the only chance to survive is escaping from the camp.He plots to break out with the bitter American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris); the funny Yugoslavian accountant Zoran (Dragos Bucur); the Polish chef and aspirant artist Tomasz Horodynsky (Alexandru Potocean); the Polish Kazik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) that has night blindness; and the Latvian priest Voss (Hustaf Skarsgard) and is forced to admit the Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell) in the group of escapees. Along their journey, they face snow storm, mosquitoes, hunger, the desert, sand storm, thirsty and they meet the fugitive teenager Irena (Saoirse Ronan) that joins the group. In the end, three of them reach freedom in India.In accordance with the introduction of ""The Way Back"", in 1941 three escapees from Siberia arrived in India crossing the Himalaya and walking 6,400 kilometers (or 4,000 miles). Peter Weir makes a good film based on a true story with the epic journey to freedom of spirit of seven men and one teenager. The performances are top-notch, and locations, special effects and make-up are very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Caminho da Liberdade"" (""Path to Freedom"")",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very dramatic, but also historically accurate","This film was truly an experience to watch. The events of this film are based on the story recounted by Slavomir Rawicz, a polish army lieutenant who managed to escape from a Siberian gulag during the second world war and walked to freedom in India. Peter Weir uses this story and some imagination to produce the sometimes fantasy-like plot for the film. In the opening scenes, Janusz, the protagonist, is being interrogated on charges of spying for the Allied powers, but refuses to sign a confession even after his wife is forced to falsely testify against him. This sort of corruption was not unusual in the USSR during this time, further developing the exposition for the film. The film also does a great job of depicting the experiences of prisoners in these gulags. Upon their arrival, the commandant of the camp explains the true viciousness and harshness of the natural environment in these camps, and that this ought to be feared more so than the guards, officers or work. This is an accurate picture of the gulags, especially in Siberia, where bitter-cold temperatures, sudden storms and other harsh conditions took the lives of both prisoners and guards at only marginally different (but still alarming) rates. Work in these camps was often tough labor like the logging shown in the film, and was possibly even more dangerous than the film depicted. Trees would often fall on people, accidents often occurred that resulted in serious injuries, and there are recorded incidences of people who chose to harm themselves to get a reprieve from this dangerous environment. 
In addition to the work and conditions, the types of prisoners in the gulags depicted in the movie were also accurate to a great extent. Gulag populations were far from homogeneous, and often held career criminals, political prisoners, and many common people who were charged falsely with some crime, as well as people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The career criminals often took control of the prisoner population, and were able to manipulate others in the camp to get what they wanted. Often times, the guards even supported this behavior. Similarly, there were people of all walks of life, all levels of health, and all manners of allegiance to the soviet order. While many of the main characters were in open opposition to the Soviet system, people like Valka - who still praised Stalin even after escaping the camp - did exist. 
Overall this film paints a relatively accurate picture of gulag life, and the types of conditions seen within the camps. The characters are at times overplayed, and the story itself becomes slightly monotonous after a period of time, but I would recommend this film to anyone interested in a story of true human will.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Way Back,"A group of gulag prisoners escape from a Siberian camp and walk 4,000 miles to safety in India.A pretty much linear tale following a small group across tundra, desert and mountains and the terrible hardships they must face.

My 382nd Review: Epic without sentimentality - a better film for its straightforward approach,"Research affirms that 56 millions Soviet citizens died in the Gulags.The Way Back focuses on one story, without melodrama or fuss (and some will want it to be more an adventure film, but it is a more realistic take than that). It is serious about suffering - not in any generic horror fashion - but genuinely, how much can humans survive and are willing to survive to get to freedom. This is film-making where the plot is foremost - and what a plot. The film reveals in the first 20 seconds that plot, but takes over 2 hours to show how it is achieved.I personally came away from this deeply inspired, partly because it really makes you think that if they can achieve what they achieved, then how can I not complete any task in front of me, and secondly, because it is not glorified story-telling - it keeps it focus and keeps this pretty plain and simple - and yet it totally hypnotic.At every stage the detailing and the relationships are well done - but it is the effort that carries this to the heights - and like 127 hours you can complain that it's not full-blown production heavy filming - and you'll be right, but like 127 hours what you'll get instead, if you can let yourself become involved, an extraordinary journey that defies all sense of human effort.Well worth the effort. It is a story of the triumph of the human will and a very good watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Dull Metaphor for the Cold War,This film is a big disappointment. There are some decent acting performances but the actors are let down by leaden dialogues and the requirement to deliver their lines in crudely accented English. The long trek itself was lacking in drama and rather implausible. There is very little detail of the survival techniques employed by the group and it is difficult to see how they crossed huge deserts with virtually no food or water. It is also difficult to imagine that the group crossed a huge continent at war with virtually no hindrance from other human beings. The sets are a clumsy mixture of natural and studio settings with a sprinkling of CGIs. The camera work and music are routine. By the end is clear that the long escape from the Gulag is a crude metaphor for the Cold War with Ed Harris representing America's unwavering support for the long struggle of eastern Europe to be free. Far too long and very dull.,3.0,Anonymous,History

Maybe the best movie I watched this year,"'Freedom' sounds a regular, effortless word when you think you have ample of it. But when it's taken away from you, or it becomes scarce what would you do to gain it back? You might risk anything or sacrifice anything to die free, as a free soul. 'The Way Back' is the epic true story of such few individuals, who risked their life's in order to become free men, amongst the thousands who never tried under the circumstances and many who died trying.This wonderful story of human ambition and its remarkable representation as a movie is one of a kind. Lasting 15 mts longer than two hours it will grab your attention so deeply that you might feel glad of the freedom what you have and will determine to cherish it as long as possible.The movie is about a set of escapees from a Siberian prison (known as a Gulag) in 1940s. Having a solid plan to reach Mongolia passing the Baikal Lake they set foot on unknown territory, beaten up by weather and hunger and challenges unforeseen. Miraculously surviving a horrific and tedious walk across 4000 miles over jungles, mountains, deserts and wastelands they reach India. Challenged by snow, sand, water and what not, this larger-than-life journey is purely an impossible task even for the modern man but they conquer their fears, exhaustion and pains just to taste the sweetness of freedom.Main leads played by Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris & Collin Farrell this movie is not a walk in the park to perform in. Filmed in challenging environments in Bulgaria, Morocco and India it sure does bring out the best in each role. Very well played by others too which is not mentioned above, 'The Way Back' is a well acted movie. And it will be a grave mistake if I forgot to mention how striking the makeup department was. They make you feel thirsty in the deserts and cold in the winters by making the actors suite to fit the scenes by their looks. Wonderful job on that I must mention and it got a nomination for Oscars as well.Cinematography is very impressive as well. Scene after scene the story unfolds in landscapes which is a bliss to see in national geography style, but in the same time give the viewer the sense of hardship embedded in each territory. It is quite arduous of me even to explain this journey let alone to do it in real. But maybe the score does a god job at it.Skillful direction by Peter Weir has indeed made this movie a masterpiece. Having a taste of bringing reality in to movies which happens way back in time he has done it again after the Oscar nominated directing of Master and Commander. 'The Way Back' is not a movie which you must miss even by mistake as such movie crafting is seldom.Read my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,History
I have to get back. I have to get back.,"A small group of determined survivors walks together toward freedom — through a forest, a blizzard, a desert, across mountains. A thousand- kilometer journey.A great cast: Ed Harris an American, who claims his name is only ""Mr. Smith,"" and Colin Farrell as Valka, a Russian. Jim Sturgess as Janusz, who's had the idea for the escape, and Irene (Saoirse Ronan), a young Polish woman.The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith Clarke claims to have been inspired by Slawomir Rawicz's bestselling memoir, which has since been debunked as not entirely true. (A BBC documentarian believes there is evidence to suggest the journey happened and that Rawicz stole a different prisoner's factual escape story.) That hasn't prevented Weir and longtime cinematographer Russell Boyd from fully conveying the scope and severity of the journey, fictional though it might be.How severe was it? Well, the search for food and water completely took the men's minds off the fact that there was a beautiful woman in their company.One can only imagine the satisfaction of releasing someone from their self-imposed guilt.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"The Way Back isn't for the faint of heart, but it's visceral, and visual creativity makes it an experience worth taking.","I recently got a chance to see the grand epic The Way Back. This isn't a perfect movie, but I'm gladly going to give it thumbs up.Based on an impossible, but incredible true tale, the film centers on a group of people who escape from a concentration camp in Siberia, and attempt to travel all the way to India on foot. This includes the leader, a young Polish POW named Janusz (Played by Jim Sturgess), a no crap from anyone criminal named Valka (Played by Colin Farrell), an American immigrant simply known as Mr. Smith (Played by Ed Harris), and the mysterious Irena (Played by Saoirse Ronan), an orphan who tags along with the group.The film is a dazzling epic directed by Peter Weir, a visual artist best known for films like Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show. And while it certainly isn't his best directed, it's certainly one of his most beautiful. He doesn't fall back on the well known three act structure, but that's probably for the better, as the film beholds plenty of things to keep us watching. The journey is a long and visceral experience, and his ensemble cast is deeply effective, specifically that of Saoirse Ronan, who steals each and every scene she's in by delivering brilliance through understatement.Each and every one of Weir's technical crew deserves nothing but praise, such as Russell Boyd for cinematography that calls back to the epics of David Lean, Lee Smith's smart film cutting, and the incredible Oscar nominated makeup team of Edouard Henriques, Greg Funk and Yolanda Toussieng. Their work which includes hardships like overheat, illness, exhaustion, and malnourishment adds a subtle depth to the pain of the characters, and makes it feel more genuine.The Way Back isn't for everyone, but it's an experience I think most should have at least once.I give it *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,History

No bother about how authentic the story was, so long as it does not purport to be. Each of the characters were very believable and well acted.

The plot of 'The Way Back' remains faithful to the true story it is based on and the characters have depth and personality.

The loooong way back,"Some convicts escape from a gulag in the middle of Sibiria. One of the jail guards said that the Siberian was the real prison, so this tale is how to get out of that prison.Essentially this has a very weak story, it is about the hardships they encounter on the way and a few of them fall off, but so what? First they walk to Bajkal, then China, then Tibet, then India, then done.One reason to stay clear of Hollywood for me is that it's bound to have the standard story to appeal to all audiences and in the process not managing to tell anything, but instead pervert the whole experience. This has: evil vs good, romance between main characters, the wise, the weak that fall ... Bah.Peter Weir, you used to be so good!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Clunky drama but this will be remembered for its sense of history,"The Way Back is a big film, as other reviewers have commented. The Gulag scenes at the start were immense, and the dramatic tension was held for two hours. The escapees journey, the heart of the plot, was credible - most of the time. Was it poor editing or simply a gap in the storyline that caused the film to jump jerkily across large parts of a continent, fast forward across the Trans Siberian Railway without even a frame of action, and to 'miss' the Hymalayas almost entirely? And for a journey of such magnitude without anything like adequate nourishment the guys that made it managed to maintain their weight and flesh throughout.The controversy surrounding the veracity of the published story may have impacted negatively on the film but despite this Peter Weir has succeeded in subtly weaving in much more historical background than many 'historical' films deem necessary. Film goers went to see an action film but will have absorbed more understanding of the catastrophic and deadly events in Poland and Russia of the period than perhaps they realised on coming out of the movie.My interest was kindled after hearing accounts from two friends, separately, of their Polish fathers' journeys from prison camps in Russia in the middle of WW2. Both were released after being granted amnesty - Hitler had just invaded Russia and Polish captives were offered the chance to fight for the allies. Both made their way to Tehran in Persia, a journey of similar epic proportions but this time (two years later than the events in the film) with the approval, if not the material support, of the Russians. Not Siberia, and no Gulag breakout, but a historic episode all the same, one experienced by thousands of Poles who had been incarcerated after the invasion of their country in 1939.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""The Way Back"" focuses on the resilience of the human spirit in adverse conditions and overcoming oppression, how the strength of freedom is more powerful than that fear","""The Way Back"" is one of the few films that Peter Weir decided to write, making the work closer to his vision as a whole. Satisfactorily, he brings this incredible story, managing to establish the characters well through their main characteristics: from the kind protagonist to the supporting designer with problems dealing with the horrors of the past. Although the majority of the film is focused on the journey, Weir is very concerned with establishing key elements during the imprisonment in the Siberian gulag, such as the trading of items among prisoners, the excruciating days of forced labor, the cruelty of the soldiers, among other pertinent features. To the narrative.However, right at the beginning, some pedestrian errors that Weir makes become quite evident, seriously damaging his work. For example, instead of creating a good scene for the prisoners' escape, Weir simply uses an ellipsis, never showing this action to the viewer. This happens not just once, but in the most climactic moments of the work. It's simply surreal to eliminate the most cinematic elements of the film. Therefore, the main focus of the script is on the great journey that the survivors took. And nothing more than that. Weir inserts some interesting but obligatory elements into the subgenre such as hunger, thirst and death, as well as seasonal encounters with strangers. The most curious and extraordinary thing about Weir's writing is how he doesn't dedicate himself to making the group know each other's stories. They are all strangers with defined roles in the group.Only with the curious insertion of the character Irena (played sweetly by the talented and beautiful Saoirse Ronan) do the men get to know each other better, becoming great friends. In this way, despite being unfair and not very complex, the characters gain a good dimension of humanity that provides a great dose of realism. If there is a lot of silence and very little conflict throughout the work, a lot of responsibility is placed on the actors and ""The Way Back"" can be very proud of having exceptional names such as Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, Mark Strong and Ed Harris. Even lesser-known actors like Dragos Bucur and Alexandru Potocean manage to bring a resplendent aura to their characters. They are all very different and arouse different interests in the viewer. Despite the film's very heavy atmosphere, Weir manages to insert good doses of relaxed moments indicating hope and joy even in the bleakest situations.Weir has a long history of bringing very human portrayals to his films, focusing on very specific passions without ever repeating the elements in other films. ""The Way Back"" focuses on the resilience of the human spirit in adverse conditions and overcoming oppression. How the strength of being free is much more powerful than that of fear and death. This is the great beauty of the film, which is visually stunning. Weir really wants to convey this arduous journey to the viewer. Therefore, we have a huge variety of terrains, vegetation and climates, as well as new challenges to serve as distinct arcs for each passage, whether in the Mongolian desert or the dense forest of Siberia. With an exceptional photographic eye, the director finally manages to deliver his most beautiful work, with vast cinemascope frames of stunning views.The director, in his previous works, has never been interested in bringing this type of visual power before, apart from ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)"", obviously. But here there is a great purpose in these magnificent and unforgiving views: to show the power of nature that subdues the tiny figures of man. They are completely in the hands of fate in an overwhelming situation and Weir manages to convey this very well in this huge walk. Here, Weir managed to construct a narrative that, despite being episodic (blizzard, tundra, desert, etc.) achieves two things: at the same time, it holds the viewer's attention - which is not easy, as it is more than two hours - it also causes the saturated experience of a trip made without practically any supplies or food. He tends to avoid cliché and even though he can give an action tone to the plot, he preferred to embrace the drama, with the greatest difficulties and losses being caused slowly by the very strength of nature and the weakness of human beings. All the most diverse scenarios act as a playground for the very talented director of photography Russell Boyd (""Ghost Rider""), who manages to extract the best angles from each environment.It's really just a huge shame that the director simply doesn't have the slightest interest in generating any conflict other than those already expected in a survival feature. We don't have chases, we don't see sequences in which they would be totally relevant to the story, in addition to greatly improving the film's deficient pace. It just needs a little more action and tension to pique the viewer's interest after long passages in which simply nothing happens, other than walking. Get ready, because 80% of the film is about this huge journey. The characters seem to walk more than the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" throughout the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Obviously, the director offers good images without falling into visual repetition, in addition to inserting a lot of poetry into the look between the characters, whether in conversations or when they come across something unique on their journey. In fact, it is a unique care for the realism that the director so cherishes. The impact of the climate and conditions on the characters is tremendous, requiring meticulous makeup to shock us with the weakened state the survivors find themselves in. In the end, fulfilling the protagonist's words, Weir inserts a beautiful fusion showing a walk as entire years pass, telling the main events of the rise and fall of Soviet Communism. And so, with vast emotional power, Weir manages to end his work in a sublime way.Continuing, the American vision, already absorbed by the ""foreign"" director, tries at all costs to soften the violence, transforming suffering into non-suffering. The message of superiority that is clear right away: Americans can do anything, even survive the heaviest of battles. Despite everything I said, the film has many merits, let's look at them. One of them and the most important is the visceral interpretation of Colin Farrel, who is totally committed to the role, characterized as a survivor of the underworld in which he lived. Colin is undoubtedly what takes the viewer to the cinema. ""I wouldn't know what to do with freedom,"" he says. The script subtly infers metaphors. The symbolism of the mysterious girl, the injured foot, the protection for the head of birds' nests, the scorching desert sun, the mirages, everything creates the transfiguration of Christ, who came to save them. They are wanderers seeking survival, but following social principles. ""Survival is my form of protest,"" he says. They walk and walk, not knowing where to go. It has no direction. They just want the life they had before. At this moment, anyone watching is completely attentive to the plot. Another positive element also involves interpretation. The supporting and main characters (Jim Sturgess), including the excellent girl Irena (Saoirse Ronan - celebrated her 16th birthday during filming), complement the team by doing an incredible job. In conclusion, a film that mixes narratives, balancing the chosen genre. Don't try to be what you're not. The film itself respects itself from the beginning.Interestingly, the autobiography of a Polish refugee released in 1956 that served as the basis for the script was, in recent years, denied by researchers into the history of the gulags, and even this does not seem to have provided a safeguard for the more integral exercise of fiction in Peter Weir (or, when he does, it's to cast Colin Farrell as a Russian gangster and patriot, who has Lenin and Stalin tattooed on his chest, blatant comic relief). The fiction, here, would be the presentation of a real threat to this crooked harmony that accompanies the group, since death, in itself, does not seem to be so relevant - the opening credits warn us that the film is dedicated to the three survivors of this crossing, which turns the adventure of the eight original members into a scavenger hunt for guessing the next casualties. Nature, of course, is the ideal enemy: still in prison, a captain warns the prisoners that the real executioners are not the Soviets and their weapons, but Siberia itself, violent and devastating. In this, the young Polish Janusz, the guiding thread of the narrative, a farmer in a nearby region and accustomed to dealing with this violence, would be a kind of ""undercover agent"", one who speaks the language of men (or the most respectable of men, as reminds me of the snotty American played by Ed Harris, someone who will still be shocked for being so kind) and who also speaks the language of nature.There are no mincing words for Peter Weir with ""The Way Back"". A filmmaker with such a vast resume of excellent films can afford to do whatever he wants with his latest work. For him, the film may be incredible, but for the viewer, it is easily a good work telling a very good survival drama. The problems are notorious: the pace is terrible, and the turns are rare. For a story about a very difficult escape, there is no chase throughout the entire narrative - it also doesn't help that Weir already tells the characters' final fate in the opening sign. If the viewer doesn't stay connected with the characters, it's very likely that the film will die for you due to the inherent boredom that affects the work. Despite this, it is a beautiful photographic work by Peter Weir who managed to retire with a good film, even if it was completely eclipsed by the spectacular quality of his previous works.",7.0,Anonymous,History

By the way, most if the prisoners were driven there by trains, thousands of miles. And no, not in first class, not even tourist class wagons, but in cattle cars... And they had to travel all that way without any stops, being packed in small wagons dozens of them trying to stay alive... Many of them left their lives while the train kept moving...And what was the life in Siberian prison camp, well, you will have just a glimpse of that in that movie, hopefully there will be another movie one day (hopefully from Russia, if they finally admit the manslaughter the CCCP = USSR did) to take that subject in further details...But lets keep the politic s.. behind nowTo go further, this movie has several layers, and the second biggest for me was, how darn big this world really is, one day you are in snowy wasteland and then you are in the desert (of course, actually it takes several months to go either ways).

"A long journey,literally!","Rating-7/10The Way Back is a firmly good movie and although long(quite literally) ,it is also a good adventure too. The film offers thrills, spills and drama that can at times be unmatched and with a fine cast on screen It all makes for a good journey that is also a good watch. I felt it was firmly good as a film and here is why I thought that below here.The story is a darker tone of a story but the adventure side of the film is also fun and a good thrill of a thing to watch. It can be slow at times and certain parts drag and drag but that is usually only because they are one place too much too long. I also felt that when they were in a certain part it was more thrilling and you worried for them more, but then they left that area it lost it's thrill and they should have dragged a little longer in the first area. Overall despite what I say the story is fine and unravels well before a good ending where you can never predict what will happen.I found Jim Sturgess good in the main role and his character is a voice of rationality, and with Colin Farrell playing a more ferocious role he is perfect to use and portrays him well. Ed Harris and Saoirse Ronan also lend there support and do solid jobs but overall the acting isn't fantastic and to be fair could have been a little better for me here.I enjoyed the script and it well done for this, each character is suited to what they are saying and the exact right words are chosen throughout. It is based on the book by Slawomir Rawicz who's personal experience this is supposed to be, although many consider him to be lying so it is not truly known if it is a true story. I loved the setting finally and some great camera shots over large areas make for a lovely shot film and as I say some locations are wonderful and would work in any film.The story can be a little boring and especially towards the end because you kind of get sick of the point of the movie, but it isn't a thing you will hate by the end by any means. I said the acting wasn't that great and also the pace of the movie can be maybe just a little slow and the feeling this film is an epic adventure quickly diminishes as it goes along, but I can't criticise it that much in all truth.If you enjoy a WW2 film then this isn't for you because although it mentions it a lot, it has little action in a sense. If you love a Drama that is unpredictable then this is for you because that is what it is in a strange sense but see for yourself what you think. This film I think was serious all the way throughout and the chemistry between characters never grows much beyond having the one goal, I felt a little more friendliness would have made the group more felt for and would have worried more for them.Overall it is a 7/10, as I say a firmly good movie and I think most will enjoy this, unless you hate walking. It is the kind of the movie that you can enjoy but then again it can also not be enjoyed but hey as I always say, see for yourself and witness what may or may have not been a true story, because if it truly true, witness the great harshness they went through, and what pushes Humans to the brink of death.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: The Way Back,"Once in a while a film comes along to reinforce the point of Man's propensity to survive against near impossible odds, where if we put our minds to something it's usually mind over matter to get to where we want to despite that of naysayers. It's also a tale of conflict between being trapped and free, where the flight to freedom comes with insurmountable risks, that it may make better sense to survive under captivity than to die free men. If given a choice, which option will you opt for?The opening scene is chilling, where a Soviet interrogator gains the upper hand in his session with Pole Janusz (Jim Sturgess), accused of being anti-Communist, speaking bad about then leader of the Soviet Union Josef Stalin, and being a spy. Worse, intelligence and accusations gathered come directly from the confessions of one's wife, whether coerced or under threat and duress, and becomes the death knell of a sentence being sent to Siberia for decades of hard labour. And as a reminder, the camp commandant advises that it is Mother Nature who will prevent any inmate from escaping.This will deter all except for the most determined, and assembling a rag tag crew of men desperate and hopeful enough to get out of their predicament, many there because of being in similar boats, each with varied skills to count on from somebody lighting up the mood, to gatherers and hunters, to cooks and painters, and so on, who also add as the unceremonious fodder in biting the dust when the time comes. Amongst the crew are Ed Harris as the American prisoner Mr Smith who got jailed by the Russians, and Colin Farell's Russian Valka, a gangster who's in jail to maintain ""law and order"" and who is tired of being stuck in this sole mission in life. Saoirse Ronan shows up midway through the film to stir up team dynamics as being the only female in the group, and outside of the age demographics being the youngest of the lot.It's been a long time - some 7 years - since Peter Weir last helmed a film, and in some ways this celebration of the triumph of man's spirit is quite in line with his The Truman Show starring Ed Harris too, where a man journeys beyond his comfort zone to seek true freedom from the clutches of an engineered life brought about by a television producer. Here he puts you right into the thick of the action, as if you're constantly alongside the group of escapees, and having to feel every predicament, and highs and lows in their quest for freedom, feeling every bit of elation as they overcome small obstacles, and feel their despair when the whole world seem to conspire against their escape.From the icy cold winds and snow storms in Siberia to the ultra dry Mongolian desert, the special effects and makeup departments deserve every bit of respect for the realistic recreation of the external human condition under such extreme weather circumstances. Cinematography is also top notch be it to enable the freezing cold temperatures to be felt, or the heat wave across sandy landscapes, and the rich greenery of the mountains in India. You'd come to expect plenty of food rationing, sourcing, hunting, and perhaps it is this outdoor survival instinct that makes the film a little more interesting, yet also sticking to expectations without surpassing it.And the best of Man get brought out, rather than to focus of negatives that would usually plague escape films like these. Sure a bunch of relative strangers put together have their differences, but I believe like them, everyone understands the power of sticking together, pulling resources and contributiing to their strengths, and in doing so increases the odds of survival. It's like Survivor the reality show, only that everyone belongs to the same team in the building of shelters and food contribution. A reminder that unity comes strength, with a poignant finale brought about by a haunting score. Definitely recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Gorgeous wartime drama,"Peter Weir's epic wartime drama The Way Back is a feast for the eyes and ears, if spread a little emotionally thin. It presents us people dealing with severely hard times, and unlike many films like this, it actually shows the toll that living back then took on both the body and the soul, as the characters it focuses on are put through a wringer and then some. It concerns a handful of prisoners and their escape from a Russian prisoner of war camp. It then chronicles their subsequent journey across the vastness of the Gobi desert and their hopeful arrival in the safety of Tibet. The opening of the film in the dank, unleasent and overcrowded gulag is a stark contrast to the open air natural beauty which comes later in the film. Ed Harris plays the stoic leader type like he does best, a caged animal of a man looking for any option for escape. A blustering fool (Mark Strong) keeps talking of making a break for it, but that's all he ever really does is talk. It's not until Harris hooks up with a skeezy bandit (a nicely nasty Colin Farrell) that the opportunity comes, and the pack of them seize it, making a harebrained scattershot run for the hills. And so their adventure begins, set against some of the most beautiful, awe inspiring scenery ever put on film. Across the Russian plains and into the unforgiving, immeasurable expanse of the Gobi, seeing many sights along the way, and tested by both man and nature at every turn. They are joined by an orphaned village girl (a heartbreaking Saoirse Ronan) as well. The film let's the characters take a backseat to the sheer scope of the natural world around them, a narrative and tonal choice which may leave some viewers feeling alienated. I was reminded of the expression 'Figures In A Landscape', a term used in many paintings, films and abstract discussion. It can mean a lot artistically, but it came to me in the notion that we almost watch the film from nature's perspective itself, only half understanding the creatures who blunder around in its playground, full of secrets and above all, harsh but fair in its treatment of humans. A film bereft of much of the melodrama often found in the genre, but rich in visual splendor and scope.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Better to die free than live under the shackles of communism,"""The Way Back"" (2010) takes place circa 1940-42 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold, desolate Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,"" but not based on it.After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of the book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski.Moreover, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in this movie (and the book) regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, ""A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.""Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teen-aged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.This a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point: the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.It drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion, slander and execution.Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America? Of course it is and it's been obvious for quite some time (the Dems).Better to die free than live in a gulag (aka labor camp or reeducation camp) or under dictatorial socialistic governments.No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.FINAL WORD: ""The Way Back"" is a must if you love survival stories like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (especially the original version) or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" as well as films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Black Robe"" and ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan."" It's unique but it has the same general tone. Stay away if you have ADHD or solely relish films with conventional Hollywood plotting and roll-your-eyes BS, not that there's anything wrong with that, lol.RUNTIME: 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,History
very very good.,"just to contra the previous review: ""21"" wasn't a ""flop"" at all! it was a brilliant movie and Jim Sturgess himself was brilliant in it. so there is no need for him to ""redeem"" himself.. Jim Sturgess is a great actor, which is evident AGAIN in ""The Way Back"".From an ordinary spectator's POV (which are the majority of cinema goers), The Way Back was a thoroughly enjoyable film. All actors portrait their character truthfully and realistically. Colin Farrell never disappoints.I've noticed that some scenes appeared a bit shortened, probably due to the total length of the film. However, it wasn't as severe that the plot suffered. Some characters seemed to be more developed than others; I personally would have liked ""the funny one"" of the group to be more funny e.g.Over all a very intelligent and sophisticated production and emotionally satisfying.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not quite in David Lean's league,"This is a good film that somehow manages not to be a great film. It brings to mind other stirring epics like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and you wonder if David Lean would have made it a truly great movie. What the escapees endure during their 4,000-mile journey is vividly brought to life (the Gobi desert scenes are especially harrowing), but because Jim Sturgess's character is the only one with a back-story, there's a lack of involvement with who these people are, and this fatally diminishes your interest in their fate.It's a far-fetched comparison, I know, but one of the best elements of THE PERFECT STORM was the way ALL the cast were fleshed-out characters, so that you really wanted each of them to somehow survive the great wave. Compare that with James Cameron's TITANIC: you know that 1,500 souls will perish, but the movie concentrates on a love-struck couple who weren't really there!Colin Farrell does a great job with a Russian accent but his character seems particularly pointless. Excellent acting from Ed Harris and Saoirse Ronan evokes sympathy, but they remain just 'cyphers' - the token Yank, the token girl. Peter Weir's direction is, as always, flawless; there's a great sense of the vastness of the swamps and deserts and mountains they have to cross.10/10 for the visuals, but only 6/10 for the writing.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Starts Great, Ends not so Great.","I feel Like this Could and Should have been a great film but unfortunately its not. The first 45mins (in the prison and the escape) had me captivated and I felt I was about to watch a masterpiece but it gradually becomes very repetitive and pretty flat.

There is a lot of walking over various terrains, Pseudo Philosophical campfire chit chat and the finding of a fine selection of water sources but thats about it.

anti-communist propaganda sells movies,"I was very disturbed about the one-sidedness of the otherwise great movie. It was an epic human adventure. Just let alone the politics and show the human side on the movie. The good point is, that aspect IS actually on the movie. But when you get into politics, the lack of objectivity bothers me a lot. Stalin is just as much hated in Hollywood as Hitler. With forgetting Russia suffered the most by the world war II and Stalin damaged hitlers powers the most, and after all it was Stalin's forces that destroyed Hitler. I am not trying to create sympathy, I am just trying to balance the over- biased view. There were innocent people falsely accused in the gulags, yes. There were people politically critical or the regime falsely accused of spying, yes. And then there were real spies and conspirors, lots of them! (from Germany, US and Japan) But to show the prison full of completely innocent people? As I said, hating Stalin is easy. And obviously, it is an easy formula to sell movies to add some anti-communist propaganda. (just like the old recipe of sex and violence)Other than that, great movie, great acting, great plot. Even everybody speaking in English is not really disturbing. Well, only a fool would expect an objective movie from Hollywood about communist Russia anyway. Objectivity would seem as sympatizing with communism. But the film could just leave the propaganda altogether, cut those parts completely and still be full and rich.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Inspiration of all Inspirations!,"First of all, I just want to point out that this movie was extremely inspiring and one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. The fact that the need to get out of the Siberian Labor Camp, where the group of men were put, made them go on a voyage to India, which in my opinion was a death wish. The brutal weather conditions, the exhaustion, the constant walking, the tiredness, and the weight they had to carry to ensure they had necessary things to remain alive all played a role in the death wish they embarked on. These group of men were on a mission and their freedom and break away from communism was super important that they had to get as far away as possible, except for the one guy that decided to stay since he has been a communist all his life. 
Before being set upon their journey, the conditions at the Siberian Labor Camp were pretty accurate, in terms of how it seemed like it was every man for them self and the men there would trade their food rations or other items for clothing in order to keep warm, given the weather conditions. The shaving of heads was also another accurate portrayal that, believe it or not, was present in many other camps as well such as the Gulag and Nazi Concentration Camps. 
Overall, this movie was by far the best movie we have seen because it just goes to demonstrate the lengths that people are wiling to uptake just to get out of a camp and how much people really cared for the lives that they wanted to have.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The book on which the film is based is not credible.,"In 1958, Dr. Hugh Richardson, a civil servant and scholar who was one of the world's leading authorities on Tibet, wrote a review of ""The Long Walk"" for The Alpine Journal (UK). Based on his knowledge of the geography of the region, including India, Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan, and the Gobi, and of the cultures and habits of the peoples there, he concludes that the journey did not happen. Aside from the claim of going for 12 days without water, the descriptions of places and of people do not jibe with the reality on the ground during the time of the walk.Some examples from his review: ""Apart from Lhasa - which was 'bypassed' - there are no place names; there is also rather scanty detail of scenery, local customs, etc, and what there is is quite uncharacteristic of Tibet."" ""The abundant wildlife on the greater part of the route through Tibet is unnoticed."" ""Mr. Rawicz tells of a 'succession of villages' in the deserts of North Tibet and of great stretches of uninhabited country in South Tibet and in the Indian Himalayas which are known to be populated. That must create grave doubts.""The full review could be obtained from The Alpine Club in London.",,Anonymous,History
"Not the kind of special we've come to expect from Peter Weir, but still a great flick","My top 10 list is sure gonna be hard to make this year. There have so many great-but-not-GREAT movies this year and The Way Back is one of them. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent film but the screenplay isn't quite as good or interesting as it has been in some of Weir's other movies. Not that that stops Weir from directing this film in the masterful manner that he usually shows, seriously, I think he is one of the few directors in film history who can ""do anything"" if that makes sense because despite any flaws this film may have, it is a beautiful piece of work and if DP Russell Boyd doesn't get an Oscar nom then eyebrows will be raised. The acting is as reliably good as we've come to expect from the cast (I still can't believe that Saoirse Ronan is ONLY 16 with the number of great roles she has on her CV) with the exception of Colin Farrell, who is absolutely fantastic as the violent Russian criminal whose ""skills"" the other escapees may come to need. With this and In Bruges, his transition from Hollywood bad-boy to respectable actor is complete, the performance is Oscar-nomination worthy at least and he stands out to the point where it is weaker in sections without his character. Some critics have labeled The Way Back a disappointment and whilst I can see why, its still matches a lot of the other beloved films this year for quality and I hope it isn't completely ignored come January 25th.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Doesn't live up to it's potential.,"'THE WAY BACK': Three Stars (Out of Five)Peter Weir directs and co-writes (with Keith R. Clarke) this would be epic about about a group of prison escapees that flee a Siberian gulag camp and embark on a 4000 mile trek to India and freedom during World War II. It's based on the book 'The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom' by Slavomir Rawicz, an actual World War II Polish POW of the Soviet Gulag, and was claimed to be (by him) a fact based account of his escape and miraculous journey to freedom in India. The book has recently been proved false and it was discovered that Rawicz was in fact released from the prison by the USSR. Jim Sturgess stars in the film as Janusz, the character loosely based on Rawicz. The film co-stars Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan (of 'THE LOVELY BONES' fame).The film begins with Janusz being sentenced to 20 years in the gulag, in large part due to his wife being tortured and forced to testify against him. Janusz then makes it his mission to escape the prison and make it home to his wife so he can relieve her of her guilt. He makes friends with several other prisoners, including an American named Mr. Smith (Harris) and a Russian criminal named Valka (Farrell), and together they devise a plan of escape. They wait till one night when a storm is so bad it will cover their tracks and, as a group of seven, they make a run for it. They're later joined on their journey by a young teenage girl (Ronan) who claims to have escaped a collective farm after her parents were murdered. The journey becomes extremely treacherous and of course not everyone makes it through alive.Peter Weir is a great director (he's directed such well loved films as 'WITNESS', 'THE MOSQUITO COAST', 'THE TRUMAN SHOW', 'DEAD POETS SOCIETY', 'GALLIPOLI' and 'MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD') but here he doesn't quite live up to his reputation. The film looks beautiful, the acting is effective, the music is fitting and the makeup is exceptional (which is nominated for an Oscar). It has all the ingredients of a classic epic war / drama film but it doesn't quite live up to it's potential. The movie is never as sweeping as it should be and the emotion and depth of the characters just isn't there. At first glance it looks like a great film but it never engages the viewer the way a great film like that should. The film is still mildly entertaining (although it drags in several places) and looks beautiful but it doesn't ever amount to very much.

"Pedestrian redemption, gruelling desert","At some point in this, our starved gulag escapees run off a pack of wolves from their prey only to assume their place. This is The Way Back in a nutshell for me, a stark film of easy contrasts, with the power to emotionally affect but not to really challenge. It goes down easy, maybe too easy.This came and went without much fuss it seems like, which is surprising because it's a sentimental tale of redemption done in a sweeping canvas. This should be crowdpleasing in a number of ways. Criticisms of the movie write themselves I think, how the characters are set up to face predicable dilemmas, how the story told here is slight and the filmmaking often pedestrian. The part that takes place in the gulag is a particular offender in those regards, a choppy segment where details are hacked left and right to quickly establish a narrative.The movie will pause all this for the characters to relate us with stories of how they were traumatized by the Soviet regime, they all have something to walk away from or towards and be redeemed for it and most of them do by the end. But out in the Mongolian desert the film becomes gruelling and silent. This is what I had anticipated, small figures of men smitten hard in vast, cruel landscapes.In his book The Mystical Gaze, Richard Leonard explains about Peter Weir's films that they employ devices ""that enable the spectator to ask  fundamental questions about meaning, purpose, identity, existence and the relationship of this world to worlds beyond"", which is all perhaps true in theory of this film, but I experience these in very obvious ways as opposed to Weir's great films from the 70's that rewarded immersion by the introspection they required. His visual imagination now has petered out, whereas once it was flourishing with the uncanny and the mystical.The finale is the most intriguing part of this for me. Tricly almost but it resonates with the sadness of these broken humans, how the woman has stood in place punishing herself for a lifetime for her betrayal, the man having to wait a lifetime to absolve her.",,Anonymous,History
Moving and epic,This is a grand and touching movie about the human spirit and quest for freedom. A real great escape. Good points: Well directed makes you feel the cold of Siberea and the thirst and heat of the desert. The Gulag and its horrors are quite well portrayed. There is an epic sweep and some very beautiful scenery. The acting is good. Ronan does a good job. She looks the part is very angelic looking and provides a good balance to the male actors. Colin Farrell provides some comic relief though he is not too Russian in style. Ed Harris is always convincing and looks quite haggard for the role. Jim Sturgess is very competent - though not very Polish sounding - maybe it's better than a bad accent.Faults: Don't really get to know who the secondary cast are. Not much introduction to them prior to the march beginning or during the march. Maybe a bit less of the walk and a bit more background and later life would have balanced things a bit. There was a bit too much of the walking in the sand.,8.0,Anonymous,History

Impressive but no Weir masterpiece,"I awaited this movie with great expectations as I am a fan of Peter Weir and of mid 20th c. historical adventures. I also loved Seven Years in Tibet which had a similar setting. Having said all the above, I have to admit that this latest 'epic' by Peter Weir (based on the ""Long Walk"") has left me wanting. This has nothing to do with the actors, most of which are at least as good as the story. I found Ed Harris top-notch, as usual, Colin Farrell, Saoirse Ronan and the less known Dragos Bucur very good with the remainder of the cast believable to adequate. The visuals also left nothing to be desired with stunning vistas of the 'Asian' hinterland (although filmed elsewhere). Nor was I bothered by the limited and mostly pedestrian dialogue, especially after Farrell falls silent because, as one of the escapees puts it: Ghulag inmates refrained from chatting...So, what is it that failed to please? First of all, in the opening chapter in Siberia, I found the make-up of the actors and their overall appearance poorly done. After ""Shindler's List"" and a host of other movies about gulags, stalags and Jewish survival stories, the actors in this one never seemed convincing as gaunt, under-nourished, ex-bourgeoisie dying of exposure. Second, the trek. This was obviously linear, as was the authentic trek, but there was always something of a TV series about each segment/trial. David Lean managed to make a visual trek (always less empathetic than a written narrative) truly epic. Weir fails miserably to do the same and I don't know why. The trekkers reach almost the end of their tether at some point in the movie, but I never felt the extreme sun heat (David Lean's ""anvil"" in Arabia) and dehydration, just as I had not felt the debilitating icy gale in the Siberian woodland. Overall, not an inspiring movie despite the enormity of the main characters' undertaking. All the elements are there but there is no magic to dress the whole.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The story is OK but there is no action and very little substance. You can only watch a group of people walk so far.

They then cross a wintry Siberia, the Gobi Desert, the Himalayas and finally the Indian subcontinent. All by foot, all in farcically difficult conditions and running the risk of being handed in for a bounty on their heads.Add to that the fact that it is directed by the once awesome Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Witness, Picnic at Hanging Rock) and mix in a pretty star studded cast (Colin Farrell and Ed Harris) all shot on location and what one would expect is a moving, jaw dropping boy's own adventure that takes the breath away.Instead we get a very disappointing anticlimax with some hammy, nay cod, Polish acting (Farrell triumphs in this department), poorly lit and rather uninspiring cinematography, a forgettable soundtrack and no more character development than you'd expect from the average news report. The script is weak and the whole movie rather laboured.Despite this I'm not saying it's actually a bad film. It's not, it's just not a particularly good one.Overall, disappointing. But not a complete disaster. After all Ed Harris plays a bit of a blinder.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Great Movie, dodgy Accents","A group of prisoners of war escape from a Russian Gulag during the second world war and trek thousands of miles through hostile terrain into freedom. Sounds like a great movie, and it is.At first the viewer is introduced to the characters inside the prison. The harsh and brutal reality is well portrayed. The actual escape is not shown and they don't seem to be followed. Which seems strange.The trek through the snow, the mountains and then the deserts is very captivating and dramatic as some of the escapees die. I am not sure where this has been filmed, but I don't think it has been filmed in the real locations. Some visual effects are poorly made (sometimes you can see that they are sitting in a studio, and not in the mountains). This takes away a little of the feeling that the viewer is involved.Also, some of the actors are not Russian but speak with a Russian accent which at times is appalling. I acknowledge that having some stars in the movie is quite appealing but the accents are dodgy.All in all, this is a great movie that fits in very well with Peter Weirs previous work.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Two hours of scenery would deserve more seconds of characters,"From director Peter Weir I have seen movies that spend rich but near silent moments on building characters and rapport with the protagonists, in a masterful way. With The Way Back, there is wonderful scenery and much dialog to drive the epic tale forward - but sadly not enough scenes focusing on the characters, the inherent struggle in the joint endeavour we are experiencing. Perhaps sticking to the original story made the path too linear, or editing simply became overwhelming considering the huge amount of vivid and colourful footage of this movie. I would have wanted more and longer quiet but conflict full scenes early in the movie - for example the route into Siberia could have been a 5 minute long silent tour de force to have us really understand the solitude and low temperatures. Nevertheless a beautiful and exquisite piece of film - but it could have become more engaging with different editing.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Long walk to freedom,"At the end of '1984', Winston Smith loves Big Brother. And in a documentary I saw about prison camps in Siberia, the grizzled veterans confessed that, when they learnt that Stalin had died, they cried. So my first quibble with Peter Weir's film (based on an extraordinary real life escape from such a camp) is that it conveys absolutely nothing of such psychology. The prisoners denounce Stalinism, and protest their lack of freedom, in a way that seems to better reflect modern sensitivities than the actual reality of life in the camps. Things don't get that much better once the escape is underway. To me, at least, the interesting thing about the story is logistics: how does anyone manage to live as a fugitive for months in the depths of Siberia? But I don't really get a sense of how they did it from the movie, which conveys that the men were short of food and water but presents these challenges almost in the abstract, rather than showing us the everyday discipline that allowed their ultimate survival. The film is not completely awful, yet somehow, it didn't come alive for me, unlike some books I have read about life in the camps which brought their particularities to vivid life. The story here seems more generic, and consequently, less interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The Way Back - 3 Stars,"Siberia. Mongolia. India. What these places have in common in ""The Way Back"" is the footsteps of a small group of people who have a matchless desire to go home. The latest film by Peter Weir, director of ""The Truman Show"", follows the extensive and exhausting journey of convicts who are imprisoned not just by guards and fences, but by lands that have been conquered by communism.Escaping the Siberian gulag was the easy part; a 4,000-mile walk awaits them. During this journey, our eyes are treated with some magnificent imagery. The snowy mountains and scorching deserts are exhibited through great cinematography by Russell Boyd. It's weird how these paintings of nature are also what could drive our ""Walkers"" to death. ""The Way Back"" causes mixed emotions in its irony that the things that could bring so much pleasure to our eyes are the same things that torment the film's heroes.At one point, with bodies thinner and teeth more rotten than the week before, the convicts run into a beautiful Polish girl. She is played by the beautiful Saoirse Ronan, a rising Irish actress who has yet to answer any of my occasional tweets. Like the brave men from the gulag, I persevere.Official review here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-way-back/",6.0,Anonymous,History

Peter Weir can do better...,"Peter Weir is one of my all-time favorite storytellers. 'The Truman Show' was a wonderful film. 'Witness' & 'Dead Poets Society' also were memorable fares. 'Fearless' offered some strong performances. 'Master And Commander' also had it's share of pluses.However, Weir latest flick, 'The Way Back', which is a war drama, about a group of prisoners who escape from a Siberian Gulag camp during World War II, doesn't rank amongst his finest works.'The Way Back' begins with a bang, and has a rock-solid first hour. The problem, I thought, began in the latter hour. The writing gets weak, and the pace dips for quite sometime. The writing needed to be sharper, especially in the latter hour.Weir's direction, as always, is note-worthy. Cinematography is striking. Editng could've been sharper. Performance-Wise: Jim Sturgess rules the show, with a fantastic performance. Sturgess is an actor to watch out for! Ed Harris is good, as ever. Colin Farrell is superb, and gets his Russian accent correct. Saoirse Ronan is fair.

Should've Brought Their Fitness Trackers,"The Way Back boasts of an awe-inspiring narrative that showcases human resilience & the unyielding will to survive against insurmountable odds. Peter Weir's 2010 adaptation of POW Slawomir Rawicz memoir is exactly that, as it recounts his 6400-kilometer march to freedom from the Soviets, during the onset of WWII. With this premise, The Way Back's storyline is then reasonably straightforward and devoid of complexity, yet works wonders thanks to the performances and Weir's crafted atmosphere of desolation, that authenticates the perilous journey of his characters. The cinematography of Russell Boyd deserves praise then, as his breathtaking renders captures both the beauty & overwhelming harshness of the natural world, becoming antagonistic characters of their own. The portrayals of Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan were impeccable, shaking off the picture strange casting that ALMOST dilutes the genuineness against its historical context. The production also deserves praise, most especially the makeup, bringing to life the visually-gripping physical toll of the journey.Overall, The Way Back is definitely worth a watch for its emotionally-revving premise & cinematic beauty. Sure, it certainly doesn't offer anything groundbreaking, yet Weir achieves his ambition to convey an epic survival tale. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Interesting but too long,The Way Back is an interesting story about the Russian communism from the last Second World War. It shows how the prisoners were forced to work in the Siberian gulags. The escape and the imposing landscapes makes this movie a worth check out. Colin Farrell played the Russian criminal very cool and solid. His Russian accent made him credible and his performance stands out in this film.There were many dramatic survival scenes that give it an adventure touch.

A film as powerful as its central message.,"1939- Poland is divided between Hitler's forces from the West and Stalin's red army from the East. A Polish soldier on the Russian front, Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is betrayed by his wife and sentenced to 20 years, having allegedly spied for foreign powers. Imprisoned in the Siberian Gulag or high security Soviet POW labor camp, Janusz first meets inmate Khabarov (Mark Strong) who has devised a plan to escape. Over the following two years, Janusz befriends a small group of inmates who would eventually aid in his and their escape from the Gulag.1941- Seven inmates escape from the high security Gulag. The convicts include Janusz, an American engineer, Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), Valka (Colin Farrell) a hardened thug, and four others, an artist who can cook, a Pole with night blindness, a priest and an accountant with a sense of humor. Escaping from a POW camp surrounded by guns, dogs and barbed wire was the easy part. What lie ahead is the harshest elements of nature, starting with five million square kilometers of bitter cold Siberian landscape, an unforgiving desert and a second onslaught of frozen mountains through the Himalayas. Over and above, they endure this journey with dwindling supply of food and water, while avoiding contact or help from locales for fear of getting caught. Along the way they pick up a young woman on the run from her past, this despite the fact that she can slow down their escape to freedom. Of the seven escapees plus the young woman they take along (Saoirse Ronan as Irena), only three will arrive in India, 4000 miles from the Gulag, and all on foot.Adapted from ""The Long Walk"", a book that sold half a million copies and written by Sławomir Rawicz, this is a powerful film that tells an epic story; a story that is inspired by actual events during Rawicz's alleged escape from the Gulag. Historically, the facts remain murky as others have claimed to have escaped from the Gulag, whereas Rawicz was supposedly released by the USSR. Having also co-written the screenplay, six Oscar nominated director Peter Weir claims that such an escape exists as archives in Polish museums in London, England and Stanford University in California. Aside from Rawicz's book, part of the script is also inspired from autobiographies of some of the fugitives, titled and verified in English as ""Shallow Graves in Siberia"".Facts and debates aside, this is an exceptional film that captures the human spirit in surviving against all odds. Although seven men had their own ideas of freedom beyond escape, only three were noted to have made it to their destination. This is either testament of Darwin's theory of 'survival of the fittest' or of something far more profound— that humans as a species are capable of anything we set our hearts and minds on. From the filming perspective, I am satisfied with almost all aspects of the production. Acting is top notch from everyone including the European actors. While Sturgess and Harris are very convincing, Colin Farrell and Dragoş Bucur offer some comic relief in well punctuated spots. As Irena, Ronan is a welcome addition to the posse of fugitives while her acting says she has clearly progressed from a child actor and looks powerfully ready for bigger and central roles.Co-produced by ImageNation Abu Dhabi, with filming on locations in Bulgaria, Morocco and India, the highlight of the film is the sweeping cinematography. No wonder then, because National Geographic has had a hand in the production as well. Photography is breathless and places the viewer right in the middle of the Siberian cold or dehydrating heat of the desert. While illustrating these terrible hardships for the characters, make-up is terrifying and realistic, resulting in an Oscar nomination. For the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography and general production, Peter Weir should be credited as a tour-de-force for this phenomenal piece of work. Running over two hours, I do feel that Weir could have built more depth into some of the characters given that many scenes are dialogue heavy. But as a standalone production, this is ample proof that given the right focus and vision, Independent films have as big a scope in powerful film making as compared to films backed by major production and distribution studios.",,Anonymous,History

HISTORICAL WAR ADVENTUREInspired by actual events, and adapted from a novel ""The Long Walk"" by Slavomir Rawicz, co-produced, co-written and directed by Peter Weir with the first half hour showcasing abuses that used to occur in many Russian war camps under Stalin rule when he invaded Poland during WWII. Then the movie shifts the focus on a group of seven men who managed to escape from their POW camp with J A N U S Z Wieszczek (Jim S T U R G E S S) leading the pack to a specific direction, against blistering weather terrain and away from other warring factions through Siberia toward Lake Baikal. Besides Janusz, the group also includes an American who calls himself Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), V A L K A (Colin Farrell) the only man armed with a knife he names Wolf, A N D R E J S V O S S (Gustaf Skarsgård), K A Z I K (Sebastian U R Z E N D O W S K Y), Z O R A N (D R A G U S Bucur) and T O M A S Z H O R O D I N S K Y (A L E X A N D R U Potocean). And S A O I R S E Ronan also stars as Irena they meet along the way, she plays an orphaned teenage Polish girl who had just escaped from the Soviet Union.What makes this movie fascinating with this movie is that it is not like any other survivalist movie, since each character have his or her own characteristics, such as theirs an artist and chef, a comedian, a priest, an accountant and an American.

"Fun, but ultimately limited","The Way Back, directed by Peter Weir, tells the story of several Siberian gulag inmates and their escape to freedom. This film does a good job at what it was meant to do: entertain. Being able to follow the characters through their treacherous journey was exciting to watch, and sad to see so many likeable people die. In terms of an educational film on the horrors of the gulag, it did a very good job, though it was quite brief in comparison to the rest of the movie. 
The very first scene portrayed the feelings that many Russians felt upon being interned. The scene used a lot of minimalism, limiting the screen to 3 wide shots, one for each character. It felt almost disorienting for the audience. We have no perception of who these characters are, why this man is being accused, why his wife is seemingly betraying him, the sheer callousness of the guard as he refers to them as ""accused"" and ""witness"". This confusion was also felt by many inmates, as they were often interned for false, almost arbitrary reasons. The scenes within the camp were the highlight of the film as they were able to tell so much about life within these camps, with so little time spent there. Some noticeable sections that were displayed were the trade micro-economy that existed within these camps, demonstrated by the exchanges of cigarettes, meats, and clothing; the existence of a hierarchy ruled by the criminal class; and the presence of various prisoners forming groups based off of reason for internment, whether it was criminals or political internees. The cinematography was also especially strong within the camps. The extreme wide shots of the neighboring mountains truly portrayed the expanse and isolation of this camp. The fences were not the jail, the environment was. The shots demonstrated the impossibility of escape, and the hopelessness that the inmates felt. Inside of the mine was another highlight. The stage presence of smoke, falling rocks, and orange filters created a sense of exhaustion, claustrophobia, and disease, all of which were truly present in the mines. Working there was essentially a death sentence, and this concept was heavily felt. One noticeable flaw in the film was the lack of starvation within the inmates and those travelling. The makeup was well done and believable, but in terms of physicality, everyone looked pretty well fed. There was one scene where a man was begging for food, but that was the extent to which the hunger was shown. Overall though, this film was strongest in the beginning, but still fun to watch throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Two dimensional, lacks authenticity","Very fond of Ed Harris and Jim Sturgess as actors as well as Peter Weir's direction in past films, but this movie was not a shining achievement for any of the three imho. The story is amazing...the screenplay failed to pull me in emotionally. Here's a hint for Peter Weir and the production team...when filming a scene that is taking place in a region who's temperature is below freezing, there should be steam emitting from the characters' mouths and noses. Was this entire film shot in studios on green screens??! Not in one freezing scene do I recall ever seeing any steam from anyone's mouth or nose. Very hard to get emotionally drawn into a film when it fails to pass scientific standards. As for the landscape and backdrops, they were quite stunning and beautiful at times, but again if they were merely thrown up on a green/blue screen behind a set, then it was a completely wasted effort.

A Great Adventure,"The book is a can't put it down page turner which has been faithfully adapted to the big screen. A Polish prisoner of war who was imprisoned at a Soviet gulag in Siberia wrote the original journal which became an international best seller in the 1950s. Director Peter Weir has done a fine job in retaining the feel of the book, The Long Walk.The lead, Janusz, is placed in the camp in 1939 and meets an American, Mr. Smith(Ed Harris), an actor, Khabarov, Valka(Colin Farrell), the only real criminal, along with a cook, a priest, and an accountant. They put together a plan to travel south to Mongolia, passing Lake Baikal. The escape begins on the night of a blizzard and one of the men gets lost and is found frozen to death. The trek is a dangerous and deadly one, knocking them off one after the other.A young Polish girl, Irena, meets them along the way telling the tale of her parent's murder by Russian soldiers and her harrowing escape. She later admits that her mother and father were actually arrested as spies.The group encounter a sandstorm, suffer starvation and dehydration and some of them finally reach the Himalayas with Nepal and India within sight.

Gave up at Mongolia,"I saw this movie some years ago, or more accurately I saw half this movie some years ago. Maybe I was having a bad day but at the time I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to see it through. So when I saw it advertised recently to appear on television I thought I would give it another shot.This time round I made it as far as Mongolia, which I suppose is progress. That I got this far is probably because this time around I noticed that it was directed by Peter Weir and because I am a big fan of Gallipoli I gave it more leeway and time for development. Alas my patience and respect for Peter Weir were not rewarded on this occasion.There is something very fundamentally wrong with this movie, or perhaps the story itself does not lend itself to audience engagement, at least on the big screen. Peter Weir's genius in Gallipoli was to make a ""war"" film (or actually an ""anti-war"" film) by showing practically nothing of war. 80% of that movie was about building up the characters and the relationship between them, and because we know them so well we actually care about what happens at the end. In ""The Way Back"" Peter Weir seems to have forgotten about the need for audience identification with characters. Perhaps I missed a few things with the bas russian accents and names that do not register after hearing them once but quite frankly I had no idea who those people traipsing around Siberia were and even less idea why I should care. I think (but I am not sure) that there is one key protagonist (the one we see being interrogated at the beginning) and a bunch of other guys, but that is hard to tell because they all look and sound the same. If that were not bad enough these strangers do stuff that anyone would do in that situation and they do it for a long time against a backdrop that looks basically the same. I had no idea where they were going and no idea of the distances involved or the absolute immensity of the landscape, be it Siberia or Mongolia. A map and some aerial shots would have helped enormously for as it is it looks like they are off for a weekend tramp. We have absolutely no concept of the magnitude of their feat, which I would have thought is the whole point of the film.Our heroes, whoever they are, are so clueless that they have to batter a watch with some genius who tells them they must turn off the generator and cut the wires to escape. Bravo, that is certainly a plan and a half. How they disabled the generator, or cut the wires, we are not shown, nor are we shown how they escape dozens of guards and dogs in hot pursuit. And yes, we have a BLIND man thrown in for good measure, that's right, not just a BLIND man but one who indulges in syrupy flashbacks. And then, blow me down, if our intrepid team don't meet a pretty young girl partway along and for reasons best known to themselves they skip across some ice together. It is all very lazy, uninspired and unbelievable stuff.Eventually our band of heroes gets to the Mongolian border and comes across a huge archway in the middle of nowhere...ah...what? They are surprised to learn that China is also a communist country, which in 1941 was not actually true.Annoyingly, despite starting the movie with people speaking their actual languages and having English subtitles, as soon as we get to the Gulag everyone amazingly speaks heavily accented English. Perhaps this approach would have cut the mustard 30 years ago when all Hollywood Germans spoke like Colonel Klink, but in this day and age portraying foreign language by using badly accented English is just plain embarrassing to all involved. Quite apart from the embarrassment these rotten accents made it difficult to understand what anyone was saying, and because one actor's poor impression of a Russian speaking English sounds much like another's poor impression of a Russian speaking English, it only made trying to figure out who was who even worse.OK, this is not the worst movie in the World and indeed I see that many people think this movie is the best thing since sliced bread.

Yes, it is slow and I guess you have to be in the mood, but this is a commendable political prisoner film, with a good cast and some great location shooting.Set in 1941, a group of Gulag incarcerated political prisoners are trapped, and slowly starving to death in a Siberian woodland camp. They join up as a group to escape together, determined to better die trying and free, than starving to death at the hands of the Russian/German alliance in WWII.The group of Polish prisoners are in the whole acted by British actors and so the accents are questionable, but the performances are strong and the characters due muster up some aiding emotion, sympathy and feeling. Their escape, based on true events, is believable, heart-felt and compellingly raw.Overall, a long-winded but rewarding tale of triumph over adversity amidst WWII creating an entertaining and mainly gripping prison escape drama.",8.0,Anonymous,History
How did I miss this film??,"I guess I was under a rock somewhere in 2010 when the film came out, but I'm so glad I happened to flip through and found this gem for a stay at home movie night with my dad. Had plenty of action, great dialogue that mixed heart-stopping action and heart-breaking emotions with a hearty dash of humanity and a pinch of humor, and maybe a bit of insanity to tell an astonishing, but doable, tale based on true events.Ed Harris is phenomenal--tough, emotional, selfish, caring--he's great, as usual. But the big surprise was Collin Farrell. At first I didn't expect much from an hot-tempered Aussie trying to play a Russian thug, but I'm tickled to say I was soooo wrong! Farrell did an amazing job of walking the tightrope between a brazen psychopath and a human jaded and kicked by the struggles to survive in a ruthless world.Honestly, the whole cast deserved an Oscar nod, and the directing and filmography are amazing!

Life is a Struggle and the only way is to keep moving forward,"There might be many prison break movies but this is unlike any other. No prison cells, no guards following and definitely no gun fires and high speed chasing. The fugitives face bigger problems than that, the chilling Siberian winter and the scorching heat of the Gobi desert.The characters show immense mental strength as they surpass the tormenting test, the nature throws at them. The way in which the escapees from diverse background, a cynical American, a Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who draws, a priest, and a Pole with night blindness stick together when their life depends on hope for becoming free.One might be cynical about the dept of the truth behind the story but as the movie progresses the doubt fades as you watch the characters move forward based on the morality.The movie is quite long but the cinematography, epic journey and the harsh conditions faced by the fugitives keeps you engrossed. The movie itself is a journey and the actors really make you experience the walk over 4000 miles for freedom. The struggle for survival feels very real.

An inspiring tale!...,"A really well made film about an epic journey; Peter Weir is good at this kind of thing and this is a good example of his work. A nice musical score by Burkhard von Dallwitz complements the visuals with quite anthemic themes, particularly towards the end. All the performances were very good; particularly Jim Sturgess as Janusz, Colin Farrell as Valka, Ed Harris as Mr. Smith, Saoirse Ronan as Irena and Mark Strong as Khabarov. Honourable mentions must go to; Gustaf Skarsgård as Voss, Alexandru Potocean as Tomasz, Sebastian Urzendowsky as Kazik and Dragos Bucur as Zoran.There is a bit of a spoiler at the beginning of the film where the audience is told how many make it to India which does take a little of the impact away from the film. You find yourself wondering just when various cast members might either meet their demise or decide to take another path. It's a distraction I could have done without. The film is a bit too long and there is a lot of time spent in just getting out of Russia which, I felt, could have been better spent in crossing the Himalayas (just my personal preference). Over all though I did find it quite inspiring that such a journey could be made and I felt quite elated at the end. I may not watch it again, but I'm glad I gave it at least one viewing.

Die Free or Live as a Prisoner,"THE WAY BACK is a discovery: there are some themes of films such as the bleak one this title suggests that we too often avoid, think that there is only so much that can be expressed or processed in a long stretch of a prolonged escape. Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of this film. It begins in 1940 'when seven prisoners attempt the impossible: escape from a brutal Siberian gulag. Thus begins a treacherous 4,500-mile trek to freedom across the world's most merciless landscapes. They have little food and few supplies. They don't know or trust each other. But together, they must withstand nature at its most extreme. Their humanity is further tested when they meet a teenage runaway who begs to join them on their quest. A compelling testament to the human spirit, this gripping wilderness adventure is Peter Weir at his hypnotic best', as one critic from the Telluride Festival phrased it.The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith R. Clarke is based on the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" and despite the controversy about the facts as portrayed in this film, this is a human versus nature drama that quietly explodes with an intensity that is at times nearly unbearable, while at other times extraordinary in the manner it shows how men survive the most impossible obstacles. From the beginning of the film in a Soviet Gulag the escapees include a Polish political prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) who was caught working in Moscow when war broke out, and Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgård). During their 4500 mile across the Gulag, Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, the Himalayas in China and into India they encounter a young girl Irena (Saorise Ronan, in an incredibly sophisticated performance), also escaping the Soviet Union, and she becomes part of the survival team.The well-written script allows the human element in all its forms to rise out of the struggle with Nature and thanks to Peter Weir's astute direction and the incredible cinematography of Russell Boyd the epic is a deeply moving tale.Grady Harp",9.0,Anonymous,History
Compelling though implausible story.,"Even though the story is far-fetched and indeed challenges the limits of plausibility, it's an engaging, interesting and at times dramatically powerful movie. The movie also teaches a very important lesson: Walking thousands of miles through dense forests, across deserts and over mountains, in nasty weather, can be hard on one's feet. This movie features some of the most stark close-ups of beat-up feet maybe in the history of cinema. Between Ed Harris and the young lady who plays the female escapee, there's enough foot damage to keep a team of podiatrists busy for years. Indeed, after watching this movie, one might think twice before deciding to take a walk across a desert - with no water or food - which brings up another point dramatized in this movie: Never take a 4,000-mile walk without bringing matches. At some point you'll have to make a fire, and it's not easy to make a fire in the middle of nowhere without matches. It can be done, but it takes a lot of work and you can save yourself a lot of hassle if you bring matches. Now, the soviet Gulags were deliberately placed in the middle of Siberia precisely to deter the kind of escape portrayed in this movie. Indeed, the authorities were practically inviting prisoners to try to escape and with good reasons: first, there was no place for the prisoners to flee to and second, the environment was far more punishing then the prison itself, meaning that there was probably more of an incentive for inmates to stay in the prison and try to make the best of a bad deal than to leave and be at the mercy of the forest, snow, cold and wild life. Nevertheless, the movie presents a compelling story about desperate people trying to escape to freedom, and that alone makes the movie worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Long movie, but beautiful...","I wasn't familiar with the story told in ""The Way Back"" prior to watching the movie. I must say that it was quite an ordeal that these people went through. But as a movie, it was just running a bit too long and without much really happening, so you should be prepared for that.The story is about seven prisoners whom escape the Russian Gulag camp in the depths of Sibiria and trek an astonishing 6500 kilometers through the frozen Sibirian tundra and sun-scorched Mongolian Gobi dessert.It is an impressive tale of survival and determination, and hats off to the people who actually performed this impressive feat.

As for the ideology of the film, the tensions of the Cold War are presented as a mere reference. We don't hear any new thought on the matter.

"This movie should be about Ukrainians, not Poles.","Finally - finally a major motion picture that paints a sobering picture of the brutality of Stalin's gulags. Even though roughly equal numbers of innocents died under Stalin as did under Hitler, this brings the current score in terms of major motion picture to something like: Holocaust/Hitler: 84,245, Stalin: 1 or maybe 2. Anyway, it's a start.The movie follows a small group of a prisoners on their long walk / escape out of Siberia to freedom. Amazingly, a significant percentage of the group are Poles. One other is a Latvian, and another an American. To say that this mix would be unusual in a Gulag in 1939-1940 might be the understatement of the year. Why, by comparison, are Ukrainians, who would make up a noticeable segment (if not an outright majority or close to it) of political prisoners in an actual Gulags strangely absent? The story would be historically plausible were the actors Ukrainian nationalists taken from western Ukraine. The Soviets would not have bothered to send a polish military man (as the lead character was) all the way to Siberia--certainly one accused of sabotage and spying, as ours here was, would have likely been shot outright. However, I guess it's hard enough to get audiences, even ""enlightened"" ones as might go watch this film to warm up to the story at all, so the director had to anchor the main characters as Poles, something that western audiences might be able to latch onto easily. It's a pity nevertheless.While the gulag scenes were obviously not filmed in Siberia (and nor, I'm guessing, was any of the film) they were more or less well done. However, the film as a whole lacked authenticity and believability. Even if you believe the story to be a metaphor for the whole soviet experience or something, it still should be told well, and I can't say that it was. The characters are remarkably well fed. It is difficult to get a sense of space. And, crucially, it doesn't feel like a walk.I've done some long walks in tough conditions. The most obvious thing is that when you are tired, you walk in a file, not abreast, as walking in a single line saves brain energy as you just look at the feet in front of you. the characters here must have found that to be not photogenic.so, 10/10 for the idea and concept, but, alas, 3/10 for execution. it just didn't resonate. i don't think it was a good parable of the struggles under communism, and, by its focus on poles, i don't think it's particularly good history, either. finally, despite what some critics say, i don't really think the characters flesh out that well.5/10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A good long walk,"¨Kindness. That will kill you here¨The Way Back is a fantastic movie directed by Peter Weir, who made one of my favorite films, The Dead Poets Society. I don't think any of his movies will live up to that one, but The Way Back is still a great and inspiring movie. The film is based on the novel ¨The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom¨ written by Slavomir Rawicz who claims the book is autobiographical although many skeptics have found flaws in his claims. I don't care if the events actually happened or not, I still think they made for a great and inspiring story. I've seen many films about survival and some are greatly exaggerated (The Grey for example), but this tale is as realistic as it gets. There are several long shots of beautiful scenery where nothing much happens other than long and exhausting walks. I guess that is what a survival film should have: endless walking. I even got tired of seeing these characters walk so much, but Peter Weir adapted the screenplay in such a way that he maintains us interested in the characters and their struggle for survival and their refusal to surrender under such harsh adversities. I also loved the performance from the cast, Jim Sturgess was strong as the lead role and he had a lot of help from the supporting cast including the always reliable Ed Harris (who gave one of the best performances of his career in another Peter Weir movie: The Truman Show), Colin Farrell who may have had a few misses but also has a lot of hits including this one thanks to his great Russian accent, and of course the young and talented Saoirse Ronan who we have seen in Atonement and Hannah. The Way Back is a solid movie with a lot of heart, beautiful scenery, and some strong performances.The story is pretty simple, it takes place during the early 1940's in communist URSS during the Second World War. Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a Polish accused of being a spy by his own wife (after having tortured her) and therefore sent to a Siberian gulag where he meets other innocent and no so innocent prisoners. Some of these prisoners include the reserved American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and Khabarov (Mark Strong) the man who introduces him to the place and befriends him. Janusz knows how to survive in the wild and begins to engineer a plan to escape and walk across Russia to Mongolia. Along with Mr. Smith, Valka, and a few more men they decide to escape in the middle of a snow storm and take their chances in the wild. With little food and fierce weather conditions they begin their struggle for survival in the open. During their journey to Mongolia they face several obstacles but continue to pursue south. On their way they meet a teenage girl who is also trying to flee the country. Irena (Saoirse Ronan) begs the men allow her to accompany them and although they refused at first they begin befriending her and enjoying her company. Together they continue their struggle for survival in search of freedom although many more obstacles are ahead of them.I really enjoyed Colin Farrell's performance in this movie. I think he brought the comic relief that was needed in this type of movie and was perfect. His scenes were probably the most interesting ones. Jim Sturgess has a great future ahead of him and he does give a strong performance in this difficult film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors so it was no surprise he was so good in this movie. Saoirse Ronan gives the movie the heart it lacked at the beginning. The movie has an excellent cast; they give great performances and make us care for their characters which are essential in a survival movie like this. Every time the movie seems to be slowing down something exciting or interesting happens that hooks us again. There is also a lot of different and beautiful scenery in the film and the cinematography is great. The film also reminds us of the oppressive regime that the soviets ran and the injustice many had to face. It makes a pretty harsh statement towards this political movement, but in the end it is actually a movie about survival and never giving up.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

Always a good plot,"There is something nostalgic and romantic about walking, especially if it is to get back to someone you love. (remember 'cold mountain'). It is always a good plot to build a film.

The characters talk about avenging their captors, but as the movie progresses , their energies are drained by the forces of nature and revenge is hardly on anyone's mind. Survival is the only thing that matters. Since the basic plot is minimal, a film of this nature needs some serious effort from the actors and the director to carry it through.

Truly inspiring,"Throughout my life, I have constantly tested myself: martial arts; street fights; pledging Kappa Alpha Psi; earning my Eagle, Globe, and Anchor in the Marines; deploying to Iraq; Crossfit; Tough Mudder, Spartan Race, GoRuck Challengethe list goes on and onyet any time I even start thinking that I'm slightly a bad-ass, I am quickly humbled by something amazing that another human being has accomplished through sheer determination. This film's Plot Summary says it all.Whenever any life event gets so tough that I want to quit, I tell myself to just take one more stepyou can always take one more stepno one and nothing can make you quit but yourself. I'd like to think that I could survive what the subjects of this film did, but I'm not 100% sure. I'd fight to the last breath, but sometimes it's the right combination of attributes, skills, and luck that allow you to survive something like this. I am truly in awe of what those people survived.Hopefully, this film will inspire you, too. Hopefully, it will shame you out of using the words ""I can't"" when you're really saying ""I'm quitting because this is too uncomfortable."" Hopefully, you will convince at least one friend to watch this movie, so that he or she can be inspired, too.This film also illustrates the power of community. All of your differences seem less important when you're put through the fire. You may still irritate each other and fight, but some of the strongest bonds are formed through the endurance of overwhelmingly-difficult situations together.This movie should also raise your appreciation for the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States. It highlights the extent of the damage that the Axis did to so many people during World War II.Finally, a bit about leadership: it is an inexact science, for which experience is invaluable. If you are an inexperienced leader, the best thing you can do to limit the mistakes that you will inevitably make is to learn from the mistakes of others. Read books by leaders you admire. There are some very important takeaways about leadership in this film. One of them is that sometimes you can be wrong, and your group may overrule you, but it doesn't mean that they don't trust you. Too often, leaders become too concerned with defending their decisions, rather than recognizing when they were wrong and learning from their own mistakes.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

based on what?,"This was a nicely shot film and a fairly compelling story. It does however get progressively more sappy and cliché as the film progresses culminating in a preposterous ending which veers widely from even the authors claims, which a quick visit to wikipedia, will show are exceedingly unlikely. Ranging from the reasons for the authors imprisonment, to the soviet records of the duration of that imprisonment and eventually the variance with which his documented history relates to his claims. There is a British officer somewhere who was stationed in India in the Second World War and claims he did record the emergence of three emaciated soldiers from Tibet who said they'd escaped from Siberia. It was almost certainly not the author of the 1955 book of the same title and we know nothing of the veracity or details of that journey.The claim ""based on real events"" has been so abused at this point as to be meaningless from any Hollywood source.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Sprawling Epic!,"The Way Back is an inspiring, hold-your-breath epic that tells the story of an impressive and nearly impossible feat. Peter Weir's first film in seven years is a good one and it touches on many social themes people had to deal with during the World War Two era. I liked this gritty tale of survival and bonding with each other despite lack of trust. However, the film gets intense at times especially in the latter stages.Peter Weir's film tells the tale of a supposedly true story about a group of people who escaped from the Siberian gulag in 1940 and traveled 4500 miles through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia to their freedom across the Himalayas in India.The acting is quite good. Jim Sturgess may turn out to be a good lead if he keeps up roles like this. Ed Harris does very well as Mr. Smith and should have garnered an Oscar nomination. Colin Farrell also stands out and I like his macho, pro-Stalin stance. Saorirse Ronan is very good and delivers a captivating performance.Overall, this is a very good film that tells about what it takes to survive against Mother Nature and her forces. The acting is very strong and the story is often compelling. There are a few intense, emotional scenes mixed in as well.

A road movie without the road,"In 1955, a Polish army officer who was captured by the Russians in 1939 and sent to a prison camp in Siberia wrote ""The Long Walk"", an account of how he (Slavomir Rawicz) escaped the gulag with six others and managed to travel by foot across Siberia, Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, Tibet and the Himalayas before the surviving members reached India in 1941 - a staggering journey of some 4,000 miles. Did he personally do it? Almost certainly, no. Did anyone do it? Probably not. Does it matter? For the purposes of this film which tells that story, no. It is a cracking tale and Australian director Peter Weir has chosen to refer to Rawicz's book as a novel.Weir is a terrific movie-maker who has not directed a film for seven years (""Master And Commander"") and here he allies a great adventure with striking visuals and accomplished acting. The photography is by Russell Boyd and the shooting was done in Bulgaria, Morocco and India. The international ensemble of actors includes British Jim Sturgess as the Polish officer Janusz, Romanian Dragos Bucur as Yugoslav accountant Bucur, American Ed Harris as the enigmatic Mr Smith, Irish Colin Farrel as psychopathic Russian convict Valka, and Irish Saoirse Ronan as the Polish teenager Irena.This may not be Weir's best work (that might be ""Witness""), but this road movie without the road is well worth you joining for the stroll.",,Anonymous,History

Co-Writer, director and producer of ""The Way Back,"" Weir is responsible for other great films: ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""The Year of Living Dangerously,"" ""Gallipoli,"" and ""The Truman Show.""A masterpiece, this film is a powerful testament to the power of human bonding, the drive to survive no matter what, and the power of love to overcome terror and hatred, which Hitler boasted would always overcome reason. This is a move about why Hitler's thesis did not work.It is interesting to turn from my viewing of The History Channel's new series, ""The Bible,"" which like the Bible, like our world now, is extremely violent. The men who escape from a Siberian nightmare turn hatred inside out, creating their own ethos. Like a palimpsest, which can never fully be erased, allows these survivors to write over its surfade a new image, a new version, a new vision,the next chapter of their lives free from the tyranny that threatened to snuff out everything that mattered. As Martin Luther King, Jr., warned, ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.""Ed Harris, who has always impressed me, whether he is portraying a haunted gunslinger or Senator John McCain, is at the very top of his form in this film. The furrows of his brow tell a tale, even the way he is dressed, the sapphire diamonds in his gaze, symbolize physical, mental and moral toughness. His repeated refrain, that ""Kindness can get you killed,"" continues to take on new and more gentle import as the story unfolds, almost like shifting waves of sand in the endless, scorching Gobi Desert.Mark Strong who, in my opinion, along with James Gandalfini, saved ""Dark Night Thirty,"" from mediocrity, giving it the believability it lacked until they entered the story, is intense, laconic, commanding instant respect every time he speaks. That is a challenge to accomplish in this cast, in this story, where each man becomes a sort of resurrected piston in a rebuilt engine comprised of cast-offs, rejects, the detritus of the maniacal fury of Hitler and Stalin.The story begins when Hitler and Stalin, like ravenous wolves, each tear their half out of Poland, and many who do not immediately perish, are cruelly thrust into a Gulag in Siberia. A small cluster of canny would-be-survivors escapes. That's the easy part. One of them knows how to survive in the wilds, using pine cones and other surprising tricks that work. Together, they find enough food and water, survive disease and infection, traverse one of the world's most formidable deserts, and scale several Himilayan mountains to reach freedom.The government official in India who greets them asks for their passports. They smile. ""How did you get here?"" ""We walked,"" the men respond.Our world has endured financial collapse, avaricious, high tech, democracy-wrecking criminals who did not go to jail, zealots who place fanaticism before the brotherhood of man, woman and child. This is a movie to reflect upon. We are alive. Now what?Shakespeare's Edgar, a noble survivor in ""King Lear,"" mutters, ""This is not the worst as long as we can say, 'This is the worst.'"" We are alive. So what? The men and the woman in this story did not knuckle under to Hitler or Stalin. They did not die suffering unmitigated horrors in the Gulag. They blazed a new way, new lives.A Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who is an accomplished artist, a priest, a pole with night blindness, and another condemned pole who knows how to live in the wilds and leads them all.Hitler killed 6,000,000 Jews. Stalin made 50,000,000 people ""disappear."" We must never forget. Demagogues beware: As John Steinbeck warned, ""Repression tends to knit the repressed.""",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""I'll just keep going, until it's over. Just keep walking.""","Peter Weir's movie, inspired by a true escape story - escape from a Soviet gulag - came out the same year as Emilio Estevez's The Way (2010). Though I retain a small, a very small soft spot for the Estevez movie, Weir's drama is the richer, fuller expression of the pilgrimage spirit.Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is accused of expressing anti-Soviet statements, negative appraisals of Comrade Stalin, by his wife. He is sent to Siberia and to a gulag work camp. The new arrivals are told that it is really Nature that is their jailor, for there are millions of square miles of wilderness all around, and a bounty on the head of escapees. Nevertheless, Janusz intends to get away.Janusz is initally under the wing of Khabarov (Mark Strong) but eventually finds his true ally in Mister Smith (Ed Harris). When they are transferred to mining work there is no more time to waste. With five others, including Colin Farrell's killer/gambler Valka, they break out and escape into the snow storm. And so it begins. The very long walk to freedom.Watching people merely walking is basically boring, unless the act of putting one foot in front of another can itself be dramatised. This is something Weir's movie achieves admirably, in contrast to Estevez's comfortable stroll of a movie. Granted, the escaped convicts have much more to contend with and dramatically different territory to cross, everything from forests and rivers to deserts and mountains. They have to do it with barely enough food or water to survive, and for a while they are all very taciturn. They become more of a family, less of a band of opportunists, when they are joined by Irena (Saoirse Ronan), and like a good fairy she helps humanize them, one to the other. How? The oldest female curse-cum-virtue, incorrigible curiosity.Ronan's pale, innocent face is the perfect contrast to Ed Harris' magnificently weather-beaten old one. Here is an actor who has the capacity to fascinate simply by his physical bearing. Like Tom (Martin Sheen) in The Way, Harris' Smith is carrying a private pain, but although not the focus of the drama, Smith's pain is augmented by a sense of guilt, and again, in contrast to Irena's gentle graceful compassionate look there is something wonderfully masculine about Harris' Smith. Even though he's not an ideas man they need him to make it, just as they don't want to go on without Irena when she starts to flag.Weaknesses? The movie could have done with more scenes inside the camp, to really ram home the awfulness of the gulag existence. Also, there is no sense of pursuit beyond the day of escape, and a little more jeopardy, aside from the perils of the wilderness, would have been compelling. Mark Strong is sadly underused (how often is that the case), and just maybe the leading man, Janusz, could use a little something extra to make him more interesting.But this is a story of dogged endurance, a real drama of pilgrimage. A pilgrimage towards a destination that keeps getting further away. The gang have to be creative, they have to pool their limited resources, scour the recesses of their memories for useful tidbits of practical information, such as sucking on pebbles to combat thirst, or using the skin of birch trees to make masks to prevent snow blindness. Like good pilgrims they rely on good will and good fortune, not credit cards, and they have to make their own way, haphazardly, bleeding and chapped and sunburnt. Their faces get more interesting the more weatherbeaten they become. There is also the beautiful landscape photography to enjoy, epic where Estevez's was so much dusty banality. Music is used sparingly.Not likely to be a movie you'll programme every six months, but when you do you'll be awed by it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Implausible Nature Film full of Gulag,"This film, which tells the semi-accurate story of gulag escapees, is beautifully filmed and does a nice job of depicting the basics of ""gulag life,"" but the script, accents, and acting leave much to be desired. I found myself extremely bored - this film needed an editor. The plot is fairly basic - men escape the gulag and walk from Siberia to India. However, the script was dry and I did not find myself attached to any of the characters. Perhaps this is a personal opinion, but I do not understand why a director would cast a british actor and then ask them to speak in a Polish/Russian/Latvian/etc accent. If the viewer knows the character is from a specific country, why must we suffer through two hours of terrible accents. This is a frustrating element of the film. As for the acting, there is not much dialogue, but one can only make walking so interesting. The film's depiction of the gulag, a camp of little cinematic fame, is pretty accurate in terms of how people were interned, how long their sentences lasted, the psychological effects of the gulag, the social dynamics of the camp, and the terrible weather in Siberia. They only spend the first ten or fifteen minutes of the film in the actual camp, so I would not consider this a ""camp film.""",5.0,Anonymous,History
"nice , slow realistic but give it a go ....u ll like it :)","Peter Weir's the way back is a nice movie.......though its long but you don't realize that as you are so into this movie...........people finding their way out of Russia and the way they do it is so realistic........Jim sturgess the center character of the movie plays it so nicely .........his performance is so unpredictable.....Colin Farrell as always plays a great psycho criminal kinda role ....also Saoirse Ronan and mark strong performances are nice.the best part about the movie is cinematography with shots overlooking parts of Russia, Mongolia, Tibet, and India. The production design is great and makes the movie triumph.Its a great movie just a lil more would have given it an Oscar nomination but still its one of those movies for the die hard movie fans......realistic , slow and the flow of the movie goes along the characters. Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir did a fair job and I liked the movie ...So give it a go guys nice movie.",,Anonymous,History
Surviving as a Human is all about Hope.,"This film is one of the best Survival Films made, a real survival tale of human beings that fight against every possible thing, Showing how and why the war it's the biggest disaster that the human being has created, the biggest mistake that will eventually wipe out humanity.However, that's just the start of survival, not only this common people with dreams and skills prisoners of a war that nobody wants, but the proof that humans have the biggest straight of all the living beings on earth, Hope.All these elements are mixed and developed masterfully, all the actors give their best, and you can feel it in the character development, multiple interconnections, real and interesting steps along the way to find the way back. No frills, just reality.I don't want to describe all the beautiful things in this movie, but i want you do feel the people and the message of each step in this movie, showing tortured and damaged cold men, showing warm and beautiful souls that yet have the power to be kind, all lost but somehow connected together to believe in humanity as a natural result.This is a passion project for the director, he also used lot of amazing frames using simple landscapes, showing beauty when the only rule is survival. What a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Escape,"Peter Weir's final film was not meant to be his final film. In an interview with Mark Kermode after a David Lean lecture a little bit after The Way Back's release, Weir talked like he was going to continue trying to make films, but, more than a decade later, all we have to show is Ethan Hawke (star of Dead Poets Society) talking about how Weir had retired. This doesn't feel like the kind of film that a director would go out on, like Kurosawa's Madayayo or Boorman's Queen and Country. This felt like the second of several films he was venturing to make about small groups of men cast into the vast expanse of nature, having to rely on each other for survival. It touches on motifs and themes Weir had been toying with since the earliest days of his career but in a distinct form matched by Master and Commander. I would have liked to see a third entry in this kind of unofficial series, but alas, Weir goes out with a very good, earnest, and well-crafted film.Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Pole, gets sent to the gulags of Siberia based on the forced testimony of his wife in 1939 just at the start of Stalin's invasion of Poland. At the gulag, he soon makes a connection with Andrei (Mark Strong) who says he has a plan of escape that will take him and whomever he goes with south for a thousand kilometers past Lake Baikal and to Mongolia. There is also Mister Smith (Ed Harris), an American, and Valka (Colin Farrell), a career criminal who is in deep debt to the criminal leadership within the prison. Through a series of false starts because Andrei is more of a planner than a doer, Janusz leads the other two along with a few others out in the middle of a snowstorm to cover their tracks.So begins their four-thousand-mile trek south towards freedom, and the focus is their hardships as they go. It's a progression through heavy snow, several different varieties of effective desert with little water and almost never enough food except when they get lucky with the remnants of a kill by wolves or a dying deer. The film keeps a tight eye on their survival with the men hardly talking about themselves until they pick up Irena (Saoirse Ronan), a girl with a mysterious past who tags along until they let her join.The comment about them not talking to each other is important to both the narrative and how this film fits in Peter Weir's body of work. There's a running theme about human connections in systems that discourage it, and a Soviet gulag is a potent example of a system that actively discourages genuine human connection. Even in the gulag, there are informants who will turn you in for an extra ration of bread. The prisoners have been so beaten into mistrust that even out of the prison, hundreds of miles from their jailors and out of sight of anyone else, they can't talk to each other except about the most basic of survivalist aspects of their journey. This is where Irena becomes important. She's the outside force that brings them to reveal themselves to each other, where we get the snippets of backstory from people like Mister Smith who came to Russia with his son only for his son to be tortured into giving evidence against Mister Smith and murdered.Irene also becomes the focus of some borderline explicit Christlike imagery, like when she washes Mister Smith's feet in a creek, implying some kind of otherworldly effect she has on the people, offering them solace and a way to open themselves up in the face of their new, harsh freedom.Much like Master and Commander, Weir intentionally packed The Way Back full of detail pulled from reality in order to provide his bit of historical fiction (the credits say that its inspired by a true story) which provides such genuineness to the action. The little stories of a man freezing to death because he can't get back to the camp due to his night blindness, brought out because of a vitamin deficiency, or the moment they get a mosquito repellant from a local, or the walking through a looted Buddhist temple all provide this tactile reality and depth to the experience that makes all of it believable and increasingly harrowing as the journey counties south in Mongolia and into its vast desert.The struggle is hard. The effort is just. The escape ends up being populated by wounded people who all have their pain in the past, brought out by Irena. The cost is high as people drop dead and can't continue. When we do get our final promised three survivors walking into the fields of India to be greeted by the locals, it's a real triumph.I think, perhaps, the film might be a tad overlong. A fifteen minute shave of stuff around the first few weeks in the wilderness might have helped, but overall the film works as a portrait of desperation in the face of oppression, of endurance in the face of toil, and of small victories in the face of overwhelming defeats. Weir goes outside to film, using his limited budget to its max by getting great shots of our characters firmly in the physical reality of the harsh conditions, very little feeling like it was done on a set (there's a night scene in the desert that's just too picturesque in an unnatural way to fit that, though). The performances are great, though everyone's balancing fake Slavic accents through the whole thing except for Harris who gets to grumble through his lines in his native cadence.Weir might not have gotten to make his final movie with the mind to it being his final movie, but he goes out swinging nonetheless. The Way Back isn't his best film, but it is a very good example of his talent and thematic focus. I really wish he had been able to find the money to make more films, but I'm very happy to have what he made as it is.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Epic about courage determination and freedom,Wow. This movie was really sensational. Takes place in 1941 when Stalin purged Poland and Russia of anyone perceived enemy and imprisoned them in the gulag. This movie was tough to watch bc it showed how brutal the Russian communists were and their treatment of their prisoners. This was a movie about the will to live and overcoming crazy obstacles to get to freedom. The characters are wonderful led by ed Harris Jim sturgess. Saoirse Ronan And Colin Farrell. The director was was also sensational the way he developed a comradere and kindness of the characters against the hate and brutality of communism. The cinematography was also breathtaking. Highly recommended.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Long time coming,"OK, I confess I haven't yet seen this film, but have no doubt about my joy at knowing that this story will reach a wider audience. I first read ""The Long Walk"" as a child of ten. How it was on the sparse bookshelves of a 1970's, 3 room, rural school I don't know. With its graphic depictions of the Gulags, deprivation and exodus The Long Walk was the first truly adult story I had read. The experience of the book led me to literature of political struggle and deeply influenced my approach to the rest of the world. Congratulations to all who nursed it into production, 50 odd years after it was written. Kudos to Peter Weir who I trust with the story and let's get to the cinema!",,Anonymous,History
30 minutes too long & pretty boring,"I had high hopes... but it seemed like they drew everything out longer than they should. Plus it was pretty dull. Could have been the TV edit I watched, not sure.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A long walk spoiled,"Hard to believe why anyone would think this might make a good movie. Basically, a group of people suffering misery in a gulag escape to suffer misery in the wilderness. They walk and they walk and they walk some more. The only hint of drama comes when they are followed by Saoirse Ronan, and they start to walk a bit faster. Even her introduction does't serve to spice things up. There is little meaningful interaction amongst the cast. Dialogue is stilted and sparse. Being self-consciously accented doesn't make it more intelligible. Farrell, while excellent, is all too convincing as a Russian speaking garbled English. Couldn't get what he was saying. Ronan once again does her impression of a middle class schoolgirl in an alien environment. Some controversy on whether this is true or made up. If it's made up, they could have developed the script some more.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Walk your way to survival,"The Way Back's main theme is the man's struggle against nature, the will to fight a seemingly hopeless, losing battle in order to survive. Many movies with a similar concept have been done before. Rescue Dawn would be an obvious point of comparison, as it also involved prison escapees and was based on a true story, but the list is endless (e.g. Into The White, The Mountain Between Us, The Revenant, Cast Away, 127 Hours).Still, The Way Back's incredible story is definitely worth telling, as some people pulled off the amazing feat of escaping a Siberian prison and walking all the way to India, their land of freedom.The movie adopts a documentarish apporach, focusing on the extreme conditions they faced. As a result, it lacks in dramatic tension and character development. On the other hand, the movie's strength lies in its cinematography, the landscapes are undoubtedly its major asset. It should come as no surprise that National Geographic is among the production companies.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A long slog,"Amazing if true. But a 4000 mile journey on foot from Siberia to India is a long slog, and perhaps inevitably the film is a bit of a long slog too. It is a challenge to make riveting two hours of people walking through snow, forest, sand etc. I wondered why two Irish actors were cast as Eastern Europeans and whether that would work. The performances are good enough but it doesn't really. The landscape is spectacular, but the action and the narrative is severely limited. There are a few strange edits where the film suddenly leaps ahead. Unfortunately the missing action includes the initial escape and much of the final climax.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Missed opportunity,"The first two-thirds of the movie are dull, with pedestrian dialogues, toned-down emotions, and all the scenes where the story implies action inexplicably cut.It's better in the third act, when the emotional toll is ripe, but that doesn't saves it as a movie overall.Ed Harris is great as usual, Farrell is very good, the others not so much.",5.0,Anonymous,History
More interested in figuring out who dies than how the movie went...,"At first this looked like a great movie, but as I slowly got through it I found myself only interested in figuring out who would die. By the time I got to the part where the girl comes in I was thinking that was the end... then I notice there was still quite a bit left that I had to finish. The only reason why I continued was to see who actually survived in the end. I was honestly it expect it to be more about the battle between each other (since they were former prisoners) over the girl. I honestly thought they're would be more conflict between each other and a lot less of similar things with Tom Hank's Castaway where he was nuttier than a loon.I understand its supposed to be a true story, but even so, this was nothing that I expected. bah... 4/10",,Anonymous,History
book is amazing,"i haven't seen the film but the book is amazing, only a small book but its really, we see yetis, meet the Nepalese we lose a few people on the way and its a tale of a journey and the hardship and camaraderie and loss and muddling through to the end goal no matter what you face, deserts and mountains, bedouins",,Anonymous,History
Weir's Way Back,"Seven years since his last film, the lacklustre 'Master and Commander', Weir is back with 'The Way Back' and what a comeback it is. Granted that the actors accents feel awkward but once one moves passed all that, it becomes a harrowing tale of survival as the viewer follows these group of men's escape to freedom against all odds. Now there have been many films made on the similar theme of survival (even though not on this particular issue about the prisoners that Russia held captive during the war), but Weir's unique style of direction and the writing give it its own touch. I liked how clichés were avoided such that when you think so-and-so is going to happen, well, it doesn't. The build-up of tension and the relationship between the characters is well displayed. The landscape is beautifully captured and it juxtaposes well with the foreground reflecting how unsympathetic nature can sometimes be. The performances are first rate (once one gets over the accents). Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Dragos Bucur, Saoirse Ronan, Gustaf Skarsgård and Alexandru Potocean are all excellent. The film also scores high on the technical aspect, as Weir's films usually do. The cinematography, lighting, visuals and score work together effectively.On the flip side, the final journey across the Himalayas is rushed especially considering how 'The Way Back' elaborates on the first two journeys. The Ed Harris character was also improperly developed.It's good to see Weir back in form with 'The Way Back', a film that engages and involves and it actually kept me rooting for the characters and guessing as to what was going to happen next.",,Anonymous,History
