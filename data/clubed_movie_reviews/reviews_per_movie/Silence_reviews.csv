Movie for a special audience,"Silence is a difficult movie. The movie is set in Japan in the 17th century and deals with the role of Christianity at that time. From a historical point of view, it's quite interesting, especially because I haven't dealt with the subject matter shown before.The various locations around Japan are really well chosen and staged in a contemporary way. Impressive images are shown as well. The movie also takes the necessary time to let what is shown take effect. As a consequence, the pace is correspondingly slow. On the one hand I find that good, on the other hand I miss the tension highlights.
People are persecuted and tortured. This constant fear of being caught is communicated, but as a viewer you don't feel it at any time.What I liked was the portrayal of Andrew Garfield's inner conflict. He starts to doubt God and he tries to find the right way back to God. But at the same time he doesn't want to show this doubting to the people, because they have it hard enough anyway. This whole process is well portrayed.My main problem with the movie is that it couldn't catch me. I wasn't able to connect emotionally. It is thought-provoking and has good moments, but overall the movie was very drawn out.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Well-crafted but painfully slow and long,"'Silence' is exactly what you would expect from a Martin Scorsese film in that it is well-produced, written and shot with a strong storyline and engaging lead characters. There aren't many films that explore religion and faith as deeply as this one and there's no doubt that it is an intellectual, thought-provoking piece that Scorsese has created. It's also visually stunning - as a piece of filmmaking 'Silence' is difficult to fault.It is, however, very easy to fault as a piece of entertainment. For all its technical merit, the truth is that this is an overly long, tediously slow and largely dull film that the average viewer will struggle to sit through. The pacing does it no favours and the near three-hour running length is excessive to say the least. It could have been condensed to closer to the two-hour mark without losing much at all from the storyline.'Silence' is obviously more likely to appeal to those with religious/spiritual beliefs, and they would probably get a lot more out of this film than I did. A well-crafted film, but rather dull and unrewarding for the average viewer.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Brutal and Honest Look at Questioning Faith,"Silence (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) travel to the dangerous Japan where they are looking for their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is said to have turned his back on God. Ferreira was there to teach the Japanese people Christianity but soon members of Japan began killing the missionaries as well as their own people. Before long Rodrigues is questioning his faith and what power it might really have.Martin Scorsese had been trying to get Shusaku Endo's novel made for well over twenty-years when he finally got the greenlight. Some reports stated that the directed refused to make another picture until his dream project came to be and in 2016 it was finally released. It was released to mostly positive reviews but it quickly became clear that it was a box office dud and it even managed to get shut out at Oscar time, which is something very few Scorsese movies could actually say. What's sad is that so many religious movies take the subject on without being overly serious or asking any questions and they become hits. This one here asks some really challenging questions and no one is there.I'm not going to call SILENCE a masterpiece because I found there to be some flaws in the picture but there's no question that the direction, acting and all technical aspects are terrific. I will talk about the major flaw I had with the picture and it's during the first ninety-minutes. I honestly thought twenty of these minutes could have been edited out because I thought it took the film way too long to move forward and get to the real meat of the story, which is the Priest and Father Ferreira having a battle of wills. The film is about one questioning their own faith in brutal conditions and the final hour is where the film really sours and I can't help but think it would have been better had we gotten here a tad bit further.With that said, there's still an extremely deep look at faith going on here and I really loved the fact that it didn't treat the subject lightly or take on that mentality that you can't question your faith. The screenplay by Scorsese an Jay Cocks really digs into both of the Priests and their view on the horrors that they are witnessing people going through in the name of Christ. I thought the film had some deeply touching moments where people must question their faith, stay true to what they believe in even when they know their lives will be taken. There are some really powerful moments scattered throughout the film and the fact that Scorsese decided not to use a music score adds to the power.Then there are the performances, which are wonderful. Both Driver and Neeson are extremely good but so are the various supporting players. Yosuke Kubozuka and Shin'ya Tsukamoto are excellent in each scene that they're in. Then you've got Garfield who really shocked me here. This is a rather quiet role where the actor has several scenes where he's just by himself, thinking to himself and to me this is where Garfield really shined. The quiet nature to the performance means that the actor had to use his emotions and eyes and I thought he did a remarkable job.SILENCE isn't a film that's going to appeal to a lot of people and I'm sure some will find the subject and its questioning faith to be something they won't want to sit through, which is a real shame. It's certainly a film that will take multiple viewings to do it justice but it's a unique film.",,Anonymous,History
Scorsese's ode to his faith,"Far superior to his belly flop Kundun (& less sanctimonius), Silence is a confession by Scorsese that despite working in the trenches of secular hollywood, Scorsese will one day die clutching a tiny crucifix in his palm. A must watch film which will be misunderstood by liberals and misused by conservatives, this is quite possibly Scorsese at his least pretentious.How does it stack up against his other work? Whilst the Last Temptation was a shallow comic book adaptation of a great novel, this is a more mature rendering of the burden of faith. Is it as good as Goodfellas (still his best) - nope, but it is better than the over processed Casino, or the dead-because-it-should've-been-a-documentary Gangs of New York (which was clunky and sloppy).Can't say enough about the cast. Excellent work that they should all be looking back with pride on for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Painfully Underrated,"This was Martin Scorsese's passion project. The reason he waited so long was because he didn't feel like he was ready. But when he finally made it, it bombed. Silence is a deconstruction and an examination of faith and spirituality. It's long, patient, quiet, slow. Thus, by the end of the film you will be exhausted. Andrew Garfield gives one his best performances, watching his soul gradually crumble was nothing short of heartbreaking. Adam Driver and Liam Neeson were great as well. Silence is a film not to be played as background noise. It's very hard to watch at points. But if your patient and committed to view it in it's entirety, you'll find something immensely rewarding. Silence is Scorsese's most underrated film, as well as one of the most underrated films of the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but Too Long and Tiresome Film","In the Seventeenth Century, in Portugal, the Portuguese Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe[ (Adam Driver) ask permission to Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) to travel to Japan to investigate the rumors that their mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had committed apostasy abandoning his Catholic faith after being tortured by the shogunate. They meet the alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) that agrees to guide them to Japan. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the Christians residents live hidden in caves since the Inquisitor kills any villager suspect to be Christian. Along the days, Rodrigues and Garupel propagate Catholicism among the villagers and try to find a lead to Ferreira. But when the Inquisitor arrives in the village with his men, the live of the residents and the priests will change.""Silence"" is a film directed by Martin Scorcese that shows how cruel a man can be. Based on historical facts, ""Silence"" show the powerful Shogunate defending their religion and culture against the European Catholicism that promises easy paradise to the suffered Japanese workers that has to work lot to pay the taxes and survive.

Silence Of The Lambs,"Agnus Dei that is, Lambs of God. What an extraordinary film.Martin Scorsese confirms his seriousness of intent and his enormous respect for his audience.He rates us so highly that he confides in us, telling us something that clearly comes straight out of his heart. Dry, severe, an intellectual's sensibility that becomes clear and accessible to all as we realize that Scorsese is not trying to sell us something but just to tell us, to share with us something that obsesses him. I was enthralled and moved throughout. The performances in a Scorsese film are always superb but in Silence, Andrews Garfield goes a step beyond superb. He managed to make his priest someone I knew personally even if his reality is far, far away from us in time and space. A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
How can anything this spectacular be this dull?,"I really wanted to like this movie. As a Christian, I should have. Yet it is as dull as it is brutal. Arguably some kind of re-enactment of the trials of Christ, all it amounts to is two-and-a-half punishing hours of Christian persecution in ancient Japan, with endless screaming and emotionalism and not much in way of sub-plots, in fact nothing. I kept returning to it doggedly, just as with a book you are determined to finish, yet never really enjoying.

Piercing Silence,"The experience is extraordinary from different reasons. Martin Scorsese with a legendary career behind him breaks new ground with the fierce and renewed passion. A film made for the love of film not for box office expectations. A work of love from beginning to end. Then, Andrew Garfield. What a year for this young spectacular actor. The kindness in his eyes made the journey so personal for me. I must say that I've been very lucky because I've been lead by my mentor (another Martin by the way)into the world of Scorsese. I found Scorsese's films brilliant yes, but too dark, too violent and hopeless and my mentor said, ""No, don't stay in the periphery, go in. You'll see Martin Scorsese's films are religious experiences"" Well I got in, I saw, I felt, I understood and as a consequence I wept for most of Silence. Thank you Marty and Martin from the bottom of my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,History
frustrating,"Two young Jesuit priests travel to 17th-century Japan, where Christianity has been outlawed. The priests wish to verify whether their mentor has apostatized, but end up facing their own crises of faith. Silence is a huge disappointment, mainly because the main premise, a young priest having a theological crisis in the horror of Godless Japan, does not transfer well to screen. It may well be riveting in the original novel, but the interior world of Garfield does not sufficiently become exterior. This despite ample narration from the protagonist himself, and the bizarre introduction in the last 20 minutes or so of an as yet unseen character, a European merchant whose heavy-handed exposition is, I suspect, intended to close the narrative in a way the images and momentum to this point have failed to do. Garfield performs well, Liam Neeson is reduced to a cameo, and Tadanobu Asano is similarly under-used. An implicit critique of Christian missionary in foreign lands is under-developed. What the Japanese made of these interlopers would be worth exploring, but the film shows little interest in the Japanese point of view. For the first time ever, I was bored by a Scorsese film. Silence is dull, and lacks vision.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Masterful In Craft & Rich In Experience, But Dreary In Nature","To this day, Martin Scorsese remains my all-time favourite director, a man whose approach to cinema completely differs to others in Hollywood, his appreciation towards cinema as an art form is his finest quality in what makes him arguably the greatest film director around. With 'Silence' promoted as Scorsese's 20-year passion project, it was a film I couldn't resist seeing, the legend back behind the camera focusing on a subject not fully studied in cinema, a subject that's mostly misunderstood.I want to start with my conclusion and go from there. 'Silence' won't be everybody's film, the same way other ambitious films like 'The Revenant' or 'The Tree of Life' weren't, however despite my respect to Scorsese's mastery and level of detail, in my own honest opinion I believe this film fell short due to the lack of insight into it's main theme and thus instead transformed into a slow and somewhat dreary tale that arguably didn't need it's near 3-hour running time to tell its tale.Now don't get me wrong, in regards to the film's craft it is a masterpiece, the cinematography is raw and epic, the direction from Scorsese is phenomenal and the set design is gorgeous. Accompanying this are a series of fine performances, most notably from Andrew Garfield who should receive monumental praise for his role, I haven't seen such a visceral performance in years, the raw emotion is uncanny. But unfortunately the technicalities and craft can't cover up the flaws that lie in the running time and the tediously slow plot that didn't want to end.If there's anything I can leave you with from this review to help you decide as to whether it's a worthy watch or not, let me just say this: 'Silence' isn't a piece of entertainment, it's instead an experience; and whilst a technically masterful one at that, many audience members may find themselves slowly drifting off to sleep - as my neighbour in the cinema did. It isn't really a case of liking it or disliking it, it's more a case of the adventure, and despite my partial disappointment with it, the adventure was more than worthy enough for the viewing. Scorsese is still an exquisite auteur, flaws or not.",,Anonymous,History
harrowing first half,"In 17th century Japan, Christians are persecuted. Jesuit priests from Portugal and their Japanese peasant converts are being massacred. Word arrives that senior priest Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had renounced his faith. His proteges Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are in disbelief. They travel to Japan guided by refugee Kichijiro who claims to be Christian. They find small communities of fearful Christians trying to hide their faith from ruthless inquisitor governor Inoue Masashige and cunning interpreter Mokichi.Martin Scorsese doesn't know how to film a bad looking scene. The first half is harrowing and on its way to being one of the best films of the year. The midway point has Rodrigues and Garupe disagreeing about trampling a religious icon. That argument needs to be aired out and expanded. Scorsese should have let them stake out their positions. It would clarify Rodrigues' starting point and allow his journey to be more compelling. It's just odd that he seems to appreciate the deadly danger at that point but naively shocked at the actual violence done to the people after that. I expected him to be smarter or at least, not be the doe-eyed innocent shocked at everything. His emotional journey should be less melodramatic so that Ferreira's reveal could be much more shocking. With a minor alteration, the journey would have worked much better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Will take some time to process,"There's a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all it's artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think I'm falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the year's most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.The story follows two priests from Portugal (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who venture into hostile Japanese country in search of their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who has abandoned his Christian faith. Some chalk it up to mere rumors. These two young ministers take the journey to find out for themselves.What begins as a fairly traditional story ventures into the heart of Japan in the 16th Century with a sharp attention to both detail and horror. This is less a story of a search for one man as it is an odyssey into the despair found in conflicting religious beliefs. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) holds hope that Ferreira is alive while also working to convert as many locals under cover of darkness. Upon landing on the shores of Japan (smuggled in on small fishing boats from China), he encounters villages of faithful Christians who worship in secret. For them, the arrival of Rodrigues and Father Garupe (Driver) is confirmation of their beliefs. Through language barriers, it seems that God is always present.As we delve further into the country towards Nagasaki (where Ferreira is said to be held), the two priest break off on separate journeys. Rodrigues, though oftentimes alone, is shadowed by a Japanese recluse named Kichijiro, a drunk who once betrayed his faith in order to spare his life (he witnessed the execution of his entire family) but returns to the faith time again in order to make Confession and amends with the Lord. Rodrigues continues to absolve him, and yet this is the slow unraveling of an aspect of this story: do the Japanese really comprehend the religion in the same way Westerners do?There are three people who make this movie better than average: Andrew Garfield surely gives one of the year's best performances as a man trapped in his own personal Hell, forced to grapple between martyrdom and eternal damnation. It's a strong year for Garfield, getting accolades and Oscar buzz for his other leading role in 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Trust me, this is the better performance. Second is the skill of Martin Scorsese, who slowly paints a portrait of a time long forgot with such attention to tone. It's a horrifying and at times morbid story to sit through, but there was never a moment I found myself any less than fully-focused and contemplative.Third is a surprise, a breakthrough performance by a Japanese actor named Issey Ogata who gives without a doubt one of the year's most memorable performances. Throughout the film the Christians living in Japan are routinely inspected by samurai officials who intend to hunt down and capture any found citizens in violation of the law. One such official is Inoue Masashige (Ogata) who treats the job with a certain flair. Constantly waving a fan and with an ear to ear smile, this is a performance that steps above the rest of the cast by perfectly encapsulating the braggadocious nature of Japanese law without missing a beat. It's a winking devil performance that I hope the Oscars won't look over.'Silence' is at times hard to palpate and yet rewards the audience for it's patience. Whether or not this film can be interpreted as being pro or anti-Catholic is maybe not the ultimate message of this film. While the final act delves into a horrifyingly-dark arena, consider the final shot before the credits begin to role (I won't spoil it). In such a brutal era with antiquated customs, isn't there still hope left to be found?",8.0,Anonymous,History

It's basically asking the big questions, but doesn't really answer them and it won't or shouldn't convert anyone that has already made their minds up either way about the nature or futility of Faith.

"Scorsese in Bergman/Dreyer mode, and it's amazing","It's Scorsese. Martin Scorsese. He makes the best films. Is this one of his best? Hmm....It's a personal/religious epic, but it's all about the interior self - an intimate epic, which is always the toughest to pull off. Silence chronicles morality in such a way that is staggering and with very few specks of light (that is, brief relief through laughter - it does come through the character Kichijiro, more on him in a moment), and it's practically an anomaly to be released by a major studio with such a budget and big stars. This is a story that comes from history you rarely ever get to see anymore - history from a country like Japan that doesn't involve samurai (at least how we see them) and dealing with Christianity vs Buddhism - and it's directed with a level of vision, I mean in the true, eye-and-heart opening sense that declares that this man still has a lot to say, maybe more than ever, in his latter years.Silence is, now pondering it hours after seeing it, possibly the best ""faith-based"" film ever made (or at least since Last Temptation of Christ); in its unintentional way, a great antidote to those pieces of garbage like God's Not Dead and War Room which preach only to a select few and insult the intelligence of everyone else. In this story of Jesuit priests who go on a journey to find a priest who may be long gone but could be found and brought home, it's meant for adults who can and should make up their own minds on religion and God, and the persecution part of it isn't some ploy from the filmmakers for fraudulent attention. This is about exploring what it means if you have faith, or how to question others who do, and what happens when people clash based on how people see the sun. Literally, I'm serious.It's also heavier than most other films by this director, which is good but also tough to take on a first viewing. And yet it feels always like a Scorsese film, not only due to the rigorous craft on display (I could feel the storyboards simmering off on to the screen, I mean that as a compliment, this is staggeringly shot by Rodrigo Prieto, I'm glad Scorsese's found another guy), or the performances from the main actors (Garfield is easily giving his all, and not in any cheesy way, Driver's solid, Neeson seems to be paying some sort of penance for some mediocre action fare), but because of a key character: Kichijiro.He's someone who really fits in to the Scorsese canon of characters who are so tough to take - he makes things difficult for Rodrigues, to say the least, and yet keeps coming back like some sad pathetic dog who can't make up his mind - but, ultimately, the toughest thing of all for this Father, as it must be for this filmmaker, is 'I know he is weak and irrational and probably bad in some way... but he must be loved as all of other God's children.' So as far as unsung performances for 2016 go, Yôsuke Kubozuka follows in a tradition set out by none other than De Niro (think of him in Mean Streets and Raging Bull, it's like that only not quite so angry).I may need another viewing to fully grasp it. But for now, yes, see it, of course. For all its length and vigorous explorations and depictions of suffering (occasionally highly graphic), not to mention the, for Scorsese, highly unusual approach of a lack of traditional (or any) music or score, it's unlike anything you'll see in cinema this year, maybe the decade, for pairing the struggle of a man to reconcile his God and his responsibility to others in a repressive regime with the visual splendor of something from another time - maybe Kurosawa if he'd had a collaboration with Bergman. And yet for all of this high praise, there's also a feeling of being exhausted by the end of it. Whether that exhaustion extends to other viewings I'm not sure yet. As a life-long ""fan"" of this director, I was impressed if not blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,History
When the light of Christianity went out in Japan,"Martin Scorsese took 20 years to bring Endo Shusaku's 'Silence' to the screen, for lack of funding.Set in Japan during the 17 century in the wake of the failure of the mainly Christian peasants revolt against the ruling Tokugawa clan in the wake of the Battle of Shinmabara, in the Kansai region of Japan (including Osaka, Nakasaki, the island of Kyushu and surrounding islands).This salient fact is absent in Scorsese's wondrous film: its absence puzzles the general audience whose grasp of Japanese history is tenuous at best.Pictorially, it is remarkably shot in vivid, painterly colors. Cinematographer Diego Prieto uses fire, the earth, water, air and the vacuum that repression of Christian weigh on the spirit of Japan.Shusaku uses the metaphor of the swamp to designate Japan as unfit for Christianity to take root.But is that true? The Counter Reformation sent forth the Jesuits to bring Roman Christianity to the world. They found fertile ground in southern (Kansai) Japan.'Silence' puts the number of converts as 300.000, including samurai (nobles) and peasants. What, again, is absent in Scorsese script, is that the arrival of Christianity took place in a n age of warring clans, that the Tokugawa Shoguns won, thereby consolidating their rule until the coming of Admiral Perry's black ships forced open in the 1850s, from its splendid isolation.The Christianized south thus became a rival, backed by adherence and, possibly, allegiance to foreigners and the Pope in Rome. Which, it can be argued attacked the idea of what being a Japanese meant, Japan's independence, and the introduction of foreign influences and ideas, manners and trade and customs.The early Tokugawa restricted trade and limited movement of foreigners. After Shimabara, the shoguns in Edo (Tokyo), waged a brutal, merciless campaign to eradicate vestiges of Christianity in and closed Japan to the outside world.'Silence begins with two Jesuits slipping secretly into Kansai to find the only remaining Jesuit who it is bruited has become an apostate.The Japanese authorities forced Christians to step on the portrait of the Virgin or Christ on the cross, to renounce Christianity. Those who refused suffer lingering torture until they expired: boiled alive, hanged upside down with a slit on an artery the better to exsanguinate the victim in a death of a single knife cut, crucifixion, and so on, ,the better to successfully expunge any vestige of Roman Christianity in Japan.Andrew Garfield as Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Father Garppe are on a mission to investigate the truth of Father Feirreira's apostasy.Smuggled into Kyushu, they find a group of hidden Christians who find comfort in the priests presence, the reciting of the mass once more, the ministration of the sacraments, ending a prolonged period of spiritual drought.The priests are helped by a renegade Christian Kichigiro (Yasuke Kubozuka), who like the disciple Peter betrays his God (whom the Jesuits represent) three times. In consequent, risking the very lives of his secret coreligionists.Garfield is a figure in black that is strikingly different with colors of Japan. He is pious, self-effacing, but smug in his beliefs. You wonder about these two men gone far away from their home,; the lose themselves in something larger and stranger than the lives they had known. They are driven by the Jesuit motto: for the greater glory of God. They have taken holy orders, they have a spiritual map and exercises to achieve their appointed goals.Alas, Scorsese's script makes them out to be lifeless, lacking animation. Vapid is the best term to portray Scorsese's concept of them. His genera; conceit may arise from the religious training he received in the old St. Patrick Cathedral School in Little Italy more than 60years ago.Scorsese is, I believe, a very spiritual man, and his film clearly raises questions of right and wrong and salvation.However, for him and his reading of Shusaku's 'Silence', he has sunk into a Western bog when it comes to Japan.And yet, the Japanese characters are full of life and they, in contrast to the Jesuits, are colorful, complex and complicated; and be they peasant or samurai, they come out of the screen, leaving sensory scratches on our minds. They are earthy and full-blooded, they are subtle and keen and maliciously playful in playing hot and cold to stamp out traces of Christianity.Tadanobu Asano as the interpreter and especially Issei Ogata as the wily Inquisitor can, in my mind, rivals Dostoyevsky's breaths much life into 'Silence'. The Japanese cast does a yeoman's job and deserves high praise.In the end, an apostate priest remains in Japan. In a way, if you recall the ending of Evelyn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited', the hero Charles Ryder kneels in the Marchmain' chapel, once again consecrated with the red flame signaling the presence of Christ in the tabernacle, Garfield remains, despite his spiritual sacrifice, a priest, a representative of Jesus in a Japan where technically no practicing Christians remain. But Garfield is that red light until he dies.Truth be told in Kansai, secret Christians like cryptic Jews embraced Buddhism, but introduced Christian beliefs in it.In 1868 when the Emperor gained power, hidden Christians reemerged after 200 years. And they could openly practice Christianity again. But the religious cleansing and the closure of Japan to the outside world did its work. And so they remain a very small minority today.But Christians in Kansai were not spared further suffering. For the plutonium bomb that the Americans dropped on 9 August 1945 wiped out a goodly number of Japanese Christians, and those who survived bore the scars of radiation.In all, 'Silence' is worth seeing. And better yet, reading Shusaku's excellent novel.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I was silenced after watching it,"Wow, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't silenced after watching this film. Really interesting subject matter. I am curious about the book now. When I first heard about the film I thought it looked like a modern ""Andrei Rublev"" set in Japan. Well, I was wrong about that. This film is very much its own beast. These are my first impressions right after seeing it.I didn't know much about the history of the Jesuit priests who traveled all the way to Japan. I did know that some Japanese converted to Christianity, but I didn't know there were that many. So, I was very surprised by that. It does explain a lot though. I understand more of the reasons why a civil war started in Japan that would ultimately lead to any foreigner being banned from the country. It's actually very interesting how the Japanese Christians almost feel more faithful than a lot of the European characters.This film explores both the beauty and the horrors of humans and their faiths. There are many beautiful calm scenes where you can relax and admire the stunning sets and locations. Then there are many scenes that will make you nervous, emotional and horrified because of the cruel punishments that some people must endure.Religion is an interesting subject matter and everyone has their own different view and opinion on it. I still haven't finished processing this film yet, but I'll tell you this; it's something that will stay on your mind for a while. It makes you think about a lot of things. Like what's right and wrong about the different views brought up in the film? And how would things have been different if everyone would have accepted each others beliefs? And even if they didn't believe in the same thing, could they all still live in peace?It's not an action packed adventure, but more of a spiritual journey with exploration about morals, history and so much more.

Well-Made Film But Some Tough Sledding For the Viewer,"I saw Silence on TV. To be brief, the movie is about two, young, 17th century Catholic priests venturing to Japan to find a lost priest. Apparently Catholic priests were not held in high esteem in those days in Japan because the two priests had to go into hiding.I almost turned off the movie at about the half hour point. It was slow going. Eventually it became clear that the priests, and other native Christians, must forsake their religion or die of the Buddhists. To show the priests and the other Christians that they meant business, there was a lot of torturing going on.Anyway, enough. If the viewer is a devout Christian, particularly a Catholic, then the film might have some meaning. It might even be inspirational. To the average joe, it will probably come off as kind of strange. In fact, the inspirational parts for some viewers might seem to other viewers like the actions of the foolish. I was in the latter camp.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Faith is tested again and again for nearly three hours.,"It begins with a cacophonous medley of environmental sounds, such as crickets chirping, before cutting to absolute silence and the title. And then to a shot of severed heads. Perhaps this is Scorsese adding in some of his signature bits of artistic representations and violence. But what follows is an excruciating exercise in repetition, as faith is tested again and again for nearly three hours, with a relentlessness better reserved for succinct motifs, not heavy-handed, protracted lessons on religious dogmata.""There's little peace for us now."" The progress of spreading Christianity in Japan has been halted by persecution and destruction. The remaining padres have - along with their followers - been brutally murdered. Some even ask to be tortured to demonstrate their faith in God, but the end result is the same.When a letter reaches Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds), purporting that one of the strongest of all priests, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), has apostatized and taken up a Japanese wife, two young padres refuse to accept such an unequivocal falsity. Resolute in clearing his name, they determine to make the hazardous journey to Japan to find out the truth about Ferreira's whereabouts. Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) and Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) were directly under his tutelage, and so procure a Japanese man, Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka), living in Macao, to aid in their smuggling onto the island.By 1640, Garrpe and Rodrigues are the last two priests to witness the aftermath of the 20 years of Jesuit persecution in Japan. They make their way to the tiny village of Tomogi before moving on to Goto, where remnants of Christian believers still secretly practice their faith. They must hide during the day and hold mass in the dead of night, always in fear of being found out by the Inquisitor (Issei Ogata), an elderly, somewhat comical man charged with seeking out and eradicating the perceived threat of Christianity.""Silence"" does exhibit stellar performances, especially when it comes to exceptional courage through unshakeable beliefs (Driver being far more convincing than Garfield, in appearance and speech). There are also opportunities for contrasts and fluctuations in adherence to such religious principles, particularly with Kichijiro, who comes to represent many of the failed ideologies mistranslated or misunderstood in proliferating a system so fundamentally alien to many of the formerly Buddhist inhabitants. Doubt also creeps in, as Garrpe grows impatient and Rodrigues questions the illusory habits of a deity that unexplainably remains absent in the most anguishing of times. The two priests, along with most of the villagers, are desperate for tangible signs of faith - signs that occasionally become more valuable than faith itself.In this perpetual search for validation and proof of God's omniscience, there are numerous sequences of profound conviction, made more striking by the increasing pitifulness of the survivors and the escalation of tortures inflicted on those who refuse to renounce the invading religion. But, correspondingly, in this indulgent, overlong epic of potent morals, where the individualization of religious implications routinely trumps the bigger picture (along the lines of the infuriating yet purposeful justifications seen in ""A Man for All Seasons""), there's fleeting entertainment value to be found. It's a historical lecture more than a moving examination of theological unity or human weakness, and surely a plodding series of reiterations on shaping spirituality through pain and fear. It's not quite the ""priestsploitation"" nonsense that it could have been, but it's nevertheless redundant, light on engaging drama, heavy on physical and psychological trials, and sparse on monumental ideas. Particularly with its finale, ""Silence"" attempts to think for the audience, so that they don't have to strain to uncover subtle genuineness; religious viewers will certainly interpret various sequences to a greater (or different) degree than those without perspectives comparable to the characters on screen.The Massie Twins",,Anonymous,History
Silence movie is not well as the book,"Well, dear readers, let me explain why I can not appreciate this movie Silence in high values, even though it is directed by Martin Scorsese, the popular known director and the valuable man of acting world these days. First is because I already read the book. The book Silence of Shusako Endo is amazing. It explains clearly why Japanese people can not be separated from their deep belief of the Kingdom and the Sun. Each religion comes to Japan is devastated in the bush. Japanese's God belief is their own belief and no religion can conquer them. Maybe this core message that Scorsese wanted to build in this movie, but at some points we missed many things. I agree that the title in the book kept in the movie, but the spirit is gone in dramatic way. The viewers can not define the role of the actors, the plots, and the ending. They are just flowing too fast without explanation. The other thing is the role of Liam Neeson. For first I thought that he will lead the plot and be the center of the story as his image on the poster of this movie in all advertorials, but I can judge that without Neeson, this movie can go. So, I can critic this movie must be remade and please give some more details about Japanese culture, traditions, values, and history, so that the viewers can see what happened in that period of Catholic Missionary in Asia, just like they are reading in the book.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The latest temptation of Martin Scorsese,"With regards to Martin Scorsese's SILENCE, let me just put it this way, I saw Scorsese's 1988's ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" back when I was in college, as you know that film was also an adaptation, and I thought it was pure masterpiece just in terms of its themes because whether or not you'd want to argue that perhaps that some of the approach may have been sacrilegious or religiously inconsiderate, if you will, to me it was about wondering the what if's and whether or not doubt has any footing in order for faith to grow. To a certain extent, SILENCE conveys something similar.Based on Shusaku Endo's novel, SILENCE is about two Jesuit missionaries who travel to Japan because they have heard that their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly denounced God. At the time, Christianity was outlawed in Japan, so in their search for their missing mentor, they endure torture, suffering, and the ultimate test of faith.In a way you could say that SILENCE is Martin Scorsese's way of paying respect to the legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa especially for us fans who grew up watching old time Japan's samurai classics, although SILENCE is not action-driven obviously, but the authoritarian rule depicted in this film is definitely something that's culturally based on that particular era.From technical standpoint, SILENCE is as rich and complex as the story itself, even the violence is done in a graphic yet artistic manner. Because the story is told through Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues' perspective, you'll find some of the shots from inside his prison cell, looking out, with the frame being in between the wooden bars, to be quite engrossing. It makes the tension all the more real because your mind just keeps racing, you don't know how much more gruesome it would get. Odd to say this but it sort of becomes a point of anticipation, it's as if every other half-hour or so, you know some Christians are going to get tortured and so you're just bracing for impact. Martin Scorsese's ever-so-reliable high standard quality filmmaking is present through and through, so there's no disappointing you there.After being religious and full of conviction in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" as a Seventh-Day Adventist, actor Andrew Garfield becomes religious and full of conviction again, this time in ""Silence"" and what's interesting is that both films feature Japanese people. All that aside, this is yet another evidence of Garfield's commitment to his work, the same goes for Adam Driver and Liam Neeson who not only went through physical changes, you actually feel a bit concerned for their health, but that conviction is shown in their eyes. It's amazing to see how this former Spider-Man quickly this powerful force. The Japanese actors are equally outstanding, especially Issey Ogata whose performance has his own flamboyant way of being ruthless.This is Scorsese's long passion project, he had been wanting to do this film for years, but the question remains, and those of you who've watched the film are probably wondering it as well. And my answer is no, I don't think SILENCE means to demonize Buddhism. If this film is Scorsese's way of promoting Christianity, then that is his prerogative. But throughout mankind's history, there had been many cases in many lands where the majority religion, whatever religion that maybe, persecutes the minority religion because they view them as a dangerous threat; a symbol of a potential takeover. Inquisitions have happened everywhere. Which leads me back to what I said earlier about how SILENCE reminds me a lot of ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" we see men who are supposed to be like rocks, seemingly falter and start to question their faith, but perhaps questioning your faith is one way of reaffirming it. Liam Neeson's character in this film has a counter argument to Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues and he may make a bit of sense if you see it from his version of truth.-- Rama's Screen --",8.0,Anonymous,History
The story doesn't add up .,"A film about faith that ends up making a fairly complete mockery of faith, as well as courage, sacrifice honor or any other human virtue.What is truly sad about ""Silence"" is that it comes at a time when ISIS is doing the same things to Christians and other individuals of faith, yet seems to justify the horrors committed and basically blame the victims for their own sufferings.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent movie on Christian perseverance and suffering, faith and doubt. Haunting.","I rarely score movies a 10 out of 10, but Martin's Scorsese's Silence fully deserves it. This movie is so haunting, so impressive, has such an emotional and spiritual impact, even after viewing it multiple times, it does not fail to impress, and leave a mark on your soul.The subject of the movie is highly unusual, as well as highly unpopular, both with Christian viewers, as with non-Christian viewers. Some of the reviews here clearly show anti-Christian sentiments who just seem to down-vote because of the clear Christian content of this movie. It's not often that in a movie Jesus actually speaks. Apparently that triggers a nerve, almost similar to how the Japanese responded when Jesuit priests came to Japan to share the gospel of salvation through the redemptive work of Christ in his vicarious death, suffering for the sins of mankind. This has been described in Shusaku Endo's novel, the base for this movie. But we also know from other historic accounts how blatantly anti-Christian the Japanese elite were, seeing it as a direct threat to their rule. The brutal persecution that followed resulted in Christianity being almost completely erased from Japan until modern times, and still modern Japan has only a marginal number of Christians.But the movie goes deeper, touching subjects that also make many Christians feel uncomfortable. Do not expect a heroic, glorious, Hollywood, happy-clappy, superficial version of Christianity, with a feel good happy ending. It goes deep, and it goes raw. Which is not what many Christian viewers seemed to expect either. Not surprisingly, Endo's novel initially was harshly criticized by Roman Catholics, a sentiment that is reflected in some reviewers comments too.This movie not only takes the viewers in a fascinating but gruesome bit of history, it also dares to explore some very deeply disturbing spiritual questions, without providing the answers. The movie is beautifully shot, and the sound design perfectly reflects the gruesome atmosphere. Viewers have complained this movie is too long and boring, but I strongly disagree. The slow buildup, the somewhat repetitious events, all bring the viewer into an inner state where you really connect to the issues presented deep in your soul. And the acting work of Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver is actually amazing, especially for actors of their age. In contrast I found the acting of Liam Neeson a bit underwhelming.At the surface the movie addresses the already difficult issue of suffering and persecution. How is someone prepared to suffer under persecution for the faith that is his deepest conviction? But also, how does a Christian deal with the guilt of denouncing his faith, and can he repent of that and be restored in the faith. And at what point have you suffered enough? Should you give in -- not to save your own life, but the life of others? And if you give in, does it mean you failed as a Christian?But the movie goes deeper, as you can probably guess from the title. How can God allow his faithful servants to suffer? Why does He appear to be silent? Why does He not interfere? Why does He not help these missionaries to spread the Christian faith? It is this same question not only the viewer, but the characters struggle with. Does the silence imply God does not exist? The characters are brutally tortured while facing these questions. And we follow them as they struggle with these questions. Yet, in face of all this, chilling, literally awesome appearances of the suffering Christ are shown, where He speaks to us. Is it imagination, is it real to the characters?The movie is excellent to NOT give an answer to these questions, although it is somewhat suggestive. It offers these questions to the viewer, to think of these profound questions himself.It's rare to encounter a movie which takes such an approach, and dares to address such deeply spiritual themes in such a way to confront the viewer and deeply disturb him.Haunting. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
To apostate,"Martin Scorsese has made a personal epic which he has wanted to make for years. Silence is an adaptation of Shusaku Endo's 1966 historical novel. The trouble is the older Scorsese is not in the peak of his filmmaking skills and this film is uneven even muddled.Despite some nice photography of Taiwan standing in for feudal Japan, I hesitate to even call it a visual epic, the script is laborious which no amount of praise for the film by Pope Francis can make you overlook it.Jesuits priests brought Christianity to parts of Japan in the mid 16th century but it soon became unwelcome. It seems the Japanese became wary of the ulterior motives of some of these missionaries. In the 1630s, Christianity was banned and those who practised the religion were persecuted.Silence follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver) who make a treacherous journey to Japan to find out what happened to their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is believed to have renounced his faith. The two priests regard the claims as a slander and want to find out for themselves.When they arrive they discover enclaves of hidden Christians practising their faith in secret and then witness the torture and persecution of the peasants when they are caught that includes being beheaded, drowned, burnt alive and crucified. It is only now they realise the true plight and dangers that Christians in Japan face.Rodrigues is caught and his inquisitor wants to make an example of him like they did with his mentor. He is taunted to publicly renounce his faith in order to save the lives of others or let them die horrifically and enter martyrdom. Rodrigues gets visions of Jesus and wonders about the virtues of being flexible in his beliefs.The question the film repeatedly asks is whether Christianity can flourish in a swamp. Well Christianity did spread in south and central America, but there the Jesuits and others forcibly converted people and killed or enslaved those who refused. The casting of Liam Neeson just invites people to recall the more superior film, The Mission.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Japan does NOT want European Christianity,"Thinking of the immense suffering European Christianity wrecked on other parts of the world, it would seem, that the Japanese were 100% right in recognizing the evil threatening their shores as early as back in the 17th century - which is the scenario of this movie.If that was the message of Scorsese or if it was, as some have suggested, the opposite; Vis-à-vis the courageous suffering of Catholic priests in face of immense adversity is unclear.A side note: At least Japan was spared the hundreds of thousands of instances of child abuse, that were to come in the places, were the Church succeeded in defeating all opposition.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Purposefully, perfectly slow","When a great movie moves at a slower pace than the average movie-viewer tolerates, they never understand the reason for it. They question & complain about it and yet, often they are still drawn into it - never even quite sure why.As always, the dull-minded viewer will hate this kind of movie. I wonder why they bother to watch in the first place.For the above-average, this movie is a masterpiece in every way - the pace of this movie is excellent and necessary to the entire point & story of the film -
not only in regards to every part of production, dialogue, wardrobe, location, capturing the era, etc, but the depth and feel of the story which - altho based on an actual person, is novel, brings to life such stories as found in Foxes Book of Martyers for one of many examples.While I'm not Catholic, this film is about persecution & working out ones faith & spirituality while being human. Any spiritual path could be inserted here. Deeper thinkers do, & will appreciate it as often as it's viewed in the future.Meanwhile, if you need a bit of inspiration on thinking deeper - specifically about how spirituality both clashes with & overcomes humanity, often simultaneously, think Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"There's a saying in here: ""Mountains and rivers can be moved but men's nature cannot be moved""","Martin Scorsese (The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Goodfellas) together with his frequent collaborating author Jay Cocks adapted the novel by Shûsaku Endô - and few stories could be less suggestive of Scorsese than SILENCE. It is a very long film that explores faith and Catholicism in Japan in the 17th century, a time when being a Christian was punished by torture and death. The film has moments but for the most part it moves very slowly between torture scenes and hiding from the Buddhist forces who desire to cleanse Japan of Catholicism.The setting opens in 1633 Japan as Portuguese Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) is writing a letter. Then the film jumps to 1637. Two Portuguese Jesuits, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) listen as Father Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) reads the letter, which is said to be the last known writing from their mentor, Father Ferreira. Valignano says that Ferreira eventually apostatized to avoid being tortured and now lives in Japan in an arranged marriage. The two Portuguese priests do not believe this because Father Ferreira was their mentor and a committed believer of Christianity and a powerful influence on everyone he knew. They were going to be dispatched to find Ferreira, but with this message, the task seems complete. However, Rodrigues and Garupe beg permission to go to Japan to find out the truth about Father Ferreira and clear his name. Valignano reluctantly allows them to go. Rodrigues and Garupe face the ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor at a time when Catholicism was outlawed and their presence forbidden. They are 'assisted by an intermittently faithful Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) and when captured are interrogated by Inoue (Issei Ogata) and after years go by the faith of Rodigues is tested and to say more would spoil the little story there is.The film is heavy handed, dark, well photographed, and has some solid points about Japanese culture versus Western culture, faith, Catholicism, Buddhism – and in many ways points out the pain and futility of entering another country's space and beliefs and the futile attempt to impose our own ways to 'make them better'.

Interesting historical narrative/ a bit repetitive,So a lot of the reviews on here are clearly taking the religious context of this film to the extreme calling it a Christian propaganda film to demonize Japanese history or Buddhism as a whole but I genuinely don't believe Martin Scorsese had that as an agenda nor would he put his talent to channel that kind of negativity. This movie is based on a book so the story tells of two Portuguese Catholic priests who are at first going on a mission to japan to see if there father mentor truly apostatized their faith. When they end up getting to Japan they find Japanese Christians who have to hide their beliefs due to the severe punishment enforced by the Japanese government at the time. Although the main character shows his will power in trying to uphold his Christian teachings and quest to save the local villages restored faith in Christianity the story is not supposed to tell the audience to be a Christian or show a weepy story about the suffering Christians have endured through out times of persecution. To me it's merely showing a historical account of what was happening throughout Japan at this time in the 17th century and really makes you think about the psychology of man and how much the main character will endure before ending the suffering of others or himself for a God who won't answer him back in his prayers and pleads. I will say the movie could be much shorter but I can see why it was drug on in some regards. The repetitive torture scenes or raids on villages do get a bit dry but are trying to emphasize a point at the same time. Very little scoring as far as music is concerned and the audio mixing was strange in some of the dialogue (minor inconvenience but stuck out in some scenes). Overall the last 25-30 minutes really make you think about what the films central message is and shows an interesting historical narrative. Was the main character too caught up in his faith to sacrifice the church's doctrines or were his choices trying to replicate the image of Christ's biblical story in a Strange ego driven craze. All adds to a great story and for the record I have no religious bias in this review to all the trolls claiming this movie is religiously motivated by the director,7.0,Anonymous,History
Riveted and stunned into silence,"One of Martin Scorsese's very best films? Not quite, speaking as a fan of 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver'. One of Scorsese's best films in recent years? From personal opinion, yes it is but due to its challenging nature 'Silence' is not going to appeal to all taste-buds.At over two and a half, nearly three, hours, 'Silence' is a little overlong and the slow pace may be a challenge for some. Long lengths are not a problem usually in films, especially when a film is continually riveting enough to justify it, neither is slow pacing when more often than not there is a reason for being so.It was clear that the pacing was deliberate and it wasn't an issue at all, because of how well made 'Silence' is and what it does with its themes. Personally do think however that a few of the early parts of the film could have been trimmed down or tightened up, because there are a few draggy aimless stretches that are also rather on the repetitive side, the points 'Silence' makes are made very clearly but in these few spots it was like it didn't quite know how or when to stop.On the other hand, 'Silence' is visually stunning. There are no words to describe how magnificent the cinematography is and am so happy that it's warranted an Oscar nomination, and the bleak and unforgiving landscapes are very evocative of the subject matter and cruel mood. Scorsese's direction is exemplary, hard-hitting but also at times remarkably subdued. The music similarly is a nice fit and doesn't feel heavy-handed.The script was clearly written with a lot of thought and intent and evokes very strong emotions, if a little repetitious in places. The story is simply riveting, rendering images that are hard-hitting with full impact and with complex themes that are expansively explored with raw power but also in a restrained way. The ending is devastating and Liam Neeson's scenes, integral to the film, sees the story at its most focused.All the acting is exceptional, helped by strong writing and sharply drawn characters. Andrew Garfield is subdued but still splendid, while Adam Driver is powerfully moody. Liam Neeson is on fearless form and gives perhaps his best performance since 'Kinsey'. Issei Ogata is superbly shady, and Yōsuke Kubozuka honestly couldn't have brought any more delicious juice to Kichijiro even if attempted.In summary, riveting film, one to experience and live with without ever forgetting, with a slightly shorter length and a little trimming it would have been a masterwork. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very Atmospheric Film on The Subject Of Faith,"Silence features some of the most beautiful imagery to be seen in a Scorsese picture and it manages to tell a very fascinating story about faith.

A hard film to ignore.,"This was one of those films that sprung up out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers at the beginning of Christmas, was it a marketing ploy to get larger audiences. One fact that would certify this film as as a box office blockbuster is having Scorsese written all over it.Based on the titular award winner novel by Shûsaku Endô published back in 1966, a work of historical fiction about two jesuit priest sent on a missionary to 1639 Japan to investigate the disappearance and assumed apostasy of their mentor.Scorsese read the book back in '89 and It's been a project of his for over 25 years, but never getting everything together, never being entirely ready until he finished filming The Departed. Whilst it's not strictly a remake, there is another earlier film made in 1971 by Masahiro Shinoda but had an ending not of the original source, being very much to the dislike of Endô. I do wonder if Endô approves of Scorsese's adaptation.Drawing from his own relationship with the Catholic Church growing up in New York, Scorsese gives us themes of compassion, love and faith. I have been trying to understand the motive to why Scorsese why make such a film, being quite different from the rest of his portfolio. He's a self-admitted fan of Japanese cinema, namely Mizoguchi's 1953 Ugetsu Monogatari that lead him onto others like Akira Kurosawa, and then turning into an obsession.There is a strong taint of classic Japanese cinema here, obviously influenced by his obsession, yet Scorsese adds his flair, the close-ups, the lighting and something gruesome scenes he's so well know for doing, but I honestly don't think I would have known it was Scorsese without looking at the credits, and had I not known, I would have been totally shocked, and possibly be in more awe for the Director.We follow Priests Fr. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Fr. Garupe (Adam Driver) to Japan, in a time she wasn't very welcoming to foreigners. It was common for visitors to be beheaded on the beach. Both on a mission to seek out their mentor Fr. Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who has supposedly denounced Christianity under the torture of the Japanese.Both Garfield and Driver are amazing, portraying their religious dedication with defiance and the uncertainty and fear as they're both constantly tested and pressured, at first hiding from the feudal lords of the land. Liam Neeson replaced Daniel Day-Lewis which occurred because the long delay in production, and I think it's a shame. Not saying Neeson didn't deliver, he does, but I think Day-Lewis would have made an amazing Ferreira.Are people going to like it just because it's a Scorsese movie? Shame we can't do blind tasting look we do with wine, watching it without knowing who's behind the camera, because I honestly doubt anyone could guess it is Scorsese at the helm. It's amazingly captured, perfectly woven into a delicate fashion, but into a very long and drawn out story that can be quite mind numbing for some.Ryan, a fellow blogger shared a quote from Matt Zimmer Seitz's review on the Roger Ebert's website which captures it exactly ""This is not the sort of film you ""like"" or ""don't like."" It's a film that you experience and then live with."" It's certainly a film that's going to be hard to ignore. Being long-winded, and with the subject drama, it's going to be an acquired taste, but it's hard to deny it being a tremendous film, however, personally, far from being my favourite Scorsese movie.Running Time: 5 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 068% 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

"sobering, but with a relativist spin","The author of the original book is a Japanese Catholic, so it's important to realise that this rather gruelling examination of faith and martyrdom was intended - like Orwell's 1984 - not as a hostile critique but one from the inside. It's an irony of history that when you put the story in the hands of Western film-makers you get a spin which has less faith in faith, and seems more in favour of the Japanese state: which is inclined to condone the brutality of the officials in their (ultimately unsuccessful) efforts to root out Christianity. And yet when you look at the eventual results - the cruel monster let loose in the 1930s and 40s which was the result of Japan's incestuous self-begetting - you have to say that history in this case is not really on the side of relativism.Other than that, this is nicely made and performed but depressing, I should think, whatever your point of view. If you're a believer it makes you look a bit stupid. If you're a sceptic it's a reminder of the way ideology can cause people to do things that are insanely dangerous, for themselves and others (but you should remember that you probably have an ideology too). And for all, it's a reminder of how callously governments can treat even their own people in the interests of hanging on to power.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Scorsese Does it Again!!!,"""Silence"" is Martin Scorsese's latest masterpiece of cinema that he's brought us since his 2013 hit ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". ""Silence"" follows two Jesuit priests played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver who invoke on a mission to go to Japan to find and rescue their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) and to spread the faith to the Japanese at the same time.""Silence"" was a film that Scorsese spent the past few decades trying to make and even though it took him such a long time to bring this powerful story to the big screen I'm just glad that it got made. ""Silence"" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Japanese author, Shusaku Endo. I read the book and loved it and the movie is just as up to par as the book. This is one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen, the movie has all the plot points, themes, and messages the book had and brought it to the screen flawlessly.The acting in this film is phenomenal. Every person in this film is on the top of their game no matter how big or small their role was in this film. Andrew Garfield's performance in ""Silence"" better get him that golden statue because he gave such a powerful and emotionally draining performance to the point that I forgot that I'm even watching a movie. Seeing Liam Neeson actually give a dramatic and emotional performance was great, it was nice to see him take his time to be in this film and not go off and do another mediocre action movie.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in this film and there's not one shot that feels out of place or out of focus. Scorsese directs the hell out of this movie and never loses focus one bit, he better get nominated for best director for the Oscars.One thing I will say about ""Silence"" is that it is very long and very hard to watch at times. Considering that the film is about the test of one man's faith automatically seems like an emotionally draining film, it's nowhere what you thought you'd imagine while watching this film. You see our protagonist (Garfield) go through hell and back while watching and experiencing such horrific things. There were times where I teared up and there were times where I grimaced, and there were times where I just wanted to see the suffering end. If there were to be another title of this film it would be called ""Suffering"", no joke.What else can I say, Scorsese pulls another masterpiece out of the box and deserves all the credit he deserves for just making this film alone. If you love Scorsese's work I highly suggest you to go see ""Silence"" because this is one of his finests without a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Slow but Good,"I was interested in this movie because it's unique environment and period. Luckily, Scorsese's ""Silence"" has some great environments, costumes, and cinematography. This is a great movie for those that are really into great cinematography. I also enjoyed the acting and themes around faith. However, unlike some other people, I unfortunately do not see this movie as a masterpiece.Some problems I had were in the pacing, the first hour or so dragged a bit. A lot of the drag came from a lack of developing tension during the start. The tension was too slow to be engaging. After that hour, the pacing went pretty well because of an increase in tension. Another odd thing that bugged me while watching was a lack of Portuguese language. For Portuguese Jesuits, they seem to lack ability to speak the language, even though the Japanese spoke (for the most part) Japanese. This would have been difficult with the American cast, but for the amount of attention put into period costumes and sets I just wish they dedicated some towards language of their period.I overall enjoyed this movie even with its slow start and even if I did not find this to be a masterpiece, I think a lot of people can get a lot from this move.

Silence: A Profound Exploration of Faith and Doubt,"""Silence"" is a remarkably powerful work that often goes underestimated by many. It is not merely an ordinary film; it is a narrative that raises fundamental questions about faith and delves into profound doubts concerning the existence of God.The film beautifully mirrors the sentiments of those who may find themselves uncertain about God's presence. Silence, as portrayed in the film, serves as a symbol of suffering and indifference, truly evoking empathy from the audience. Personally, I felt a strong connection to the struggles of its characters.Despite criticisms regarding its lengthy duration, I firmly believe that this extended runtime contributes to the film's strength. It allows for a thorough and meaningful development of the characters.The only aspect that might be subject to debate is the film's conclusion. In my view, it could have been even more poignant and realistic without the need for overly dramatic elements. Nevertheless, overall, the film imparts valuable lessons about empathizing with doubts, which many people may grapple with.For those who have questions about faith, this film can be a profoundly meaningful experience, encouraging reflection and empathy toward the doubts that often weigh on our minds.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Let many people watch this movie let them comprehend and meditate on this. Martin Scorsese did indeed is the master of his craft a versatile director.

"Powerful, neither too obscure as not to be accessible and neither too obvious as to not be lyrical.","Garfield's a tour de force and the Japanese actors and extras are superb also. There's dirt on the fingers, in the nails, missing teeth and somehow a palpable heat.
Use of natural sound is appropriately pointed and subtle in a film with so little music. Although the mix is odd, as if Scorsese was using recording techniques from the heyday of the religious picture. Garfield is an empathetic human supported by his faith, an equally important Adam Driver sees his faith and the actions that support that faith above all. It's a simple and elegant tale, free of too much judgement and too much didacticism. It's a slow, beautiful, enlightening, sometimes funny tale with a hand in the Terrence Malick camp, a leg in Apocalype Now and a head wedged in Shogun.
Solid, touching, perhaps a little pointless, or seemingly irrelevant, but good quality nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Misguided, Incomplete portrait of Feudal Japan","I was expecting an Epic on the level of ""Shogun"" and got a lecture on the rejection of Christianity in feudal Japan which was shallow and unexplained . The subject matter of Japan in the 1600's as Japan is introduced to Western Culture and Christianity is ripe for an in depth and detailed portrait of the clash between Bushido and Western thought, and is well documented- elsewhere. I was expecting a more detailed study of the resistance to Christianity by Japanese culture of the time to preserve the order of Bushido. Nowhere in the film are the traditional concepts of Bushido and Budhism represented in the film, except for implicitly.The movie seemed to force the viewer to the conclusion that Christianity was the best thing for Japan without explaining how Christianity was in-congruent with Japanese Culture and Social Structure of the time. I began to wonder, are the beliefs implied by this movie born out empirically? A quick survey of Modern Japan today says no. Despite all the strife of the Christian Missionaries in ""Silence"", a mere 1% of Japanese are Christian today. Apparently the writers overlooked core Japanese culture in the making of this movie.A more pertinent theme would take place in the Modern Middle East where massive numbers of Christians are being murdered in the modern world and ignored by the Media.The case of a few Missionaries in Japan back in the 1600's is intriguing only if we study and compare the influences of Bushido and Christianity to the Social/Political normalities of the time.The 1980's Mini Series Shogun delivered this and far more drama than you'll ever find in ""Silence"".",5.0,Anonymous,History

Powerful Kurosawa homage by the great Martin Scorsese,"Saw an advance screening: This is a powerful film, incredibly challenging and well-acted. Amazing location footage, historical details from 17th century Japan, and depiction of a clash of cultures between East and West. Scorsese is clearly doing a Kurosawa homage here, as the film has an old-fashioned epic feeling to it. As for the plot based on Shusako Endo's historical novel, it's remarkably even-handed. At the time of the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate, which only ended in 1867 after American gunboats forced Japan's ports to reopen to trade, the Japanese clearly saw the Catholic faith as symbolic of Western cultural and political takeover. But does that justify the torture, coercion, and killing of Christians to make them abandon their faith? We might consider a historical analogy: When the Spanish later felt the same way, driving the Moors out of Spain and forcing those who remained to convert to Catholicism because of the perception that Islam symbolized cultural and political takeover, do we excuse the Spanish Inquisition? The best answer might be that we can understand even if we do not excuse violent push-backs against invading cultures. There is perhaps an allegory here, as well, to the current plight of Syrian refugees and their reception or non-reception by European nations. In any event, the themes here are rich and complex, and the cast -- particularly Garfield, Neeson, Driver, and the masterful Japanese actor who plays the inquisitor -- are outstanding. This is Scorsese at his finest, eschewing black-and-white thinking in favor of complex moral dilemmas. I don't think I've ever seen a mainstream Hollywood film that is as intelligent about addressing cross-cultural and inter-religious dialogue as ""Silence."" The anguish of religious faith is part of what's going on here, but it's only the centerpiece of a very rich cinematic canvas.",10.0,Anonymous,History
zealotry,"Of course Scorsese is a great director, oh well, he had had his great moments, this one, i feel is a very personal movie. Struggling catholic as he is. Before the movie gets really interesting, about half time, you have to work yourself through a barrage of zealotry. Like, always a favorite amongst believers,: the silence of god as a proof of his presence; this bullshit is so persistent and tiresome. If we are focusing on this nonsense nothing will become of us, that's for sure. So..the movie; interesting story but the moment you start to question the premises, you see a deeply xenophobic( the people from Japan are unable to see and receive the grace of god blah blah) movie.

Praying in silence,"Set in 1600s, ""Silence"" follow two Jesuits from Portugal who were sent to Japan looking for father Ferrera - who denounced God in public. And as soon as they arrive to Japan, a series of events was set in motion to emphasize the controversial question we have all been asking ourselves: ""Is there a god?"" First, I must say, this could have been a boring and dull movie. However, under the hand of a veteran director like Martin Scorsese, the story became thrilling and deeply haunting, with the setting in Japan (Shot in Taiwan) just make it more beautiful. As a Christian converted from Buddhist myself, I find a resemblance of my concern within the context of this movie. While it is unquestionably faithful to Christianity, Martin successfully balanced the movie to make you have to question yourself is there a god and is he listening to our prayer. That is quite impressive, considering that he is Catholic. The movie also showcase how incredibly good the trio main characters are and so are the Japanese actors. They were so good that even though the movie was filled with dialogue for 3 hours long, I never look away from the screen. Although the movie would make you look away from it because of its uncomfortable contents. All in all, this is the best movie I have seen this year and you should give a chance because it's Scorsese.

"""I'm just a foreigner who brought disaster.""","As expected from Martin Scorsese's film, the technical aspects of ""Silence"" are all at a high level, but the essence is what turns me off so much, that I couldn't watch it in its entirety. Eventually, I managed to see it as if it was a mini-series, dividing it into four ""episodes"".""Silence"" is about Portuguese Jesuit priests who went to seventeenth-century Japan, where persecution and genocide of Japanese converts are underway. Their goal is to find a lost missionary, whom they heard had committed apostasy before the Japanese Inquisition.To risk, and even to sacrifice own life for a loved one (child, partner, friend ...), that I understand. To live in constant fear, hiding underground like an animal, risking death in severe torment for oneself and one's family, stubbornly refusing to renounce religious belief, even if only officially, is not only strange to me, but insane to the point that it makes this movie almost unwatchable.I am not able to sympathize with the persecuted people, who have caused misery to themselves, nor with the missionaries, who go to the other side of the world, among people who are racially, culturally, and traditionally completely different, to impose their beliefs on them.For me, it is a fanaticism with which I cannot identify and sympathize, and, therefore, the film varied between boring and irritating, which makes me incompetent and inadequate to judge it ...""Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging at some of its most critical moments...

"Powerful, meditative religious epic on struggles with faith and persecution by the master Scorcese","Silence is an incredibly well made film about the struggles of early Japanese Christians in the 1600s against religious persecution.Martin Scorcese directs a near masterpiece of a film, beautifully shot, with powerful scenes and good all- around acting. His depiction of 17th century Japan is absolutely stunning, and the story is easy to follow despite the clashing of languages.Gar field and Driver are sent from Portugal to find Father Fierera, who is feared to have renounced his faith among the persecuted Christians. What they discover is the hostility towards Japanese Christians is violent and intolerant.It's a story of the struggle of faith and how far would you go to remain true to your faith and beliefs. In the end, the answer might not be what you would expect. How the inner belief differs from the outward profession is brought into discussion as the consequences of nonconformity to cultural absolutes enforced by the empire's oppression of foreign religious sects may undermine their cause.A well-made movie on many fronts, Silence is unique and comes off like a spiritual, exploratory epic and a work of art with much more depth and insight than most movies this year. It seems like a movie that could have been shot in the 80s as it has an older feel and ambiance to its staging, pacing, cinematography, and characters.While the movie is long, it is mostly engaging, and although the pacing is slower, it still maintains your interest in this reflective, introspective epic.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Silence (2016),"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Andrew Garfield, Tadanobu Asano, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, Issey Ogata, Yosuke Kubozuka, Shinya Tsukamoto, Ciarán Hinds, Yoshi Oida, Nana Komatsu. (R)After receiving word that a priest (Neeson) living in Japan has renounced his faith following torture at the hands of authorities persecuting Christians, a pair of young Jesuit priests (Garfield, Driver) travel there to find him. Scorsese and Jay Cocks' adaptation of Shusaku Endo's book (previously filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) is an examination of the power of faith and the ""silence"" of God when one suffers and cannot hear or feel His/Her presence and compassion, reflective of the director's long-held struggle with his own religious ideals and beliefs. The film's deeply thoughtful austerity creates a hurtle to accepting its message--it unfolds too slowly once the priests' journey begins, and doesn't always fully engage once pivotal plot points arrive; the patient will be rewarded, however, by its lingering propositions. Vivid recreation of 17th century Japan is always gorgeous to look at (even at its most brutal); cut by Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, but those pacing issues (and an overlong denouement) cannot be overlooked. Strong performances from most of the cast, especially Asano and Ogata. Had long been a passion project for Scorsese, closing out an informal trilogy of faith alongside ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Kundun.""81/100",8.0,Anonymous,History

Important issues marred by an academic script,"A film about Jesuit evangelizing in 17th century Japan. It raises all the right questions about faith, religion and culture-clashes but thanks to the film's ineptness these issues remain inert.A big problem is the script, attributed to Scorsese, which apparently went through many re-writes, usually not a sign the words will leap off the paper, or in this case, the film. The dialogue seems academic, a not very imaginative re-creation of the way priests might talk in the 17th century. Instead of an experience we get a dissertation.And then there's the language problem. The priests are Portuguese but they speak in English. As do the Japanese although it is unlikely they would know English, or more to the point, Portuguese. Subtitles with people actually speaking their native languages would have made the film seem more realistic.The other problem is casting Andrew Garfield as the lead. Utterly unconvincing. Liam Neeson is better but the best acting goes to the Japanese, especially the man who prosecuted the priests, the 'inquisitor' played by Issey Ogata.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Most will find this movie boring!! So its for those interested in psychology of faith.,"Most people will find this movie incessantly boring. And to the average movie going public it will be.The story starts with Liam Neeson. As a Priest he is stuck under arrest in Japan witnessing the torture of many newly converted native Japanese Christians. This then cuts to two young catholic priests: Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) & Adam Driver (Star Wars) discussing with a senior member of the church on a attempted rescue missions of Priest Neeson (or as he is known Father Ferriera). This is because word got back via a letter after some years that he had rescinded on his christians beliefs. The two younger Padres simply cannot believe this - as he was the man who brought them to their faith. They want to save him - not just physically but for his soul too. Therein their adventure ..or more misadventure ..begins. For the next 2 hours they trek to Japan to find him.I would say this movie is only really for those who are interested in the psychology of faith or have a view about it. They will maybe find some interest in the examples and questions it raises.This is a story about the prostelyzing Western Christianity pitted against 17th century Japanese Bhuddism. The Japanese are very hostile to it and want to hunt down & purge this ""alien faith"" out of their shores. (However, it could easily be a story of any dominant belief system pitted against a minority one)This movie has some connotations to todays religious devotees. Most current in the news being Islam. Certain sects are fanatically faithful to their ways and interpretations of Islam. I am Muslim - so I can relate to some of the tests these Christians face in this movie.The basic test asked by the Japanese Bhuddist is: ""step on this image of Christ if u don't want to get executed"" - to the average laymen its probably laughable. But you would have to imagine what if you were imprisoned and asked to spit on and shred something scared to you. ie your last ever picture of your family.Apostasy and blasphemy isn't much of an issue in Christian communities anymore but its very much prevalent in certain muslim communities. This would be a viable test of faith to apply to a Muslim stepping on the pages of the quran for example. A devotee would be hard pressed to do it.In the movie those who can't do it are brutalised to death. Those who can, let go as an example to others. This, the two western priests, have to witness being done to their new Japanese converts at great personal anguish and pain. It's a test even to their own faith.I won't talk anymore about what occurs further into the movie. You will have to watch to find out if they find Father Ferreira. And what happens to them.The movie seems to be an amalgam of themes from Last Temptation of Christ (the trials of Jesus), Bridge over the River Kwai (the beat down by Japanese militia) and Apocalypse Now (important figurehead goes astray and somebody must find him)The movie I think asks the question: Is religious faith a good and powerful thing or is it all a bunch of hogwash when put to the test?Are people falsely imbued with a sense of faith in a heavenly paradise when it gives them nothing but pain?I am not sure from which angle Scorscece is aiming at faith here. He is either admiring it or proclaiming those who have it are brainwashed fools. You will have to watch the film to make your own mind up.But Scorscece no doubt finds religion fascinating. If you do then you will get something out of it. If you don't - give it a wide berth and perhaps catch it when its on TV.",7.0,Anonymous,History

5/10,"After receiving a worrying letter from their mentor Ferreira (Liam Neeson) from Japan, Portuguese priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver) embark on a journey to reach Japan in order to find their beloved colleague and help the Christians against the religious oppression perpetuating during the 1600s by the hand of the Japanese Buddhists.I think that the best way to explain my thoughts on this film are to start by explaining my history with legendary director Martin Scorsese. Whilst I think that ""The Departed"" is a top-notch film and find ""Hugo"" to be a really well told tale, I have rarely had the pleasure to enjoy his films. That's just how it is. From the 1970s right down to his latest efforts I have always had a really hard time with Scorsese and I have grown to actively dislike some of his films, whilst still finding something to mine and appreciate in them.I find that there is a common thread with what I come to dislike in his pictures. Firstly, I have always had a hard time in keeping up with his third acts, from ""Cape Fear"" to ""Goodfellas"" I have always carried myself through to the ending forcefully and have rarely appreciated his climaxes. I have always felt them as meandering and over long, not really getting to a point. Which brings me to my biggest problem, with the exceptions listed above, I have never left a Scorsese feature with something to take with me, I've never had a payoff, his films have generally left me cold and empty, his thematic explorations have often frustrated me and given me not much to appreciate.I once felt like this must be a coincidence, but the pattern has repeated itself too many times for it to be considered so, ""Silence"" being no the confirmation and actually embodying the worst about my criticisms. This is a religious slog-fest that made me angry in its self importance and complete nonsensical length.Now, I don't want to appear like I'm a jerk, whilst everything I said above is true I can't help but have anything but respect for Scorsese, he is a giant of cinema, his achievements are overwhelming, it just so happens that he really has a hard time in matching my taste and whilst he managed to get really on my nerves here, in particular, because of some of the thematic messages, I still find in all of his pictures a lot to appreciate.For one, ""Silence"" has a great first half, the drama with the characters is alive and touching, the portrayal of 17th century Japan is raw and unnerving, the atmosphere that is captured is genuinely unsettling. The point of view that is established in this first half is not a religiously inflated one, what is moving about it is how we witness the hatred that man can be brought to and the contrast with the innocence in the Japanese farmers is ever so captivating.Driver and Garfield really fuel the drama with some remarkably intense performance work that manages to not call attention to itself. Their journey is unpredictable and the recreation of the chaos and the poverty of the time really hits home. The cultural differences are explored on a visual level other than a thematic one and it makes for some really good viewing, I will fully admit that up to the hour and forty five mark I was following the drama attentively.On a technical level the film does have some fantastic production design, but for the rest there is something that really stands out as being remarkable, probably a reason for which the last hour becomes so overbearingly boring.Then comes the last hour, which shatters to pieces everything achieved before, changing perspective and escalating in melodramatic, masturbatory, religious bullsh*t with an ending that proves its aimlessness and disgusting self-importance. The drama just turns off, it evolves in a discussion that has no heads nor tails, to the point that I felt like it was contradicting itself at times. The ending is abysmal, ridiculous and trivial in a way that made me stand up and leave the cinema angrily without even waiting for the first credits which I always do.If I am listening to a full hour of religious debate which combines ethical and moral complexities to it and I am left utterly bored and empty there is something that is worryingly wrong about the film for me. I was lost for words, every word that was uttered was a further step down for the film, a real disgrace because for a good portion it was going for something an succeeding at it, then came the rest of the feature and made me sick with boredom and anger.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Scorsese's Preachy Sermon,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: In the hands of master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese has made a beautifully crafted but preachy (and boring) historical drama.GRADE: C+JIM'S REVIEW: Similarities with other sources abound in Martin Scorsese's epic film, Silence. Two missionaries are sent to a foreign country to spread the word of their prophet. No, it's not Roland Joffe's The Mission, Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast, James Clavell's Shogun, or, for that matter, The Book of Mormons...although if the film has some comedy or musical numbers, it would have at least been memorably. The film is actually more akin to Apocalypse Now...as these two envoys are sent on a mission to stop a former leader who has fallen from grace. Not the Vietnam War, where thousands were brutally killed...rather the Holy War, where thousands were brutally killed. Here the battle is over religious souls in this cinematic philosophic debate of a film.Set in the 17th century, this historical drama follows two Jesuit priests, Father Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), whose mission is to travel to Japan and rescue their former mentor, Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neesom) from renouncing his faith. As they journey to a strange land, they are met with a violent culture that will stop Christianity by any means possible and demand apostasy (the renunciation of one's religious tenets) or death to any of its worshipers. The padres cling to their faith while their flock is sadistically slaughtered in grisly detail.One cannot deny that Silence is grandiose filmmaking. Mr. Scorsese knows how to craft his tale with enough style and dramatic flourishes. One could not expect less from its great director, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks. His images are on an epic scale and the photography by Rodrigo Prieto is just glorious to behold.But there are inherent problems with the screenplay film itself. Silence trips up on its own words. The film regurgitates scenes of torture, both psychological and physical, that weaken the overall impact and border on the excessive. Its talk-torture-talk-torture format becomes redundant.While the subject makes for fascinating viewing, the road traveled is filled with lengthy scenes with languishing pacing, underdeveloped characters, and an overuse of voice-over narration to explain the plot rather than show the emotional anguish. The spectacle is visually supreme while the dialog has a heavy-handed message that never seem genuine. There is just too much proselytizing and arguing over the word of God that it becomes superficial debates and overshadows the characters who seem more plot devices than real people. There is nothing unique about the narrative. History has already proved that many have died under the guise of religion (and will continue to do so). The film is more sermon-like than it need be. Mr. Scorsese is literally preaching to the choir, with enough fire and brimstone to last seven Sundays.Mr. Garfield is compelling as Father Sebastian. His character is such a direct Christ figure in appearance and stance. Almost too saintly to be considered human, he becomes a superhero of God. Yet the actor gives a nuanced and multi-layered performance. Mr. Neeson, in a smaller role, brings some gravitas as well. But Mr. Driver, who is an interesting presence, has little screen time and simply disappears midway through the film, which is a misstep. More problematic however is some grave miscasting in two pivotal roles: Issey Ogata as the inquisitor supplies very little menace to his role and Yôsuke Kubozuka as the weak Kichijiro becomes a form of unintentional comic relief as written. The tragic tone of this character eludes him.Silence remains a strong and passionate work by Mr. Scorsese. It is a serious work of art with a Capital S (and add a Capital B for Boring). The film is in dire need of judicious editing and major rewrites. On one hand, it relentlessly rails against the Catholic Church and its teachings while showing a reverence to its own piety. The film avoids its own silent code and tends to shout its message. tends to shout its message. There's far too much sound and fury in this well-made film when a quiet noise would have been a more powerful statement about the persecution and tyranny that befell its believers. And, I must confess, the slow and laborious pacing of this film was a personal hell for this moviegoer. No matter how wonderful this film looks, and on that count it succeeds, the film ultimately left me praying for a swift conclusion.Silence is a major disappointment from a master filmmaker. Let us pray that his energy and vision comes to a better end in his next creative venture. Can I hear an amen to that?",6.0,Anonymous,History

"painfully powerful historical drama, Andrew Garfield is exceptional","First, my very few criticisms: the second half, particularly the last 40min or so, was very underwhelming. I can only assume that it was however faithful to the source material, an acclaimed novel I haven't read. Secondly, Adam Driver wasn't in it nearly as much as expected; nonetheless, he was excellent. And that's really about it. The first half of the film engaged me more than I expected, and really wore me out. It was immersive, hard to watch in places, raw, evocative, and superbly acted. Even as an atheist, it deeply saddened me in ways few films have before. Liam Neeson delivered a solid performance, too, but Andrew Garfield was easily the star. I'd not have expected such a role from him, but he excelled to say the least. Riveting from beginning to end, mostly thanks to him.

A Cry Louder Than Anything Anyone Saw Coming,"I never thought I'd see the famous Martin Scorsese spend two decades working on a retelling of 17th century priests spreading Christianity in a country that forbade it, but by George he's done it! It still misses the intended level of perfection, but Silence reminds us of one important philosophy: We have no need to suffer while spreading the word of our beliefs, as God always speaks through silence.Scorsese grips us into the uncomfortable experience with the torture of several Christians, only a handful of thousands others facing the same fate. They are tied to crosses far away from their village, and the Japanese authorities slowly pour water directly from the hot springs onto their bare flesh. One of these Christian missionaries, portrayed by Liam Neeson (Michael Collins, Schindler's List), provides a voice-over that sounds like the mouth of God. Things may look hopeless from his perspective, but less than three hours later we learn of the Lord's consistent activity in their trials, despite His apparent silence.Two new American priests, depicted by Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge, The Social Network) and Adam Driver (Girls, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) set out on a life-or-death mission of ministry to the ruthless city of Nagasaki, Japan. Here, anyone committed to Christianity must hide in the wilderness, or else be forced by governmental rule to place their foot over a stone image of Christ against their will. Other forms of persecution includes burning at the stake and hanging on a cross over crashing waves, ensuring a slow and excruciating death. Despite the stunning, picturesque camera-work by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Brokeback Mountain, The Wolf of Wall Street), the unholy conditions of this God-created land turns back onto his people. It makes you question: Where is God in moments of silence?The cast who recreates these events put on at best average performances, depending on how much creative juices director Scorsese pours into the particular scene. Yet top priority goes to the creative storytelling, even over the depth of the acting and characterizations. The two leads could not be more miscast, while nobody in the supporting cast has enough written detail to make you care for their predicament. For instance, one of the key characters gets killed after we don't see him for an hour, and then nobody ever mentions him again, almost as if he was never at any point necessary for the priests' mission. I'd also like to note a rather bizarre out-of-place moment when the priest played by Garfield looks into the water and sees his reflection as the painting of an apostle. He laughs at his distorted reflection as if he's had too much wine or something. It's a moment which you're not sure about how you're supposed to feel while watching, so you just cringe in an uncomfortable silence.The blaring errors aside, Mr. Scorsese's latest effort stands out from his others, as here there are no profound levels of cursing and violence, and no excessive love towards old filmmaking. In fact, he and his regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker (Goodfellas, Raging Bull) step back from his widely celebrated abrupt edit patterns, and instead keeps the pace as slow as possible to honor whomever suffered so much under God's supervision. No accompanying musical score to lend an ear to either—in fact, the sound mixing ranges from minimal to absent, depending on how much we can hear God speak through silence.Unlike others before it, this motion picture explores an unfamiliar place and time in history in an informative approach. It makes it easy to quickly parallel this account to the present-day worldwide desire to freely believe whatever without facing either hatred or persecution. If you were to watch these horrific trials placed on the faithful, a reminder should erupt within you of the everlasting hatred plaguing our world, yet another will erupt of hope for those evangelical souls not afraid to speak.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Divisive, but powerful film","I will have to let my opinions on this film really rest because as of now I don't know how to really feel or how to pinpoint all of my thoughts on it. Viscerally, it's a pretty powerful film. Scorsese knows that for so much of it to ring true he needs to really cut back on many stylistic flourishes and let the story speak for itself, and he's able to do that while still maintaining a strong handle on the whole thing. It's an incredibly ambitious film and I found myself immersed by it but also quite overwhelmed. I found the whole thing really effective as I saw it but an hour after it having ended I'm not really sure to what extent I like it. The acting is pretty great, although I do wonder if someone else other than Garfield would have been even better. The standout for me was Yôsuke Kubozuka.",,Anonymous,History
Challenging but oh so worthwhile exploration of faith,"SILENCE is a film you need to steel yourself to watch. You should not just throw this on at a whim. It's 2 hours and 40 minutes, and it is not exactly briskly paced. It is challenging intellectually (and perhaps spiritually, which it is meant to be), and isn't ""fun"" to watch. But it rewards careful, thoughtful viewing. Martin Scorsese often deals in religious themes...either directly or not, but this film is in many ways his most direct look at FAITH. What does it mean to hold on to your faith in the most difficult of circumstances, particularly when God isn't answering your most fervent prayers? Does that sound like a fun topic to spend so much time with? No? But again, come prepared to watch and listen and with an open mind...and you may be rewarded.I am not religious (but have belonged to churches in the past), and I don't want anyone thinking that I feel this movie will ""make"" you religious or faithful. But even if you are not, surely you can acknowledge that faith IS important to many. This film is set in the 17th century, and follows two young priests who bravely travel to Japan, a country that is dangerously hostile to Christians. And in this ""unenlightened"" time, belief in God and the redemption offered by Jesus was serious business. Even if you are someone who scorns religion in our day and time...please recall the context of the film.The two priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) live in terror of discovery. For capture is likely to mean torture and possibly death...but even more dreadful for these frightened but sincere young men is the notion that they may be driven to renounce their faith. That in the end, they will give up their very souls because they won't have the strength to do otherwise.The film explores this notion to a great degree (arguably perhaps just a bit repetitively). If you renounce your faith to save yourself or others...will you truly be damned? Can you keep your relationship with God even if you have renounced him to the world? Can such apostacy be forgiven? (There is a Japanese character in the film who continuously renounces his faith and then confesses his sins and is forgiven. Is this actually a viable survival strategy?) Anyway, the film grapples with tough topics and in typical Scorsese fashion, does not shy away from gruesome details (although he has done far, far more graphic work). I won't tell you more plot details...I'm really just trying to convey that this is a film that takes on some big issues and does not offer easy answers.Garfield is quite credible in his role, and Adam Driver makes an excellent counterpart to him. Driver, in particular, very much looks the role. Be warned, Liam Neeson is hardly in the film. His character looms large, but is only seen for a few minutes. The film features much gorgeous scenery (I saw it on Blu Ray...highly recommended.) Everything about it is immaculate, in typical Scorsese fashion. The sound is wonderful, the costumes detailed and convincing. I recommend the film...but again, with a strong warning to give it the attention it is due. There is no ""multi-tasking"" allowed while watching, unless you want to just be bored by the film. It asks to you to participate in mulling over the big issues it presents. Reward yourself by going along on that journey.And if you ARE religious, I think you'll find your faith challenged. Not your belief in God and in the ""rightness"" of your belief...but you'll be asking yourself...how strong is my faith? Were I to face a similar circumstance, how would I respond? This film is NOT sacrilegious (although it is strongly Catholic)...don't worry about that. But it asks you direct, uncomfortable questions.SILENCE is an immersive, lovely and challenging film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Always beside you, never silent","It took me some time to comment on my most anticipated film of the year - ""Silence"", by Martin Scorsese, but it was worth it...The central notion of spirituality and human nature is the very essence of faith in this masterpiece by Mr. Scorsese.We see two Jesuit priests (Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield) going on a journey in peril. The aim - to find their mentor - Father Ferreira, who has renounced his faith after being tortured in Japan.St. Paul's college in Macau is indeed a symbolical building to marvel at. It emphasizes on the transience of an era of devout, dogmatic Christianity. But still, its facade exhibits the magnificence of the human spirit. And how faith can travel and conquer, but also stay and change, transform any place in the world.There is a really nice poem called ""Footprints in the sand"". It speaks volumes of the Christian faith, and to that matter - volumes of any faith, which is righteous. It goes like this:""One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord.After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. ""Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""He whispered, ""My precious child, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you.""This is very much what to my account this movie is about. The hidden treasures of faith lie within our own understanding of life and its meaning. In ""Silence"" not all questions of father Rodrigues are answered, as nor do all of our delusions meet their end throughout our lives. But we all witness the pain and torture which the great ensemble of characters endure. Here, I must really praise the directorial work and all the actors' incredible performances. We must emphasize that all characters - from the main one to the smallest and most episodic ones - are represented truly and faithfully.We see Japan and the Japanese way of life as it is. Nothing is spared, nothing is hidden. Nature itself is a major character in this movie. It is no coincidence that ""Silence"" was nominated only for Cinematography for the annual Academy awards - perhaps this is the most incredible part of the film. I cannot explain enough how the visuals speak volumes of storytelling to the viewer. We are engulfed in the sounds and colors of this magical godly realm called Earth. You must truly experience this both beautiful and disturbing nature of the movie.The screenplay twists and turns around us and our expectations. We feel our own doubts and remorse, we live the same life deeply within is and at the end of the journey we feel maybe a bit better about out choices in life. Not because the film gives a final solution, or because it pretends to be a parable. This monumental work from Mr. Scorsese about how the human spirituality works is a fine example of storytelling through introduction of a riveting internal dialogue within each and every viewer.I myself feel the need to share this film with everybody that cares for cinema, spirituality and purpose in life. It is a shining example of a perfect movie experience and a carefully paved way to self discovery.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Phone Call From God...,"Mmm..here's one that's difficult to evaluate and offer a polished critique of. Perhaps it's best just to say whether one just enjoyed the film for 'what it was' and whether or not it moved you in some way, rather than getting into...well, you know. I personally don't think Scorsese has made a 'bad' film, not the ones that I've seen anyway, with the exception of Gangs Of New York and that's only because I've never seen it. Never did and still doesn't appeal to me.For the time being anyway.
However, I liked Silence a lot, although by its end, I had the feeling it isnt saying anything we all didn't already 'know'. Still, it was a project the man had envisioned for many years, so we should respect him and the film for that.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Silence is yet another Oscar-worthy Scorsese master work,"After deciding that I'd go to a Saturday matinée of this Martin Scorsese film, I began to laugh.I knew that I wouldn't have to arrive at the movie theater super early to get dibs on my favorite seat because, seriously, is anyone other than me rushing to the theater to see a film about Christian persecution in 17th Century Japan?""I'll probably have the theater all to myself,"" I thought.As things turned out, I was wrong, but not far off. There were eleven people – including me - in the theater during my viewing of this film. There's good news and bad news in that.The bad news is that based on my very narrow theater experience, millions of people aren't going to see yet another Scorsese masterwork. Pity.The good news is that Scorsese was able to get this film made during a time when it appears that our culture is obsessed with many of the things that run afoul of God, Jesus Christ, faith and everything else that this film is about.It was such a pleasure to sit there in near silence and let this profound piece of film making just wash over me. This is what Martin Scorsese does best. He gives you brilliant storytelling, spectacular cinematography, soul-scouring drama and delicious food for thought that I'm certain will remain with me for months to come.Without question, ""Silence"" should be winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2017 and Scorsese should be Best Director. Few storytellers in the film making arena have his mastery and authority. God bless them, but they just don't.Actors Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Liam Neeson are all fantastic as Jesuit priests fighting bloody battles beneath brutal Japanese religious rule. Garfield is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination here and I continue to be astounded by Driver's total commitment to his roles. Neeson gives us his usual steely reserve that only vaguely hides the moral turmoil brewing beneath.I'm left with so much emotional and mental residue from this film. Scorsese weaves so many themes in this epic screenplay adapted from Shūsaku Endō's novel of the same name published in 1966. You leave asking yourself just what would you do or not do for your faith? Do you have faith? Would you die for your faith? Would you deny Christ? Should you trust God? Where is God? Is He here with me amid the silence? Does His silence mean He's not there?""Silence"" is a deep, beautifully-woven film that Scorsese finally completed after many years of staying the course. One might argue that that mere fact that he got this film made was an act of faith and utter devotion in itself.By the way, I must give some hearty shout-outs to Tadanobu Asano, Yôsuke Kubozuka and other Japanese actors who are simply sublime in this film. I want to see more of these fantastic actors in roles in which they're playing contemporary human beings not primarily defined by their race or culture, but rather their contemporary humanity. But that's a story for another day. No?In short, ""Silence"" is a glorious film that really is the jewel in Martin Scorsese's film making crown. -- Michael K. Corbin, ArtBookGuy.com",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of Scorsese's very best films,"Martin Scorsese has wanted to make ""Silence"" for a very long time, (he secured the rights to Shusaku Endo's novel 28 years ago), and now that he has I am happy to report that this is one of his greatest films and one of the finest films to deal with religion and spirituality ever made. It is the story of Father Rodrigues, (a magnificent Andrew Garfield, virtually never off the screen), one of two Jesuit priests, (the other is played by Adam Driver), smuggled into a 17th century Japan in which Christians, and priests in particular, are being put to death. They are there to find their former spiritual mentor Father Ferreira, (Liam Neeson in a small but commanding role), who it is rumored has denied his faith.This is a long film, (almost three hours), and concentrates almost entirely on Father Rodrigues, who is portrayed here as a Christ figure complete with his own personal Judas, (a superb Yosuke Kubozuka). Will he find Father Ferreira and will he deny his own faith or suffer martyrdom? The film never deviates from this central theme and Scorsese and his cast, (there's great work, too, from Issei Ogata in Oscar-worthy form and Tadanobu Asano among his tormentors), never slackens their grip. This is Scorsese at his most austere, art-house rather than multiplex Scorsese with no concessions to his audience. It is absolutely not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but slow and long-winded,"1630s. Christians in Japan are being persecuted and news now reaches Lisbon that the senior Jesuit priest in Japan, Padre Ferreira, has renounced his faith. Two Jesuit priests set out to Japan to not only find Ferreira but also to continue his ministry.Interesting drama, directed by Martin Scorsese. Quite gritty in its depiction of the persecution Christians faced, as well as the dilemmas they faced. The moral quandaries of the priests when faced with torture and death, not only of themselves of their flock, are explored well.Some good themes covered, especially faith and what one has to do to remain true to it. Powerful ending.However, far from perfect. The movie moves at a glacial pace and is quite long-winded and verbose: many themes and dilemmas are repeated unnecessarily. Quite difficult to remain engaged and focussed when things happen so slowly. Some editing would have gone a long way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Religious much?,"The premise is that Christians had it really tough in Japan. They were hunted, they were punished unless they became faithless. In a way this is what Rome did way back in the day, when they were trying to suppress Christianity. Of course we cannot forget that Christianity also tried to force themselves and their believe on others, while invading countries for quite some time.So everything relating to punish people because of religion, I'd say not really a good thing. Whether it be of what you believe (or don't) or what you want others to believe. This journey is really a tough one though and as others already have stated here, this is not an entertaining movie. It also brings home the message way before the movie ends. In other words, it may have done with a shorter running time.Having written all that, I can also say as many have before me, that this is technically brilliant. The actors also doing a great job, Scorsese going back to one of his favorite themes. While Bringing out the Dead was not successful and had its issues too, this sees an expected evolution to the theme. Tough and long watch then, are you up for it? Will this be something you want to see?",6.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely one of Scorsese's best!,"'SILENCE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Martin Scorsese's new historical epic, which has been a passion project of his for over 25 years! The film is adapted from the 1966 novel, of the same name, by Shusaku Endo; which has been adapted into a movie once before (in Japan, in 1971). Scorsese directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay, with Jay Cocks; who also co-wrote 'GANGS OF NEW YORK' and 'THE AGE OF INNOCENCE' (both directed by Scorsese). The story revolves around two 17th-century Jesuit priests, that travel to Japan, from Portugal, to find their missing mentor; who is reported to have renounced his faith there. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciaran Hinds. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it was named one of the ten best movies of the year (by the American Film Institute), and it's expected to be a major Oscars contender. I think it's an absolute masterpiece.Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Father Sebastiao Rodrigues (Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Driver), learn that their mentor, Father Cristovao Ferreira (Neeson), supposedly committed apostasy; in Japan, years earlier, after being tortured there. The two priests do not believe this information is true though, and they decide to travel to Japan to find out the real truth. Once they arrive in Japan, they learn that all Christians there have been forced to go into hiding; and many are executed if they're discovered. Rodrigues and Garupe struggle to keep their faith, while they're also put through a grueling test to renounce it.I have mixed feelings about what Scorsese is trying to say (about Catholicism) in this movie; and I'm not even completely sure what the film's true message is. Being raised a strict Catholic though, I'm fascinated by movies that deal with religion; and I think Scorsese is a very talented filmmaker at bringing them to life. The movie is always intriguing, highly involving, and breathtakingly beautiful to watch. Garfield is fantastic in the lead role, and I think his character is very sympathetic; I think almost anyone can relate to being forced to go against what you've always believed, in order to accomplish a greater good. The movie is a pure masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Scorsese's best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Unlike anything you've ever seen before, for reasons both good and bad","Having wrestled with getting Shūsaku Endō's 1966 historical novel adapted since 1988, Martin Scorsese's 28 year battle with screenplay, financial and legal troubles is finally over with the release of 'Silence'; an epic story of two missionary priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) and their journey into 17th Century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed on pain of torture and death. Their mission: to find Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who went years before to spread the word of God but supposedly denounced the faith whilst there.Films that extend to over 2 hours 30 minutes are not unfamiliar to moviegoers of the 21st Century; even the mighty superhero genre has ventured beyond this mark with 'The Dark Knight Rises', which was undeniably stretched. Notably though, Scorsese is one of the master filmmakers in this area and standing at 2 hours 41 minutes, 'Silence' is similar in length with his other projects. However, it consistently peaks and drops between scenes of fascination and disinterest; for this reason, it does not reach the heights of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' or 'Gangs of New York' (both over 3 hours long) which expertly maintain the viewers captivation throughout.Where the moments are good they are artistically beautiful, as cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto provides atmospheric shots of Taiwan's (standing in for Japan as the setting) landscape so sweetly, it makes such dreadful torture scenes where people are burned with boiling water or drowned at sea somehow feel serene. But when the artistic nature of this film cannot be appreciated during the admittedly repetitive extended scenes of dialogue, it nadirs to pure boredom, and one cannot help but think 'Silence' tries too hard to make the viewer aptly acknowledge the magnitude of the film.Fulfilling the mainstream appeal of this film, Andrew Garfield rises from the ashes of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' series with undeniable gravity, and Adam Driver proves his acting skills further, swaying far from the 'Star Wars' franchise, which has type-casted many before him. But both fall just short of legendary performances with unstable Portuguese accents in with their English dialogue, adding to the films inconsistency. Liam Neeson's talent is barely used; even he looks confused at his lack of participation at times, but is still as solid as ever. But it's the Japanese cast that truly shine here, with Tadanobu Asano and Issei Ogata playing their respective roles with conviction, portraying their manipulative characters with confidence and unquestionable ability.Scorsese addresses the complex issues in this film with the experience that one would expect from the 74 year-old classic director, and while 'Silence' may not be as engrossing as 'Goodfellas' for example, it is eloquent yet sharp to the point, and can be a joy to watch.'Silence' is a culmination of artistic class and mundanity, certainly not a highlight amongst Martin Scorsese's vast collection of thrilling and intricate plots that have been seen in his previous films, but it stands out as possibly one of his most aesthetically creative works yet.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Torturous - exactly as Scorsese intended,"Silence is slow. Silence is long. Silence is not for everyone. Scorsese's lesser-known (and under-appreciated) retelling of this 20th Century novel is a beautiful but relentless film, detailing the brutal reality of bringing a new religion to a foreign land. Amazing cinematography and filmmaking going deeper than basic storytelling portrays the story, acted with suitable gravity. There will be points where watching is borderline torturous - and that is exactly as intended.Unfortunately, this cinematic style will not translate for many people: impatience and tension are both paramount to this film, as by making the viewer feel powerless, you begin to understand just how the characters also suffer. Japan is an amazing backdrop for this story - cultural differences help emphasise the difficulties faced by Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they try to survive their new home, whilst also searching for their estranged teacher, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). Japan's architecture, symbolism and intrinsic way of life all lend themselves to the story, whether explaining native religious devotion, or the methods of torture and negotiation employed.Scorsese is not a director I have a deep love for: mobster films do not particularly convince me, and movies like The Wolf of Wall Street are more colourful than they are quality. However, Silence shows a compassionate side and a passion I had not seen before from this veteran; the vision to direct something as stark and yet nuanced as this is something to be commended on its own. The film is a test - not just for the characters, but for those watching - and this technique is so difficult to execute without alienating your viewership.Some of the visuals do lack a critical edge. There are scenes shot on the water or with lavish backdrops that suffer as the result of shoddy CGI, forcing poorly-rendered fog to drift around the characters. Furthermore, some of the dubbing is not brilliantly done, and characters are occasionally seen talking out-of-line with their physical movements. These are infrequent, however, and Scorsese's use of water, darkness and wilderness is truly amazing. Silence is about immersion: if the priests cannot see, neither can you; if the characters struggle to understand, the viewer will as well. The acting mirrors this, as Garfield and Driver both embrace the roles fully, flanked by some quality Japanese actors throughout.Silence falls into a similar bracket as Joker, in that they are not conventionally ""enjoyable"" films. More, they are exhibitions of cinema, bridging the gap between novel filmmaking and Hollywood epics. To me, this might be one of Scorsese's best films - for all the right reasons, I hated it as much as I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Incredible Christian Movie - Silence,"Incredible Christian Movie - Silence. Silence is most likely the most beautifully shot Christian movie. I suppose that's no suprise considering this is from the same people who made other well made movies like Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. (What a resume!)Silence is also very violent- which is a factor to consider in seeing this- there are people burned alive, be-headings, crucifixions, drownings, etc. It's not quite as harsh as The Passion of the Christ, but it can be just as heartbreaking. Christians in Japan died for a living Savior.You do not watch Silence to ""enjoy"" it, even though it's great and very moving. You watch Silence to experience the reality of religious persecution, and to learn how hard keeping faith can be. The God's Not Dead films should take note, this is REAL Christian persectution. Andrew Garfield's character actually steps on a picture of Jesus after he hears Him allow it since He knows his actual heart. However, we see in the end (I won't say how) that he faked it and really HELD unto his faith. I told someone I know at church who is against R rated movies about Silence and she refused to try seeing it just because of that. Yes, it's hard and sad to watch this happen, but think about how much Garfield endures for his faith.It's a harsh reality that he would do that, but it IS a reality for some people. This raises an important question: what would YOU do?That is another positive about Silence- it asks many questions and leaves them unanswered for you to answer yourself. Questions like: Is faith worth giving up? What if it benefits another? Does God forgive those who fake giving up their faith? Should you teach your faith to those who do not believe?",10.0,Anonymous,History
Scorsese's Passion Project,"We're lucky to have this film in theaters. Martin Scorsese worked to get it made for close to 30 years. While I can't fault the importance or overall uniqueness, the final product isn't exactly the easiest to connect to.Scorsese makes notoriously long epics. Most of the time, I enjoy the length and they can even leave me wanting more. The man is just that good at filmmaking. He's also consistently produced some of the most memorable scripts, whether they're written by him or someone else, over the last several decades. Silence contains some 'best of' Scorsese for sure; including a maniacal but fleshed out antagonist, several brutally relentless scenes, and some magnificent performances. But I'm not sure this ranks near a top 10 list for his career as an overall feature.Not starring Leonardo DiCaprio nor Robert De Niro, Scorsese got Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson to head this historical epic dealing with two Jesuit priests and their trek to find their mentor in faith, who they refuse to believe has apostatized. Especially during a time when Christianity was banned in Japan, this voyage is a fascinating trial of faith and reserving what you believe in, even if it means torture or death. A similarly themed movie, Hacksaw Ridge, also starring Andrew Garfield was released earlier this year. Both movies are well-made, brilliantly acted (although I think Garfield was better in Hacksaw), gorgeously shot, and portrayed thought provoking themes and ideas throughout.With that said, I don't think Silence is as interesting as it could have been. With a glaringly slow pace, by the end of the film you are so drained with the experience of these two priests that it's hard to want to spend any more time thinking about the story at hand. I also found it a little difficult to connect to the characters, because of how far we are removed from that time-period. Some can certainly say that some of the same belief issues are going on in today's world, which is fair, but the aesthetic of mid 1600's Japan felt very separated from our world. Which I guess, can also be contributed as a compliment to Scorsese's ability to transport you to a different era via set design and cinematography.I liked Silence. I think it brings up interesting questions involving faith and showcased what was once a world torn by religion pretty flawlessly. I just wish it was easier to connect with the characters, the run-time cut down, and the pacing be picked up.+You get a feel for what this world was like to live in+Fascinating themes+Brutal-Slow burn-Besides a few memorable scenes, the characters needed to be easier to connect to7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""I am so tempted to despair. The weight of your silence is terrible.""","""Silence"" (2016 release; 161 min.) brings the story of several Jesuit priests in Japan. As the movie opens, we get to know Father Ferreira in a flashback in what looks to be maybe his final days. We then move to the present day, 1640, where Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe, Portuguese priests in Macau, and pleading with their superior to let them go into Japan to look for the missing Father Ferreira, whom they last heard about in a letter written in 1633, already 7 years ago. Their superior agrees, despite the clear and present danger to venture out in Christianity-hostile Japan. When Rodrigues and Garupe get smuggled into Japan, much to their surprise they find there is a thriving underground Christian community. But it isn't long before the dangers start popping up... At this point, we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is Martin Scorsese's long awaited (over 2 decades) ""religious"" film, about the trials and turbulations of Jesuit priests in 17th century Japan. While things are happening pretty quickly in the initial 20 min. of the movie, they are most definitely slowing down to a glacial speed in the middle 90 min. of the movie. So if you are expecting some sort of an epic historical action-drama, please adjust your expectations immediately (in particular as it relates to the ""action"" parts), otherwise you are bound to be let down, if not outright disappointed. I think the movie's running time is in fact too long, and could've easily be trimmed by probably 15-20 without losing much of the narrative. That said, if you can hang in until we get to the last 45 min., you are bound for a wonderful payoff. I thought the last part of the film was nothing short of mesmerizing. The central theme of the movie (will Rodrigues renounce his faith to save himself, like Ferreira may have done?) plays out beautifully. ""I am so tempted to despair. The weight of your silence is terrible."", Rodrigues tells us in a voice over, and we hear his pain! Along the way, we are treated to a visual spectacle (has there been a movie containing more fogged landscapes that this one?). Andrew Garfield, MILES away from his erstwhile Spider-Man days and just after his equally acclaimed performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge"", is outstanding as Rodrigues. Adam Driver disappears from the movie altogether after just an hour (but for one short scene afterwards). Neeson makes an appearance both at the movie's very beginning and again in the last 30 min. When the end credits start rolling, Scorsese dedicates the movie to those that advanced catholicism in Japan, and adds for good measure Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (the Jesuit slogan, meaning For the Greater Glory of God).""Silence"" opened wide this past weekend, and under-performed at the box office. This does not surprise me, as it takes quite a commitment to sit through this overly long film. It it weren't for the movie's excellent last 45 min., I'd have rated less than what I am rating it now (4 stars. The early evening screening where I saw this at on MLK Day here in Cincinnati was not attended very well (about 10 people), and unless there is a a significant pick-up in Oscar nominations next week, I can't see this movie lasting much longer in theaters. That said, if you are a Scorsese fan, you will definitely want to check this out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Such a wasted opportunity,"The source material was a brooding, excellent movie about faith, humanity, sovereignty, etc. and Scorsese turned it into an interrelationship drama about priests, a binary on Christianity and Japan, and never once even manages two or more shots displaying the scale of imperial Japan elites and the peasantry, for example, Castle shot in relation to the smaller houses over a distance.It's really a disappointment; not a bad movie, but a movie with the potential to be talked about for decades on end. Here's to hoping another director gives it a try in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Silence Speaks Louder Than Words.,"As a Christian and a film buff, both God and movies are very important to me, and I show that by placing my favorite Christian movies above all of my other favorite movies. Silence is my 2nd favorite Christian movie, after The Apostle. I suppose that's in part due to Martin Scorsese being my favorite director.I first heard about Silence a few years ago, and I was excited about him making a Christian movie- I happen to also adore his controversial yet uplifting The Last Temptation of Christ. (Which I have also reviewed.)I later found Silence on DVD and watched it with my Grandma- who enjoyed it but decided that she would never see it again.Silence is about 2 missionaries, one played by Andrew Garfield and another by Adam Driver. They go to Japan when they hear that their mentor (played by Liam Neeson) has renounced his Christian faith. With no other way to confirm this, they travel to the country and face persecution, along with a small number of Japanese Christians.They have to then renounce their faith for the government by doing acts such as stepping on religious icons or spitting on crosses. And if they refuse, they are tortured to death. Andrew Garfield's character holds onto his faith, but it turns out that it may be harder than he thought it would be.Silence is most likely the most beautifully shot Christian movie. I suppose that's no suprise considering this is from the same people who made other well made movies like Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. (What a resume!)Silence is also very violent- which is a factor to consider in seeing this- there are people burned alive, be-headings, crucifixions, drownings, etc. It's not quite as harsh as The Passion of the Christ, but it can be just as heartbreaking.You do not watch Silence to ""enjoy"" it, even though it's great and very moving. You watch Silence to experience the reality of religious persecution, and to learn how hard keeping faith can be. The God's Not Dead films should take note, this is REAL Christian persectution.Here, I have to SPOIL something. Andrew Garfield's character actually steps on a picture of Jesus after he hears Him allow it since He knows his actual heart. However, we see in the end (I won't say how) that he faked it and really HELD unto his faith.I told someone I know at church who is against R rated movies about Silence and she refused to try seeing it just because of that. Yes, it's hard and sad to watch this happen, but think about how much Garfield endures for his faith.It's a harsh reality that he would do that, but it IS a reality for some people. This raises an important question: what would YOU do?That is another positive about Silence- it asks many questions and leaves them unanswered for you to answer yourself. Questions like: Is faith worth giving up? What if it benefits another? Does God forgive those who fake giving up their faith? Should you teach your faith to those who do not believe?If you want to learn more about Silence, I suggest going on YouTube and looking up ""The Movie Proposal Episode 12 Silence."" Here, 3 Christians discuss their thoughts on the movie-and one calls it the ""best Christian movie, period.""This sums up the main ideas of how I feel about this religious masterpiece, though I could say much more. (That YouTube video will help me more.) It's a movie all Christians, and just about everyone else, must see. And good for Martin Scorsese for making this right after The Wolf of Wall Street!While many Christian movies are rubbish- God's Not Dead, Unplanned, Loving The Bad Man, and Left Behind, for instance, Silence is one the prime examples of a faith based movie done right. It is a beautiful and remarkable masterpiece. Martin Scorsese has fashioned a wonderful Christian movie where silence truly does speak louder than words.*Edited from my review from my old page written on 1/28/19.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Silent Treatment,"In this expensive, long-nurtured and extremely long 'personal' project Scorsese again tackles head-on the religious component which is a subtext to most of his films; in which God as usual demonstrates His boundless love for humanity by maintaining an aloof silence to the wailing, gnashing of teeth and purging of the flesh (usually bathed of course in beautiful amber shades by Oscar-nominated cameraman Rodrigo Prieto) that His silence permits to continue.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A test of faith encapsulated marvelously by Scorsese.,"Martin Scorsese's 26-year long passion project 'Silence', despite certainly not being a film for everyone, is a remarkable, captivating piece of cinema. Featuring stunning cinematography of the lavish '17th-century Japan' and powerful raw performances from stellar Andrew Garfield, Yosuke Kubozuka, Adam Driver, and all the cast alike, the storyline was thoroughly engaging and impeccably executed by Scorsese and team. The film's length acts as a strength in the narrative, encapsulating fully the purposely drawn-out travels of Rodrigues and Garupe, and despite it's length I was utterly engrossed through the film. Sound plays a key thematic role in this film, having a heavy influence on scenes sometimes more-so than the dialogue; the only thing that irked me were the rough-cut voiceovers, especially in one key scene with Garfield, however it is easy to look pass. The film ultimately provokes thoughts galore on faith, humanity and humility, and you will be left pondering and shocked at the religious persecution presented on the screen. It is one brutally intense, movingly beautiful masterpiece, displaying a long and at times uncomfortable journey that shines under Scorsese's direction.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Martin Scorsese's Schindlers List (Though Not Without Its Flaws),"When I sent to see this film in the theatres about halfway through the man in front of me got up blocking my view and I got such a shock because I had been focused on the screen for so long because this is a film that always grips your attention and holds its through its fantastic performances, intense sequences and smooth directions. I loved the fact that this is a film that Martin Scorsese chose to do this movie because it shows his range as a director as he did such a good job directions this film he used a lot of long takes even during the hardest scenes to watch that helped to give the film a greater impact on me. The cinematography in this film is also stunning everything from the sunny hills to the fog filled pits look nothing less than life like. Andrew Garfield has easily become one of my favourite actors working today, while Hacksaw Ridge doesn't get released in my country for another few weeks I've heard nothing but good things about his performance but in this film he easily gives the greatest performance of his entire career through his performance we very clearly see the gradual breakdown of his character and his suffering was easily easily conveyed through Garfield. Liam Neeson makes his return to drama in this film and while he wasn't in this film much he definitely did a fantastic job while he was there. This film asks a lot of questions about faith and people's interpretations of god and there is a lot of division to the subject and everyone who believes in something or holds a belief in this movie is always convincing, you never take just one side in this movie and the viewers ability to do that better illustrates the struggle of Garfields character. But I can't say this film is flawless for one Adam Driver while very good in this film doesn't get a lot do To he doesn't have much screen time so ends up suffering from a lack of characterisation. Martin Scorsese is known for using a lot of narration in his movies and it usually works but here I found it to be over used at times in scenes where just silence would be more effective. Another Scorsese trade mark is a very long runtime but again here it doesn't always work as I found the ending of this film to be very drawn out to unnecessary levels.While I don't quite thinks it's Scorsese's best I do think that it will go down as one of his most ambitious projects. Silence is definitely going to get a few Academy Award nominations for acting and technical qualities. While this isn't a film I'm going to rush to see again it's definitely one that I'm not going to forget any time soon.73%/B",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Torturous Journey,"I cannot find anything to recommend this movie . A movie of repetitious torture and death brought about by two Portuguese priests bringing the Lord to the 17 th century Japanese . Big surprise despite tons of prayers and suffering tortures and death for God, He saves no one , but the intrepid priest ( Andrew Garfield )seems to think the next bunch he endows with Christianity will some how be saved from these indignities. Took twenty years for Scorsese to bring this to the screen , wow. Casablanca completed in 8-9 weeks great from start to finish with meaningful and beneficial sacrifice by the characters. Really I felt more tortured than the victims in this movie , it required real sacrifice for me to see it through to the end.",3.0,Anonymous,History

One of the finest religious movies ever made.,"My Rating : 7/10Martin Scorsese's passion project of 25 years, 'Silence' is a religious movie dealing with themes of faith, doubt, hope, suffering, salvation and one's belief in God the Almighty - both sacred and profane.The pacing of the film is purposefully slow with interesting cinematography to keep the viewer engaged with sparse narration and dialogue. It is Scorsese's most minimalist film and does away from his usual theatrical quality of violence - though there is some violence in the second half - an unusual combination of religion and violence not often seen in movies of this kind.The strongest, clearest way to understand the story of Silence is through the character of Rodrigues, because his arc hangs on a double thread: that of his role as a European missionary in Japan - what from the 21st century might seem like a ""white savior"" complex - and that of his place as a priest struggling to understand how to imitate Christ and realizing, slowly, that he can't, or at least not the way he thought he should.It's a long film and you really need to be in the mood for it to enjoy and absorb it fully as it is very simple and often gets repetitive.Enjoy it for what it is, Scorsese seldom makes such arthouse movies, the others being The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016) which rounds up Scorsese's trilogy of spiritual films.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Puzzled as to why Silence is rated so low,"This is perhaps one of my most contrarian ratings on IMDb - I really think Silence is an amazing film and cannot understand why it is rated as 7.1(!) at the time of writing.Often referred to as Scorcese's life project - as he spent over 2 decades trying to gather the budget to produce it - Silence dives into the journey of two Portuguese jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver) to Japan in the 17th century, with the aim of finding their mentor, father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who is rumoured to have renounced his faith.
The script was based on Shusaku Endo's novel written in 1966.The imagery of this movie and tonalities are amazing, and really help create the feeling of discreteness and concealment associated with practice of Christianity in Japan in that age, under severe persecution - Silence was even nominated for Best Cinematography in the Oscars.I have no particularly sympathy for Christian missionaries (Japanese persecution is perhaps no different or worse than what the Inquisition did in Europe) but the way Scorcese depicts the struggle those priests face, between spreading the faith and putting their followers in danger, is absolutely gripping.
There are scenes which are incredibly hard to watch, but in a good way.The only reason I see for this movie to have less than a 10 are perhaps:
a) casting of Andrew Garfield - don't get me wrong, his acting is great but hard to see him as a pious priest of 17th century given his lush head of hair and after playing Eduardo Saverin or Peter Parker
b) main character personifying Japanese persecution is very cartoonish, with a high pitched voice and overall comes across as too biasedNot the only Scorcese movie that touches on religious matters (Last TEmptation of Christ and Kundun) but definitely very much worth watching

Challenging start to the year's movie-going,"My first movie of 2017 is a fairly challenging one – Martin Scorcese's 'treatise' on Faith and Apostasy in 17th-century Japan. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver play two Portuguese priests who travel to the Orient to look for a missing predecessor (Liam Neeson) and to bring comfort and sacramental rites to Catholic converts who are being persecuted and tortured by Samurai inquisitors.Interesting to discover that Buddhism, which most of us think of as a pacifist, contemplative religion, has a history as dark and violent as that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The silence at the heart of the movie is the silence of God: does He hear the prayers of the persecuted; and does He mind if people stamp on an image of Christ to save their lives?Apart from the harrowing scenes of torture and brutal execution, much of the film is shot in darkened rooms and daytime fogs. There are many long scenes – too many, too long – of dialogue between Garfield and the Inquisitor. There are a couple of clunky moments which attempt to echo Christ's Passion, and a Japanese 'Judas' pops into the story a little too often. Garfield gives a performance that reminded me of Montgomery Clift – that sense of tension waiting to be uncoiled. Driver's role is more physical, more heroic, less subtle. Liam Neeson relies too much on the gravitas of his presence. The last chapter in the story undermines much of the film's intensity and the final frame feels like something added as a 'sop' to today's evangelists.Inevitably you find yourself comparing SILENCE to Roland Joffe's 1986 epic THE MISSION. Scorcese's movie arguably has more depth and definitely more debate, but THE MISSION had a 'magnificence' which SILENCE has less of – and Joffe's movie had that resonating Morricone score. SILENCE deserves points for nobility of purpose and Mr Scorcese is clearly a man of huge integrity,",7.0,Anonymous,History
Silence,"Silence is an incredibly powerful film. It captured my attention from the very first second, but it also captured my thoughts for its duration, as well as for the time after. When a movie does that, it is special in some way. And this film certainly is special.Although religion is a central driving force behind the narrative, this film isn't really about religion. This film tells of the battle between Buddhism and Christianity, and Japan and Portugal. But those religions and countries could be replaced by others. This change wouldn't hurt the narrative or make it any less impactful. So, what then, is this movie about, if not religion?
It's a movie about faith. It's a movie about our relationship with faith. How it can drive us forward and how it can affect us. How it can let us down, and how we see it at our darkest moments. These themes could be applied to any religion. They could even be applied to things other than religion. As such, I believe it's false to look at this movie as one purely about religion.Moving the focus towards faith and the narrative, we find ourselves joining two Jesuit priests on their quest to find a fallen priest from Japan during the inquisition. A premise that could've been approached in very different ways. The approach that Scorsese takes is one of conviction, deliberation, and discovery. A film like this could've easily been overly violent, but the focus here is on faith. The way Silence explores faith, be it through hardships or success, left me moved. Although I'm far from being religious, the power that this film had on me was surprisingly impactful. Seeing how far people are willing to go for their beliefs and their faith, but also how unwavering faith can be in those who are supposed to teach it to us, left a profound impact on me. But alas, as much as I would like to describe how effectively faith is explored in this film, I simply can't. This is one of those movies that needs to be experienced. How you see and feel this movie depends entirely on how you see and feel faith.While the power of the story moved me immensely, what struck me the most, was the beauty of this film. When I said that Scorsese's direction was deliberate, I was mainly referring to how this film looked. Every shot was composed and framed with such care and deliberation, that, at times, I was transfixed by the sheer beauty of what I was seeing. Certainly, the stunning scenery helped. Silence is easily one of the best looking movies that I have recently seen. And although it deals with a heavy story that can feel hard to take in, the calming nature of the way it looked, helped make it more palatable.Silence is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. It's slow and difficult. But it's also beautiful and meaningful. Although it can feel even a little too slow at times, the overall effect it had on me makes it more than worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Makes it Point Perfectly but Prolonged...Too Self-Indulgent & Obvious,"Long, Indulgent to a Fault, but Beautifully Crafted ""Tale of the Christ"", Told through the Trials and Tribulations of Catholic Missionary Men in 17th Century Japan and the Resistance by the Rulers and the Sometime Conversion by the Peasants.It's a Grueling, Gut-Wrenching Film and looks like a ""Labor of Love"" from Director Scorsese, and is Certainly a Commentary on the Labor that it takes and the Toll it Requires to be a Lover of a God who is Not in Geographic or Cultural Fashion.The Faith or Religion of Choice almost Always Demands Pure Devotion and can Not Tolerate anything but a Singular Compliance to Doctrine, Dogma, and Devotion Restricted to the Confines of the Conventional.It is a Frustrating, Feeble, and Foregone Conclusion about Religion that is and was so Powerful that it Grips its Followers in a Fatalism Followed to the Death, Enduring all means of Torture, Oppression, and Imprisonment unless the Faith is Denied among Witnesses.The Parallels to Today in Certain Situations cannot be Denied.

Masterpiece for an extremely niche audience,"This heavy film is not for the faint of heart or the casual viewing. To truly appreciate this masterpiece (and it is a masterpiece, undeniably so, crafted by a master at the height of his craft) you must simultaneously belong to two narrow demographics:First, you must be intimately acquainted with and ingrained in Japan and its culture, yet still be an outsider. And I do not mean the weeabu, otaki dork Japanophiles. They would be horrified to see this under side of their anime utopia and soundly reject it all as lies. But if you've lived there, worked for a Japanese company, been raised with the real, actual, culture, been in, but never of, Japan? The frustration, the exclusion, and the total and complete irreconcilable alienation between the two cultures in the film will feel as familiar as going home and you'll be as comfortable as a frog in slowly heating bathwater as you nod along and agree that, yes, this is exactly what Japan is like under the welcoming surface gloss: Japan is a mud swamp.Secondly, you must also be Christian. A legit, have-read-the-bible, believing, questioning Christian. Having attended seminary would absolutely help, as this is not a surface exploration. The questions of faith will not stab you straight through the heart if you have no faith to question.With those two conditions met, you're in for a defining movie which will crush your soul, twist it up, then spit it out, queasy and disoriented, to stumble away and never forget the experience.If you meet only one condition, you'll miss a large chunk of the movie and not even know it exists, but the exquisite construction of the film might carry you through to appreciation nonetheless. (Though it won't kick you in the head like it would others.)Have neither and you'll be lost and bored.A historian might appreciate the film, but this is more for the religious philosopher than the cultural anthropologist. Torture porn fans may erroneously flock to the film, but this is not for them. The true horror of the torture is the mundanity of it. How everyday and boring it has become to treat humans in the worst of ways. Excellent for deep thinkers and those having existential crises.You will only ever need to watch it once, but that will be enough.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Silence (2016),"One of the things I always look forward to is a new Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese is definitely one of the best filmmakers of the past and present, although I haven't been to impressed with his recent streak of films. With Silence, I was hoping for a special film that could rank among some of his best. Silence seemed to be that film that would be a cinematic and spiritual experience. It does not disappoint on that level. However, upon reflection I'm still a bit mixed on this film. In fact I'd say this will polarize the audience and that's probably what Scorsese had in mind.One thing I hope is that people aren't liking this movie because of the religious conflict. I think personal beliefs should be checked at the door when experiencing a film. If you go in with the mindset that this is sacrilegious to Christianity then you will have a biased view. Suspend your beliefs as they would say. I'd say Silence should be viewed in the theater or in the highest quality possible because some of the cinematography is beautiful. The oceans, plains, forest, clouds, pop out at you on the screen. Fog is seen often in the film and its great for suggesting a feeling of unease, anticipation, and even fear of the unknown. Scorsese's camera-work is always a joy to behold and it won't disappoint here. One of the most notable aspects of the film is the lack of non diegeitic music. There's a minimal use of a score, Its truly silence in that aspect. It lets you absorb the world of the film, its nature, and its surroundings.I've not always been sold on Andrew Garfield as a serious actor and I was scratching my head at him being the lead in this film. I'll have to say I have no complaints here. Once you get used to the accents you basically see him at his best performance yet. His character has to show a bit of range as the film progresses, and I thought he did it well. Garfield's Sebastião Rodrigues goes from cautiously optimistic to having a serious crisis of faith . A lot of the film is told from the perspective of his inner monologue which goes hand in hand to his state of mind as events transpire. I liked Adam Driver in this as well. The film could have used more of him.Now to get to my criticisms. Perhaps I got the wrong impression from the subject matter and the trailer but I was expecting more action/violence. This is definitely not that kind of film. Which is fine, however there are times where the film could have used more violence to build fear. What happens to Garfield and his Christian faithful is a scary thing (in a scary land) but sometimes there seems to be no urgency. I had problems with the pacing. This was not a film that flew by. At its near three hour length, you will feel the length. The first act is slow, second act picks up but then drops in the final act. The final minutes are fairly predictable and the method of telling the story at this point felt odd.We live in a pretty modern time but I could have seen this film being pretty controversial in an earlier decade (much like Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ). The themes and messages would have driven a fair few into a minor fit. God is silent and remains silent, through your pain. Your unwavering dedication to God; what does it mean? What purpose does it serve? Is it more important than living? This was a passion project for Scorsese , which doesn't always mean its going to be fun at all times for us. I'd say this is a good film but I couldn't help but feel disappointed after expecting something of a masterclass from a fantastic filmmaker. By no means is it a bad film. I think I had problems with the delivery but the subject matter of the film is deep. I don't think its one of Scorsese's best; it wouldn't crack my top 5 of his filmography. If you are a fan of his work, I think you owe it to yourself to see it and form your own opinion about it. Just be prepared to invest your time into it. The film could yet be a grower and be something I love in a few weeks.7.75/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Riveting Adaption from the Award Winning Novel,"The film primarily takes place in 17th century Japan. During that time the country tried to block all foreign cultures/religions as leaders believed their people were being heavily influenced by foreigners. Silence is about two Jesuit priests who decide to go to Japan to rescue their mentor, who was captured and tortured for practicing Christianity.Having read the novel, I thought this was a well done adaption that captured most of the themes the book was trying to tell. Scorsese was able to show us the brutality people went though for believing in something other than what the state wanted as well as the courage and strength of the citizens and priests. The only real thing that I thought should have been included in this almost three hour movie was some scenes of Japan's religion/culture. The movie focused a little heavy on the Christian side and how it was not welcome. I would have appreciated seeing a couple of scenes featuring Buddhist or Shinto beliefs, so the audience could see the differences and similarities between the two.The costumes and scenes are just visually beautiful. At least this part was recognized by the academy as it is well deserved. Garfield was tremendous as Rodrigues. He was able to convey the emotions necessary to enhance their impact. Driver's scenes were a little hit or miss as some of his lines would take me out of the moment. Neeson always seems to give a solid performance and this one was no different. Other notable performances that left a lasting impression had to be Issei Ogata as Inoue. As I watched his character reminded me of Col. Hans Landa from Inglorious Bastards as he was in full control of every scene he had a part. He just had that way about him that draws you.Well if you couldn't have guessed from my previous statements this movie's story is heavily focused on religion so if those type of movies make you uncomfortable then this is probably not the movie for you. If not then this is a wonderful story that shouldn't be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful and exhausting,"Martin Scorsese's latest film can be included in his most personal works, in his impenitent quest for the truth of faith, the purest and universal religious belief, through the tortuous and biblical path followed by his main protagonist, Father Rodrigues (played by a magnificent Andrew Garfield). The story of two Portuguese Jesuits who travel to Japan in the seventeenth century in search of their mentor, is narrated brilliantly by Mr. Scorsese, although his style is closer to the leisurely pace of ""The Age of Innocence"" than to the nervous rhythm characteristic of his main filmography. However, this does not imply the loss of a palpable tension from the first moments of the film when the character played by Ciarán Hinds warns the two young Jesuits of what they are going to suffer and suffer in their search for the father Ferreira. We can not fail to mention the proximity of this story to the religious concerns that were manifested in another very important work of Scorsese, ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" And in the infinite and unbearable search for religious faith, the human being ends up being, in the last analysis, a common human, with the doubts and weaknesses that we have along the way towards the clarity of the most mundane things. This is one of the best works done by Martin Scorsese, and almost without hesitation, we are in front of his more personal journey towards the hells of humanity. The best: the set of actors (particularly Andrew Garfield and Issey Ogata), and the monumental photography by Rodrigo Prieto. The worst: the film can be interpreted as a lesson in Christianity when it tries to show us the reaction of humanity within a religious context.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Education on Religious Order,"Silence is a Martin Scorsese film about two 17th century Portuguese priests played by Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield who travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor played by Liam Neeson. This was a difficult movie to watch to see how humans react and treat one another all because of religion. Japan is land based on tradition and it's crazy to think how you can't change a person's faith.

A Divisive Work Of Art That Viewers Will Either Embrace Wholeheartedly Or Reject Outright,"I'd like to begin with a confession. The only Martin Scorsese films that I'm actually fond of are the ones starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role. A lot of his earlier works, especially the ones with Robert De Niro, are due for a rewatch but I vividly remember not liking any of them. His turn of the century flicks, however, have fared better on my radar but his latest isn't one of them.An ambitious & personal project that has been a long time coming, Silence finally makes its long overdue transition to the film canvas after being stuck in development hell for over 25 years and is a silent contemplation of faith & ideology that's skilfully layered with religious themes and crafted with perseverance, but the end result is still something that's overlong, tedious & frustrating to sit through.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Silence is set in 17th century Japan and follows two Jesuit priests who set out to locate their missing mentor after learning that he renounced his religion following prolonged torture. Setting foot in the nation where Christianity itself is outlawed, they find refuge in the local Christian population but face their ultimate test when they attempt to propagate Catholicism.Co-written & directed by Martin Scorsese, Silence is a historical piece that's beautifully shot from start to finish but is going to be an excruciating experience if you are not intrigued by its premise. Scorsese's direction bears all his trademarks, each sequence is shot with an auteur's eye, and the attention to detail in every segment plus the multitudes of themes beneath the surface only assist in enhancing its imagery.Production design team brings 17th century Japan to life in splendid detail and the exotic locations add a serene quality to it. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera, colour palette, lighting & angles to turn each frame into a gorgeous artwork and the static but fluid movements only help in making the whole journey all the more immersive while Music stays in the background & silently complements the narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson & Tadanobu Asano, and all of them chip in with well-measured inputs. Garfield plays the Jesuit priest whose journey & struggle this tale is all about and although sloppy at first, his work does get better as the plot progresses. Driver does well with what he's given, Neeson dominates his moments with ease while Asano amazes the most.With a runtime of 161 minutes, Silence is no easy sit and the glacial pace at which its events unfold makes it all the more challenging but for those who can patiently connect with it, the film may turn out to be a spiritually fulfilling experience. While there are moments of pure brilliance that surface every now n then, the vast amount of nothingness in between turns the whole journey into one hell of a bore. Illuminating for some & infuriating for others, Martin Scorsese's passion project is one of those divisive works of art that audience will either embrace wholeheartedly or reject outright.",,Anonymous,History
In Silence you will see the answer,"If you are wanting to go and watch a movie with twists and climaxes, some intense suspense thriller scenes or amazing soundtrack...then this is not the movie you wanna watch. This movie is less about itself and more about the basic concept it revolves around...how strong is your faith? I believe the story line was linear yet satisfying in the end. I must say, the ending and the lesson we learn from it, is definitely satisfying. Direction overall is good. I wouldn't say spectacular but its definitely worth appreciation. I thought initially the movie was taking shortcuts to get to the main story line of the priests chasing their mentor. but then it stabilizes itself and moves on at a decent pace. Andrew Garfield did a really good job in acting. Overall! I would give it an 8. I would recommend it to everyone to at least watch it once.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful and not that much Silent,"I'm not a fan of Martin Scorsese, The movie is one of best output from him. Worth watching the movie but, there are some glitches. Those minor cons won't affect the Movie content. After watching the movie I feel like something I lost; I think the director succeeded to make this kind of feeling.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great film that runs too long,"Silence is amazing. Martin Scorsese has proved to be the most consistent filmmaker of all time with a great body of work for each decade he's made movies. Here he continues to be as versatile and impressive as ever. Just by looking at the past two movies he has made, Silence and The Wolf of Wall Street, you can see this man has no bounds. He's probably the only filmmaker who's quality hasn't gone down over time, and this film proves it.Although this movie is great, its not perfect. Now, this might seem to contradict everything I just wrote, but you will feel the pain all the Christians in this movie felt by siting through it. By that I mean, you'll need some serious stamina to get through the movie, it's extremely long and at times can be very boring. Its almost like Scorsese was trying to torture us so we can relate to the people on screen. Some parts feel a little repetitive too, especially after the two leads split up. The beginning drags on a little too much and so does the end. The movie didn't seem to know when to end, after the protagonist makes his final-ish decision in the movie, the movie should have been over just a bit after, but instead it kept going. I also feel people who aren't a part of a faith or really familiar with it might not enjoy some of the religious rituals depicted early on, honestly I'm religious and found a lot of those parts boring. I also didn't like that we had a disembodied God voice or the ending ""reveal"", its just a tool to spoon feed the message to the audience and completely unnecessary, taking us away from reality and taking away from Rodregues' struggle. The ending ""reveal"" was especially pointless telling us something we didn't need to be told and would have been better if the film let us doubt a bit.Despite the not-so-goodness I just talked about, this movie stuck with me in a good way. This is one of the few movies where as I thought about it more after watching it, I liked it more rather than less. It's just so rich in meaning, everything about it, the decisions each character makes, from the villagers, the three priests, and the villains of the story. Looking at the Christian villagers and the three priests, everyone makes an important decision that is perfectly fleshed out. the motives and consequences of their actions are thought provoking, but I don't want to spoil anything so I'll move on. This is also one of those movies where the title is a beautiful representation of the film. The idea of silence being both the struggle and answer to those of faith is done perfectly (and kind of ruined when they give God a few lines, but I guess I'll let that slide). Looking away from the message and at the film itself, there are some scenes in this movie that are extremely tense that kept me hooked, of course there are also some less tense dragged out scenes, but when stuff happens and the plot moves it gets interesting and its too well done to ignore.The entire cast in this movie is great. Liam Neeson isn't in much of this film, but when he is the subtlety of his performance is outstanding. Specifically, his interaction with Andrew Garfield are well done, the awkwardness and genuineness of it is great. Andrew Garfield once again takes the role of a religious man who has his faith tested, pride pushed, and is hunted by the Japanese in Japan. In all honesty, The characters and the films are very different, but this and Hacksaw Ridge are two home runs for Andrew Garfield as he is excellent in both roles, probably more so in this one because of the lack of his creepy smile. Adam Driver, Tadanobu Asano, Yôsuke Kubozuka and the rest of the supporting cast were also excellent and I would have liked to see more of Adam Driver in this because his character didn't have that much of an arch.Overall loved it, it might be too long and religious for some, but I think you should be able to look past that and really see the deep meaning and excellent filmmaking at work.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wish the director didn't fumble the pacing / editing,"Darn. Just darn! I wish with a vengeance the director did a better job editing and pacing this because almost everything else about this film is sooooo good. I would not recommend seeing this in theaters because you need the freedom of pausing the film and walking away from it for a few hours because it is extremely boring, especially during the first 60 minutes. However the acting is outstanding with all parties involved. The scenes are shot with the eye of a film master. The scenes are visceral and realistic. The film is a blend of heartbreaking and inspirational. Which is why this should have been edited better. And etc. This is such a good story, I just wish I could recommend it without telling people it is boring.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A film of passion, faith and betrayal","A long awaited passion project of Martin Scorsese's, SILENCE is a film that stays truthful to its title. One of the most immediately recognisable traits of the film is its complete lack of score. Silence is not elevated by themes and motifs, by recurring orchestral identities for the major developments of the film's soul, instead it is surrounded by the noise of birds, wind, waves and language. Silence moves at a moderate pace as it tracks the trials and tribulations its characters face as they enter Japan searching for their missing teacher, hoping to disprove the rumours of his alleged relinquishing of his Catholicism.Both Garfield and Driver do well in their roles. Garfield's Rodriguez is the centre of the film. But he and Driver's Garrpe play in an interesting way: Garrpe appears almost as a more refined, superior version of Rodriguez; he is more faithful to his convictions, less lenient with dismissals of the faith - and he does not trust the drunk Kitchijiro so easily. An important disagreement foreshadows their fates.Kitchijiro serves as the Judas-like character, possibly a reflection of Rodriguez's own hubris. He is a weak man, desperate and willing to toss away his religious convictions in favour of survival. An illuminating moment between him and the protagonist asks questions of the 'faithful servant of God' - in a simpler time, of much lesser sacrifices, Kitchijiro would have made a much more faithful Christian.Silence's screen time is focuses greatly on difficult and powerful scenes of torture - often psychological it focuses on the breaking of spirits rather than gory excess. The Japanese seek to rid their country of the catholic faith - the High Inquisitor describes it as having no place to grow in Japan. Is Japan inhospitable of its own nature and culture, or have these powerful patriarchs poisoned the soil to stop its growth?Silence, stylistically, has many classic Scorsese elements, yet sees the film-maker more restrained than usual. Silence is a quieter film. Yet he shows off his remarkable technical ability in crane shots, tracking shots, powerful uses of fog and mist and darkness; and even extended point-of-view shots capturing the action. The period detail is beautiful and Silence has many striking images - some may, in a way, remind the viewer of Akira Kurosawa, though Scorsese always retains his distinctive mark. Silence may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is an impressive, moving, gripping and stimulating one. A worthy addition to his filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Silence is a near masterpiece.,"The latest film from acclaimed director Martin Scorsese comes in polar contrast to his last film, 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Where that film is all about indulging in excess and living a very in the world life 'Silence' is literally the complete opposite. It's a film that is all about human nature, acceptance, and all that that implies. There's no nudity, no language, and hardly any violence. It's a film that relies on you as an audience member to be invested rather than trying to force you into it. However, the problem a lot of people are going to have with this film is the run time. This film runs just under three hours. Which, compared to the endless ninety-minute features we are getting, can be quite a daunting task to take on.It's not the ""epic"" it's being acclaimed as, but it certainly is an experience. Or maybe even a journey yet, this film almost goes out of its way to not be an epic. It spans countries and eras but it manages to feel small and personal. This is why 'Silence' is a film that will go down in history as a landmark in contemporary cinema. If any film will be studied in film school for decades to come, it will be this.Much like 'The Revenant' the star of this film is the director. The direction here is incredibly precise without being show-offy. There's hardly any shot that felt out of place or over stylized. Which is why Scorsese is definitely the star of the film. It's so breathtakingly beautiful but it's never false or phony. With any other director at the helm, this film would've turned out over stylized or too fake for the content.It's not only beautiful to look at but it's themes and messages are equally beautiful. I realize that a film that's mostly about religion might turn off a lot of people but it does so much more than being just a religious film. It advertises itself as an emotional, spiritual experience, but it's more about human nature.It asks questions about humans and why we are the way we are. And it couldn't have come at a better time. Not only is this about human nature but it also brings in themes of acceptance and cultural barriers. In a time where humanity is rather divided, 'Silence' takes these questions head on. And as the credits roll, I sat in a stupor of thought that lasted until the pre-credits for the next show started up.While we are on the subject of positives, I want to talk a little bit about the characters/performances. Both of which are great. Every single actor in this film (right down to the extras) is absolutely incredible. Andrew Garfield is our main character and he gives a performance like I never knew he could. His efforts in 'Hacksaw Ridge' were admirable but here he actually has substance to work with and boy does he pull it off.As you go through this journey with him you can clearly see what this character is going through just by his physical acting. He is able to show an incredible range and versatility that I have never seen from him. Obviously, his other star roles were mostly in the 'Spider-man' films where he literally had nothing to work with. Which is why his performance in this film is all the more impressive.While I could gush over this film for hours on end I did find two chips in the armor of 'Silence'. One being the pacing/run time. While don't really have a problem with the run time, the pacing could've been a bit tighter in a few places. There were two or three scenes where I was on the verge of getting bored. It never quite happened but, in these scenes, the long run time can be felt. Flaw two would be a bit of pandering. There were a couple instances where the film blatantly spells out some of the film's undertones.This is a very mature, slow-moving film with a lot of moving parts and having it direct us in a certain way of thinking felt off here. Saying, ""You should be thinking about this right now."" is never a good way to go and especially not in a mature film that requires your attention. That being said, I absolutely loved 'Silence'. It's the third film I have seen in 2017 and so far it's the best. And it will stay that way for the majority of the year I think. If you're willing to give this film your time and fully invest in it, it will blow you away. Seek it out if you love movies or if want to see something completely original and impactful.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Grade Movie No Doubt,"Silence is a good movie that avoids the bombastic power that often, happily, comes along with a Scorsese movie. That results in a more even film.Scorsese delivers a fantastic visual environment that makes you really feel onside with the characters both main and support. You engage with their beliefs and the troubles they are enduring because of it.The acting is exceptional excluding Neeson and this may be more of a misscasting than anything else. Neeson sticks out like two things dangling from underneath a dog!It is a long movie (Mr Scorcese, sometimes a good game is a fast game!) but it only drags sometimes leaving you pretty entertained :)",7.0,Anonymous,History
Blasphemy,"Forgive Scorcese, Father, for he has sinned. While in general I think him to be quite overrated, I could only classify his previous movies that I've watched as at least ""good"". Well, there's an exception to every rule.I honestly am at a loss for words, there is almost nothing to like in this movie. The whole plot can be described as ""Japanese officials demand Garfield to denounce his religion, he refuses, common folk gets tortured"", repeated a good dozen times. The protagonists are unlikable and hard to relate oneself to. (This could be intentional.) The dialogues, which comprise the bigger part of Silence, are boring and at times pretentious. (Yeah, the tree metaphors aren't nearly as smart as they try to sound.) The religious debates are shallow and bland. What's worse, some moments are outright cheesy, like Garfield's reflection morphing into the face of Jesus or God actually talking to him. The movie just fails miserably to get the audience interested and emotionally invested.The only reasons this is not a 1/10 are the quite good cinematography and Andrew Garfield. He, now unshackled from the mediocre Spider-Man reboots, has shown for the second time in a row this year that he is a very potent actor. Still, he alone could not save this movie.You know, the audience's experience kind of reflects the protagonist's journey. First you come to the cinema, expecting a good film on a largely unexplored topic. Then you get tortured for two and a half hours until you lose faith in Scorcese completely.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Speechless...,"What can I say about Martin Scorsese that hasn't already been said. He is an astounding director who's explored many different genres of film but Silence unveiled a side of Scorsese which I haven't seen.Silence tells the story of two Portuguese priests who travel to Japan in search of their mentor, who has been said to have apostatised the Christian faith, as well as spread Christianity to the residents of Japan.This film conveyed to me the diversity of Scorsese's skills as a director. A lot of his previous films arefast paced and made to entertain the audience. Silence separates itself from that body of work due to its much slower pacing and intense atmosphere which general audience won't enjoy. It's inevitable for some people to feel bored throughout. This is a movie that isn't made for a high box office collection but rather to respect cinema as an art form.Silence is a journey. An emotionally intense journey that studies humanity and religion as a whole. We see our main character Rodrigues, played by Andrew Garfield, go through a huge amount of turmoil as he becomes a man who believed in his faith as strongly as possible to someone who's completely broken and torn about his beliefs. This is possibly Scorsese's best looking film. The lighting, camerawork is absolutely sublime. Rodrigo Prieto did the cinematography for this film as well Scorsese's other films like The Wolf of Wall Street. He did an unbelievable job here. The writing by Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese is brilliant and captures the 17th Century time period really well.Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are superb here. Whilst Driver isn't as prominent in this film as Garfield, he still makes a huge impression overall. Words cannot describe how good Garfield is here. After seeing him in The Social Network and Under the Silver Lake, this adds to his collection of brilliant performances. Liam Neeson isn't in the film much but he's still good for the time he's on-screen. The Japanese cast are all spectacular and bring a great amount of authenticity overall.Silence is another example of Scorsese's talent. This is an emotionally draining film filled with many scenes that can be difficult to watch. I do wish the pacing was better during the first act as it wasn't as engaging compared to the other two acts but Silence overall is an encapsulating experience that will you speechless.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not quite the Last Temptation,"For anyone that doesn't know, Silence looks at the struggle of Christian missionaries in 17th Century Japan and the actions of Japanese officialdom to root out the foreign religion. The film is seen primarily through the eyes of Rodriguez (everybody's favorite Catholic Andrew Garfield), who undergoes repeated crises of faith when he is asked to renounce his God with the threat of having his followers tortured.
It's a story with a lot of potential and to be sure there are several interesting moments (especially when the characters discuss the relevance of Christianity in Japanese culture) and some terrific shoreline imagery, but I didn't feel as successfully involved with it. While it may be historically true I felt the Japanese officials were came across as caricature villains - it didn't help that Issey Ogata as the Inoue (governor?) sounded like a cross between Kenneth Williams of the Carry On series and Yoda. Also, Rodriguez's visions and messages from Jesus were very on-the-nose and cheapened the experience for me.
So I think I'll stick with Last Temptation of Christ, so far as Marty's religious filmography goes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"This is Scorsese's new Kundun. There are people who will enjoy this, but this is defiantly not a movie for everyone.","""We will not abandon our hidden Christians who live in fear."" Rodrigues (Garfield) is a Jesuit priest who, along with his fellow priest has just received word that their mentor Ferreira (Neeson) has traveled to Japan and committed apostasy. The two travel to the country to not only find their friend but also to support and spread Catholicism. What they find is torture and abuse and a land that will test their faith in ways they could have never imagined. When I saw this movie was coming to Blu-Ray my first thought was, how did a Scorsese movie come and go without me hearing about it? After watching it I can see why. I'm not saying this is a bad movie at all but its just agonizingly slow in many parts and just a little too long. Length of a movie doesn't usually bother me because my two favorite movies are The Godfather (almost 3 hours) and JFK (directors cut is over 4) but this one felt longer than the 2 hours and 40 minute run time. The story is very good, the acting is great and the movie is beautiful and very well made, but it was one I really struggled to get into. This is Scorsese's new Kundun.

Scorsese's most personal film to date,"At the age of 74 and with 50-odd years in the business, Martin Scorsese shows no sign of letting up, whether it be in terms of quantity or quality. His movies are still routinely up for all the big awards, and his name alone is enough to sell a picture (although the presence of Leonardo Di Caprio in recent years will surely have had a hand in that). His last feature, The Wolf of Wall Street, saw the director at his most free-spirited, spinning a tale of white- collar crime that was both incredibly funny and outrageously over- the-top. It now feels like Scorsese may have been flushing some pent-up energy out of his system before he finally tackled a passion project 25 years in the making: his long talked-about adaptation of Shusaku Endo's novel Silence.In 17th-century Japan, Christians are being forced to renounce their beliefs in the face of horrific torture, as a samurai referred to as 'the inquisitor' prowls small villages hoping to snuff out anyone hiding religious idols with the image of Christ or the cross. In Macau, Jesuit priests Sebastiao Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) learn that their former tutor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who had travelled to Japan to spread the word of God, has apostatised and integrated himself into Japanese society. Believing the rumour to be nothing but propaganda, the two priests travel to Japan with the help of drunken sailor Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka), who has witnessed first hand the brutal acts of the inquisitor. Upon arriving in Nagasaki, Rodrugues and Garupe find poor communities going to desperate lengths to worship in secret as eyes and ears lurk everywhere.Scorsese has spoken often about his Catholicism, and has made it the subject of many of his best works. The most obvious being The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), but you can trace themes of Catholic guilt way back to Mean Streets (1973). A few of the characters in Silence struggle with the absence of God, and Rodrigues in particular struggles to comprehend a God who would sit back as thousands are tortured and murdered because of their faith. Scorsese explores this theme in a slow, considered manner, and it's clear that this may be the most personal film he's ever made. At almost 3 hours, the scope and vision of the story are a perfect fit for Scorsese's eye for classical film-making. There are plenty of beautifully framed shots, capturing both the beauty of the landscape and the brutality dwelling within. With a cast full of Japanese faces unfamiliar to Western audiences and a narrative happy to dwell on contemplative conversations, it's no wonder that this is one of the film-maker's lowest-grossing movies in years, but there is plenty to savour here from a purely cinematic perspective.When I first heard about the film, I wondered why Scorsese hadn't opted for Driver, who is clearly the stronger screen presence of the two leading actors, in the central role. But, combined with his Oscar-nominated performance in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge earlier this year, Garfield has cemented himself as a compelling leading man, and has finally rid himself of Sony's Amazing Spider-Man stigma. Driver has surprisingly limited screen-time, but he commands the screen whenever he's on it. The same can be said for Neeson, who leaves an impact in what adds up to only a handful of scenes. The film belongs to Garfield, whose boyish good-looks make his inner turmoil all the more gut-wrenching, as he watches folk put to death by high-tide crucifixion or burned at the stake, after they refuse to take part in a symbolic denouncement of faith by stepping on a slab with the image of Jesus. It received only a solitary Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, but it seems Scorsese made this for himself, and the most personal visions can speak the loudest of words.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"I sided with the ""antagonists""","The entire idea of going to another society to spread your brainwashing gibberish and then be surprised and shocked that you're met with ridicule and punishment is absolutely crazy to me, and not only that, the dumber idea that so many of them would rather get tortured and killed then denounce their fate publicly, and what's even dumber and dumber is IT IS A SIN TO EVEN PRETEND TO DENOUNCE YOUR CHRISTIANITY EVEN WHEN FACED WITH DEATH, that is by far one of the dumbest things I've heard about a cult, sorry I mean religion.And btw the Japanese aren't evil like for example in other Muslim countries where they would literally burn you alive for the slightest doubt of blasphemy or being of a different religion (there are many examples and stories), at least the Japanese at least gave them a chance to denounce their braindead idealogy by spitting or stomping on a cross or a on picture of Jesus and then if they do they set them free, and the moronic brainwashed monkeys still won't do it lol.This movie might make some Christians more empowered to be Christians, but for me I find it a huge example of why religions are a disease to the human race, where humans reach a point of such low intelligence that they would rather get tortured or killed than denounce their literal gibberish made up silly religion.All religions are literally just cults with brainwashed people that waste their current lives just for the belief that there will be eternal heaven for them and if they don't it's hell forever, it's the oldest and most primitive and childish idea ever and yet billions of people are religious today.There is a line by the Christian priest character where he says ""it's the universal truth"" and he says it with tears and seriousness and I laughed out loud when I heard and at the same time got angry that none of them told him ""it's the universal truth according to you, that religion also believe it's the universal truth, and that one believes it too, and in every religion and ideology, they all believe their faith is the objective truth be everyone else is wrong, how can you be so obtuse be arrogant?""A lot of times I was just laughing at the braindead people who were crying or screaming when someone gets killed, like it didn't happen because you DID NOT WANT TO STOMP ON A DRAWING OF JESUS WITH YOUR FOOT WHEN YOUR LIFE IS THREATENED. It's just so stupid I just can't with these people. The only intelligent Christian in the movie is that guy who kept doing it whenever they told him to.--
Japanese Person: I kill you if you don't stomp footJapanese Christian Person: NoJapanese Person: Kills Japanese Christian PersonJapanese Christian Person: Shocked and sad.--This is my take on the movie, it's fantastic and I enjoyed it, acting is top notch and the directing is great even though some shots are unnecessarily long and should've been edited better but overall really well made movie. I just couldn't sympathize with the supposed ""protagonists"" of the film the Christians, and I was actually rooting for the Japanese that imprisoned and killed them, so I don't really know what Martin Scorsese was trying to make or if his message is pro religion, but yeah that's about it. 8/10P. S. The same people that felt like the Japanese were oppressive and evil and felt like punishing the Christians is wrong are the same people who say ""You can't just wear an LGBTQ flag in the middle east or a Muslim country, respect their society and beliefs, and you have to live by the country's rules"" or even today ""respect the Japanese culture and take your shoe off when you go into a place"" or other hypocritical stuff by a bunch of hypocrites lol.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Martin Scorsese's brilliant religious polemic.  Is religion good for the human race?  You'll need to see it to decide.  Vital for our times.,"To follow up The Wolf of Wall Street with this movie demonstrates that no director has the sheer vision and chutzpah of Martin Scorsese. We are talking chalk and cheese in extremis here. Not even P.T. Anderson or Alejandro Iñárritu can match his range.As each movie goes by he lays greater and greater claims to be the greatest movie director of all time.But Silence will not be, by any means, top of the popularity list.Because this is film making borne of extreme passion (clearly the source novel connected with him).This is a cinematic therapy session, a philosophical 15 rounder and languid, art-house fare that few will love.It's a beast of a movie, weighing in at 2 hours and 41 minutes. There is no action. No soundtrack (music) to speak of. No sex. In fact hardly any women.And it's about the tension of religious powerbroking in 17th century Japan.For many reviewers I've read (and my wife's view) it's just plain boring. And I can understand, but don't agree with, where they are coming from. It is incredibly slow.Scorsese's lifelong editor, the mighty Thelma Schoonmacker, has either been over-ruled in many places or is complicit in its sheer lack of pace.Certainly it could be cut in places where some repetition is evident and probably unnecessary. That said, its pace is its schtick.The central premise about religion being the root of all the shoot the world had to deal with then, and has to deal with now, is highly topical and that's what makes it an essential movie of our times.It even-handedly plays out the battle between Buddhism and Khiristianity (sic) and leaves the viewer to decide if religion is the root of all evil or that some religions have more merit than others. Given Scorsese's Catholic upbringing this is an impressive feat. I know not whether he remains a believer or an abstainer, but either way this could have made for an overplayed hand either for or against Christianity. The fact that the movie is neither is to his huge credit and gives it it's real moral backbone.It's roundly well performed, the cinematography has a lot of merit and the overall production values are excellent.But this is not entertainment as such; this is a slog. A reason to appreciate cinema. It's notable that StudioCanal is behind it. Surely the greatest contributor in recent times to art-house cinema.There are no laughs in this. None AT ALL.

Harrowing and complex religious epic brands a superb cinematic work by Martin Scorcese,"""Sometimes silence is the deadliest sound"" marks the uncompromising tagline of this religious epic directed by the hands of Hollywood mogul Martin Scorcese. This film is perceived as Scorcese's passion project, a cinematic translation of the acclaimed novel by Shusako Endo, which he's tried almost three decades trying to lift off the ground before finally landing it just in time for Oscar season. The historical epic paints a harrowing of the journey following Catholic priests venturing into a foreign country where spirituality comes at a great cost and religious rights are stripped away by the hands of tyrant individuals who spit in the face of religion. What Scorcese's long, complex testament comes down to is a harrowing and realistic tale that feels largely relevant to today's era, particularly when you examine the ongoing cultural conflicts erupting around the world as shown in the media. For many people, it hits awfully close to home. Set in the 17th century, this film follows Portuguese Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (played by Adam Driver) who are informed by Father Alessandro Valignano (played by Ciaran Hinds) of the news of Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) captured in Japan and denouncing his faith in a public. Out of curiosity to this rumor, Rodrigues and Garupe travel to Japan where they witness mass persecution against Christians at the hands of Inoue Masashige (played by Issey Ogata). In an efforts to locate Father Ferreira and propagate Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are placed in a harrowing battle of wills against the Japanese tyrant that will place their faith to a test.Although this doesn't mark Martin Scorcese's first time tackling on the topic of religion as his first adventure in this subject was 'The Last Temptation of Christ', this film does not draw a biblical portrait of the days of Jesus. Instead, it explores a powerful testament on how Christian missionaries have experienced challenges where their spirituality is battered and used as a weapon against them by nihilists who view religion as a philosophical hoax. And with an inspiring screenplay by co-written by Jay Cooks, stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (who's collaborated with Martin Scorcese for a second time following 'The Wolf of Wall Street') to capture the overwhelming atmosphere, and an overall enchanting direction; Scorcese paints an emotionally (and visually) arresting picture on two Catholic's priests' journey to spread of God while fighting against the mass persecution in a world where religion is outlawed and flushed from society. The story is very gut-wrenching and very complex, but also very slow. The plot moves in a leisurely pace that is enough to drive impatient viewers into utter boredom. But those who sustain their wills of sitting through the sluggish narrative are offered into a captivating story of pain, loss, hope, and redemption; and Martin Scorcese rarely pulls any punches when igniting the story is life. It is a depressing journey, but unfortunately it is still true to this day.Since his debut in the cinematic spotlight, Martin Scorcese never an immersive cast of widely acclaimed actors for granted. Stepping into the lead role of Father Rodrigues is Andrew Garfield. With his 'Spiderman' two years in the rearview mirror, Garfield has taken the advantage of the opportunities to explore more grounded roles outside the superhero genre as well as his acclaimed role in 'The Social Network'. Garfield plays the role of a determined Catholic priest who's forced to face the brooding reality of Japan in a society where Christianity is a contraband philosophical being. By the hands of a brutal Japanese authority officer, Rodrigues is trapped into a tense, psychological battle that challenges his spirituality and pits him with a tough decision between standing up for his beliefs and witnessing poor civilian followers being slaughtered, or shout against his faith to save their lives as well as his own. Similarly in Mel Gibson 'Hacksaw Ridge' in which he played another religiously-defined character, Garfield delivers a solid portrayal of this role. Although he evokes occasional hiccups in his Portuguese accent, it is difficult to deny the powerful gravitas he pours into the role. Adam Driver is also very stringent in his role as Rodrigues's accomplice as his Liam Neeson has the emotionally broken Father Ferreira who shares much less than a handful of screen time throughout the near three-hour run. Japanese actor Issey Ogata successfully unleashes a frightening, if somewhat humane portrayal as Inoue Masashige, the cruel mastermind behind the savagery against the Christian community.Silence is a harrowing and complex religious epic that marks an enthralling piece of cinematic work by Martin Scorcese in a departure from his typical violent mobster crime genre. Needless to say, this is not a film that is likely to convince those who are non-believers to convert to Christianity (or at least that is not Martin Scorcese is aiming for), it is a captivating picture that marks a good recommendation for both sides of the religious compass. In conclusion, it stands high as one of the best films of 2016.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Dark,dreary,boring,slow,did i say dreary?","I started watching this move having been intrigued by the story and spent a long time trying to cope with the boredom. And the fact that I'd seen interviews, read interviews with Mr Scorcese talking about the fact that he spent 20 (!) years in the making of this movie. Well, Mr Scorcese... As boring as it eventually was, maybe you shouldn't have made it. I've seen better movies by your ideas and direction but gosh this is just beyond boring. And the fact that you had rave reviews over this movie makes me wonder... Are the reviews great because you Scorcese or what?

A flawless film,"I generally don't like to accuse people who don't like a well received movie of ""not getting it."" But after reading several negative user reviews, I'm convinced people did not get Silence.Silence is not telling you the priests are doing the right thing. It is not telling you that Japan is evil. It is not telling people to convert to Christianity. It is merely portraying historical fictitious events as they happen and it does so masterfully.Silence portrays a priest struggling with whether he should apostatize (renounce his faith) and save other's lives, or to let them die, appearing selfish, for what he believes is right. Now you may think that one side is right but Scorsese presents both sides showing that it is a gray area. It is less about religion and more about the cost of your beliefs making it more powerful than most movies.People complain about the run time. Those people were watching it, not experiencing it. The run time is long, but it is for a reason. Many similar scenes seem to repeat, however in between each the movie introduces a new idea so when you see it again it inflicts a different mood and different opinion. Taking a viewer and putting them in the story and experience the events is true storytelling. If you check your phone, you are only gipping yourself of a great experience.In addition to what's been already said, it's important to point out that the slew of reviewers claiming ""this is NOT good film making or good basic storytelling"" are completely ignorant to film. You can say you don't like it but ignoring the fact that this has an amazing score, some of the most beautiful camera work and cinematography, Garfield's amazing method acting and at least presenting beliefs in an objective matter.Silence is a flawless movie.

No, it's not, when most of us wouldn't even know how to recognize it. It takes artists (only referring to those in cinema here) like Chaplin, Allen, Kubrick, and others, and now, Scorsese, to give us a glimpse of the truth. Many of us are scared of the truth.

Too Long to tell the story,"I have zero problem with a movie that is long if it has a lot to say to tell the story. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minute, as most of Scorsese movies are long I have never had an issue with any of them in fact as in the Godfather series I wanted them to be longer, each scene had something different to contribute to the plot and progressed perfectly to the end. Intro,char development, climax, closing. In Silence it was Intro,char development, then about 40 minutes of more char development that was repetitive to the point you loose interest and become desensitized. Then it finally hits climax and the close is about 5 minutes too long.So in the opinion of this avid movie goer of all types of movies, I gave this movie a 6 and more then likely would have been a 7 maybe 8 had the editor done his job and cut about 45 minutes from the film.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Silence:  how catholic colonialism failed or how japan protected its culture,"I am a huge Scorsese fan and while not every film he has made is a favorite of mine, my most favorited movies are directed by him. He is a brilliant director and not much more needs to be said about that.This film caught my eye for two reasons: Scorsese and Japan. And it delivers in the sense of showing the beauty of Japan, the culture in the 17th century and ample emotionally intense scenes and unforgettable images. Japan is lush and green as I remember it. The sound of cicadas takes me back to summer along the Tama River. The film is like being there again in many ways.Unfortunately, the subject matter was not my cup of tea and no matter how much I wanted to engage with the film I just couldn't get past the subject which seems utter madness to me to be told from this perspective of the suffering and crisis of faith of the missionaries. It seemed a rather overblown effort to create parallels with the Christ--as if these missionaries were white Jesus' coming to save Japan. From what exactly I'm not sure as everything suffered by the poor as portrayed in the film is identical to the suffering of peasants in europe at this time.I did enjoy the philosophical debates that ensued between the padre Rodrigues and the elites (esp. inquisitor and converted priest ferreira) who hold him prisoner. Probably the highlight of the film.But these discussions weren't enough to forget the irritating aspects of the film. For example, the narration grates very quickly. Its just a monologue of romanticism for religious fanaticism. I wish the film had heeded its title rather than add this aspect to the film. I think the content, if necessary to the plot, could have been conveyed in another way.So the movie is basically a two hour plus illustration of the utter waste of human life and suffering over the course of history all in the name of religion and fictional tales of yore. Its not a pleasant experience to watch and the questions raised by the film are not ones I personally wish to ponder as I have left that psychological crutch behind long ago.One thing that kept running through my mind during the film: if the Native Americans, who were also facing catholic colonialism during this period of history, had done what the Japanese did when they found western culture polluting their own, they might still have their languages, lands and ways of life.Maybe if you're religious this would be pleasant to watch, but for me it was a long long film that tangled with concepts that were not of much interest to me.One thing I found rather offensive was the dedication at the end of the film to the Japanese Christians. I remember meeting a few Japanese Christians while living in Japan. I found it rather intriguing that the Japanese in general viewed these believers with some level of--suspicion? I am not sure how else to characterize it but clearly their beliefs were not accepted and viewed as strange. Even with witnessing this, I still don't think a dedication like that is appropriate. It is basically characterizing the Japanese Christians as long suffering victims. The fact is, if Japan had not done what it did, it would have lost its culture and been overrun by colonialists like Hong Kong and other Asian cities. It may have been harsh but I think it was a wise choice to keep the European colonialist marauders at the beach head. And the tactics used as shown in this film were brilliant. If there is any doubt about that, just look at what happened to the indigenous peoples around the world who did not or could not make that same choice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Is it better to apostatize if it can save lives, or is it better to become a martyr for one's faith?","The ultimate question in the movie Silence becomes that of the meaning of life: Is life here on earth the most important, or is the ""life"" in heaven/paradise the most important?And the ultimate consequence is then: Is it right to deny one's god (apostatize) if one knows that it can save people from being killed? Or is it right to hold on to one's religion because of the belief that people will enter into paradise even though they will be killed (the belief in martyrdom)?In the movie father Ferreira explains that the Japanese view is that the Church (Christianity) is not desirable as it can never produce anything good (""take root"") in the Japanese society. Ferreira probably means that Christianity produces no life-affirming and strengthening ideology for the life here on earth. Instead the Christian ideology acknowledge death (but Christianity calls it ""life"" in heaven/paradise) and weakness (the Christian concept of sacrifice and self-denial).The Japanese religion (mindset) is more focused on humanity than on divinity according to the film, which means that Christianity's focus on heavenly salvation never works in Japan. In traditional Japanese religion the sun is seen as the god-son that arises every morning to give life to the earth, which makes Christianity's teaching about a god-son who gives his believers life in heaven/paradise incomprehensible.According to father Ferreira, the Japanese Christians have mixed the Christian teachings of God's Son with those of the Japanese religion, and thus do not believe in the same Jesus Christ as Western Christians do. Thus, the ""martyrdom"" of the Japanese Christians becomes unnecessary as they die for a different belief than the ""genuine"" Christianity. Thus, according to Ferreira, it is better to apostatize than to be tormented and killed unnecessarily for a misinterpreted religion.I think that this is the only thing in the movie's theological reasoning that is vague, because how can Ferreira know that all Japanese Christians have misinterpreted the Christian teachings of the god-son? It somehow seems that this is his own excuse to say that the Christian mission in Japan is unnecessary. Or perhaps he says this to justify his own apostasy (and saving his own life). Or perhaps he is right because he has been in Japan for as long as he himself says, and therefore knows what he's talking about.The movie creates a lot of interesting questions about religion and about the meaning of life. The settings are good and the acting is aswell, and if you're interested in history and religion you will like this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

question and answers,"Why is (or was) God silent is a key question for believers. Why was God silent when Christians were prosecuted and died for their religion in the 17th century in Japan? Why was God silent when Jews were prosecuted by the Catholic Inquisition and died for their religion at the very same time? Or when Christians fought and killed each other in the European religious wars in the same century? Or during the Holocaust? Or today when people are prosecuted, fly for their lives and die for their religion in so many parts of the Globe? Is (or was) God silent? Or maybe He did speak and we did not hear Him? Those are the questions asked in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'. Are these questions asked in a generic manner, or just limited to his own faith, and to the specific period he deals with? Are the answers the film gives convincing?The experience may depend on the viewer's close or remote relation to faith. The story of the two Catholic priests who are traveling in AD 1640 in Japan at one of the most cruel periods of persecution of Christians, their encounter with the different culture and religions, their fight to help the devote local Catholics who were continuing to stick to their belief, their own personal fight with the doubts and the apparent silence of the Divinity, their dilemma the ultimate choice that they need to make between saving lives and their own soul, between martyrdom and apostasy - all these may speak a lot to believers in general and Catholics in particular. From that perspective, this is the Via Dolorosa story with a different ending. What if as viewer one does not belong to either of these categories? These viewers are left with a film of exquisite cinematographic beauty but with a slow and unconvincing story telling, quite surprising for a master director as Martin Scorsese is.There is a secondary story here of the relationship between the priest father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and the local fisherman who helps and then betrays the two priests Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka). It's an extension of the Jesus - Judah story, a continuation maybe of the relation between the two described in Scorsese's 1988 'The Last Temptation of Christ', and one more work that deals with the story of Judah, part of a trend of 'rehabilitation' of the character, at least in films and books. I liked this part, and the acting in general (not to forget Liam Neeson who always fills any screen he is on). I liked less the long off-line monologue which becomes quite repetitive at some point, the 'Deus ex machina' off-screen voice that shows up at a key moment, and the odd epilogue that does not add too much to the story, is told in a different style and from a different perspective. Maybe it's just Scorsese's way of making sure that we place the story he is telling in the historical context? Did he really need this?One of my friends wrote after reading the original version of my short review: 'It is an experience more than a movie to watch.' I agree with her. Seeing 'Silence' is like visiting a church. Christians and non-Christians, believers and non-believers, everybody has a different experience, remarks and appreciates different things.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Valiant Effort,"1- Story: The story follows one of two Porchegese priests who travel to Japan in the 1600s to spread their faith, and find a fellow priest who has been taken captive. The priests we follow, in particular the main one played by Andrew Garfield are not at all well developed. Garfield's character is a blind follower of Christianity, who gives his God credit for everything. Meanwhile, his counterpart, played by Adam Driver, is the classic non-believer who struggles but ultimately stays by the rules. When we are asked to follow these two into, we are given no reason why they are interesting or important to follow. The story suffers for this, with the first two-thirds being very interesting as the story is built and the conflict is introduced, but when we are meant to follow Andrew Garfield's character as the true trials begin, it somewhat deflates.Performances: Though they are not given much to work with from a script perspective, both Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield do a fine job with what is provided, no doubt with help from their director, the great Martin Scorsese. The truly interesting acting comes from the Japanese actors, all of whom have such interesting looks and demeanor, not to mention good acting skill, to create this feeling of unease that puts you in our main characters place. The best part of the entire film is Issei Ogata, who delivers such a strange and intimidating performance that it's incredibly engaging. From the moment he comes on screen, you want to know more, and as you learn, you are only more interested.Craft: So, as I said, the script needs a little work. The two main characters have very little back story, and when we are expected to watch them challenge their beliefs, we have no reason to be on their side, we don't really know what their beliefs mean to them. The dialogue is somewhat stiff as well, but this could be because none of the characters in this film would be speaking English. The directing by Martin Scorsese is masterful, maybe some of his best work. He uses the beautiful and somewhat intimidating ambiance of his setting to make the audience as uncomfortable as the priests, and this works to incredible advantage, with high tension and unease throughout.Entertainment Value: As I've said, the first two-thirds of this film are incredible as we learn about the environment we are in. However, once this is done and the story is really set in motion, it is less interesting, with some characters giving you tastes of excitement, and wonderful direction throughout, but it is not a perfect film that entertains all the way through.Memorability: There are certainly elements of this film that are highly memorable. The performance of Issei Ogata, the brilliant directing and some of the visuals are absolutely breathtaking. But this film is nearly three hours long, and after a time, these elements are not enough to live on in tour mind. It is worth seeing, but don't have your hopes too high.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another Scorsese Classic!,"In case not known, Martin Scorsese is one hell of a director & his passion project Silence, is another testament to his brilliance. This 2016 gem whose premise centers on the persecution & agony of Christians due to their beliefs, carries such a gut-wrenching storyline that doesn't shy away from its punishing themes. From the opening act, Scorsese focuses on the burdensome conflict between adhering to one's faith, vs choosing the pragmatic path. He captures the desperation & anguish of those riddled with this struggle in such detail, that their internal crisis is deeply sensualized. The ensuing brutality is both harrowing & serene, as the depth in its motivations are thoroughly exposed. With Scorsese at the helm then, the films religious drama are told vividly & masterfully, resulting to an emotionally staggering viewing that leaves one speechless.The artistry instilled in Silence is as well praise worthy. The tandem of Scorsese & cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto puts forth a thing of beauty, as the shots
are pristine even in confined, low light settings. The sound design on the other hand elevates, as the premise of secrecy in remote locations is well conveyed through the successful mix of hushed yet clear conversations & crisp ambient sounds. On the acting piece, while Andrew Garfield & Liam Neeson were superb, the Japanese characters deserves mention at the very least. Tadanobu Asano (Interpreter) & Issey Ogata (The Inquisitor) were standouts, menacing in their unfazed wheedling. Meanwhile, Shinya Tsukamoto (Mokichi) & Yoshi Oida (Ichizo) epitomizes the devout & conflicted excellently, portraying hardened faith amidst suffering.As for the films issues, the 161-minute runtime is glaring, specially for a film with discomforting & complex themes. It then must be adored to the highest regard, to earn a second viewing as the experience is a tad laborious.Despite this, Silence remains a worthy religious film. Scorsese's devotion to tell this thoughtful & complex story is passionately felt through its perfectly executed storyline pieces. These pieces ask the most difficult questions on faith, weakness & human conditions, while offering little enlightenment. Truly a thought-provoking piece of cinema. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Silence will challenge the audience.,"Silence is a fantastic film. The story follows two priests who travel into Japan in search for mentor who has apparently denounced his faith publicly. This movie's story is hard to watch because our main characters are broken down down so emotionally throughout the movie. What this movie does really well is questioning the audience what it means to question authority and faith. Throughout the movie this is a common theme and it's played out so well. Andrew Garfield plays out his part so well, a performance matching that of Hacksaw Ridge. Yôsuke Kubozuka is also very very good in this movie, playing a person who's been tortured so much and has had so much taken away from him because of his faith. The cinematography is beautiful in this movie as well. Rodrigo Prieto makes every shot beautiful and detailed. He also worked on The Wolf of Wall Street so it seems that Scorsese and Prieto are a good match. My only flaw with this movie is the run time. The movie clocks in at about 2 hours and 45 minutes long, which is very very long for most audiences. It didn't effect me but there were a few people in my theater that walked out at about the 2 hour mark. In the end, Silence is a beautifully directed film with amazing acting, beautiful cinematography, and a story that will stay in your head for days.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Old-school religious epic turned torture porn,"It's hard to rate ""Silence"" because it's one of those movies that has a lot of good going for it, but ultimately loses it's way, and my appreciation of it drops the more I think about it. My original rating was ""8"". ""Silence"" ultimately does not work as Scorsese's flaws get the best of him.This is a movie about Catholicism, perhaps made for Catholics. It shows that this production had it's inception in late 1980s, as it is similar to the ""priests travel to a foreign land and suffer"" epics of the era, from ""The Mission"" to ""Black Robe"", the latter which it most resembles in pace and visual style. Many of the religious practices and references (what is a Jesuit? Why are they talking in Latin?) will be lost on non-Catholic audiences. However, most with some understanding of European history will appreciate that this is the opposite of a Spanish Inquisition movie: the Catholic priests are the ones persecuted and tortured by an Inquisitor who tries to get them to denounce their faith. I grew up very Catholic, and I've come to appreciate different main types of practicing devout Catholics: 1) those who only focus on Jesus suffering for others' sin, the need to repent, the need to suffer, and yelling that everyone else is a sinner; 2) the ritualistic, who are focused on repetitive prayers, rituals, statues, and rosaries (e.g. Marianists); 3) the institutional crowd, who worship the Church itself, with focus on Roman Empire culture and social conservatism as a way of maintaining feudalistic/oligarchic societies (e.g. Opus Dei and Benedict XVI's crowd); 4) those who focus on trying to carry out good deeds, love, build communities, and transcend the material (e.g. Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits). In ""Silence"", Scorsese tries to explore all of these aspects of Catholicism to some degree or another, but seems to settle on mostly the first two.Thus after an intriguing first hour, with great cinematography, and an interesting story of missionaries overcoming their needs and doubts to try to give hope to those who live wretched lives (and how much religion properly translates), and those who risk their life for their faith, we are treated to a visually and aurally unpleasant second hour. This hour is a repetitive depiction of people being tortured and killed, while they either follow their own rituals, or follow a Japanese ritual to renounce their faith. In fact, it mostly consists of a Shogun with an improbably ugly, nasal voice and his associates yelling ""Trample!"" at poor, suffering Japanese peasants, who cry and say ""I don't want to trample!"" to Andrew Garfield's priest, after which we see feet step on a bronze plaque with a religious image, and then see the peasants are whacked half the time anyway, while a priest cringes. At times there's interesting dialogue on theology, cross-cultural misunderstandings, Western vs. Eastern philosophy, the main character's arrogance, symbols vs actions in Christian faith, and facing the consequences of Catholic beliefs (pardoning of sins, going to Heaven, martyrdom) when things go sour. At it's thematically best, ""Silence"" explores it's title by addressing the flip side of the saying ""There's no atheists in foxholes"": what if you are stuck a long time suffering in the foxhole, seeing people die around you, and God doesn't answer your prayers? And here's where Scorsese's flaws as a filmmaker ruin this movie. Scorsese has always been less of an actual story teller, and prefers to show us intertwined experiences of a character, often one who is loyal to an institution or social group, with their fall from grace due to sin (pride, wrath, paranoid distrust, or lust and general hedonism). Scorsese tends to make those falls be extra-long, with repetitive scenes. We often tend to allow it to pass, as those scenes can be entertaining and dynamic, leading to the film eventually wrapping up with some sort of quick glimpse into the character's life to come. But in ""Silence"" the repetitive scenes are unpleasant and torturous, and ultimately become boring. Then what should be a 3-5 minute final scene instead becomes 20-30 minutes long, with a new narrator, and some pointless long shots that make you wonder if Thelma Schoonmaker gave up and walked out of the editing room. What starts as an open-minded glance into Japanese culture turns into an almost villainous depiction of it. And while thematically it goes from carefully exploring Jesuit concepts, from the vows of obedience and poverty, to a heavy exploration of the concept of Casuistry, ultimately there's a missed opportunity to explore the Jesuit concept of contemplation (detachment and ""finding God in all things""), as the movie goes too far in exploring the feeling of spiritual abandonment, with an unconvincing return to spirituality.Although the repetitive scenes are what drags down what sounds like a much better movie, they were not the only flaw. Another distracting factor is the main characters themselves. They are Portuguese priests, but the only one who looks vaguely Lusitanian is Adam Driver. Driver and Garfield start out with varying accents, before eventually giving up altogether. Liam Neeson doesn't even try, and speaks in his Liam Neeson voice, although I'm able to forgive him, as he's come to occupy that spot previously reserved for Sean Connery (""he's playing a Spaniard named Ramirez, but he speaks like Sean Connery. Who cares, he sounds cool!""). I get that this was not the original cast, who could have passed more like Portuguese. However, we have to deal with whom wound up on screen. These Portuguese are stranger as they are speaking in English, as are some of the Japanese.

"An unflinching, truthful, and masterfully done historical epic.","Martin Scorsese's latest historical epic based on the book by the same name is not a film that's for everybody although one would believe it should be upon seeing it. It's difficult to describe Silence without giving too much away and it's hard to explain why this film experience is unique to any other an audience member might see.The story of Silence holds nothing back in portraying the two Jesuit priest's struggles in experiencing the real violence and persecution directed towards Christianity in the country of Japan. They, as well as the viewer embark on a unique and heart-wrenching journey of tested faith and personal identity and one's relationship with deity. This is back dropped by the film's title Silence as the viewer experiences something every human could possibly feel strongly about: God's seeming silence during trials. This films takes you on a special spiritual, emotional, and intellectual quest that the average movie goer is bound to not expect.The film is constructed quite perfectly; something to be expected from a master filmmaker like Scorsese. The editing is constructed perfectly and the movie is shot beautifully. Not just because of the filming location but it's obvious Wolf of Wall Street cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto took delicate and special care to every single shot of this masterpiece.This all being stated, as said before, the film isn't for everyone; especially the every day movie- goer looking for a ""good time at the movies."" This isn't a ""good time"" but rather a slow, thought- provoking journey that will require everything out of those who participate in it. This also isn't a film for those who don't enjoy anything religion (especially related to Christ) seeing as how the entire script is filled with it. That's not to say however, that anyone can't enjoy this film but seeing as how it's such a difficult film to muscle through given the subject matter and gut- wrenching content this film is for those who know they'll appreciate it and are prepared to be challenged in ways they might not be so comfortable with.Overall, this film is incredible and should be seen by anyone who loves cinema and wants to know more about great filmmaking. However, it's not for those who are looking for a ""feel good"" religious movie or an adventure to Japan that'll light you up like Dances with Wolves. Be prepared for a heavy experience that'll challenge and enthrall you to the very end.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Middle of the Road Scorsese is Still Pretty Damn Good,"Silence is probably the most aptly titled movie to come along in a while. The latest from masterclass filmmaker Martin Scorsese is an exercise in restraint. How much can you do with so little? In this case, the movie's lack of sound and the absence of the frenzied urgency that is Scorsese's signature is both an aesthetic and thematic choice. We watch in silence, the film presents itself in silence, and its main characters suffer in silence. Based on the novel of the same name by Shuzaku Endo, this is a passion project that Scorsese has been trying to get off the ground since the late 80's, and while Marty has made a name for himself as a master of the art of excess, here he shows how much he can really do when really subdued.Our story takes place in 17th century Japan a few years after the Shimbara Rebellion, a failed uprising of Christian Japanese peasants that lead to the religion becoming outlawed. Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Father Rodruiges (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) have received word that their mentor (Liam Neeson) has renounced his faith during his last mission and has sided with the Japanese government, so they travel there to find him and find out what really happened to him. When they arrive, they're taken in by a small group of Christian peasants who are escaping persecution and worship God in secret, and in return they give them mass and listen to their confessions. But the inquisitor soon learns of the priests' whereabouts and announce a price on their head, putting the villagers' lives in danger with their mere presence.While Martin Scorsese is known far and wide for making super violent films about gangsters and life in New York, he likes to dabble in period pieces every once in a while (see: The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York and Hugo), and his Catholic upbringing tends to frequently seep into his work as well (see: The Last Temptation of Christ). You'd think that when they collide it would result in a giant blood bath, especially since he chose feudal era Japan as the setting, but surprisingly, this is actually one of the most bloodless movies Scorsese has ever made. (That's not entirely true, there is one scene where someone gets decapitated, but that's about it.) This is the anti Wolf of Wall Street. Where The Wolf of Wall Street was a never-ending cavalcade of debauchery, decadence, hedonism and spectacle, Silence is incredibly subdued and restricted. There's virtually no score, the bouts of silence add gravitas to its brutality, and while the characters endure horrific torture and suffering, the placid camera work makes it understated yet still hard to look at. It's a lot like Hacksaw Ridge, another recent film where Andrew Garfield's religious faith is put to the test in a bloody period of Japan's history, but whereas the Hacksaw Ridge's is all building to one big bloody blow-out, Silence's protagonist is slowly raked through the coal over the course of its three hour run time.Scorsese is one of those directors whose style is instantly recognizable, but this time around the fingerprints of other filmmakers are a lot more visible. Appropriate for the setting, the most notable influence on Silence is Akira Kurosawa, specifically in the use of weather. Rain, fog, wind, fire and mud are used so effectively that the landscape becomes a character all its own. The camera work isn't nearly as kinetic as it usually is, things are a lot more stationary, and coupled with the stark cinematography gives the film a cold, isolated feel, even in the middle of the sweltering Japanese summer. A sense of isolation that drives the narrative home.Eventually the focus shifts away from Garfield and Driver as a duo to Garfield himself, who eventually develops some rather sketchy motives for helping these people. The search for his lost mentor devolves into a search for guidance from a God who doesn't answer his prayers in a place where He probably can't hear them. As the film progresses, it becomes a lot more questionable about whether his devotion is a matter of faith or pride. As our point-of-view character providing the bulk of the narration, Rodrigues' inner monologue begins comparing his struggles to that of Christ and silently passes judgement on Garrpe, his mentor, the peasants. This self-absorption does play well into the film's overall themes of martyrdom, doubt, strength and weakness, faith in the face of persecution and the effects of imperial foreign influence, but it doesn't make for a very relatable narrative. Part of this is because of the overall isolated tone working against itself, but part of it unfortunately falls on Andrew Garfield. Garfield is a terrific actor who I believe has an Oscar-worthy performance in him, but this subject matter is hard for even the greatest of actors and he doesn't quite have the muscle to pull off something so weighty.Garfield isn't alone in this department, as the performances are a bit of a mixed bag. That's not to say there are any bad apples here, there isn't a single bad actor in the entire cast, but there were some things that I found a bit distracting. Garfield and Driver both speak with these weird and clearly phony Portugese accents and it wouldn't be so bad if they at least spoke more Portugese. Liam Neeson doesn't even bother to hide his accent, but it's Liam Neeson, the man is his accent. The Japanese actors give great performances across the board. Special praise has to go to Yosuke Kobuzuka who plays Kichijiro a cowardly Judas figure who spends the film in a cycle of betraying Rodrigues and begging for his forgiveness, cult filmmaker Shinya Tsukatomo (best known for directing Tetsuo, The Iron Man) as one of the devout villagers, and Issei Ogata, who gives a tremendous portrayal of a frail but menacing inquisitor. They all do a great job, but it does strike me as odd that they all speak in Engrish. Really good Engrish, mind you, but Engrish nonetheless. This is all just a minor inconsistency, but one that does become a bit hard to ignore after a while.Overall, Silence is a definite slow burn that not everyone will get behind, but is probably the most personal movie Scorsese has made in a long time. It's not his most relatable or inviting film, but there is still a lot to be admired about it. If Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Casino are your preferred flavor, then this one might be a bit hard to swallow. But then again, Scorsese on his worst days are still better than most directors at their apex.7/10.",,Anonymous,History
Silence has its raw unease moments with Martin Scorsese's direction and also very slow moving.,"The latest Martin Scorsese historical drama film following the Jesuit priests traveling to Japan to find one of their own that went missing. Scorsese's film is well focused on story telling this historical story, also delivering some great performances from Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. Silence may be short on being one of Martin Scorsese's better films like The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc.In the 17th Century, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are sent on a mission to look for a missing priest Ferrera (Liam Neeson). When he was last heard in Japan, where they are trying to renounce the Christianity faith and torture to those who would not give up their faith.Martin Scorsese is great at being a storyteller in his movie scripts and direction. I like the concept going over the ""hidden Christians"" era when the conflict in Japan of the shogunate is trying persuade the village people in their country to renounce their Christian faith. With Father Rodrigues and Garupe visiting the village citizens and to see that they are still holding on to their Christian faith. Even as they have mass in hiding at night. When Rodrigues is feeling like he is being tested as he witnesses innocent people being tortured unless they renounce their beliefs. It is a powerful moving film. Rodrigues holding onto what he believes in, no matter the challenges that he is facing. The cinematography has its raw tone, and the music score kept to the minimum and with the outdoor noise of Japan being heard in the background from waves sound, a silent moment with crickets noise, etc. The set design was beautiful. Some unease feeling when seeing how people are being treated for what they believe in.Andrew Garfield did a great job with his performance and Adam Driver as well.The film is very slow moving with its storytelling. Does take a while for it to set up its story. Clocking in at a running time of two and half hours. The film can also be boring, seeing Rodrigues being taunted and he rejects the idea of giving up his faith which can go on for almost an hour. May not be one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The acting and direction is the spotlight of this movie. While the rest falls in the slow moving story of a historical drama that hasn't been told before.Overall, Silence is a fair film, great performances, and strong direction. Its slow pace of two and half hours does feel like a very long time and some boring moments. I would rate Silence 3 out of 5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Salinger found god in ash-trays, Scorcese seeks him in soundlessness","Many people I have spoken with call Silence –http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490215/– a must see performance and there are many cinematic reasons including dialog, interesting plot and screen shots that make this a terrific film. Some of the sequences could have been edited and thus shorten the film. The exchanges between the clergyman and the inquisitor –among the best features of the film for thoughtful viewers– could have been more frequent and revealing of the Asian / European divide when it comes to fathoming the role of faith in these two Portugal and Japan homogenous yet strikingly different ethnic, cultural, and religious societies. The performances while very believable are of characters who become too stereotypical given the numerous scenes of brutality displayed, as well as hinted at, in the course of the narrative. Among the best themes revealed in the dialog is the absence of divine intervention and the possible reasons for all that fear, torment, & suffering to which audiences are subjected by the scenes of torture and sacrifice. A clear, well-written script, delivered by very capable actors, accompanies beautifully photographed scenes. The story line does lack sufficient details to fully reveal the causes of what we witness in the film, unless of course Scorcese deliberately wanted us (like Job) to fully appreciate the senselessness of authoritarian extremism as much as he does the absence of divine grace. To the question ""why do bad things happen to good people?' the movie leaves us with Silence.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Boring,"I found this movie interesting in that it shows the tribulations of Christian missionaries in Japan but it was made in a very boring way. At 2:40 h it is way to long, it could easily be cut by at least 40 min. Also, something that really bothers me is that while Japanese people speak Japanese, supposedly Portuguese missionaries speak English! I know that US and UK viewers do not like subtitles and are not used to them, and there would be no space for Liam Nielsen or Andrew Garfield, but it really affects the movie in my opinion. There are excellent Portuguese actors that could have performed a credible role, or even Brazilian actors for that matter. This way everybody speaks English with a few ""Padre"" and ""Deus"" words thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Will be remembered as one of Scorsese's truly great films.,"Fifty years from now, this will be remembered as one of Scorsese's truly great films. It's not fashionable to make a film about devout Jesuit missionaries these days. Certainly not as fashionable as making films about sucking cocaine out of prostitutes' orifices.This film has a soul. It has a purpose. It sets up a goalpost. It does not move them. It achieves the goal.The first two acts are very violent and disturbing, not unlike The Passion of the Christ or The Mission, which also starred a younger Liam Neeson, Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons as Jesuit Priests in the Amazon jungles. Real portrayals of actual martyrdom occur relentlessly, multiple times, and for quite some time in Silence. And it is extremely confusing and distressing to watch. There are a few gory scenes, but the real torture comes from the mental games that the Inquisitors play in order to get the outlaw Christians to renounce their faith.The third act has quite an impressive twist that I did not expect at all. By the end, it was truly graceful and satisfying. Scorse has said that Taxi Driver was directly influenced by Robert Bresson's Pickpocket, both tales of alienation in modern society. I haven't seen a lot of discussion about Silence, but it seems to be that the third act especially must have been influenced, at least in part, by Bresson's masterpiece Diary of a Country Priest. One of my favorite films of all time. Though I fell asleep three times trying to watch Diary, my heart soared when I finally got to see the end of it. ""All is..."" Well, I don't really have to tell you now, do I? All you need to know is right there in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
There's Quality Here but it's not for me,"It's a tricky film for me to review objectively. A slow film about religion would not normally be my first choice. That said, I am happy to try new genres, particularly when well reviewed. The film undoubtedly has quality - it's superbly shot and well acted - Andrew Garfield was outstanding. And a story of a naive but committed priest taking on the Japanese establishment who understand the threat he and his faith represented to their status quo was never going to end cheerfully. And there's the problem - it's long, slow, quite depressing and other than a snapshot of how brutal the Japanese were in these times, I don't know what I've taken away from it. It wasn't time wasted but it's certainly not a film I'd watch again. And I don't think I'd even know who to recommend it to either.",6.0,Anonymous,History
a lengthy and stunning journey into the power of religious belief,"I particularly enjoy this style of filmmaking, Silence was a long, beautiful journey that followed a very calming pace despite the actually disturbing content. As we follow these two priests through their journey through Japan. I really liked how this film was so long, it really goes to show the excruciating length of their travels, yet it didn't feel dragged on a at all serving as a very well utilized narrative device.This is the second time we've seen Andrew Garfield in a film about religions and beliefs particularly Christianity. He does really well in these roles, his facial language and soft tone just creates such a soothing aura when very befitting of these roles. Liam Neeson and Adam Driver though didn't get a lot of screen time played it well when they were on screen as more minor characters.The real breakout performance in my opinion is definitely from Japanese actor: Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. It was an extremely well acted role, the way he moves and talks in this film, the stumbling tone and the way he speaks and approaches the two pastors really shows this strength of his belief. I really liked how this came through in all of the Japanese villagers. Other than that also a shout out to the Japanese actor who played the bastardly Kichijiro, both very well acted roles.As mentioned the theme of belief is so powerful and so impactful in this film as it was in Garfield's other film, Hacksaw Ridge. From the smallest of tokens that the villagers held that had any connection to god to the secret baptisms that the village held. Tomokichi final song, it really is an ode to the power and strength of believing and religion.Overall Silence definitely has its very impactful and shocking moments however it does have its dull moments particularly in the later half of the film but none the less this is a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Tedious, repetitious","This could have been done in half the time. Way too much self reflecting and breast beating by Garfield's character. We got the point in the first hour -- he was having problems with faith. Yet how can any of us have any sympathy for someone going into another culture and act as if that venerable country with its own long established beliefs needs to be given someone else's. Hypocrisy at it height -- at one point one Jesuit says to the other essentially ""why are they treating us like this?"", ignoring the fact that their own religion was doing the same and worse to anyone who did not follow their beliefs. At one point my wife turned to me, and began to chuckle as she saw I was staring at the ceiling. I was counting ceiling squares. I would have left, but was with friends, who did not like it either, but they always stay through films. I love movies, and have seen some bad ones, but this is way up on that list.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A tremendous gift for a new year,"Having been in some kind of development for the past quarter of a century, Martin Scorsese's Silence finally opens. And after a grim 2016 it emerges as the perfect gift for the new year: a deeply probing and contemplative epic exploring themes of persecution, integrity, truth and faith, which seems not only apt for our times, but necessary.We open with the chaotic sounds of nature – a cacophony of insect chatter and animal wailing – and then we cut to ""Silence"".The year is 1633 and the place is Japan. Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) provides the context. He's a Jesuit priest, captured and tortured by the Japanese for his faith. Jump to 1640. Two of Ferreira's students, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver), are informed that Ferreira has gone AWOL in Japan. The crackdown on Christianity has turned that country into a dangerous place for Christians. Rumours abound that Ferreira has denounced his faith. But Rodrigues and Garrpe believe this is slander, and they set off for Japan to bring Ferreira home.The wandering priests enter a coastal village and are welcomed by the native Japanese, who exist in crushing poverty, struggling under the ruthless, ever-watchful eye of Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata). Suspected Christians are regularly dragged from their homes and forced to publicly denounce their God by stepping foot on the image of Jesus.This ""trampling"" becomes a key weapon and point of conflict in the story. As the Japanese rulers repeatedly state, it is ""just a formality"". But for the flock it means the relinquishing of faith; a surrendering of who they are. It's called ""korobu"", literally meaning ""to fall down"".When Rodrigues advises the villagers to go ahead and ""trample"", he is applying real-world advice to a punishment that threatens their very existence. Yet what about Rodrigues himself – why should he not heed his own advice? The Japanese believe it's a matter of ego; that Rodrigues is arrogant. But is it not his job to be held to a higher religious standard?The story is seen almost exclusively through the eyes of Rodrigues: his horror at the cruelty of the ruling class; his ambivalent but ultimately loving relationship with Garrpe; his guilt and doubt about his faith and his mission; and finally the extent of his service under a repressive system. After all, what relief can he provide dead? Even if it makes him a hypocrite in life.In the basic plot there are parallels with Heart of Darkness, and by extension Apocalypse Now, although don't expect a crazy Colonel Kurtz showdown. The inevitable confrontation with Ferreira is a philosophical fight. What is found is scary and threatening to Rodrigues, but not for the reasons one might imagine. Indeed, this third act shifts our view of the priests, who were once unquestionably saviours, to something less morally clear.But the greatest parallels are with Scorsese's own film, The Last Temptation of Christ. Like Willem Dafoe's Christ, Garfield's Rodrigues is humanised. He's temperamental, doubtful, even hopeless at times. Always burdened by this divine responsibility, although perhaps less resentful than Nikos Kazantzakis's Son of God. Garfield brings great warmth to the role, and an agonising, largely internalised passion.Special mention must go to the sound design. It's a quiet film but one which is conspicuously bereft of silence. At one point Rodrigues hands a token – a tiny wooden cross – to a poor villager, and it seems to chirrup like a living thing. Scorsese is reminding us that nature is never silent, and rarely is the human mind.By the end, we are left with more questions than answers – which is fine, because they are questions we can all ask of ourselves. Narratively harking back after the lifetime of Rodrigues, we ask: If a person's faith is not permitted to be shown – not fetishised – does that mean it is vanquished? Belief, one might argue, is actually given strength by repressive rules, driven deeper, into the soul of the individual. (Or, for the atheists among us, into the unvoiced subconscious.)All of which makes us look at the broader struggles portrayed throughout the film in general. The Inquisitor frequently refers to Japan as a swamp in whose soil Christianity can never take root. Indeed, as a structured organisation, Christianity may not be able to overthrow the Buddhist order. But on an individual level, leaving aside rituals or tokens, there will always be those who need relief from the burden of their guilt, or who struggle with their personal integrity.In the wake of last year's events, it is sometimes mentioned that we are living in a ""post-truth"" world. That truth is the objective kind, whereas the ""truth"" to which Silence refers is something different: the truth that beneath the artefacts of our belief systems – the crosses and the books and the veils – lies a shared belief in humanity; a desire for order and community. In portraying the captors and captives in a nuanced way, without madness or outright evil, Scorsese isn't obfuscating this greater truth but illuminating it.At 160 minutes, Silence looks on paper like a slog, but it's briefer than your average Middle-earth movie and it is never dull. This isn't Bela Tarr, where boredom is a currency; there is purpose and drama in every scene, and if you surrender to its perfectly paced lull then you will emerge self-reflective, and quite possibly into the most interesting post-cinema pub conversation ever.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Passion for Silence.,"Im an agnostic and this is a honest review about the passion project ""Silence"" by Martin Scorsese. A story based on the novel by Shūsaku Endō about 2 Jesuit priests who travel to Japan in order to find what happened to their mentor and propagate Catholicism. Novel was published in 1966. I have read a bunch of different reviews about this film. Some praise it, some say its one of the most boring movies they ever stumbled upon that only religious people will enjoy.For starters this is a very slow phased movie that will take a lot of patience to sit through. I cant say that it is pro-Christian or anti- Christian, because there are several ways to interpret this movie. How far would you go to keep your faith intact, how much suffering you would go through or seeing other people suffer and get tortured before renouncing god? It raises some important questions.""Silence"" is a very intelligent film, that will make you put your thinking cap on whether you are religious or not (open mind). Overall very great acting from the cast. Especially Garfield and the Japanese actors in supporting roles. Felt like Driver needed some more screen time though, he didn't have that big of an impact in ""Silence"". The cinematography is stunning which was noticed by the Academy by a nomination on best cinematography-category. Hard movie to rate and to find enjoyable, but in few years this might just be known as an overlooked masterpiece. In my opinion one of Martys most original movies, and as mentioned before: a passion project, which shows.Dedication that Scorsese had about making this, was extraordinary and that needs to be respected.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Scorsese's Brutal & Thought-Provoking Passion Project Is A Must See!,"A long-time passion project for Martin Scorsese, which he developed for over 26 years, 'Silence' has finally come alive. And to its fortune, Scorsese delivers one of the most powerful films ever based on Faith, Humanity & God Itself. This is a Brutal & Thought-Provoking Film, that questions our existence & the religious beliefs we're surrounded by.'Silence' Synopsis: Two priests travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor and propagate Catholicism. While there, they are faced by severe protest & torture.'Silence' left me disturbed & thought provoked. Scorsese delivers such a brutal tale of people driven by faith & later being tortured for their beliefs. The Japanese torture & brutalize the Christians as they try to propagate Catholicism. To be honest, you need a very strong stomach to absorb 'Silence', its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. The goings-on are very intense & at times, brutal.Scorsese doesn't shy away from showing what has to be shown. This tale of faith & the violent prosecution that follows, is told with relentlessness. And by the time you reach its final-act, where a shocking twist unfolds though an character, you're bound to be shocked. 'Silence' truly questions humanity & how faith can be questioned too. And above all, it questions God with pain & sorrow.Scorsese's Direction is remarkable. He brings his passion to life with gut-wrenching intensity. Without a shed of doubt, 'Silence' finds him at his peak! Jay Cocks & Scorsese's Screenplay, Based upon the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. is frightening, but arresting all through. Rodrigo Prieto's Cinematography is marvelous. Thelma Schoonmaker's Editing is well-done, even though the film runs for nearly 3 hours (160-minutes to be precise). Kim Allen Kluge & Kathryn Kluge's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues, the protagonist, takes upon the challenge Scorsese puts him in & in return, delivers a moving performance. His breakdowns when he witnesses brutality on the name of his faith, appear real & haunting. Adam Driver as Francisco Garupe, does well in a relatively smaller role. Liam Neeson as Father Cristóvão Ferreira, enters the scene pretty late, but commands the screen. He's fabulous! Issey Ogata as the inquisitor, the antagonist, is fantastic. He is a scene-stealer!

10 all the way!,"Having seen this movie, I decided to wait for a few hours to digest it and see if my opinion changed. After that time, I am more convinced it is a movie is flawless in its single-mindedness, its technical craft, and in its acting, but there are a couple of problems with the film.Its violence is realistic and gut-wrenching, as many have said before. For a time this shock works towards its purpose, and you flinch at every blow. As the movie wears on, however, its relentlessness begins to de-humanize the sacrifice of its main character.As I'm writing this review, I find myself trying to do so without any sort of revelation of my own personal beliefs, and it is difficult. If this were any other character besides Jesus, I'd be simply complaining that I didn't identify or feel any sympathy with the main character, and, consequentially, the suffering and the sacrifice's impact are lessened, and the movie suffers for it.But this is about JAPANESE CHRISTIANS who endured horrific persecution because of their beliefs. Not unlike Christians today who endure persecution from the secular crowd who will one day be ushered into eternal darkness forever. Sobering.I speculate that Scoreses was not interested in humanizing the Japanese, though. The film does not sermonize its message, but simply documents it. If this is what Scoreses intended to do, then he succeded with aplomb.And though this review seems negative, I dont' intend it to be. I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars, and stick by it. It is beautiful, though painful, to watch. It is moving and, in its purpose, it succeeds. I walked into the movie expecting to be blown away, and wasn't, but I was still intrigued, and its made me talk to others and think about my own faith. Perhaps that was the intention all along.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Curious and outstanding,"Whatever expectations I had of 'Silence' based on advance trailers, of a dynamic and dramatic movie, were wholly upended. This is an astoundingly understated feature, where the music listed in the credits is so subtle that I do not recall it in the film I just watched. The duration begins and ends with sparing ambient sounds - crickets, ocean waves - laid over a black screen. Every act of violence and feeling of anguish in the story is viewed as though from a distance, not directly experienced by the audience, with the unremarkable neutrality of an observer that diminishes emotional beats if not altogether rendering them sterile.This is a curious, thoughtful film, and while I enjoyed it, I don't know entirely what to think of it.This much is certain: Martin Scorsese is unquestionably a master film-maker. In word and in final realization it has been made very clear that 'Silence' has been a passion project for him for many years. While my knowledge of Scorsese's pictures is far from complete, I can think of very few films broadly, let alone those among his that I know, that were so obviously crafted with the utmost painstaking care. 'Silence' is driven by narrative, not by emotion or artfulness, yet it feels like every footfall, every word, every second of film were considered with the most calculated precision of intent. It's not difficult to imagine that every frame is laid out with the exact vision that Scorsese has held in mind over time.So many shots are surely eye-catching, and brilliantly arranged from both sides of the camera. The costume design and overall production design, overseen by Dante Ferretti, are phenomenal, as is wardrobe generally and set decoration. The filming locations were exquisite choices, making 17th-century Japan feel very real even from the comfort of my own home. In every technical sense, 'Silence' is a fantastic achievement.The actors assembled here all give outstanding performances, and in my mind that's true especially of the Japanese cast. Not to discount anyone, yet this goes most of all for Shinya Tsukamoto, excellent in his prominent role as devout Mokichi; Yosuke Kubozuka, as untrustworthy Kichijiro, struggling in his faith; and Issey Ogata, cool and casual in his malice and indifference as the antagonistic Inoue Masashige. Of course the big stars get our attention, too; Liam Neeson and Ciarán Hinds capably keep our attention while they're on screen. More surprising still are Adam Driver and especially Andrew Garfield. For both their relative youth and less prominent star power, to say nothing of the action blockbusters that mark their most recognizable roles, I balked when I first learned of their involvement. Yet both put in swell performances befitting the picture, and I feel confident that having proven their capabilities for a revered film-maker like Martin Scorsese, they have shown just what they can do in more dramatic parts.The aspect of 'Silence' where I get caught up a bit is with the narrative, simply because the subject matter is complex and charged. No matter the time or place, freedom to practice religion as one wishes is a quintessential human right, so long as it affects no one else, and any measure that would suppress that hallmark of civilization is to be abhorred. Indeed, the past history of active, violent resistance to outside religion in Japan, as vividly seen herein, should disturb anyone of conscience, and it does. Yet at the same time, as a non-believer, I particularly detest and oppose organized religion, and recognize the harm that comes with it. Where go white missionaries, soon follows colonization, expansion of sociopolitical and economic hegemony, subjugation and erasure of endemic culture, and worse. Moreover, there's a sickening inherent complex to structured faith, as illustrated in 'Silence,' that direly seeks persecution and martyrdom as a means of validation. With these points in mind, the refusal to allow a Western dogma to seed is more understandable and reasonable, even as the methods of repulsion remain excessive and extreme.For all these reasons, I find myself conflicted where this picture is concerned. 'Silence' is, I think, evenhanded and objective in its depiction of events, glorifying or sanctioning neither the Jesuits' proselytizing nor their aggressive quelling by the Japanese. This approach to storytelling allows the viewer to engage more earnestly with the narrative, seeking our own informed judgment of the saga just as the characters struggle alternately with doubt and resolve. It makes the watching experience more challenging - but also more rewarding.When all is said and done I do heartily enjoy 'Silence,' but I still wrestle with what to think of it more specifically. By no stretch of the imagination is this going to be a movie for everyone. Between the subject matter and violence, the weighty, understated tone, and the deliberate avoidance of dynamics, this is a film that requires a patient, attentive audience. Yet for anyone willing to engage with it honestly, 'Silence' is masterful and captivating, a monumental accomplishment that in time will surely be uplifted as one of Martin Scorsese's greatest works.Strong, reverberating recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,History

For a Non-Believer This Movie Is a Slog,"It's my own fault. I broke my own rule about watching religious movies, so I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored to tears by ""Silence."" I don't believe in God, and religion plays absolutely no role in my life. I think the Bible is mythology, created for the same reason mythology existed for other cultures -- to explain things about the world that are otherwise unexplainable. That religion is important to the vast majority of humans does not bother me. I have nothing against those who practice. But I'm not moved by stories of faith or the struggles of those who undergo religious doubt, because for me there's about as much worth in expending mental energy trying to decide whether or not Tinkerbell is real.I didn't care about anybody in ""Silence,"" Martin Scorsese's ambitious dud of a movie. I certainly didn't care much about the main protagonist, a priest played by Andrew Garfield, because his primary conflict is trying to understand why God stays silent in the face of so much human misery. Well that question for me was answered before the movie even began, so I certainly didn't need 2 and a half hours of pontification about it. I felt the most for the Japanese people who weren't allowed to practice Catholicism by a brutal regime who would torture and kill them if they did not reject it, because I believe people should be able to worship however they want. But this all happened so long ago and it all remains so abstract and Scorsese was not able to bring it alive in any compelling way.Nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,History

Scorsese's most underrated film,"I've never written an IMDb review before but I just had to for Silence after seeing it only had a 7.2. In my opinion, Silence is a top 3 Marty film and a masterpiece. It's by far his most thought provoking film, beautifully shot, has amazing performances especially from Andrew Garfield, and super well written. It didn't even feel that slow considering it is almost 3 hours. No scene felt like a waist. A profound and powerful film on religion. I truly am clueless as to how this has a 7.2. I'll insert my main review here:
A powerful film on religion. Religion brings people comfort, hope, and comradery but also brings conflict, division, pain, and oppression. This film asks an important question. Is your faith worth more than human life? Is preserving human life the greatest act of faith? If we confine ourselves into something that we aren't, our lives will become meaningless or unfulfilling. Because of this, we must always hold on to who we are under all circumstances. But is preserving who we are worth it if it means that others are harmed in the process. I, like many of the characters in this film am very conflicted with how I feel about these topics. Silence is by far Scorsese's deepest and most thought provoking film and also possibly the most beautifully shot. Andrew Garfield knocks it out of the park. He flawlessly portrays a man seeing his world come crashing down with doubts of the very thing he has dedicated his life to. Everyone in this delivers an amazing performance. Even if you are forced to hide something far away from anyone, don't let it go. Truly profound.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Silence,"I seldom talk about religion on IMDB since it's a thorny topic and it ruffles a lot of feathers. However, since this movie deals with faith and spirituality I'm gonna talk about it so suck it up I guess. This film depicts real Christian persecution, it's not the kind of fake persecution you get in those terrible Pureflix movies. This film depicts Christian persecution in 17th century feudal Japan. The film has a lot of great performances from everybody involved including Liam Neeson and Andrew Garfield. Personally as a lapsed Protestant, I think that secular and religious people can coexist together, after all at the end of the day we're all human and we can find a common ground even if we disagree on religious matters. And I would go a step further and say this: you don't need to be religious to be a decent human being you just need to have compassion and empathy for your fellow man but I digress.

"""The Blood of the Martyrs Moistens the Seeds of the Church""","...So says the Jesuit missionary to his psychologically astute Japanese ""inquisitor"" who threatens him with torture and death in Martin Scorsese's overlong but compelling film ""Silence."" The Jesuit can endure torture and a horrible death for the sake of his Savior but can he endure the terrible suffering of the innocent whose agonies are prolonged due to his unyielding faith in his God....or is it a misplaced need for establishing a church in an alien land....or even a reflection of unconscious spiritual pride amid the honest weakness of the ""apostasizers?"" The inquisitor asks for an overt rejection of the Christian God by the imprisoned Jesuit whose journey to Japan was prompted by news of an earlier missionary's apostasy (renunciation of the faith). The Jesuit along with another priest have made the perilous journey for the salvation of the apostate's soul and to renew the missionary effort. Will he succumb to the same terrible dilemmas as tortured the apostate's?Scorsese's film is replete with religious and psychological themes that haunt us. What is the meaning of suffering; can we allow others to suffer to demonstrate (or confirm to ourselves?) our boundless faith; does faith supersede all other human criteria at all times; can love of God be separated from love of man; whose ""truth"" prevails: the Christian ""truth"" in a Buddhist land, or the Buddhist ""truth"" amid Christian interlopers? I'm reminded that Mother Teresa, who did holy work amid the poor and dying of Calcutta, has been criticized for not allowing painkillers to be given to the suffering and dying in her care, because suffering, in her judgment, was spiritually good for them. While that may indeed be right, is that her decision to make?Part of the power of the church's appeal, and part of the theological problems with the nature of that appeal, is the ordinary person's amazement and respect for the amount of agonies the church's ""holiest"" representatives will endure to substantiate their faith. While briefly touched upon in ""Silence,"" and not remotely on the same level as martyrdom, I'm reminded that some historians have commented that the clerical power of the Roman Catholic Church is reinforced by priestly celibacy, i.e., these men are stronger than us, they can subdue their bodily appetites unlike the rest of us.",8.0,Anonymous,History

An Earnest Examination of Faith,"Two priests, alike in their devotion for their former mentor, enter the country of Japan to find word of his fate. It is the 16th century and more than a decade has past since the Shimabara Rebellion which caused the Tokugawa Shogunate to actively suppress Catholicism across Japan. ""The moment you set foot in that country, you step into high danger,"" warns the priests' superior. ""You will be the last two priests to enter Japan. An army of two."" Thus Silence begins; our attention and in many ways our faith is carried through by the quest of the sincere but arrogant Rodrigues (Garfield) and the pragmatic and terse Garrpe (Driver).It is a well known fact in film circles that director Martin Scorsese is a devout Catholic whose faith at one point geared him towards joining the priesthood. You get a sense of that whenever Catholicism inserts itself into his work (as it often does). There are obvious tonal shifts which do a good job at paying proper respect to the divine without taking away from the story. At his most reverential however, such as in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), that tone greatly enriches the film as if shining a light on an ancient gold quilled manuscript or filtering a beam of sun between panes of stain glass windows.That constant reverence shows up here, though Silence wisely injects oceans of naturalistic beauty that at times feel more like parts of Kundun (1997) than, say, the catholic mass in Mean Streets (1973). Despite a change in setting, similar questions echo in the dark caverns, lush bamboo forests and Edo period fortresses of this film. Can you be forgiven selfish acts in the pursuit of selflessness? Why do bad things happen to good people? Is redemption achievable? - and probably most importantly, is anyone really up there? None of these questions are of course answered; how can they be, given the pain and suffering so many go through in the course of this film. Catholics, largely peasants and laymen are forced to blaspheme, are tortured and/or executed for the sake of preserving the foundations of Japanese sovereignty against what they see as European encroachment. In voice over, Rodrigues comments that he has never seen a race more devoted to the faith, - his reflections betray his own wavering devotion and can't help but feel incredibly naive in the face of Inquisitor Inoue's (Ogata) questions.It's no stretch to presume that silence is an important motif in the film. The lack of a film score and the story's inclusion of secret masses only cajoles the audience into listening intently for a lack of noise. What we hear instead are constant insertions of God's grace: the gentle breezes, the crashing of waves, the rustling of bushes and trees. Only once does the film go completely quiet. Only then does Scorsese, for the first time presume to know the judgment of God where before he has remained silent.The faithful and the faithless will no doubt see Silence in vastly different ways. As a lapsed Catholic myself, I can sit uncomfortably on the fence and see two camps forging a mutual appreciation for the film while taking potshots at its transgressions. One camp appreciates the religious seriousness and contemplation of Silence; a mode that only inhabits a mainstream Hollywood feature maybe once every decade. The other, more secular side gravitates towards the film as form. Those in the know will catch on to the channeling of Japanese greats such as Kenji Mizoguchi, Masaki Kobayashi and especially Akira Kurosawa.Yet what's sorely lacking from Silence is a sense of history. We get a very satisfying and granular peek onto one man's crisis of conscience but we get very little information on the social, political and economic forces that have shaped Rodrigues's harrowing story. As a vessel for proved colonization and cultural genocide, Catholicism, sadly only gets a third-act tongue lashing. Also, setting up Japan's aggressive period of isolation as an original sin of sorts, could have made for an interesting dimension. Alas that tact is ignored to make room for meditations on private vs. public faith. Also for a movie about Japan starring an almost exclusively Japanese cast, it's disheartening we're spending so much time with the only three white people on the islands.All in all, Silence stops just short of being a must-see cinematic experience. There's a lot to recommend here, and considering how much it gets right, I'd venture to say the movie might just transubstantiate for you. Scorsese has stated in the past that he's been interested in adapting this story to the screen for over a quarter century, but has never felt ready until now. Some people may think he finally came around to it after maturity in his faith. I'd venture to say it's penance for making The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).",8.0,Anonymous,History

Great human document,"On 16th century Japanese missionaries had succeeded in introducing Catholicism in Japan and converted lots of people till this was considered a danger by Japanese authorities that outlawed Catholicism there and arrested and executed several missionaries. This movie is an excellent human document about this by telling us the story of two missionaries who travel to Japan to search their mentor of whom there were no reliable news. There they must face the severe persecution of the authorities though at first many converted peasants help and hide them. That puts them into a lot of trouble and the story is admirably told in several very dramatic scenes, excellent images and extremely good performance of the actors. There was a small flaw when a couple of Japanese authorities and leaders behaved more like western current people in terms of facial expressions and way of talking than the usual Japanese ones. But I think that in general this movie shows a vivid quality in terms of images, scenery and characters.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterwork of Restraint,"Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" is not entertainment. It offers neither thrill, nor escapism, nor joy. It is not education in that It does not aim to convey facts or impart knowledge. It is not as didactic as a homily, or as quizzical as a kōan. I imagine it is best described simply as art. That seems an apt label, since the exercise of watching ""Silence"" resembled to me the ponderous study of a painting in a museum. A painted masterpiece does not merely depict the beauty of its subject, but conveys also some aspect of truth. The nature of this truth is imbued partly by the master, and reflected partly from the observer who explores it. The Mona Lisa does not force you to understand why she smirks, nor does she demand that you respond in kind. Yet each man appreciates her differently, and each in his own way gleans a bit of her truth viewed through the lens of his own. Such is the nature and quality of ""Silence"".This is a sober, challenging film in every respect. The heady subjects of faith and doubt in the apparent absence of absolution are explored with an unflinching honesty. Scorsese refrains from tugging at heartstrings or welling up emotional responses through music. He refuses to tell the audience what to think, preferring instead to simply depict a story worth thinking about. The lack of emotional manipulation is stunning, almost unsettling. It is a masterwork of restraint in a milieu typified by pretension and hyperbole.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""The Price For Your Glory Is Their Suffering""","Martin Scorsese's new drama was not designed to be easy on its audience. Silence is a dark tale of violence and persecution that raises many questions about faith and martyrdom, but doesn't pretend to have the answers to those questions. This is what makes the film so profound. Those that consider themselves very religious will find sympathy and outrage at the circumstances displayed. Those that are not religiously- minded, or that consider themselves atheist or agnostic, will find it unfathomable that people can treat each other in such ways over religion- or that people would be willing to die for their god. The question at the core of Silence is ""While you may be willing to die for your faith, are you willing to allow others to die for it?"" Silence does not pretend that there is a right or wrong answer to this question, instead it gives you the results of the decisions made by these specific characters-and allows you to ponder and decide for yourself what right and wrong is, or you may decide there isn't a right or wrong. Either way, I don't believe anyone can leave a viewing of Silence unaffected.As a movie, I went in a little worried. I had read that it was long and deliberately slow. But I didn't find this to be the case. While it is long, at 2 hours and 41 minutes, I did not feel that the film dragged, nor did it feel like it was too long. In fact, I was so enthralled by the characters on screen, I didn't really want it to end. At the same time, as much hardship is displayed on screen, the film needed to end-before it induced some semi-permanent depression on its audience. I guess what I'm saying is, if you're a fan of mature, thought-provoking movie-making, don't let the lengthy run-time scare you. Long-time Scorsese-collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker proves once again why she is one of the best film editors in the business. She's been doing this for fifty years now (according to IMDb), and Silence is one of her finest works yet. Not a single scene feels unnecessary or tacked on. Even though she already has three wins (The Departed, The Aviator, Raging Bull), I hope the Oscars don't leave her out this year.As for the cast, there's several award-worthy performances on display. Andrew Garfield is having quite the year. He's already been Golden Globe- nominated for his excellent turn in Hacksaw Ridge. But I believe his work in Silence is even better. His character has to deal with an intense crisis of faith, and it has to feel real or the film simply wouldn't work. Garfield makes this look effortless. The supporting actors, including Adam Driver, Liam Neeson and Ciarán Hinds all bring their A- game. The Japanese cast is also top-notch. Yoshi Oida, Shin'ya Tsukamoto, Yôsuke Kubozuka and Tadanobu Asano are all memorable. It's Issei Ogata as Inoue the Inquisitor who I really wish was in the awards conversation this year. His performance is humorous at times, bordering on just a bit hammy, but his character is so evil that these things only make him more despicable.The film is also a gorgeous production. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning. The costume and set designs give you a real sense of time and place, transporting you to world few films have gone and even fewer have made look this authentic.As for the star behind the camera, Martin Scorsese is one of those directors we've come to hold to a higher standard. Like Steven Spielberg or Francis Ford Coppola, when their films aren't great it is more noticeable-simply because these filmmakers have given us so many classics we hold in high esteem. Thankfully, Scorsese does not disappoint. At 74, he's delivered one of his most technically ambitious features. While Silence may not be as entertaining or re-watchable as some of his past efforts, it is certainly one his most thought-provoking and important films. Movie-goers also shouldn't let the ""Scorsese-brand"" worry them as far as the film's content. The film does feature some very intense scenes of torture and violence. But there is nothing in the way of profanity nor sex/nudity.Those going to Silence looking to be entertained may be disappointed. Not all films are designed to entertain. Some are made to promote thoughts and conversations about important subjects like religion, war and prejudice. Films like Schindler's List and Apocalypse Now come to mind; movies that you may not see over and over again-but that everyone should watch at least once. Silence may be difficult to watch at times. It can be faith-assuring or faith-shaking depending on what you take away from it. But like those other films I mentioned, it is a film everyone should see at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The acting is incredible throughout--the English and Japanese actors both doing a superb job. The story of Portuguese priests in Japan in the 1600s was interesting for me, because I could see both sides. What value did this new religion bring to the ruling class of Japan? They were a culture who followed the beauty and power of nature, and some scenes in the movie, a stunning view of the moon for instance, highlighted this. The movie gets a little slow sometimes but some of the final scenes with Mr. Neeson and Mr. Garfield are some of the most moving and powerful I've ever witnessed.

a discomforting masterpiece,"Greetings again from the darkness. Martin Luther King said ""Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase"". Martin Scorcese's esteemed film career could be described as unveiling that staircase, one step/film at a time. Religion, spirituality and yes, faith, have played a key role in his life and his films – most notably, Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ, but also most of his other projects.A high-ranking priest (Ciaran Hinds) is meeting with two younger Portuguese priests and informing them of the rumor that their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has reportedly renounced his faith and is now living as a Japanese Buddhist in Nagasaki. The two young Jesuit priests, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) refuse to believe this and request to be allowed to track down Ferreira and bring him home. It could be termed a rescue mission, and the two men could be called missionaries, but what follows is an excruciating test of their own faith.Martin Scorcese has been working on this passion project for more than two decades – ever since he read the Shusaku Endo novel (published in 1966). Cast members have changed through the various iterations of the project, but after the box office success of The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorcese received the financial backing to bring his vision to the screen. He co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks (Gangs of New York) and the result is the visual and emotional epic that you might expect from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.17th century Christianity in Japan might be a difficult subject to sell to the general movie-going public, and Scorcese goes out of his way to leave unanswered the multitude of questions the film raises. Rather than wrapping it up with a clean ending, he leaves viewers craving further discussions, clarity and explanations. In other words, it lacks mass appeal and shouldn't be confused with light-hearted entertainment.Rodrigues is resolute in his belief that God is the answer  even when the film's title is at the forefront. As Rodrigues and Garupe minister to the village of secret Christians (led by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto) at night and hide during the day, we learn of the Japanese state's commitment to eradicating Christians and Christianity to ensure the power and isolation of the country. The oddest character in the film is that of Kichijiro (an excellent Yosuke Kubozuka). He is both guide to the priests and a constant challenge to their faith, while also providing moments of comic relief in a film with very few. Were this a Kurosawa film, this role would have been a perfect fit for the great Tishiro Mifune.The most obvious adversary for the priests is the Japanese elder known as The Inquisitor. Issei Ogata excels in the role as a wily, half-smiling, quite knowledgeable wartime (a war on Christianity) leader intent on creating the most painful and public extermination of Christian believers and those priests who dare to infect his country (Japan's 1614 Edict of Expulsion). The torture and persecution is too much to detail here, but it portrays how even the most ardent believers could choose life over faith.The film blends fiction with some true-to-life aspects, and is most effective at asking questions and spurring thought. Which is more crucial – public or private faith? Is doubt allowable and even understandable? Is Rodrigues so committed to faith or is there also an element of martyrdom present? How about the ""Judas"" sub-plots? Is it betrayal if it saves one's own life? Just where is that line? Is Ferreira a disgraced priest or simply a man valuing survival? The film is beautiful to look at (superb work from cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and editor Thelma Schoonmaker) while being exceedingly tough to watch (and quite long). Be prepared to set aside time for reflection and discussion  you may even discover some surprises in your views and beliefs.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A cinematic meditation on the nature of religion and religious ideology,"For those of you who go to movies with the expectation of being 'entertained' you may come away disappointed. As others have indicated, the themes in this work are repetitive, disengaged and monolithic.What this film does do is point to the nature of Spirit. And how man's ideological impositions are, in the words of Shakespeare, ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"".What we witness is the huffing and puffing of Christian zealots attempting to 'support the faith' in Japan. Apparently, without any real understanding of the nature of the established religion, Buddhism, and by extension, no great depth of appreciation of the core of their own faith.The remorseless churning by way of persecution of the non-apostates is in itself a message of consistency.

nope,"As someone who became a ""cineaste"" in my tweens, I can say that Scorsese was first a God, then, in film school, a bloated pre-madonna, and now, as a middle aged film-lover, a damn fine, if over-celebrated film maker.This is one of the best films he's ever made, which is not to call it a truly a great movie. Aesthetically, it's breathtaking. The imagery is probably the finest Scorsese has ever conjured. He and DP Rodrigo Prieto create pictures worthy of far greater artists, like Tarkovsky or Van Gogh.Thematically, it's a hard piece of work for a proud atheist like myself to swallow. It's a celebration of religious faith as such. However, despite the overtly spiritual, Christian nature of this work, it fits right into Scorsese's oeuvre, one that has been, at times in my life, inspirational to me. Are not Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas all about an inner, obsessive drive to live up to a presupposed ideal? In all those cases the ideal reached turns out to be an empty goal, a false target.In this work, as I experience it, the empty ideal is the Christian faith, one that, the film makes clear in the most visceral of ways, has claimed many victims, in the service of both ""proving and disproving"" its dogma. But for Scorsese to be human is to carry obsession into the realm of violence, against both the self and the other.One of the strengths of Silence is how it plays out as a conversation between sincere missionaries and ruthless, if clear sighted, anti- imperialists. The film makers intend you to identify with the former, but I did so with the latter. That never blinded me to the fact that both sides were making compelling arguments. I do think the film wants the viewer to take both into consideration, and for that alone it is commendable.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Extremely disappointed,"I had high hopes for this movie, it is directed by the great Scorsese. The whole movie was overly acted and constant face palms throughout. I will never watch a movie with Andrew Garfield again, he is a horrible actor. I never enjoyed his acting but I thought just maybe he would do alright, boy I was wrong. This movie could have been a great one but it wasn't, it was a complete waste of time. Listening to people talk about it while leaving the theater helped me realize I wasn't the only one who thought this was garbage. The main character should have been Adam Driver, he is a truly good actor. But he was in the movie for maybe an hour all together. Liam Neeson was a disappointment. Don't waste you're money on this nonsense.",2.0,Anonymous,History
'Silence' is Golden,"Martin Scorsese's use of nature fuels his latest film ""Silence,"" which follows the journey of two priests (Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield) into an unfamiliar land. They have traveled to Japan in search of another priest (Liam Neeson) who by all accounts has renounced his Christian faith. The film takes place during a time of persecution, when Christians are forced by an inquisitor (Issey Ogata) to denounce Jesus Christ by stepping on an engraved plaque bearing his likeness, or face torture and death.My favorite scene is the one in which Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Neeson) reveals how nature, specifically the sun, played a role in the villagers' understanding of the priests' message of Jesus Christ. It is wonderfully backlit and suggests the use of natural light, and when Father Ferreira points up at the sky, the camera zooms in for an extreme close-up of the yellow blazing ball of fire. The sun appears powerfully radiant. It's the same sun that has the power to expose the priests in hiding if they dare to step out of their huts. Water is no less forgiving, quenching Sebastião Rodrigues' (Garfield) thirst from a stream one moment, and punishing Christian villagers being tortured the next moment. Scorsese shows that just as God can seem silent in response to the prayers of the suffering, nature too can seem to display a similar indifference.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Silence is the virtue,"This review of Silence is spoiler free**** (4/5)We don't know what Pope Francis thought of Silence when he attended the special premier at the Vatican but rumour is that he possibly gave it (4 out of 5 mitres at best) but may be that was the religious subject that reigns the strength of the film. Based on the late Shusaku Endo's 1965 novel Silence which also spawned an animated short in 1971 it pictures the tale of two priests who travel from Portugal to Japan to find Father Ferriera (Liam Neeson) who has somehow thought that the people of Japan could see the word of God, but without success. But when Father Garrpe and Father Rodriguez (Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield) receive the seemingly final letter from him they are given a quest to find him. They must enter Japan without seen, so when they are on the brink of constant danger from being caught by a Machiavellian Japanese man who thinks that he runs the country and thinks that he can scrape their faith.We also don't know what the novelist will think of this adaptation either but it seems that the decades Martin Scorsese spent trying to make this film it the final result is worth it. Though at points Scorsese isn't afraid of using torture among the residents of Japan who are put through some very harsh forces of torture, as we see images of men and women being burned at stakes, but also there are some men who devout the word of god they are tied to crucifixes for many days on end finally drown by high tide, though these gruesome images are essential stuff for setting up the story of the characters. But as Rodriguez and Garrpe are separated and sent to fend for themselves in different parts of the country to try and teach the other residents. Though the fate is clear for Garrpe but with Rodriguez its not so clear though there are points he seemingly gives up, thinks that the lord doesn't love him and just when it seems he is about to give his life away there is a scene when he looks into a stream and sees an image of himself as Jesus, so he forces himself to some extent to keep going.As Silence starts its stunning third act. It's here through a series of flashbacks that we see what the country did to Ferreira there is final chance for him and Rodriguez to sit done in conversation but as he is trying to convince that he isn't who he was Rodriguez looks to him as if his religion has been betrayed by him, and so he sees an end to his final hope and decides to declare his life to Japan and it's culture as he finally sees that he can't teach the country new things into the world of Christianity. Though the film does flag a little with it's length as it seems that some of the film is prolonged it shows that Scorsese can still create a masterpiece even at the age he is as he also manages to get Oscar-worthy performances out of Garfield and Driver. Despite the length and the fact that it feels a little slow at points Silence is a genius religious film, with stunning imagery that's gorgeous, strong with a hard hitting story that's utterly compelling. And it shows that his imagery of religion in the 1600s is as relevant today as it is pertinent.VERDICT: Yet another masterpiece from Scorsese, it may not be for everyone but Silence is a hard hitting with epic proportions and phenomenal Oscar-worthy performances. It's stunning to see, though sometimes cruel but it's powerful.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Subtle Masterpiece,"Now this was a film I've been giving some time to think about for the past week. I knew that this was my favorite film of the year, but I had a hard time trying to explain why. But now I think I understand. Silence is a film that tackles its ideas and themes mainly through sounds and images, not words. There are definitely a few dialogue heavy scenes, but the scenes that leave the most impact are the ones that linger on the sounds and visuals rather than whats being said. And not only does that approach make this Scorsese's second best film (in my opinion) but also the most powerful and emotionally resonating film of the whole year. Because its not the moments where characters give passionate discussions that I remember the most. Its the haunting images that have embedded into my memory as well the sounds, or the lack there of. Im definitely going to rewatch this when this gets a wider release. I have a feeling this won't be as successful as Scorsese's other films, mostly because its quite lengthy and slowly paced. But I feel that for its slow pacing there isn't a moment where I wasn't engrossed in what was being presented. I absolutely urge everyone to go see this movie, even if you think it might not be your thing. I want go any longer because I feel like I'll just start rambling. Then again, maybe great movies can do that to you. Also shitty movies of course, but luckily this is not a shitty movie.100/100",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Cruelty of Men,"In ""Silence"", Martin Scorsese tackles a difficult and rather controversial subject -- Religion. I'm sure many people will see this as a love letter to Christianity, perhaps. That some people never lose their faith. Some may view it as completely anti- Christian. They came to other countries to force their beliefs onto others. I choose to see it as a display of how cruel we can be to each other just for believing in different things.I believe in freedom of religion. You may choose to believe whatever you want as far as I'm concerned, as long as it doesn't involve inflicting pain upon others. We see the cruelty of men in all people, regardless of their faith. Some may choose to use their faith to rationalize using violence. My point is, it doesn't matter what we believe, as long as we treat each other well.As to how the film is shot, directed and edited - this is a masterpiece. It starts off a bit slow, but once it gets going it doesn't stop. Scorsese is firing on all cylinders here. The actors, especially Garfield are all perfect and he could probably have received an Oscar nod, had he not already got one for ""Hacksaw Ridge"".Despite its length, this film never got boring and was a real breath of fresh air. I'm really looking forward to Scorsese's next picture.Grade: 9/10. By an atheist Swede.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Score ZERO for Scorsese for this Kurosawa Wantanabe,"Viewers should hail a taxi in hopes that the driver will rescue them from the three plus hours they will lose watching this Kurosawa ""Wantanabe"" film. The photography was great but that did not make up for a topic that was fully explored previously by James Clavelle.To quote Scorsese, ""Cinema is gone."" I should have been gone well before the film completed.Perhaps, competition has been causing TV to improve and the lack of competition, formula movies, special effects, inflated-paid IMDb reviews, robots, and Chinese funding have been working in tandem to destroy the movie going experience.If three hours of Silence was not brutal enough the coming attractions don't augur well for the future.

"To watch Scorsese's Silence is to go through a tough, but beautiful exploration on spirituality","To quote the Bible from the book of Peter 5:10, ""And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast"". It may surprise you that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese wanted to become a priest before he settled on a filmmaking career. While that doesn't say much about him now, it does show that the church was a big part of his life as a youth and makes you wonder about how he sees the world.Martin Scorsese is the one filmmaker from the French New Wave era of movie makers who has managed to remain consistency great. Even his lesser work like Shutter Island is still a very good movie is the least. Scorsese has put his two cents in every genre from family (Hugo), to gangster (Goodfellas), to biopics (The Aviator, The Wolf of Wall Street) and many more. His most controversial film came in the 1980's when he made The Last Temptation of Christ, which was said to be his most personal (and is also a film I love). Silence is his next foray into religion and to holding onto ones belief.In the fifteenth century, jurist priests Sebastiāo Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (played by Adam Driver) receive word that their mentor Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) has committed apostasy in Japan. Christianity has been outlawed in Japan and the Jurists have been trying to change that. Knowing their teacher wouldn't do such an atrocity, ask and get permission to go and find Ferreira. Once they are introduced to Kichijiro, a Japanese fisherman who claims to renounce Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are taken to Japan via boat.In several small villages, Rodrigues and Garupe see that the local Christian population has been driven underground, for the sentence is usually death. Both men ask, but few seem to know who Father Ferreira was. In the meantime, both priests do their best to help the Christians while remaining hidden from the Samurai army. At one point, Kichijiro betrays Rodrigues and has the priest captured. Rodrigues is told by ""the inquisitor"" that Japan has no use for the Catholic Doctrine and that Christian prisoners will continue to be tortured until he too commits apostasy. It is here where he faces a lot of questions about his faith, selflessness, and the nature of humanity.Silence is a movie that Scorsese has wanted to make for decades, and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. This is an example on how to make a great religious movie. Now only is it a story that is never boring, this truly pushes the audience as much as the priests are being pushed for their beliefs. It may be a long movie (nearly clocking in at three hours), it's all intentional for the benefit of feeling just as isolated as out main character.Coincidentally, this happens to be the second religious story for Andrew Garfield this year along with Hacksaw Ridge. However, this also proves that this young man may be one of the finest actors of our generation. All of his moments, from staring at himself in the water to his struggle to step on a Christian picture, all feel earned and never once feel phony.It is beautifully shot and edited as all Scorsese movies are. Something about Silence makes it's clearly large world feel so isolating. It really feels like that your going on a spiritual journey. How you come out in the end is up to you.I'll give this ten pictures of Saint Peter out of ten. Silence is a movie that while maybe not for everyone, is something that I implore every fan of film to check out, even if their not following a religion. This is more then holding onto spirituality; its about your principles and holding out for what you DO believe in. This'll probably be too polarizing for the award season, but this is a work of art that needs to be seen at least once (preferably on the big screen). Silence will hang above you like a cloud for a while like I expect it to do for me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A history lesson,"I just watched today at Netflix a great masterpiece, and the best part of the movie is not the acting, the direction, the themes but the story itself. We follow the paths of two very determined Jesuits who are living in Macau-China, and they volunteer to investigate the disappearing of their former teacher and mentor Father Ferreira in Japan.There are rumors that he abandon his religion, and the two young priests want to see with their own eyes whether its is true or not. Japan is a changed country in the late 17th century, and now being a Christian is considered illegal, and whoever is accused of being Christian is punished by prolonged torture followed by slow and painful death (like crucifixion, drowning, burning, etc).We get the sense that their mission is doomed, but what surprises us and bring us some pleasant moments in this movie, is the positive reception the priests receive from impoverished peasants and fishermen, who lived a life of eternal oppression, and were ready to sacrifice themselves for their Chirstian faith, since it promised hope for a better life after death, in a country with no hope where a few wealthy barons ruled over the starving masses.So the movie focus on the lose-lose situation where the priests are stuck. Their heart says that they need to look for the remaining Chirstians, and keep their faith alive, but this is only bringing death, since the Japanese authorities are destroying every single village visited by the pair, and their mind says they should try to save as many lives as possible, since there will be no disciple left if the murdering spree doesn't stop, but in order to do that, they are blackmailed by the authorities who order them to spit on crosses, and stomp on religious images. The idea is make them role models and use their examples to reconvert people back to Buddhism, which is the only religion allowed.It is a choice between saving lives versus saving souls. They meet their former mentor Father Ferreira, now a Buddhist, who says that it is useless to bring European concepts to Japan, since the power structures would never allow any foreign idea, whether positive or negative, to make an impact in the country.I watched the movie cheering for the main character all the time, even though we know now trough history that they lost the fight (Japan has virtually no Christians, even today), but for a brief time it seemed like a miracle could happen in the Asian nation",10.0,Anonymous,History
Silence and knowing thyself,"Any film director is characterized by his movies. Scorcese is not the exception. Some of his movies are violent, erotic, and filled with history. The movie Silence is a particular one, due that the lack of violence, erotism and the rapid movement of the camera shows us another version of this great director. You may call it an apology of Christianity or a complaint against this religion. But the fact is that this movie shows us when 2 great religions find each other: Budhism and Christianism. Both religions teach peace, but their essence is completely different:Buda is a state where all men can become and then be happy and become one with God Salvation comes with the knowledge of true love to be happy with GodThere is a slight difference in those religions. The movie explains it so well, that it may help you (if you believe) to realize what your religion is about. If you aren't religious then is a cultural knowledge to understand this religions.The movie is about jesuit ""padres"" that go to Japan to evangelize a new and unexplored civilization. After 20 years, the missionaries are being put to death in the most horrid ways ever, for altering the peace and destroying the cultural and religious identity of the country.

Universalist v nationalist religious loyalties,"Before going to watch this movie I had read a lot of reviews and opinions about it. Positive and negative. In Greece where I live the review of the leading daily ""Kathimerini"" was politely and mildly negative. I share an interest in the portrayal of religion and spirituality on film therefore I decided that ""Silence"" was worth seeing. Despite a rather unpromising start mainly because of the vivid depiction of human misery and wretchedness, the story becomes more interesting, the depiction of Japanese society more diversified and you are treated with some superb dialogue between characters embodying different world views.Japanese authorities regard Christianity as a subversive force and a foreign influence threatening the independence of their country. The argument is that Christianity may be good and true for Portugal and Spain but that does not mean that the same can be told for Japan. To this point the hero of the story Jesuit Father Rodriguez answers that something can be true regardless of time and place denying thus relativism and parochialism in religion. If we supplant 17nth century Roman Catholicism with modern day Human Rights we may have a glimpse of the same perennial debate couched in present day terms.I will not enter in more detail so as not to reveal the plot to those not yet familiar with it. Although the setting of the movie is situated in 17nth century Japan and the predicament of Christians there, the questions asked have a far wider significance and resonate to our own times as well. The context is Catholic Christianity but one can ponder to the limits we can go to be steadfast to the beliefs which form the core of our identity. The sufferings people undergo to remain constant to their faith. On the other hand one has to reflect on the right of a culture and a society to safeguard its particularity against what is perceived as onerous foreign influence. Those are not easy questions and the movie does not give easy answers.Images are striking especially those of nature, weather and sea. A feast for the eyes. Dialogue is also top notch specifically concerning issues of truth, religion, tradition and such topics. The actors are very good. The pace is rather slow and the depiction of torture quite disturbing. Misery and wretchedness abound but also wit and conviction.I do not think this movie is a masterpiece but I found many things to be impressed. If your are interested in spiritual issues you should probably watch it. It is boring at times but it is original, brave and special. If such questionings leave you cold then you should think twice before attempting to go....",8.0,Anonymous,History

There are many different interpretations of the meaning behind this movie, and my friends and I have spent hours discussing it.

Just too long.,"This film was not what I expected when going into it, I expected an adventure style film of the two main characters (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) trying to find their friend (Liam Neeson). This is the impression I got from the trailers, it was not that at all. This is a film that is about how people with a faith will not be broken of their faith no matter the circumstances or consequences, and this film shows that with some incredibly powerful and gut wrenching scenes.The visuals in this film are fantastic the location, the cinematography was outstanding this is a great looking movie one of the best looking films of the year, one particular scene that I enjoyed the main character is in a jail cell and the camera is peeking through each gap in the cell to show what is happening outside it was surprisingly effective and just helps to make the scene that much more impactful.The performances of the our two main characters (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) are impeccable, particularly Andrew Garfield he did an amazing job and definitely an Oscar worthy performance by him. Also Liam Neeson was surprisingly good in this film.Now onto the negatives, my biggest problem with this film is its just too long, I found myself thinking this scene is too long and could have been shorter, I also feel as though the pacing is very slow which is okay as long as the scenes are meaningful to the story but a lot of scenes of the film is our main character reliving people of their sins which is okay to show once or twice to show how the people rely on the two characters but, showing it about 10 different times throughout the film makes it at times uninteresting and a little boring. By no means am I saying this is a poorly edited film was I personally thought it was editing very well in general but my biggest problem was the run time and how some of the scenes were a little repetitive at times.Overall I give this film a 9/10, another great film by Martin Scorsese with an incredible plot and outstanding visuals.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A Long, Long, Long, Long, Long Masterpiece.","Martin Scorsese has been trying to make Silence for over 25 years, to call it a passion project does not do it justice. It was while riding a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto on the way to film a cameo in an Akira Kurosawa movie that Scorsese finished the book that his movie would be based on. All of this shortly after he had finished one of his if not his most controversial movie The Last Temptation of Christ. Since then Silence has been through all types of development hell, constantly being pushed back by movies like Gangs of New York, The Avaitor, Shutter Island and The Departed. It was once set to star Daniel Day-Lewis, Benicio del Toro, and Gael García Bernal which just makes me all types of sad that we did not get to see that movie. Silence is finally here, from that 1989 trip to Japan to 2017, Scorsese has gotten to make his ""passion project"" and he has put all he has into it, the good and the bad of the genius that is Martin Scorsese.The story is about two Portuguese Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who learn that their teacher, Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly renounced his faith in public in Japan. The two priests cannot believe such news and travel to Japan to find Father Ferreira and prove that this news is false. Christianity has been outlawed in Japan and is investigated and eliminated by a man called ""the inquisitor"". Upon arriving in Japan, both men are shown how horribly Christians are treated there and go through bouts of lost faith. The movie is very well written, other than the length of the movie which I will get into later. For being such a long movie about a seemingly a bit dull topic these days, it moves very well. Other than a few key scenes the movie is always moving forward, but this is not only because of the writing.Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of his generation, if not all time. His movies have influences countless others and pushed the idea of what movies could be. The master does not slip up in Silence where he puts some of his best work in recent years. The Wolf of Wall Street was incredibly made, but I think Silence is a step ahead when it comes to Scorsese's directing. The movie is presented beautifully, and then we are treated to some astonishingly difficult to watch scenes. There is a level of realism that can only be attained by the best, you are drawn into this world and once you are let out you wont be able to get your mind off it. Scorsese has also always been a director who gets amazing performances out of his actors and Silence is no exception.If there was an acting award that could be given to the cast of a movie as a whole my vote would be for it to go to Silence. Not only is Andrew Garfield putting up the best performance of his career, not only is Adam Driver a strong supporting actor but there were countless Japanese actors in Silence that were absolutely fantastic. Tadanobu Asano as the Japanese interpreter, Yōsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro and Issey Ogata as Inoue Masashige all play key roles and play the hell out of them. This movie is packed full of emotion from some characters, but others take the events with a level of normalcy that must have been difficult to perform as well.My biggest complaint with Silence is the length. 2 hours and 41 minutes is ridiculously long, and I know Mr. Scorsese has earned the right to make his movies as long as he wants, but this movie would surely have been a 9 out of 10 if it were about 20 minutes shorter. Other than that Silence is an incredibly made movie, and maybe the best piece of cinema from 2016. The massive length also kind of adds into the mystique of the movie, and while I found my time to move fairly fast I can see others struggling through it. Silence is also not an easy watch because of some of the intense scenes involving torture, but these were both not very graphically violent and very necessary. Would this movie be better if it had been made in 2009 with del Toro, Bernal and Daniel Day-Lewis I do not know. What I do know is that this one is an amazing movie and a must see for any fan of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece beyond what anyone could imagine,"As far back as I could remember, movies like Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, Fight Club, The Shawshank Redemption, as well as all the many amazing films that I've been blessed with when I was kid. But to me, Goodfellas was the movie that made me want to make movies that inspire, shock, emote, and floor audiences beyond the theater. So the first time when I heard that Martin Scorsese was making a movie about historical Japan based on a book he read even before making Goodfellas. So some time later, the movie was released and I tried to see it in theaters mainly because I thought it was amazing that we still get the chance to see a Martin Scorsese in theaters(seriously think about it, how awesome that is!). Unfortunately I couldn't see it the few theaters that it was in because life is unfair, but that didn't stop me from buying the Blu-Ray, along with Arrival. I even tried to watch it on the biggest TV in my house and then turn off all the lights to replicate the feel of the movie theater.Then I watched it and I got to say, I had no idea what to expect but after letting the film sit with me after a while, I can definitely say that this film is in the same league as the classics that gave Martin Scorsese his status & love for over the 5 decades.The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is pure eye candy for those who crave amazing storytelling, the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is gold standard of how to edit a film, the casting, the production design, just about every single aspect & effort put into this film was beyond worth it. The acting and directing on display is the template I'll be following for movies that I'll hopefully get to make in the future.To me this is a movie that needs to be discussed especially today, not because of how the world is today but for truly understand why we do what do, what does it mean to be human, etc.In the film we get to someone who is at the top of his game but as he progresses down so far, it's just absolutely heartbreaking. I could explain more but you HAVE to watch it for yourself. This is a film that will last forever, and infinitely better than moonlight or La La Land.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of Scorsese's greatest achievements,"How do you follow up a movie about debauchery on Wall Street through the 90s? If you're Martin Scorsese, you make a deeply religious movie adaptation of a Japanese novel about Jesuit priests in feudal Japan, that's how. This was one of three major passion projects that Scorsese held onto for a number of years before finding the funding to make (the other two were The Last Temptation of Christ and Gangs of New York). Originally written with Jay Cocks (and the first Scorsese writing credit on one of his films since Casino) in the early 90s, Scorsese's efforts to get the film made waxed and waned for decades before the independent success of The Wolf of Wall Street allowed him to secure the nearly $50 million to make his film, shooting in Taiwan with two of America's up and coming leading men. The movie's theatrical release was completely botched by Paramount, and one of our greatest filmmaker's greatest films died a quiet box office death.In the 17th century, about a hundred years after St. Francis Xavier introduced Christianity to Japan, the shogunate made Christianity illegal, torturing and killing priests and Christians throughout the land in favor of the native Shinto religion. One priest, Father Ferreira, sent a letter back to the Jesuits at Macau, China, detailing the final extent of the persecution that took years to reach his Christian brothers. Two young priests, Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe, who had Ferreira for a teacher, were to be tasked with the dangerous mission of going to Japan, but the letter and other rumors of Ferreira's apostacy tell their supervisor that their mission is no longer necessary. Their fervor pushes them forward, and they are allowed to go.The Christianity they find in Japan is a scared one. With no priests, the community of Christians left huddle in secret and pray what they can, terrified of anyone outside of their community. Rodrigues and Garupe represent the first rays of light for these people in years, and yet they have no word of Father Ferreira who had settled in Nagasaki, not some small seaside community. Guiding them to the small village and another island off the coast is Kichijiro, a peasant Christian who has repeatedly apostatized to save his own life, most damagingly when he was the only one of his family to do so and he watched them burn alive.Kichijiro is the key to understanding this movie. He goes in and out of the story around Rodrigues, and Rodrigues grows increasingly impatient with him. Kichijiro keeps apostatizing, stepping on fumi-e with religious images in order to free himself from temporal danger manifested by the shogunate. Rodrigues, even as he gets into more and more desperate situations himself, must remain calm and understanding as he hears Kichijiro's confessions, all confessing the same sin over and over again.Rodrigues is almost like a Fellini protagonist in that he's caught between two worlds. As an educated priest, he understands the dogma more than anyone else in the country, but he's also a man with doubts. Those doubts grow as the film progresses. He prays for guidance, for deliverance, and for help, but all he's met with is silence. His lowest point is when he is crouching alone in the wilderness, after watching three of his flock tortured and killed, and he wonders if he's praying to nothing.Rodrigues and Garupe must split up as the shogunate's agent, the Inquisitor, gets closer. Rodrigues runs into Kichijiro who ends up turning Rodrigues in for the three hundred pieces of silver reward. Taken to Nagasaki to face the Inquisitor, the movie becomes a battle of wills, wits, and religions. In prison, comfortable physically and allowed to administer to the captured Christians with him, Rodrigues confronts the Inquisitor. They speak in metaphors back and forth about Christianity as a tree and Japan being unfavorable soil for the tree to take root. Rodrigues feels his faith strengthen, but Kichijiro gets captured, begs for forgiveness yet again, and apostatizes a few days later to save himself again. The Inquisitor has also adopted refined methods for dealing with priests.It's not about torturing the priests themselves. That makes them stronger in their faith and spreads the words of their martyrdom. No, he doesn't physically torture the priests, he tortures their followers. The irony of Rodrigues is that he begs his followers to apostatize to save themselves, but he can't bring himself to apostatize to save them. The worst part is when Father Ferreira appears. The rumors were true, he apostatized, took a Japanese wife, and is writing works in Japanese about the folly and untruth of Christianity. The sight of his mentor turning into such a disgrace crushes Rodrigues, but Ferreira's future is Rodrigues' own. As Rodrigues watches five fellow Christians hung upside down with slits in their neck so blood doesn't pool in their heads, all five of whom have already apostatized but are only being tortured for his sake, Rodrigues finally hears the voice of God, breaking the silence that has tortured him. The fumi-e of Christ speaks to him, begging him to step on him to save himself and his followers, which Rodrigues does.So, what's the point of all this? Is this saying that Christianity was wrong to enter Japan and disrupt Shinto's hold on the people because the Christians lose in the end? I've read that take, and it's such a wrongheaded take that I just can't believe someone would make it. No, this isn't a Christianity versus Shinto fight, this is tied to the dual journeys of Rodrigues and Kichijiro. Kichijiro keeps failing to live up to the Christian ideal, even as those around him, just as poor and normal as himself, rise up to the rank of martyrs for the faith. In a similar way, Rodrigues apostatized, he failed his faith, in order to save not himself but the innocents of his flock. Are Kichijiro and Rodrigues bad people because they failed? Are we all bad people because we are continuously guilty of the same sins again and again, because we fail to rise to the status of saints? The movie's final shot, an addition to the story not in the novel, shows a crudely made crucifix in Rodrigues' hand in his coffin, hidden there by his wife and originally made by one of the villagers from the beginning of the movie. The point that Kichijiro's final confession years after the main action of the film and the crucifix is that no matter how many times we fall, as long as we earnestly ask for forgiveness God will offer us absolution.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's about oppression, torture, faith, and death, but it's one of the most compelling visions I've seen. In a filmography as deep, varied, and fantastic as Martin Scorsese's, this stands out as one of his crowning achievements. He pulled career best performances from Andrew Garfield as Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Garupe. Issey Ogata as the Inquisitor is amazingly physical, reptilian, and overbearing. Yosuke Kubozuka is broken and earnest as Kichijiro. Liam Neeson carries a deep seeded fear underneath every word as Ferreira, perhaps hiding his true intentions and fidelity to Jesus despite his façade. The soundtrack is almost entirely nature sounds of ocean waves, wind in trees, and birds, a marked contrast to the use of diagetic music that defines Scorsese's career. The quiet power of the entire package is potent and lasting. That this movie was so mishandled by the distributor saddens me. This deserved a more educated rollout, not being dumped in theaters right before Christmas with nary a marketing budget to do much of anything.This is a triumph of a film. An emotionally wrenching piece of cinema asking hard questions of its characters and its audience about their goodness in times of crisis. As Kichijiro says, ""Years ago, I could have died a good Christian. There was no persecution. Why was I born now? This is so unfair.""I adore this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Not going to be 'popular' in the multiplexes but a profound and wonderful film that transcends times, fashions, everything really. This film doesn't beg to please the audience but asks the audience to listen to the deep silence that transcends all thoughts and words, the Silence of the title is not an easy option but an eternal consent, a 'yes' to paradox, it does not judge, it does not condemn, it is and can easily be denied and dismissed, but it won't go away, a film that says 'yes' but admits that it won't be for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence,"From this reviewer's view point as an agnostic, the excruciating question of religious faith, or in fact, any form of belief, is so rigorously emphasized on a person's exterior conduct, but since our ""real"" thoughts can only be accessed by ourselves (or the Almighty, if he exists), thus, what is the big fuss if a Christian steps or spit on Jesus' effigy, which doesn't necessarily means he apostatizes, because he is the only person who knows about his faith, and if he chooses keeping one's faith intact inwardly and truly, he is still a good Christian in every respect, not to mention in doing so, he can save innocent lives. That's one tough lesson learned by the young Father Rodrigues (Garfield) in Martin Scorsese's passion project SILENCE.Stuck in pre-production limbo for ages, SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence, majorly shot in Taiwan as a surrogate of Japan, it is a tortuous crucible for the two Portuguese Jesuit priests Rodrigues and Garupe (Driver, galvanized with astonishing physical transformation in his latter scenes), to assume their duties in a Christianity-persecuting Japan in the 17th century, with a covert mission to find out what has happened to their mentor Father Ferreira (Neeson), who has been propagating gospel in Japan for over 15 years, but the recent tiding says he has renounced his faith after succumbing to the torture from Japanese authorities.Breathtaking cinematography is a default attraction borne out of its exotic locale, and SILENCE doesn't disappoint from DP Rodrigo Prieto, who is landed with the film's sole Oscar nomination, luxuriant mountains, inclement weather, decrepit villages, grim shorelines, Stygian and foggy night sailing, are the visual accoutrements of the priests and their poverty-ridden believers' trials and tribulations. Unavoidably, glancing exclusively through a westerner's eyes, there is no excuse of Japanese government's high-handed cruelty towards those wretched citizens, which Scorsese doesn't flinch from presenting with explicitness, and one might argue at certain point, this monotonous practice almost shades into a religious torture porn - the opprobrium which Mel Gibson's astronomically lucrative THE PASSION OF THE Christ (2004) once notoriously received, it turns out, when wrestling with contentious religious topics, not much one can do to avoid being curtained by personal angles, whether you are the populist Gibson, or a more cinema-savvy Scorsese. (Coincidentally, Garfield is the star of both SILENCE and Gibson's HACKSAW RIDGE 2016, comparing their orbit in the past Awards season, it shows that the populace does plump for the less thornier one, even it is too on-the-nose in its thudding message).Here, the message is more opaque, after Rodrigues' meandering faith-clinging-and-violence- witnessing struggle comes to a halt when Ferreira appears in front of his eyes, Rodrigues' final capitulation shows up his own shortcoming: he yens for dying as a martyr, like J.C. before him, he can endure any corporeal affliction for higher goals, because he wants to believe he is the chosen one here on earth like the former (when he sees J.C.'s image in his own reflection), so what devastates him is that he is exempted from physical crucifixion, alternatively, the devious Japanese inquisitor Inoue Masashige, played by Ogata with affectedly slippery, inflicts him with the burden and responsibility of the sorry ends of other God-botherers, that stratagem effectively dashes Rodrigues' high-minded illusion and degrades him as a mere mortal, and ultimately he makes the choice as any sensible human would do under that circumstances, and in due time, makes peace with his religion in the closing scene penetrated by a textually surreal shot, when all is said and done, as amorphous and exclusive as one's own faith is, still, Scorsese needs a token to vouchsafe his reckoning - the little cross. So, my take of this film is less trenchant a testing ground of how one can sustain his faith when facing appalling adversity than a finger-wagging to our nature's innate egoism, superiority and self-righteousness, after all, humility is and will always be the linchpin of human race, it is the only way to reach one's peaceful niche and immune to the omnipresent vice.Garfield takes up another formidable gauntlet and sinks his teeth into a deep-dish tormented character, stoutly embodied with anguish, doubt, obstinacy, disillusion with a shade of dewy-eyed callowness, as for Neeson, he leaves a more neutral tinge of ambiguity in a much hyped character, meanwhile the Japanese cast is purely adornments, more often than not, teetering on the brink of one-note (Asano) or repugnance (Kubozuka).The losing battle is the self-aware religion debate, which encompasses the big chunk of the conversations between two conflicted denominations, but accentuating God's silence, which de facto is religion's most overt attribute, as the clincher of the central story (God has always been, and hopefully will always be remaining in silence, so why would that be a matter of contest to his faithful disciple at any rate? Wouldn't it be a proviso which every intake has to accept before taking one's vow?), takes some shine of this film's profoundness and empathy. It is a hard-sell, but if Scorsese can't pull if off, one might wonder who else in Hollywood can?",8.0,Anonymous,History

Silence the sound of the faith,"In 2016 Martin Scorsese produces, writes and directs a film that was completely snubbed by both the public at the box office and the Academy Awards, despite the discrete criticism it has received.
Silence cost 46 million dollars and earns only 7 at the American box office, a film that certainly deserved greater consideration but the duration of 2 hours and 40 certainly did not favor it.
A really long time for a film with a very challenging plot, taken from the novel of the same name, which is however managed impeccably, so much so that time runs without this being felt, thanks to a great atmosphere that makes immediate the immersion in the film by the viewer.
Of course the plot, and it can be seen even just seeing the dimensions of the book from which it is taken, is very diluted but this does not affect at all because in the most static moments, silent or anyway in which the story suffers a slight arrest, the viewer can enjoy the magnificent artistic component that makes ""Silence"" a real painting to be admired constantly.
Thanks to a cinematography that is able to cleverly exploit the light and colors that enhance the fascinating and evocative scenographies that are the background to a story that otherwise could have been uninteresting.
Admirable Scorsese's ability to make the whole film a great testimony of the Christian Church accessible and appreciable even by those who, like the undersigned, do not share its ideals but nevertheless can not remain charmed, almost envious, for the protagonists of the story paintings with great respect and admiration by the director himself.
A directing from a technical point of view that is simply perfect, with intelligent camera angles and movements and extremely functional long shots, but what is missing is a greater thrust on emotions and feelings that are represented but that can not pierce the screen, probably also because of the script, obviously pretentious and introspective (positive aspects for this type of film), but that fails to excite as much as a story like this could have done, perhaps even for some slightly predictable steps and some redundancies avoidable.
This is also due to the somewhat restrained interpretations, almost detached by Adam Driver, which I found subdued, and by Liam Neeson who could have given much more. While Andrew Garfield confirms his great talent again giving body and soul to a role that is anything but simple to interpret.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The supremacy of Silence,"Sometimes, silence can be the most powerful scream. This is the case for Martin Scorsese's latest motion picture, in which silence figuratively expresses the real essence of the film. Developing this project in his mind for over 25 years, the legendary director has recently released what I consider to be his most powerful, self-reflective, and personal masterpiece: Silence. Behind the extensively protracted production of this movie, lies Scorsese's reluctance in embracing such an influential story – an outright spiritual journey. Raised in a strictly catholic environment, the American iconic director always had a special reverence towards religion, humbly asserting it in the majority of his works, from Mean Streets (1977) to The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). However, in Silence, the director does not employ faith to enrich the allusions and implications of his films, but rather he openly questions it, in a way that could seem disrespectful and hypocritical towards his mystical belief. One of the main characteristics of the film is its lack of soundtrack, echoing the title's significance. A cinematic silence that unequivocally joins and mirrors the main theme of the motion picture: the silence left by God. A silence that Father Rodrigues – a 17th century, young Jesuit priest sent to Japan in search for his mentor – struggles with, and refuses to accept. Alternating astonishing exotic panoramas to harsh, violent torture sequences, the movie indulges in deep philosophical reflections about the figure of God, his indifference towards human beings, and his diversity among other cultures¬; a God that assumes many shapes, that embodies the concepts of vanity, of redemption, of sacrifice and of salvation, while manifesting his omnipotence through the perpetuating silence. Father Rodrigues identifies himself with Jesus Christ because of the agony that they both had to suffer in their lives in order to spread the Christian faith, resulting in a form of narcissism. At the same time, the Japanese people that embrace the Catholicism brought by the missionaries, are actually gripping to their only glimpse of hope, merely conceiving God as a material advantage rather than a spiritual entity. Therefore, Silence, rather than being a film questioning religion, is more a reflection upon the human interpretations of it. It traces the steps of Apocalypse Now (1979), presenting a ""soldier"" in a hostile Asiatic location in search of an obscure mentor who has abandoned his ideology, embracing the enemy's, and constructing a mystical aura around his persona. The ""colonel Kurtz"" of Silence is Father Ferreira, played by a charming Liam Neeson, a disenchanted priest that apostatized in favor of Buddhism. For Rodrigues, Ferreira used to be a pillar, the personification of faith, and his apostasy inevitably crumbles the young priest's belief. Scorsese's choice of casting Neeson is not casual, of course, because during his career, the actor has already portrayed the figure of a strong, righteous priest, both in Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and in Mission (1986), as a missionary who prefers to die rather than renounce to God. Therefore, Scorsese was confident that Neeson would have been a familiar, 'trusted' priest for the majority of the viewers. Just as Sergio Leone did in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) with actor Henry Fonda, Scorsese reversed the archetype, from positive to negative, from staunch to unfaithful, generating a sense of confusion in the audience, that parallels Father Rodrigues' chaotic uncertainties. Another interesting characteristic to consider, is that Silence follows what I like to call the ""Scorsese pattern"": a very detailed, slow opening, that in its greatness does not necessarily drive the plot forward, focusing more on shaping the characters, and an extremely quick ending, that summarizes lengthy periods of time, often several years, in a few minutes. Moreover, the protagonist starts from nothing, throughout the film he reaches his peak, and then he dramatically falls down, in an unsatisfying dissolution. This pattern can be seen in most of the director's films, such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street and Casino. In the end, the disenchanted protagonists don't necessarily lose everything, but they are far from the pedestal where they used to reside, now nostalgically conformed to normality. In my opinion, Silence deserves to be remembered among the director's greatest accomplishments. In this occasion, he exploits cinema to explore his intimate anxieties on religion, and if Scorsese considers cinema sacred, almost a religion itself, he definitively managed to became the patron saint of it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Unbelievably good Christian film,"Unbelievably good Christian film. I find myself trying to do so without any sort of revelation of my own personal beliefs, and it is difficult. If this were any other character besides Jesus, I'd be simply complaining that I didn't identify or feel any sympathy with the main character, and, consequentially, the suffering and the sacrifice's impact are lessened, and the movie suffers for it. But this is about Christians who endured horrific persecution because of their beliefs. Not unlike Christians today who endure persecution from the secular crowd who will one day be ushered into eternal darkness forever. Sobering. I speculate that Scoreses was not interested in humanizing the Japanese, though. The film does not sermonize its message, but simply documents it. If this is what Scoreses intended to do, then he succeded with aplomb.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Silence so often succeeds but its runtime is a huge weakness too difficult to ignore,"Silence is an admirable piece of film-making that will, for many, demonstrate exactly what Martin Scorsese is at the very top of his field and why Andrew Garfield is one of the strongest actors of his generation. It's consideration of such dark, poignant themes and ideas (namely, the silence of God when people need him the most and the importance and dangers of an unwavering faith and reliance on one figure) is profound and very often moving, which contrasted with the brutality of the torture scenes, works on an effective but very uncomfortable level well. The opening scene, with the calmness of Liam Neeson narration in comparison to the brutality and discomfort of the torture being displayed, sets the film off on a strong footing, with some of the film's best work contained in this sequence. The final image is equally as powerful in its message (holding on to your faith) but a lot of the material in between weakens some of the impact. I completely understand the need for the film's runtime, eking out the journey and telling the story in as much detail as it deserves and I while admire the work and talent of Scorsese, it doesn't mean I have to love it and quite frankly, I didn't. Maybe, like some have suggested, I will look back at this more fondly than just a couple of hours after enduring it, but for the time being the film's biggest weakness is a little too deafening and difficult to overlook.FULL REVIEW: goo.gl/IkFgZB",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Harrowing Journey,"First and foremost, I want to say that this is one of the most faithful adaptions I've ever seen come to screen (though, surprisingly, the film ends with a little more hope). Scorsese recreates scenes perfectly, pulling in recurring images from the novel, whole lines of dialogue, but most importantly, the themes that permeate slowly, simmering through this boiling caldron of a film. This film is not fast paced; it builds slowly towards a depressing ending, much like the tide slowly coming in to drown the Christians tied to the crosses on the beach. The hope we find here is faint and far away, because the themes it deals with are some of the harder ones we as Christians have to deal with, particularly facing persecution while dealing with the distance of God.
This film is grueling and hard to watch, but purposefully so. I would argue that this is one of the most important Christian films ever made, but, sadly, the R rating will turn a lot of Christian viewers away. If you can get past the brutality of this movie, the rewards you will reap will be worth it. We, as Christians today, don't face the same persecution that these people did hundreds of years ago, but there are still moments of trial in each of our lives. All of us must wrestle with the distance of God, and why he allows certain things to happen in our own way. Know that God is still there, even if it sometimes seems like he's so far away.
Have faith, brothers and sisters.

'Silence' could use a good dose of it's title,"'Silence' could use a good dose of it's title. Scorsese smothers his film with unnecessary, repetitive narration. Powerful imagery, what little there is, is obscured by a narrator constantly telling you what just happened, often over and over again. There's no better example of this than the very start of the film. In a gruesome example of the Japanese assault on Christian theology, a group of Catholic priests are tortured and killed. What should be a powerful scene setting the stage for the rest of the film is blunted by a torrent of emotionally disconnected narration out of sync with the events on screen. Not since Blade Runner has narration marred a film so thoroughly. Scorsese has talked about struggling with how to realize the film's big moment at the end.

How can God remain silent in the face of such atrocities. I am sure that there can also be many different answers to this question but it certainly makes you think about your own convictions.Besides bringing praise to Martin Scorsese, I personally think that Andrew Garfield acted his heart out in this one.

Liam Neeson's character was beaten down and broken and he succumbed, but that doesn't mean the real person lost faith. The main Jesuit did not lose faith either because he would not have risked his very life, nor the safety, well-being, and life of his family to keep his cross all those years.

Grueling,"I liked, immensely, Quo Vadis, the Robe, Salmson and Delhila, Last Temptation of Christ (great Scorcese movie)...Passion of Christ and Silence was a romp in blood, torture and tedious long movies by 2 struggling Catholics trying to find their way. No mention in this movie about 'The Inquisition(s)by the Catholic Church. The attention to the costumes, language, land and Japanese culture was wonderful but the tedious length of the movie and 2hrs 40minutes of torture and philosophical mumbo jumbo is too much. Trite is the one word that comes to mind. Liam Neeson wasn't in the film but a few minutes and beginning and end and he was poorly cast and didn't pull off the role he was playing. I think this is the worst show Scorcese has done and i see no reason for a high rating. Christianity, as of 2010 is the largest religion in the world but it doesn't mean it's the best. There are so many Catholic clergy trying to spread the word to the defenseless, gullible people no wonder it's Christianity is the largest. In the USA 50% are Christian and 50% of Christians are Catholic. Neeson's statements about the Japanese believing the actual sun was believed to be the Son of God is specious and , if so , so what. That is no reason to go into a Buddhist culture and pressure them to see your way. Those or just philosophical statements referring to Silence. But, the main dislike for this show is the needless, constant, boring, ho hum torturing during the whole show. Gibson and Scorcese like blood a flowing. I think Mel Gibson was brutally beaten within an inch of his life and i think Passion of Christ was his way of alleviating some of the pain of the past. I agree with another critic here that the show would , most likely , never be made if it weren't for the famous director. I don't understand people's rating this high.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Unorthodoxically artistic,"Silence is a quite ambitious project by star director Martin Scorsese and it isn't a surprise that this film has failed at the box office. It is particularly long with a running time of one hundred sixty-one minutes. The topic of Jesuits resisting persecution in feudal Japan is quite unusual. Aside of Liam Neeson, who only has about ten minutes of screen time, the movie focuses on rather unknown actors. Still, Silence is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. It's obvious that he cared about this film and wanted to make it something special, regardless of grossing numbers.On the positive side, Silence grabs your attention with a topic that hasn't been treated much and might even be unknown to most audiences. Following the struggles of two Jesuits in feudal Japan who try to spread hope to the few isolated Christian communities while trying to find their mentor who hasn't come home from a mission almost feels like watching an elaborate documentary. The movie is historically authentic, includes fitting costumes and landscapes and exposes us to Japanese and Portuguese customs.Secondly, the acting performances in this movie are absolutely stellar. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver have good chemistry and convince as initially motivated Jesuits whose faith is severely tested in their quest for survival. The supporting actors are also quite convincing from a resilient, old and clever inquisitor to a disillusioned, insisting and rational convert.Thirdly, the movie has a quite sinister atmosphere that fits the serious topics. This is supported by the rural landscapes since most of this movie either takes place on the raw coasts of Southern Japan, the wild forests of several Japanese islands and the muddy city of Nagasaki where it always seems to rain. The dark lighting techniques, the gloomy soundtrack and the use of moments of tense silence also contribute to a very artistic, detailed and epic movie.On the negative side, the film is obviously quite long. I didn't get bored at any time because I found the topic so fascinating but I have to admit that some scenes are somewhat redundant or repetitive. If you are looking for a movie with vivid action sequences, numerous different locations and long-winded dialogues, you won't get any of it. This movie is slow-paced, precise and atmospheric and tries to transmit a desperate vibe instead of quirky entertainment.The ending of the movie blends in very well with the rest of the film and I liked it but it's quite unorthodox and maybe even unexpected by Hollywood standards.To keep it short, it's great to see that renowned directors like Martin Scorsese still aspire to experiment in the autumn years of their careers. Silence is refreshingly different and unique from any other Hollywood production of recent memory. It has a unique topic, great acting performances and an intense atmosphere. If you are a viewer with an interest in historical topics who likes to think outside the box, you're probably going to appreciate Silence as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Faith vs Belief,"Silence is one of the best pictures directed by Martin Scorsese. It's very well shot in the country side of Japan as well as the city of Nagasaki. The 17th century ambiance is created with great production design values.Main story of the movie is about the Christianity vs Buddhism. However the spirit of the movie depicts the human triumph of ultimate faith in God.Screenplay written by Martin and others is gripping and keeps the viewers at the edge of their seats. Though the length of the movie is 2 hour 40 minutes, not a single scene is boring. This time Martin chose a story that he can direct with the best of his capabilities and indeed he delivers the goods with an unflinching dedication.The lead actor Andrew Garfield has acted profoundly well and the brief but significant appearance by Liam Neeson gives the movie a matured look. The Japanese actors are to be appreciated due to their fantastic support as the 95 percent of the movie is shot in Japan.The movie is based on a book depicting a real story that took place around 1670 AD in Japan where two Portuguese Catholic missionaries set sail to Japan in search of their mentor who went to Japan for spreading the Catholicism there but got converted to Buddhism by Japanese. After reaching Japanese shores, they find out that the situation in Japan is dangerous for the Christians as the Catholicism was outlawed and the Japanese inquisitor is making all of the Christians in Japan to give up their faith in Jesus by making them stepping on Jesus' idol and surrender themselves or be tortured and die. It's not just about the conflicts between religious beliefs of people belonging to different geographical places, but the testing of the faith itself. How the faith leads the victory makes the crux of the story.I enjoyed this movie better than Martin Scorsese's previous movies like The Departed, The Aviator, Shutter Island, and old movies like Raging Bull, Casino, Good Fellas. After making a long list of movies with Leonardo DiCaprio, and waiting for 4 years after The Wolf of Wall Street, he comes up with a new star-cast (No Leo!) in this movie which gives a fresh feeling.As the tagline suggests, sometimes silence is the deadliest sound, one can only hear God in the Silence.

Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciaran Hinds)Martin Scorsese is in constant motion about faith, with his newest film, a serious upgrade on the subjects from Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ. He explores the suffering of Jesuit father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) in 17th century Japan.It's pretty simple: The Japanese, devout Buddhists, are expunging Christians, with emphasis on Jesuit priests. Only two of those left, one Father Rod, the other Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). The latter has caved (apostatized); Rod is hanging on. Garfield is not the best choice for a dynamic hero given that Scorsese has previously used, for instance, Robert De Niro.We're hanging for almost three hours of Mel-Gibson-like torture to get remaining Christians to be apostates. Until Father Ferara re-enters to confront Fr. Rod, nothing interesting intellectually happens; it's pretty much how much you can endure watching people seared in hot water, beheaded, and whatever.Where Scorsese scores mostly is the confrontation between physical and spiritual survival. At some point, it's easy to understand how anyone of faith could disavow it given the power of torture and the uncertainty of care on the part of Jesus.If Scorsese is also commenting on the current state of water boarding, because there is a mash up of crucifixion and drowning, then he succeeds in making the argument that torture is effective. But believe me, this film tackles the effects of pain and not the nuances of faith or why anyone would sacrifice lives for a dream of heaven unsubstantiated by scientific truths.Secondarily, Silence is not silent on the clash between cultures, which pits a deeply ingrained religion against an invading one. Japan is likened to a swamp that cannot support roots, i.e., a foreign religion like Catholicism. As it turns out in old Japan, it can't.As for the rest of us, no one of faith can escape the lingering doubts: ""I pray but I am lost. Am I just praying to silence?""

"Eerily fantastic, explores a heavy subject matter in its rawest form","Silence was eerily fantastic. Based on the 1966 novel by Shusaku Endo, it explores a very heavy subject matter and does so in its rawest form. Set in 17th century Japan, two Catholic priests, Fathers Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver), begin their journey to find their missing mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). At the time, Christians in Japan were under severe persecution by the Shogunate and many went into hiding to avoid torture and execution. Director Martin Scorsese tells the story in a very unique way. He lets the audience witness the grim details of the physical and mental suffering the Christians endure through from the very first frame. It is very difficult and uncomfortable to watch, and that dreadful feeling lingers and persists during the entire film.What's really fascinating about this film is that Scorsese built the film around the theme of Silence. There is no music in the film in the traditional sense. The score (Kathryn Kluge and Kim Allen Kluge) comprises almost entirely of insect noises and chirping of birds. The audience, like Rodriguez and Garrpe, are left vulnerable and there is nothing to distract us from the brutality that is being depicted. Darkness is a common theme here, both figuratively and literally. Many scenes are set at night, or in a hidden hut lit by candlelight, with people talking in fearful whispers.If we dig deeper, Scorsese presents many 'Why' questions around God's silence to the Christians' sufferings and it doesn't readily divulge the answers. The viewers mainly follow and see things through Garfield's perspective (quite literally through Rodrigo Prieto's brilliant cinematography) and after being part of what he goes through, we are compelled to raise the same doubts and questions as him – questions such as: What is faith? What is strength? Should you deny God to save others? Like him, the audience's willpower is chipped away little by little as the film progresses, and I could feel myself approaching my breaking point too.The film does tone down past the half way point, with its intensity dissolving slightly. Or was this because we are somewhat used to the violence at that point? The screenplay spends the majority of the film dissecting and delving into Garfield's emotional realm. They do this slowly and painfully, and for the viewers, it could feel a little wearisome. I found though, that this was all part of the process. Scorsese was merely preparing us for the much anticipated encounter between two central characters in the climax. By that point, it is easy to be fully engrossed in the conversation, and it is powerfully sincere and heartbreaking, as we could understand both characters' thoughts and motivations.After his exceptional performance in Hacksaw Ridge, Garfield gives another heartfelt performance here. Neeson's role as a mentor reminded me of his character as Qui-Gon, with his quiet maturity and perceived respectability and wisdom. Even with their limited screen time, the Japanese actors, in particular Issei Ogata as the Inquisitor Inoue and Yosuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro are incredibly memorable. Inoue's creepy voice would stay with me for a long time to come.Scorsese' Silence deliberately uses silence to punctuate its impact. It puts you through trials and tribulations and when you finally absorb everything, you'll feel extremely sick. At almost three hours running time, it is long and it takes a fair degree of patience and resilience to sit through. Regardless of Scorsese's intentions and what his message is, this film forces you to be in touch with your humanity and that's in my opinion, achieved brilliantly.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Outside its technical and artistic sense, Silence is both an examination and antithesis on faith and spirituality.","28 years - That's how long director Martin Scorsese took to conceive this film. Based on a 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō, a Japanese author inspired by Christian dogma, ""Silence"" marks the 75- year-old director's 25th feature film in a career spanning half a century. It's a passion project and every great filmmaker has at least one of these films that take a considerable amount of time to produce. For this reason and more, ""Silence"" has the potential to be Scorsese's magnum opus but only time will tell if this film reaches that level of reverence. It is a powerful film and an important one too as an epic reiteration of the persecution of Christians in 17th century Japan; Important, because discrimination against one's beliefs exists today as it has throughout history. The existence of God, and whether religion is flawed has not only been the subject of debate for centuries but also the cause of several genocides that have resulted in the massacre of millions. Using this argument and based on an actual event as chronicled by Endō, ""Silence"" is an examination into questions relating to faith, spirituality, and atonement.In broadening the scope of these questions, we follow the journey of Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) from Portugal to Japan to find their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is reported to have been tortured into renouncing his faith. This is a time when most of Japan is still under feudal law where villages are governed by unflinching Samurai lords (chillingly represented by Japanese actor Issei Ogata). They take on the role of 'inquisitors' who capture and torture Christians in the belief that no religion can take root in Japan simply because religion and its doctrines are manmade, whereas true spirituality can only come from nature. In witnessing unspeakable torture exerted on other Christians, Rodrigues prepares for martyrdom but his captors have a cruel plan in place – commit apostasy by openly rejecting his faith, or watch an entire village put to death by refusing to do so. Worse still, all his fervent prayers for deliverance are met with silence.With a run time of 160 minutes, it's a sluggish film to get through and it isn't for everyone either. It's also an unusual narrative given the director's affection for epic crime films. But Scorsese is onto something profound because at the heart of the film are bold and provocative questions on theology and our finite understanding on something as infinite as creation itself. This is reserved for the third act when Neeson's character surfaces with some very logical statements on divinity that even staunch Catholics will find taxing to digest. This is the strongest part of the film and yet, Scorsese's broad strokes aren't about good versus evil, and violence though hellish, is not about hatred inflicted by one religion on another. Although the film's climactic moment is whether Rodrigues apostatises his faith, the conclusion demands psychological insight into the boundless characteristics of love, where sacrifice is at the pinnacle of a triangular relationship between love and loss. In a way this is a paradox embedded in a complex narrative but one that might require multiple viewings to fully understand the inner conflicts associated with the solitary nature of silence.The use of that silence is a little too literal in the film too, with barely any soundtrack or background music. Without which, scenes that convey emotional gravitas loses some of that intensity. There are also issues with accents that feel out of place, yet none of these quibbles stack up to Scorsese's grand fresco of an age old battle between man and his own worst enemy – his soul. After all, Scorsese himself once studied to be a priest but somewhere along those 50 years as a filmmaker, lost his soul to cinema. And judging from the austerity of this film, that's a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Christianity and human nature from another POV,"I would say that with Silence Scorsese stepped out of his zone and tried to accomplish something different from his other movies. I think he succeeded with this attempt. The movie points us to Japan in 17th century where Jesuits are facing some major problems with Christianity and the local authority. It just makes you wonder about various aspects of Christianity, religion itself, human nature and traits of respect for others. The surroundings and the scenery of the picture are breath-taking and wonderful. It really helps to feel the emotions that Scorsese wanted to set. Andrew Garfield did a marvelous job with his character, you can relive the emotions and the spirituality just by looking at Rodrigues's face.

'Silence' Flourishes With Respect and Martin Scorsese's Ultimate Legacy,"Martin Scorsese has been a master of his craft for decades. It's hard not to consider him our single finest director working today. With films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" and now his newest endeavor ""Silence,"" we must now relish with the fact that we are witnessing a grand master of sorts working right in front of our eyes. History has remembered ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Vertigo."" These were two films not wholeheartedly recognized as masterpieces of their time. History now, however, will remember ""Silence,"" a marvelous and inspiring cinematic experience not to be forgotten.""Silence"" tells the story of two Jesuit priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver), who in the seventeenth century, face violence and persecution when they travel to Japan to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson), and propagate Catholicism.""Silence"" is Scorsese's most personal and beautiful film of his modern career. Labeling it just a ""passion project"" does it no justice. It has etched out a new avenue in which we can explore film forever. He has explored some of the most enigmatic themes in film, whether it be about revenge, family or a general exercise to push the boundaries of the medium.With ""Silence,"" he writes his most heartaching letter yet. There are filmmakers who are quickly trapped into the corner of ""indulgence"" when taking on a production this personal to them. Scorsese gets into the trenches of the story, mysteriously performing his own deconstruction of his faith and what it has meant to him. You can't ask a director to be more involved in the house of his film. He builds the foundation, drawing from the soul of his spiritual ancestors, and gives them his most devoted respect. Scorsese gives the viewer the weight of the message and lets it rest upon us. We are desperately and quietly screaming for justice, in a land that isn't allowing such things. Simply put, it's awe-inspiring.Andrew Garfield is divinely spectacular. With a year that has included another strong turn in ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" Garfield has shown himself to be one of the next generation's most gifted thespians. Adam Driver's vulnerability has never been matched in all his previous roles. He becomes the audience's spokesperson of doubt and logic, as Scorsese and writer Jay Cocks make him our voice of reason in a rich and layered dynamic.Issey Ogata is one of the year's vivid findings. Acting as the ""Hans Landa"" of Catholic persecution, Ogata's Inquisitor Inoue nearly reinvents the spiritual nature of the film, stealing every scene he shares with another actor. It's been 32 years since Haing S. Ngor won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for ""The Killing Fields"" and it's about time the Academy rewards a deserving Asian actor. With Ogata, a new Supporting Actor contender has emerged. Liam Neeson's work, though integral to the story, is a bit too brief to make a lasting impact.It's easy to write ""masterpiece"" for a film, and let it be generally understood by the casual movie-goer that reads it. The word left by itself doesn't fully explain the film's technical mastery. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Thelma Schoonmaker are masters of their crafts. Prieto frames the film to utter perfection, utilizing fog and blue-grey hues to capture the film's undying message of faith. Schoonmaker lets the story evolve into a construction of time, allowing the viewer to feel the ""weight"" of the ""waiting.""""Silence"" is epic, poignant and inventive. It must be said: As someone who was raised Catholic, used to be a high school religion teacher, and had his own personal qualms with his Lord and Savior, ""Silence"" spoke to me in a way I was not anticipating. I do recognize that there could be a large portion of the world, especially those who don't have strong feelings about any Christian religion, that may not be fully invested in the weight of its message. Scorsese set out to make a film about the ecstasy of one's own faith.How much do you value it? Why are there others so thirsty and hungry for its divine meanings and teachings? These are just two of many questions that the film dares to ask, and you really don't get the clear answer you may be searching for. For a select group, it could infuriate you, for others, it was just the tip of the iceberg of the glacier that lies beneath.The language of cinema is universal. The frames tell everything you need it to. Without words, a single image can change the world. What if ""Silence"" was a silent film? What would that have offered in its quest for answers? It's remarkably creative, and on the surface, you can say it's repetitive in what it displays to the viewer. The continuous striking of faith beats you down, submitting to the film's own moral compass, and developing a new wave of art that we have only dreamed.""Silence"" is imperative to our landscape. It is the crown jewel of Martin Scorsese's modern career, and in time, could be the defining film that history will use to represent him – his magnum opus.Grade: (★★★★)",10.0,Anonymous,History

Kurosawa Tribute,"This movie feels like a love letter to classic Kurosawa movie making and I think Scorcese nails it. There's a bit of Tarkovsky in the storytelling as instead of feeling sympathy towards the heroes and malevolence towards the villains, you end up with a sense of indifference and a reminder that not every villain is evil.The movies biggest flaw is probably the lack of direction at times, yet I am unsure how deliberate this was by the filmmakers. As an obvious homage to Kurosawa and a possible one to Tarkovsky I enjoy this method of storytelling. It allows the viewer to interpret the story themselves, rather than saturating the movie with needless exposition and dialogue to reinforce a point.Sure, this isn't Goodfellas, but instead its a total different direction for Scorcese to tell a story and I think this film is beautiful.

What Was Scorcese Thinking?,"There used to be 200,000 Christians in Japan. In the seventeenth century, the Buddhist shogunate decided to eliminate them. Christians were tortured, starved, crucified, and wiped out by the Buddhists. Thank heaven Buddhism is such a tolerant religion. Otherwise it would be terrible to think what might have happened.Martin Scorcese's film ""Silence"" depicts a slice of this history. Two priests, played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, travel to Japan seeking to learn the fate of their fellow priest, played by Liam Neeson. Japanese Christians rush to the priests, eager to receive the sacraments of communion and confession.The priests are set upon by Japanese Buddhists who starve and torture them. Occasionally there is some flapdoodle dialogue about whether or not Christianity belongs in Japan. You will receive no spiritual insights from this dialogue. It is lifeless and uninteresting. Ask any college sophomore to talk to you about Buddhism and Christianity and you will be more intrigued.The movie is very slow. Events are depicted almost in real time, with no editing. As one reviewer said, ""the movie starts in the 1500s and never ends."" The torture is graphic and grotesque. There are decapitations, crucifixions, and drownings. The ending won't surprise anyone. The priests have no power. They are surrounded by people who are not only eager to torture them, but also to torture other people. The Buddhists tell the Christians, ""We will only stop torturing these innocent Japanese people if you renounce Jesus.""What on earth was Martin Scorcese thinking? What is the point of this movie? Is Scorcese trying to get us to renounce something? The film sure feels like torture.The movie questions whether or not Christianity ""belongs"" in Japan. It implies that Christianity does not belong in Japan. Here's the thing – people are being tortured. Under torture you'll say whatever the torturer wants you to say. You'll say that Trump won the popular vote. With the threat of torture hanging over the head of every character in the film, the debate is rather skewed.Even as he appears to be belittling Christianity as an imperialist, colonizer's religion, Japanese Buddhism doesn't come off any better. The film consists of one scene after another of Japanese Buddhists torturing innocent people, coldly and gleefully. Not a great advertisement for Buddhism. Buddhism was also used by Imperial Japan during WW II. It's time we take a serious look at how Buddhism has been exploited to condone evil.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Religion is always about power,"I have no idea how to rate this film, so I won't. All I can say is that it's extremely hard to watch for anyone with a minimum of humanity, I felt the horror too much to care about acting or scenery. I suppose those were good enough, good enough not to get in the way of the story being told.Christianity is about giving meaning to suffering, taking something inevitable and give it worth. It's no surprise it spreads so easily among the poor, sick and destitute and Japan, with its extreme feudal system where some humans are barely such, in the sense of being so poorly treated, was ripe for a message that gave them some dignity and hope. I'm not sure what the original message of the book and film are supposed to be, but to me it reads as confirmation that religion is always politics and some are willing to do anything to hold on to power. Why did Christianity in Japan failed when it thrived in other places? It's quite simple, it never found its way into the upper class who always felt threatened by the poorest of the poor and by the message that they were of some value as people. Another message, all religions are perfectly capable of heinous crimes when the powerful being them feel threatened in their power.Overall, worth watching, but not for a weak stomach.",,Anonymous,History

Faith in 3 Hours,"Martin Scorsese is one of very few directors who continues to make good movies in more than 50 years of working. This movie is no exception. But to warn you straight out, Silence is not mainstream or even an epic movie in the classical way. In its heart its a small movie about people with faith, their reasons for believing and their struggle to keep doing it. So there are no big scenes with great mind blowing dialog or action.I personally also had a hard time connecting myself to the people depicted on the screen, because i can not emotionally understand the concept of faith and believing in a greater power. The actors are all good in this movie and the characters are fleshed out very well, but their motivations are unfamiliar to me. So some decisions are hard to understand. But that is one point of the movie.The cinematography and direction of the movie are stunningly great.

Fascinating 'Silence' weighs faith and doubt,"Silence, Martin Scorsese's long-in-the-works adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's same-titled novel about a Jesuit priest searching for his former mentor in shogun-era Japan, is a truly religious piece of filmmaking, in that it looks for meaning in the contradictions and absurdities of faith, instead of its assurances. Filmed in Taiwan, it limits its view of 17th-century Japanese life to far-flung villages, tiny huts, and walled compounds, effectively alternating agoraphobic and claustrophobic perspectives. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, Silence clashes the spiritual and the practical, the human and the divine. With the dialogue concentrated on the mysteries of faith and how Rodrigues' rigid insistence on God's existence might be its own form of self-deluded arrogance. Silence is an esoteric undertaking that appeals more to the head than the heart. Some may find Silence's agonised self-flagellation far too ponderous and tortured. But Ferreira's appearance elevates the movie beyond matters of Christian doctrine to universal questions about how society should best confront all forms of intolerance. A slow-burn tale filled with beautiful imagery and understated performances, its elegance yields Scorsese's one of the most subtle efforts.My Rating :4/5",8.0,Anonymous,History
Real problem work,"Since Xavier, missionaries who visited Japan were not committed with pure faith.

The Jesuit is a Catholic missionary organization founded by Xavier and others, but also a strategic religious organization of the Spanish and Portuguese governments. Behind the missionary activities, he sold slaves and abducted many children and Japanese women and sold them to European countries. Knowing that, Hideyoshi expelled the Christian missionary from Japan and banned the Christian faith. There is no story like this movie.

Read from the Silence what you will......,"Silence is one of those films where what you take away from it depends on where you start from.My starting perspective is one of pragmatism and historical fact. The realities of the time saw Portugal as a world power. Much as the US is today. Its ambitions somewhat mirror those of their latter day counterparts too.Establish a strong presence in Japan with a view to exploit it for its resources. One of the key tools in that conversion was cultural assimilation. Get the locals to see things you way. One of the key tools to achieve this at the time, was religion.Religion infused every aspect of 17th century life. It offered solace in a world filled with hardship. It was used by states to keep the populace under control and compliant and that needs to be kept in mind when considering Silence.On the surface it would seem the Jesuit priests and their followers are victims of a cruelly enforced code of silence. To believe something and not be able to express it openly.This is no doubt true. Yet, whats just as true, is Christianity, at the time was just as intolerant and inflexible and used much the same methods, including torture and executions, to ensure its religion remained in control. This benefited both the state and the clergy.So what to make of Silence? Viewed as an historical document its fine. Its beautifully crafted, with stunning visuals and a great story. I would say its a little overstated at times and it would have been nice to for the film to focus a little more of its screen time on the apostate priests lives working as a religious ""customs service"" for the Japanese state. Sadly, this is compressed into the final quarter of the film.Being critical I would say it could have been more balanced and at least acknowledged more directly the brutality of religion as a political too on both sides of the East/West divide.That said, this remains an excellent film. Its well directed, acted and examines a fascinating period in human history where religion was the mainstay, that held the fabric of society together. Eight out of ten from me.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director,"Silence is a drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson. Based on the book of the same name, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director.In 1640, two Portuguese priests, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) travel to Japan to recover their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has been missing for sometime and is rumoured to have committed apostasy. Upon sneaking into Japan, where Christianity is strictly outlawed, the two priests attempt to preach Catholicism to some small villages, all while avoiding detection from local samurais.Whether one is deeply religious or not, this film leaves a lasting impression and will likely cause one to question their personal beliefs. I particularly liked the nice blend of Eastern and Western influences throughout the story, which adds to its intriguing tone. The Eastern parts seem reminiscent of director Akira Kurosawa's work and the Western parts feel like classic Hollywood. Despite its 161 minute running time, the film never feels boring or slow, mainly due to Scorsese's clever directorial techniques.

Scorsese's unusual turn,"Martin Scorsese is best known as the man behind ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". Lesser known are his movies that focus on religion. His first one was ""The Last Temptation of Christ"". Next was ""Kundun"" (about the early years of the Dalai Lama). Now he brings us ""Silence"", a work of historical fiction about some young priests investigating reports that their teacher apostatized after getting tortured in Japan in the 17th century. In addition to investigating this, the priests also seek to give moral support to Japan's Christians, who are getting persecuted by the government.I had a couple of thoughts while watching the movie. I wondered what the Japanese thought of it. After all, the Japanese may have seen Christianity as an instrument of destroying their culture (which it was in the places that the European colonial powers invaded). Also, watching the torture that the Japanese inflicted on the Jesuits, I wondered why the Jesuits didn't just go ahead and renounce their faith. If someone did that to me, I'd say uncle in a second. True, Catholicism was the main part of the Jesuits' lifestyle, but how could anyone tolerate that torture?In the end, I wouldn't call it Scorsese's greatest movie, but it's worth seeing. While Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver get top billing, I thought that Liam Neeson's character - based on real-life priest Cristóvão Ferreira - was the most interesting character. I'm eager to see what Marty's next movie will be.I wonder how long it took to sail from Portugal to Japan.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An in-depth portrayal of religion and faith,"Overall the film was good. The locations for shooting were beautiful and chosen perfectly to convey the time period.Andrew Garfield is outstanding in this film. His expression of determination, frustration, sorrow, and self reflection is beyond commendable.Director Martin Scorsese chose a deep and difficult message to send to his viewers, but is successful in doing so. The idea of God's silence is a beautiful concept that is well captured by the directing, the screenplay, and the acting. Scorsese's directing decisions also does an amazing job of portraying two conflicting religious beliefs and opinions that, due to pride, never intertwine.The movie is mostly slow-moving and long, but the length is understandable and appropriate for the depiction of such intense historical events.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's dragged out,"This movie is absolutely mediocre, but lets try to take it bit by bitThe locations and filming is absolutely beautiful. The story is threadbare, it really doesn't exist in many ways and is very very repetitive. There really only exist 1-2 characters that aren't just hollow shells there to further the story. You can see exactly whats going to happen around 30 minutes before it happens, and there lies this movies biggest flaw, it's length. Everything goes on and on and on about the exact same thing for around 1h 30 min. With little to no progression, those 1h and 30 minutes of story goes like this: Repent your religion, No, *something bad happens*, repent your religion, No, *something bad happens* and on and on and on. Honestly this movie had potential but it needed someone who can actually write a story and not include the same thing for hours. This whole movie should have been a 1h movie and it would have been much better for it.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Silence is an incredible viewing experience that will reward all, religious or not.","Martin Scorsese's new passion project Silence is an incredible exploration of human endurance and the lengths with which one will go to protect their faith. On the surface, this may seem a religious film, risking artistic integrity in an attempt to promote Christian living. However, the undoubtedly human story at its heart makes the faith that drives the films characters to risk everything universal as a symbol of freedom.Years in the making, Silence follows two Jesuit priests as they journey to Japan to spread the catholic faith and find their missing mentor. This mission pushes their bodies and their sanity to the limit, unveiling both the strength and the horror humanity is capable of. While marketing has pushed Liam Neeson's role in the film, the true star is Andrew Garfield in an incredible performance that invokes such empathy the audience is left stunned. He is the focal point with which we see man's drive and will, following the risks and sacrifices he makes for what he believes is right. Scorsese brilliantly makes his choices and his faith ambiguous, highlighting the flaws with religious practice along with the joy it can bring. The film is not about faith but about the freedom to choose what you believe in. This film is a detailed examination of humanity and Scorsese has set out a methodical journey for his protagonist, a long and slow paced character study. We feel each struggle and each breakthrough with Garfield; Silence is in many ways an experience and it will leave you trembling. My love for what Scorsese had done is matched only by a desire to lock it away for many years. It simply takes that much out of you.As its name suggests, Silence employs stellar use of atmosphere, the sudden troughs of quiet amidst a sea of frenzied sound recreate the moments of religious realization and wonder for our protagonist, we become sympathetic to his deluded ideas of grandeur threatening to taint his morally sound character. All this complexity is grounded with beautiful visuals that merge realism with subtle stylistic qualities that gives the landscapes of 17th century Japan an almost mythic aura.Silence is extraordinary; the beauty and refinement of the production matched only by the beautiful yet harrowing tale at its core. Scorsese has again created a cinematic masterpiece that will bury itself within your mind for quite some time to come.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",10.0,Anonymous,History
God is silence,"This movie to be true to oneself and then asking what is the true version of oneself to go to is really phenomenal. I think this movie is one of the best crusading movies I have watched. It's not the funniest and the most interesting but the slow pace and feeling you get like the priest in the movie is just perfect.It's also a beautiful passion project that I could really see how much scorsese and everyone put themselves into it to get it done. I did not get the feeling that it was half ass in any way and the location dates chosen Taiwan looks really good.I think Andrew Garfield feels performance was so good the feeling of wanting to help the feeling of being a martyr of Faith, pride and loss everything he was the perfect actor for this role.And the acting is so silent and subtle and honko you can see in the actor skinny tulsos it's just so well to showed.Cinema was silent and study just shots staying there so we can see the actors do their work without too much editing. It was really well done.I am not a Christian but I could empathize and still see the hardship they went through and inpathize with the faith.What is the purpose to a priest if not to help others even if God is silence?",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gives a deeper insight about gruelling problems Christian community faced but with personal walk in faith as well,"This is not a standard review but rather a reflection about the movie.-------------------At first I was a little dubious about Silence. I thought it would portray Catholics in a fashionable and biased way. So to begin with, Scorsese most certainly has not done that. Both Japanese and Christians are presented in an honest and engaging way. Apart from being shot beautifully, Silence raises very difficult and important theological questions. It is not only about persecution and evangelism but intrinsic religious emotion and relationship with Christ each individual grows in in his own heart.Scorsese struggled with religion throughout his life. Silence completes his religious trilogy. He was raised as a Christian and now at the age of 75 finally makes a movie he wanted to make for 25 years. This explains why Silence is permeated with personal struggle priests encounter in their missionary work in contrast to community problems Japanese Christians face.The main question Silence raises that I have identified is the following: Can you commit apostasy and still be a faithful Christian? It's a more difficult question than I thought it was. Christ clearly said: ""But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God."" (Lk 12, 9) On the other side, one may even bear martyrdom for his own faith, but what if others have to bear martyrdom for *your* faith? Is it then possible to commit apostasy on the outside only for the sake of others and stay true to Christ in the inside? What about martyrs then? Would there even be a Christian faith if everybody just committed apostasy and bore Christ only within without any external sings?I don't think Silence gives you answers to this and other questions but instead it confronts you with them in an unnerving way. And that is a good thing. If you decide to watch Silence, take into account deep personal issues it develops and reflect upon them within the silence of your heart. See it with proper attitude and think about it with forbearance afterwards. You might benefit more that you think.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Pointless,"This movie was made because someone thought it's a good story, it is a good story, if told in another way. Why did these priests go to Japan? Obviously the Portuguese church wanted something there, but nothing about that, just about these 2 arrogant priests who go there to turn Buddhists into Christians, why? who made you Gods to decide that your belief is better than theirs? who gave you permission to turn these people from farmers to burnt bodies? Nothing is explained in this movie, it is like a boring docu. Very bad acting by everyone, except Ichizo, everyone cries, suffers, a big mess of stupid conversations - even i could give better answers to these ""Serious religion type"" nonsense questions. our hero eats a salty fish and is thirsty, an immediate comparison to Jesus is made, come on people!!

"Very Unusual, Deep, Tragic, Albeir Rather Violent","Martin Scorcese is a tremendous filmmaker which he has proved time and again with numerous awesome movies such as Gangs Of New York or The Departed. When I was told he had made a film on Christian missionaries to Japan in the 17th century, I became highly suspicious - who of all the people, Mr Scorcese, the very man who made a highly insulting The Last Temtation Of Christ. I was very cautious when starting watching this epic movie. My impressions are very mixed. Let me touch upon certain pluses and minuses/ What was good - 1. Excellent casting - Neeson, Garfield and Driver are awesome from start to finish, they are impeccably excellent and very powerful in each scene they do. This is the 2nd Garfield's film connected with the issue of faith and he again shines brightly. I must also pay deep respect to Japanese actors Tadanobu Asano and Issey Ogata who did marvelous job. 2. The setting - filmed in Taiwan, but depicting Japan, the camera simply enjoys every single trait of gorgeous nature, deep and mighty, superb and awesome. 3. The plot - I was deeply moved by a very correct depiction of Christianity and the real, present, graphic suffering that believers had to endure. 4. The message is simple and yet powerful, too. Silent suffering is often equal to that vivid and loudWhat was bad: 1. The length. Unwielding 160 minutes are too much to swallow at one gulp. Too slow and too plodded. 2. Too graphic a violence. No, real, too too much. I felt sick and tired soon. 3. Tempo. Must be faster and more abrupt at times, me-think.General rating - 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,History
A look behind over Christianization on a Japan's rocky ground!!!,"Martin Scorsese made a rereading of the troublesome Christianization process took place in colonial Japan circa 1614 when the shogunate drove out all Jesuits from there and takes a hard harassment in converts Japanese nearby Nagasaki and outskirts exposed by Shûsaku Êndo's novel, it brings to the light many tougher punishments on those Christians believers.The Silence focuses in many aspects of the faith, thru two Jesuits priests Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) both sent to there by Portuguese Jesuit order at the behest of themselves to find out the whereabouts of the missing Priest Ferreira (Liam Neeson), they entering on the sly in Japan protected by a small Christian community they face all kind of reprisals by the powerful inquisitor Inoue (Issei Ogata).This fabulous picture utterly points out that in rocky Japanese ground doesn't allowed any Chistian flourishment, due they keep their own culture at all coast as displayed alongside the storyline, later just Netherlands was granted to trading there as long as any Christian objects tries entering to the sacred Buddhist territory, so Portugal and Spain were banned from Japan for many years to come, awesome photograph and cinematography on the foggy and rocky eastern environment.Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 2024 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,History
an interesting but altogether disappointing experience,"I was extremely interested to watch this film after having watched the trailer and I think that the subject of Christianity in feudal Japan is something that is not often seen on the big screen. However I was left extremely disappointed by Silence from start to finish. I found the attention to small details of 17th century Japan was the only saving grace in a film where the acting, imagery and length especially were very drawn out and, to be honest, I was glad when it was all over.I have no idea why if none of the three main Portuguese characters can actually do a Portuguese accent they wouldn't just speak normally or use actors that could do the accent. The imagery of stepping on an image of Christ was used so repeatedly with so little happening in between it was difficult to remain interested or for the act itself to hold its importance. There was very little to endear any of the characters to the audience apart from characters that played too small a role. Many of the scenes in this film are needlessly long and really do beg the question of why this film has seemingly been constructed to take so long to tell the story that it needs to. I realise many people will have read the book and so may be able to look past this - I understand as well that this film may be viewed differently by people who have faith to how I viewed it myself. Having said this rather than let another Scorsese fan get sucked in by a trailer that looks to tackle a very interesting period in history I thought it best to warn people that you won't get these three hours of your life back.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Great Cinematography and Story,I absolutely loved this film. Being a Christian myself it was a very moving film dealing with the inner turmoil these people are feeling being persecuted for their faith and denying their God. The fact that this was shot on 35mm film mostly when they had the ability to shoot it digital is super impressive being it was out in rural Japan. Love it! Go Watch. also Martin Scorcese is a genius!,10.0,Anonymous,History
A film that makes you want to read the Japanese novel on which the film is based,"The more I reflect on it, the film is important for its subject (read ""the original Japanese novel""), but as cinema it is a recreation of sequences from other important films. This is Scorsese taking a leaf out of Tarantino, who was also a great cineaste.One aspect of the film that I was impressed with was the development character of the Japanese man who constantly betrays his family, priests and friends and yet seeks forgiveness from God.It is not great cinema--but it is a great subject, which could have been developed better. For instance, the Judas-equivalent in the film, betraying time and again and asking forgiveness each time--is a deep subject, which Scorsese merely treats as an appendage.After the movie ends, we are not any wiser of how much was history and how much was fiction. I salute the author Shusako Endo, just as with The Last Temptation of Christ, I salute Nikos Kazantzakis, rather than Scorsese.We cannot compare this film with Bergman's trilogy of Through the Glass Darkly, The Silence and Winter Light, because Bergman wrote the original scripts and never adapted books. Here, Jay Cocks and Scorsese were adapting Endo's novel.The more disturbing fact is that Endo is not a historian but a novelist. One wonders what Cocks and Scorsese added to Endo's tale.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Fanaticism of Faith,"Decades in the making, ""Silence"" is a gripping and challenging epic that will confront one's faith and morals in their age-old conflict between reality and belief. Based on the Shusaku Endo novel of the same name the Martin Scorsese-directed star-studded cast bring to life the tale of two Portuguese Jesuit priests and their journey in 17th Century Japan in their quest to find a countryman and fellow man of the cloth who disappeared and is rumored to have given up his faith, an act tantamount to a serious crime in Catholic Baroque-era Latin Europe. Their reception by the Japanese hosts sets off a a cinematic experience one won't forget.Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Ciaran Hinds and a host of Japanese actors lend their respective talents to this nearly three hour odyssey of defiance, frustration and pain. A film of mist, fog, oceans, streams, mountains, rocks, trees, leaves, grass and wooden prisons the movie is a moving canvas on the clash of cultures and its repercussions including matters on God, faith, colonialism, nationalism and human nature itself. As expected from a Scorsese flick the film is well-acted with Garfield proving himself worthy of the lead role by taking center stage throughout as the sympathetic but fanatical man of God. The zen-like scenery is as soothing as it is calming and the script has a depth and spirituality that lives up to the film's weighty and profound subject. The movie starts slow and the first half is a slow burn that may try less patient viewers and the religious extremism displayed throughout will be unrelatable to many modern audiences. The movie picks up though and the viewer is rewarded with one of the most engaging displays of cinematic artistry caught on film.A box office failure upon release and one that is critically acclaimed, ""Silence"" is art at one of its most complex and profound. Confronting honestly the biggest and most important realities of life this isn't so much entertainment as catharsis and redemption. Essential.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Atheist review :-),"There are two ways to review this movie:1. Cinematografic POV: The film is quite long so there are scenes that are ""little boring"" or repeating. Acting is quite good but I got the feeling that it could be beter or maybe more emphasized. Photography and scenes are great, real, but not spectacular. Rating 72. Plot/Story POV: maybe all of the ""negative"" impressions stated in above comment were intended so that the focus would be on the story! It happened to me while watching the movie that when I thought the scene was ""boring"", too long, repeating, not spectacular .. that immediatelly made me change the focus on the whole story - you are constantly forced to think about the meaning of the religion, existence, beliefs,.... And this is great!! It is very powerful and meaningful movie so don't be mislead by those who just watch movies for entertainment and give bad reviews. Sometimes we have to consider that the movie does not have to be great from all points of view to be excellent.... Rating: 9Btw, I am an atheist and from my point of view it made me even more convinced about my feelings.

You don't need to be religious to find this film intriguing,"I am not religious and I really don't think you have to be religious to find this film so fascinating.It just so happens to be about Christianity and faith, but one can take the film and relate to it with anything that they're extremely passionate about.For example, rather than religion, what if one was a really passionate soldier fighting for their country, and they end up being captured by the enemy; if they don't burn or spit on their own flag and respect the enemy's culture instead, their family or close friends would be killed. The use of severe torture was a way to get the religious groups to apostatize; this story is extremely relevant in today's society (or any era for that matter) -- think about it, the use of waterboarding can make ANYONE admit they're terrorists.I think it also questions about pride/thinking rationally in certain situations. To some, throwing away your pride and dignity is as good as being dead. It is a catch-22.What also makes this film/story interesting is how people can interpret it completely differently; one can see the behavior as being selfish/cowardly or entirely respectable.First of all, the Old Samurai Inoue (played by Issei Ogata) is fantastic. He just has this bizarre creepiness charm to him, almost like an iconic cartoon character... just has that same presence that Christoph Waltz had in Inglourious Basterds.The Interpreter to Inoue (played by Tadanobu Asano) is also excellent... of course he has the best English out of all the Japanese actors. It's that friendly charm that makes the characters much creepier/deadlier/nastier than the stereotypical villains. The best villains don't believe what they're doing is really wrong.Kichijiro (played by Yosuke Kubozuka) is an absolutely hilarious character. He is like a rat. He seems to portray the typical flaws of being a human. The main character has trouble deciding many times throughout the film, seesawing back and forth on what to do, and Kichijiro's character is always like a mirror metaphor to him.The dialogues between the Samurai/Interpreter/Rodrigues defending Buddha and other metaphors throughout about one seed may grow in one country but dies in another/the land being a swamp is really interesting.At first when I found out the movie was going to be 3 hours, I thought that was going to kill me, but it wasn't bad at all. The beginning is a little slow (they could have cut that whole China part), but it gets really interesting towards the second half.If you're just into mindless fast cutting action films and not so much a deep thinker, this film is not for you.This movie is based on the 1966 historical fiction Japanese novel by Shunsaku Endo. There was also a movie made in 1971, which has some similar scenes, but I definitely prefer Scorsese's version.This should be the real winner for an Oscar, but I'm sure Hollywood loves Hollywood, so they'll end up giving it to LA LA Land instead. Andrew Garfield is really becoming a big star than just a super hero. If you enjoy character study and great dialogue/something that makes you think, definitely watch it. It's really tragic and haunting.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Brutal,I have never seen a more brutal and powerful movie that compares to this. I have not even heard about this movie and came across it accidentally. It affected me in so many ways. Even if you remove the religious angle the way a person treats another person for having a different view shows to what extent we can go. Certain times I felt Andrew G did not fit the character but he nailed it. One of the movies where I cried in any places. It also shows how people held onto their faith even in the most difficult of times. One of the most important question we have daily 'Why is God silent' is raised more profoundly here.,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Academic, and surprisingly fascinating","Superb film by Martin Scorsese. This Silence is classic in its form and staging, its framing, to serve a story of Jesuit priests who go to Japan to evangelize the Japanese peasants and to find a Father who had trained them. It is therefore the story of a cultural clash between a Jesuit Christianity of illiterate peasants and the ruling castes in religion and Buddhism who refuse the arrival of Christians. This refusal starts with their massacre and then finally not being productive enough or rather counter-productive, the malignant inquisitor prefers to torture them slowly so that they abjure the Christian religion and join the tolerated religion. Their know-how and sophistication in terms of torture and harassment make them succeed in making the priests recant; they abandon Christianity.This whole is conducted over nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes with sublime images of nature, here Taiwanese since the film was shot in Taiwan. The film is exciting and we follow with curiosity the evolution of the story even if we finally understand that they succumb to torture, convert and abandon their ideas of spreading Christianity. With certain ambiguities of course.We are well in the vein of Martin Scorsese's religious films such as Kundun (1997) or The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).This film does some good with its very slow rhythm, its images that the camera embraces at its speed, slowly, with characters who have states of mind, who want to confess. A film with substance. With meaning. The film questions belief, belonging and the confrontation of cultures. While containing violence, the Japanese being champions in the art of physical and psychological torture.On the side of the distribution, Andrew Garfield is inhabited. Issey Ogata is great in the role of the Inquisitor, who manages to make the character endearing while being a master in the art of torture.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The master makes a masterful film!,"This is not a film for everyone: it's a slow-paced film with no obvious special effects; a thinking person's film - about religion and what it means to have faith even at the cost of your life, especially of the Christian kind versus following the Buddha's path in 15th century Japan. A film about real characters who once existed, therefore a story based on facts, and history is always well worth reviewing lest we repeat the mistakes of our forefathers.Having been brought up by an atheist father, who married a non-practising Buddhist Japanese (2nd wife, my step-mother), yet having gone to church for 4 yrs at high school at my English boarding school in the UK in the 70s, and later finding much to resonate within Buddhism in my 30s (I was to become an ardent student for 18 yrs), I found this film of particular interest.It makes for harrowing viewing when the authorities, bent on enforcing their intolerance of all things Western, including the practice of Christianity, repeatedly route out Japanese Christians from villages - with vigour! Poor peasants with a childlike faith. It's painful to watch them suffer so much! For what? Holding onto an image of a saviour and paradise beyond death, after enduring a difficult life under dominating landlords and regional governors!A long film at almost 3 hrs, but whilst some viewers found that overly long, I did not. It's a story that needed that length to be told in all its many facets.Scorsese has done it again!

Silence nullifies you through viscerally stunning imagery and faithfully religious themes.,"Many of you may know that I am not a massive fan of Scorsese unlike most aficionados. In addition, you may have acknowledged the fact that I also dislike long runtimes. Silence is, ironically, directed by Scorsese and boasts a 160 minute theatrical length. Much to my surprise, this was absolutely gorgeous. Two missionaries journey to Japan in search for their missing mentor who has been captured. The Shimabara Rebellion is an important event in religious history. The suppression of Roman Catholicism in 17th Century Japan, a religion deemed dangerous by high-ranking indigenous officials. Scorsese, along with Cocks' screenplay, managed to craft a thematic adaptation that encapsulates the utmost cinematic quality. Conveying the power of religious devotion without glorifying martyrdom was always a difficult task. Resorting to blood and violence would've been easy, yet Scorsese instead focused on the everlasting conflict in human nature. Rodrigues, played enigmatically by Garfield, is pure. Forever devoted to his faith and spreading his beliefs of Catholicism to the Japanese peasants. Even during ultimatums that could result in death, he remained defiant. But the relentless acts of torture and martyrs sacrificing themselves in the name of God started to taint his ideologies. Questioning the very existence of his religion. The visual storytelling and minimal dialogue eloquently hones in on the emotion of self-doubt. You can visualise the inner torment within these characters of having to renounce Christianity. Apostatising or disaffiliating one's self from faith feels like death in itself to these individuals. Utterly powerful. Driver and Neeson both act as valuable assets in personifying the power of religion, platforming Garfield to scenes of pure emotional vulnerability. The supporting Japanese cast all performed well, although certain translations may have needed subtitles due to the lack of clear pronunciation, was slightly difficult to articulate. Prieto's cinematography was spellbinding. The darkened blue nights to the vivid green forests all captured the aesthetic beauty of rural Japan. The absence of a musical score surprised me, and felt like a double-edged sword. It managed to enhance the tension, particularly during the long takes of peasants being strapped to wooden crosses waiting for the crashing waves of the sea to drain their remaining energy. But simultaneously it reduced the cinematic presence of the film. Emotional resonance was subdued to the lack of instrumentality, and I do view that as a flaw. A few minor criticisms here and there, but for a project that has nearly spanned two decades, Scorsese should be proud. A passion project that raises fundamental questions whilst also producing a coherently beautiful story. I was silenced throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful film set in a different era,"Well, When I came to know that Scorsese was making a film about spread of Christianity in Japan, I had painted a very specific picture about what this film could be. The thing is, It is completely unexpected. Yes, I'd agree that it's kinda too long, but I won't complain. It's a very beautiful movie, it explores various topics that would be rather not known to the viewer. Andrew Garfield just performs so well in his role and brings out the character in perfect light. I really don't understand many of the viewers expectations from this movie. It is just perfect in it's own way, I don't think this could have been executed any better. If entertainment is a top priority for you, then this is not the movie you should be watching. It's a lengthy, well crafted piece of art that needs to be appreciated. If you are into that and have an open-mind about the story, then this movie won't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A unique, but masterful and essential, Scorsese movie","This movie was nominated for one lone Oscar. It's nomination for Cinematography was well earned, no doubt. But this movie deserved so much more. It deserved more recognition from awards season, particularly for Scorsese's directing and Garfield's acting (Andrew Garfield was nominated for Hacksaw Ridge, released in the same year, but his work in Silence was the better performance.)I first saw this when it was released on Amazon Prime after it's very limited theatrical run. I was 16 or 17, way too young to fully grasp the themes and messages. Way too caught up in the messages of martyrdom and discipleship taught in the church. Now, older, with more reflection, I can see what this movie is going for and appreciate the hard questions being asked: is there glory in dying for your faith? Is there glory in telling others to do the same? What does it mean to share the gospel? Where does the line for loving others stop? When you fear that someone you love's soul is damned, do you try to save it?This is a slow burn. It's near 3 hours, it's contemplative and meditative and ponders philosophy, it lacks the fast paced energy and darkly fun side of Scorsese's crime flicks. But it's never dull. It's always engaging. It makes you feel the heavy weight of the questions it's asking and makes you contemplate alongside it, without making any of the answers easy to come to (or transparent.)Scorsese had been planning on bringing this project to life for decades before he finally committed after Wolf of Wall Street was released. Despite being different from the crime thrillers he became famous for, I believe it to be one of his most essential films (even above his other religious dramas.) This is one of my favorite dramas, and one of my favorite movies from this directors period. And I highly recommend it, though it is hard to watch at times due to its heavy themes, slow pace, and violent moments.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Captivating - Even if it's a Little Rough Around the Edges,"Silence is written and directed by Martin Scorsese and tells the story of two 16th century priests, Rodrigues and Garupe travelling to Japan in search of their mentor who they fear has committed apostasy after getting captured years earlier. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Liam Neeson and got a mainstream release in early 2017.Silence is a very meticulously made film, as one would expect coming from Scorsese but it is even more pronounced here. The story takes its time to unravel, with each scene feeling like a chapter in a book, as the audience, you will spend quite a while in one place before shifting to the next. Scorsese does a wonderful job building atmosphere in this movie, it is cold, profound and most of all moving; the relationship between the Japanese and Portuguese in regards to their differing religions will make you think long after the credits start rolling - if you do not consider yourself a religious person it is still a movie that will somewhat resonate with you. The story isn't some uplifting Christatin tale and it's not entirely a critique of Buddhism or Christianity, although there are certainly very dark moments, it is meant to be an account of the history and show in many ways how religion can simultaneously bring people together and tear them apart. There are many uncomfortable moments littered throughout the movie and those tend to be the most thought-provoking and complex moments which are handled beautifully.Andrew Garfield who takes the lead as Father Rodrigues was brilliant, he brings so much pain and complexity to the character, who struggles with his faith throughout. His performance was immediately captivating and Garfield's portrayal of his character being in constant danger was perfect, you never knew what was going to happen next, making for even those scenes that are drawn out still engaging. Adam Driver is also good in the small role he is in as Father Garupe, even if his accent took some time to adjust to. Lastly, Liam Neeson as Father Ferreira was equally superb in his limited role, you got the sense that he was haunted by the things his character has seen since being captured. There is a sense of uncertainty to his character and as the audience makes you ponder whether he believes everything he says.While the film is masterfully made there are a few things that are rough around the edges mostly involving the sound mixing and dubbing of lines. I found some of the sound mixing to be a little jarring at times, with noises in the same scene going from relative quietness to fairly loud - it made me think I was watching some sort of mainstream horror movie with jump scares every 5 minutes. Although it wasn't commonplace and the sound mixing was handled beautifully in the third act with Silence using silence to its advantage, those were still instances that took me out of the film. Likewise, there are many lines that are dubbed in this movie both in English and Japanese, and half of the time there was dubbing it was very apparent. You could tell the lines were recorded in some studio and not on set, it was just surprising to see such a well-made film fall victim to amateur blunders.All in all, Silence is a great film, although it may not be for everyone and I'm not sure how often I will revisit the movie, it was something that caused me to think and reflect on my experience/stance on religion. It is a very well-crafted film, even with its small faults - the performances were truly captivating, there is a lot to admire about the film even during its moments in the story and for that reason, I am giving Silence an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
very boring,"I can't say I was disappointed because I should have guessed that a religious film would be like this, but I had hoped it would have some good points. It was tedious, overlong, repetitive, and, at times ridiculous (God's voice?). The landscape was nice, I guess, and the acting wasn't bad. I felt sorry for the actors having to work with a clunky script like that. It left me completely cold. I was not interested in any of the characters or what became of them. The dialogues were excruciatingly unnatural and painfully slow. I didn't go to see Scorsese's other two ""religious"" films and I wish I hadn't gone to see this one. I only went because I live in Portugal and it was about two Portuguese priests. Dumb reason, huh?",2.0,Anonymous,History
Mr Scorsese's Faith,"Martin Scorsese tells of his own private faith in this brilliant movie about faith. He masterfully dissects faith in all it's aspects. From the priest who believes in Jesus to the Buddhist who believes in human nature. In the minds of the Buddhist, the community of the state is more important than the individual in Christ. Because Christ is exalted above human control they see it as a threat so they kill the freedom of Christ. In the end they fear relinquishing their power to God. Humans are the top of existence to them. Therefore God is a threat.In the end Mr Scorsese reminds us that faith cannot be driven out of a mans heart.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Scorcese,"Martin Scorcese puts his creative heart on the screen for two hours and forty minutes with this extremely personal religious voyage through 1600's Buddhist Japan. Jesuit missionaries, Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield) and Garuppe(Adam Driver) are sent to Japan to search for Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson), who has disappeared and allegedly renounced his faith in order to avoid torture and execution by the Japanese. The pair of priests encounter Catholic converts on their journey and conduct mass in secret because of the severe penalties, including crucifixion, for those practicing the banned religion. Garfield is tremendous as Father Rodrigues and Liam Neeson transcends the deeply moving material, as Scorcese allows his actors to shine, including a mostly Japanese cast. The last fifteen minutes are as memorable as anything I have ever seen. The tortures on display are excruciating to watch, but are historically accurate and necessary. 2016 is a strange year for film, as we have the releases of both Silence and La La Land. The latter has a best director nomination but Martin Scorcese was ignored by the Academy; what a disgrace. Time will prove this to be a major mistake.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Visually Stunning Yet Drawn Out Passion Project,"I've seen Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" twice: once in the theater and once on home video. My first viewing was a transcendent experience, but my second was a disappointment. What I first loved about the film remains great, but multiple viewings highlight the movie's imperfections. ""Silence"" is a beautifully made epic with awe-inspiring performances and important religious themes - but those qualities are stretched thin over a nearly three hour running time.""Silence"" is a spiritual successor to ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" Scorsese's controversial life of Jesus that divided believers but nonetheless managed to get to the heart of the often challenging experience of being a Christian. Since then Scorsese has matured as a filmmaker and with a bigger budget he was able to re-address Catholic themes with an even better cast and an expanded scope. Scorsese is a master director and in ""Silence"" he sets a thought-provoking discussion about faith against the colorful backdrop of 17th Century Japan. The questions Scorsese raises are the defining ones of his career: what does it really mean to be a Christian? How far can we take forgiveness of sins? Is it possible to renounce God in action but still love him?""The Last Temptation of Christ"" had clearer answers to these questions in a film that better utilized its sprawling length and poetic imagery. ""Silence"" holds up as a moving exploration of religion and belief, but it suffers from tortuously slow pacing and a drawn out third act that fails as pay off for two hours of build-up. I read the original book ""Silence"" when I was in high school, and unfortunately the literary version is superior to the film: the ponderous and bleak story of ""Silence"" is better fit for a novel than cinema. I do recommend Scorsese's ""Silence"" for the amazing visuals, provocative themes, and superb performances - in particular Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson shine in their respective roles. But be prepared for a film that's nearly an hour too long. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Managed to silence my mind,"In one prayer Andrew Garfield's character says he heard Gods voice in the silence. After having watched SILENCE I heard no voices of whomsoever, but I was calm and attentive. SILENCE managed to silence my mind. Maybe this is the ideal preparation for contemplation, for prayer, and, ultimately, for death and what it might bring.There is a clear construct of oppositions like Buddhism vs. Christianity, perception vs. imagination, protectionism vs. imperialism, immanence vs. transcendence or the denial of vs. the faith in the creative power of symbols. But it's hard to figure out the films own attitude regarding these sides, and this is what makes it a work of art in contrast to a work of religious or political propaganda. The conflicts within the story and its characters are numerous and dig deep, and the filmmakers manage to tell them without praising one side and condemning the other side. At the same time it is never cold and analytical, but heart filled with compassion and empathy. This is quite unusual and I can only take my hat off to this kind of old fashioned, humanistic artistry.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A gruelling but worthwhile experience,"One of the harder watches of recent memories and an experience likely to drive a high percentage of ill-informed audience members scrambling for the exit signs before its conclusion, Martin Scorsese's long gestating passion project Silence, upon reflection is certainly not an easy film to recommend.Slowly paced, perhaps a little too long in the tooth, uncompromising in its intentions and more than a few times quite confrontational, this piece of art and quickly forgotten about epic by one of cinemas most renowned voices will divide many but there's little doubt this almost masterpiece is a unique and layered film that is unlike anything else we cinema goers have seen before.Adapting Shûsaku Endô renowned novel of the same name, Scorsese and his impressive behind the scenes team including regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker, costume designer Ellen Lewis and some stunning and well deserved Oscar nominated D.O.P work by Rodrigo Prieto who gives Silence an almost otherworldly feel as he uses the Taiwanese locations to great effect have set out to create a largely word driven experience that ponders the idea of faith of beliefs whilst shining a light on the plight of Christians in 1600 centaury Japan where they were often required to lay their lives on the line for their very beliefs.The audience is thrown into this world as Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver's Father Garrpe, both Jesuit priests tasked with unlocking the mysterious disappearance of Liam Neeson's fellow preacher Father Ferreira find themselves in the beautiful yet unforgiving lands of the Japanese and from a seemingly simple set-up Scorsese uses the narrative to explore various religious themes and debates that may leave many audience members numb mixed with boredom whilst others will be tightly enthralled by the spell cast within a film that seems intent on letting its story play out before our eyes with nothing pressing it forward at any great speed.Silence's greatest weakness in the form that it has come out in is within its lack of warm emotional resonance and while sympathy and sorrow is found throughout, the ties that bind such an epic film are left wanting when it comes to a bond formed between the audience and the travails of these faithful Christian's.Largely led by Garfield's Rodrigues, a turn in which on the back of Hacksaw Ridge suggests the young actor has entered into another level of his career, Silence often feels as though it's one tiny moment away from landing a big emotional wallop but it never comes and while it's a nice change of pace to see Scorsese away from the sometimes showmanship nature of his recent films like Wolf of Wall Street there are times where Silence may've benefited from a little more of the directors famed pizazz.It's not hard to see why Silence has failed to capture traction at the Box Office or why it was largely shunned at Awards ceremonies over the previous months and while disappointing in certain regards it feels unwise to discount this eye capturing event as a film that will live long into the coming years as its future fans discover a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered and discussed by those that find it a true conversation starter.A unique entry into the stunning filmography of a master storyteller, Silence is a passion project with rough edges and missed opportunities but a project that rewards on many levels while offering more deep thinking ponderings than many other films would dare to dream up and is likely to be an experience that will reward those willing to give the film chances to grow over multiple viewings, no matter how hard a trek it may be.4 confessions out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,History
A spiritual journey,"Fantastic stuff by Scorsese again. Just downright beautifully shot, excellent direction and beautiful cinematography and very compelling. Lately I have been struggling to connect with modern day Hollywood films, whether it be La La Land, Manchester by the sea, Moonlight etc. Arrival got closest to making me care for the protagonist but not enough. I was never satisfied with my emotional connect to any or all of the characters of the said films. Silence showed me that I could care, I felt strong emotional bonds with almost all of the characters in the film, directed by the steady and unwavering hand of Martin Scorsese whose direction is the real star in the film. The rest do a decent job, Andrew Garfield gives career best performance here and is trying very hard but still not good enough to shoulder this movie on his own and there are a lot of solo scenes and his performance was good but not great. I could see a lot of parallels between this and Scorsese's Last Temptation of the Christ, like Garfield's Sebastian saw himself as Jesus figure of sorts, the ideology of pain and suffering brings you closer to god and similar moral dilemmas whether faith is more important than people's lives, a very emotional and spiritual experience throughout.Even Scorsese's greatest hits B side film is better than every film of last year. It's a shame that this was not nominated, it's not only a good film but a memorable one, it's no Seventh Seal but Scorsese doesn't ape Bergman he asks different questions and while not as philosophical but it still has a place in the pantheon of religion and spirituality based cinema something which the recent Noah just failed to do, always a very hard subject. It's amazing how Scorsese is able to maintain this level at 74, outdoing every one of his much younger peers, I hope he lives a long healthy life and continues providing us with good cinema, 2016 was in my recent memory one of the weakest years of non commercial Hollywood cinema almost SAVED by Scorsese. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Masterpiece about faith,"I am writing this review so very late. I watched the movie in a theater when it was out and will stay with me forever.I had heard feedback from friends and understood that I would be embarking in a journey that made people love it or hate it.One Catholic friend told be that it was too long and boring. Hearing this, a mutual older firend told me in private that the film is wonderful and that our friend was simply too immature to get it.I saw the movie on the same week these conversations happened.I LOVED IT.Yes, the movie is slow. And this fact is part of the magnicent work of art.The path of faith, for those whom go into it deep, is slow.And also like the movie, many times painful.And beautiful.To me, this movie celebrated a true walk on faith. And it did it perfectly.I won't say that my friend whom didn't appreciate it was immature. Maybe he was but that is not the point for me.I am sure many mature people that have seen it and felt about it like he did.You either have and are walking the path of faith as deep as you can or you can believe in God but never give it much thought, as a person of faith. And to me that is the difference. Anyone whom walked the deepest path will relate and understand the movie. Those who don't probably won't like it.I run into a youtube video that made curious to read my review of Silence and that was when I noticed I hadn't written it. Couldn't go past it and had to do it now.Really sad for the such low rating when talking of a wonderful masterpiece.Not because it is Christian.

Powerful and haunting faith-based survival tale,"It's easy to be a saint in Paradise - Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Star Trek: Deep Space NineThe opening to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets begins with a black screen as we hear the director's voice-over ""You don't make up for your sins in Church, you do it in the streets at your home. The rest is Bullshit and you know it"" While the 1973 film isn't technically his first, it does serve as the perfect opening to the filmmaker's legendary career as it is the first time he made a film that he truly revealed himself in. Focusing on a group of morally adrift people trying to find themselves in a sea of criminal temptations. It's similar subject material found in some of his other films and is emblematic of Scorsese's conflict for some 50 years: the creation and resilience of one's unique identity vs. the laws/rules/obligations that lead to conformity within the rest of society. The legendary filmmaker may venture into different genres and settings but it is the central conflict that runs through them. While certainly a departure in tone, pacing, and characters (Especially from Wolf of Wall Street, which still astounds me how much of a gear shift there is between the two works) his latest historical drama Silence is very much in the same veinIn 17th Century Feudal Japan, two Jesuit Priests Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garrpe (Adam Driver) are sent from Portugal to find their lost mentor Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who has supposedly apostatized, renounced, the Catholic Faith after suffering through extreme physical and mental torture. For years the Japanese government has banned the teaching and practicing of Christianity on its shore's, leading to execution and torture of followers and Priests of missionary work. Knowing the dangers the two young priests secretly travel to the east coast islands with the help of a drunken guide named Kichijiro (An excellent Mifune-esque Yōsuke Kubozuka) to find any information on their mentor. Kichijiro eventually leads them to small pockets of Christian believers who hide the priests at the risk of their lives. While secretly conducting mass, confessions, and baptisms the two priests feel like they are continuing the church's missionary work for the greater good. However, they also know that they can be found out at any time and face, along with their dedicated followers, unimaginable torture and/or death.Silence is a staggering, emotional, violent, pensive, complex and weighty film that centers on a central conflict that comes with belief: the Silence of a higher power in the face of horrific suffering inflicted on followers. Scorsese has dealt with Catholic themes of morality before and directly faith-based dramas with the controversial The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun but never before has he rendered so unflinchingly on-screen the human conflicts with faith and fallibility of belief. When the film eventually centers on Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues we are put on a journey in a similar scope to Apocalypse Now in showing the effects of being completely out- matched and showing the horrors of inhumanity in stark realism. The focal point is with the notorious inquisitor of Nagasaki, Inoue (A physically unimposing but psychologically brutal Issy Ogata), carries out his orders viciously and sadistically in putting down the foreign religion. Garfield is able to give us an amazingly intense and introspective performance of the young priest who begins to develop a deep crisis of faith in seeing so many Japanese Christians tortured and put to death in the face of God's seeming apathy and silence.The source material, adapted by Scorsese and Jay Cocks, is the 1966 book of the same name by Shûsaku Endô and is a landmark of its time, a lucid meditative journey of the faith solidified, eroded, and perhaps redefined. Scorsese was handed the novel after his aforementioned The Last Temptation of Christ premiered to extreme controversy and acted in Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. He has spent decades since trying to get this passion project to the screen and clearly has brought a personal edge to the work. However, he is also able to make Rodrigues' internal crisis a carefully rendered universal one found in all followers of any belief system. Proving that doubt is a powerful counter punch to faith when pushed to limit.I could go on about Rodrigo Prieto's immaculate camera-work, the outstanding performances from the rest of the Japanese cast (Tadanobu Asano as the Inquisitor's interpreter is another standout, voicing brutal reasoning with an eerie calmness), or the subtle soundtrack and sound design that dares to immerse you in the sounds of nature surrounding the violent events but really I want all those aspects to speak for themselves. Coming in as someone who isn't affiliated with organized religion the film is a fascinating examination of the deep seeded effects of Faith that isn't afraid to question it. There is much to take away from a dense work like this. As with most of the director's work, his characters will do things that you won't agree with or understand, but Scorsese as always presents without judgment between the easy and the right things to do. Sometimes the director doesn't give a sufficient answer, he only asks us to watch in thoughtful and pondering silence.10/10 (A bleak, stark, and deeply personal project of epic introspective scope that seeks to question the nature of Religion and how people internalize it. Frustrating, complicated and perhaps enlightening, just as any Faith-based movie should be.)",10.0,Anonymous,History

"This is Not a ""Faith-Based"" Film, This is a Tragedy. A Great Cinematic Experience.","The technical genre of this film would be ""Tragedy"". I say this because the movie treats itself very seriously, and there is a ton of sorrowful or terrible events taking place around the main character who can be classified as a ""heroic"" individual. The purpose of tragedies is to watch them, look at all the bad things happening to the hero, because of the hero, and by the hero, and then afterwards reflect. This movie is definitely going to make you reflect on some things. If it doesn't, eh...oh well, you still watched a quality movie. If you like tragedies, this movie is a must. Scorsese has made a beautiful piece with great atmosphere, beautiful shots, (oh gosh) scenes with MEANING and PROGRESSION. The story is complete, thoroughly explained, and ends on a positive note. I don't feel like I've wasted my time investing emotionally in characters that the story will just throw away when they fulfil their purpose. This film was not lazily madeThis film is a bit on the slow side, totaling to 2 hours and 41 minutes. If you are very impatient, this film isn't for you. If you aren't very analytical/observational, this film will most likely not be for you. If you are a cynic, or purely intellectual and not very spiritual, there is a VERY HIGH chance this film is not for you. Their are some real intense topics that this movie will delve into that take time to process. If you didn't really understand the topics before, this movie is not going to reveal anything you can't get somewhere else in a better way.Those who think this film is a ""Faith-Based"" Film, IT IS NOT. I REPEAT IT IS NOT A ""FAITH-BASED"" FILM. People comparing it to movies like Passion of the Christ or War Room are comparing apples to oranges. Just because the movie has Christianity in it, does not make this a Christian film. If anything, this is the worst movie to try and build a natural and/or spiritual understanding of the religion simply because answers are very vague and are completely left up to interpretation. ""Faith-based"" films will leave nothing up to interpretation and tell you flat out the one thing and only thing it is about, faith. This film was not purposed to do that. This film is purely a historical drama about tragic events that happened and how the protagonist makes choices during those tragedies.Thank you, Martin Scorsese, for making a good film that I can actually share with other people and not regret doing so.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Raises serious questions about the meanings of martyrdom and recantation,"It's a historical drama set in Japan, primarily in 1640/41. It follows two young Jesuit priests traveling to Japan from Portuguese Macau seeking their former Jesuit mentor, Father Cristóvao Ferreira, who has disappeared and is said to have renounced his faith. Ferreira is a historical character, as is the person on whom one of the young priests is based.The movie begins in the 1630s with Cristóvao Ferreira (Liam Neeson) watching the torture of some Japanese Christians and fellow priests. It then shifts to 1640 in Macau, where Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) informs Jesuit priests Sebastiao Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) that Ferreira has apostatized or recanted his faith. They refuse to believe him and travel to Japan to learn the truth.Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka), a Japanese Christian, leads the priests to an island with some underground Christians who are harassed by The Inquisitor, Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata), who tries to get Christians to recant by stepping on a carved image of Jesus. In some cases, he also asks them to curse the Virgin Mary.""Silence"" follows the two priests as they try to evade The Inquisitor but agonize over the treatment of the Christians. Kichijiro proves unreliable, recanting multiple times and leading to the capture of Rodrigues. The film then follows Rodriques' interaction with the authorities and his responses to demands to recant to end the torture of the Japanese Christians. By the end of ""Silence,"" we learn the fates of Garupe, Ferreira, and Rodrigues. The film raises serious questions about what constitutes true Christian faithfulness in a highly hostile environment. One does not see apostasy and recantation in the same light after watching ""Silence.""""Silence"" is a remarkable film that raises serious questions about the meanings of martyrdom and recantation. This should be especially interesting (and challenging) for Anabaptist Christians who hold the ""Martyrs Mirror"" as an almost holy book. Garfield and Driver give award-worthy performances. Narration by Rodrigues and a later Dutch East India Company doctor, Dieter Albrecht (Béla Baptiste), provide effective background. The cinematography is excellent.

Masterpiece.,"There is one thing I can tell you for sure: when Scorsese doing a film, he just know how to do it. This movie is just magnificent in the way he looks and sounds; Its just so beautiful, so different, so silence. But if we try to ignore all the wonderful cinema aspects that Scorsese control them beautifully, we can see a small story, about god, about people who love god, but their reality don't give them a chance to express it. and its hard. Its hard to believe in something who's not hear you, who's seems to not care about you. Andrew Garfield plays that young miserable person who don't know how to face his believe in order to his suffering, and he tries to live with those contradictions as much as he can. This is a film about hating god, about un-understanding his silence. This film brings a lot of believe questions that a lot of film wouldn't dare to ask, and that's why I think this movie is a complete masterpiece. Go watch it, its worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Silence is a Good Thing,"The movie opens in pitch black with just the background noise you would hear in a Japanese forest when all of a sudden all sound cuts completely as the title of the movie flashes on the screen. From that moment I knew I'd be in for a great movie and I was right.Silence is a movie not just about faith but more about what that concept means to different people. What are you willing to give up for your faith when others lives are on the line? Is it worth it? These are big questions and Scorsese attempts to answer them in as best a way as he can. Even if at times he doesn't answer all the questions, he leaves it up to the audience to discuss at length afterwards.The story begins as two priests from Portugal head to Japan to attempt to find one of their own who they fear is either captured at best, or he given up his faith at worst. As they make the trip they find themselves thrusted directly into the lives of a town of hiding Christian's during a period of inquisition and fear in Japan. There are a lot of similarities that could be drawn to the inquisition here and those that were held by the Christian's themselves in other parts of the world but that's a different discussion suffice to say that it seems the movie is acknowledging it. It even seems at times the movie asks you to question who actually is wrong and who is right.The performance by Andrew Garfield is the driving force of this film along with some great help from Adam Driver and a slew of wonderful Asian actors. Liam Neeson also gives a memorable performance during the climax of the film. Beyond that all of these performances and moments are assisted by a mostly absent soundtrack, with most moments filled with appropriate silence to make you reflect and draw your own emotion.As you'll find when you look up this movie, it is long. At almost 3 hours it does drag at times if but briefly but I was surprised to find myself at the end thinking it had flown by. The dragging mainly comes at the end of the movie as there are multiple times I thought it would end and then it didn't. The cinematography is beautiful with amazing shots of forests, ocean shores, caves and Japanese culture which more than makes up for the length because it feels like you are glimpsing at something truly majestic.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Scorsese's long-planned spiritual project... But boring,"Once upon a time in the 17th century. Catholic missionaries (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) face their ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor (Liam Neeson) – at a time when Catholicism is strictly outlawed and their presence forbidden.Of all the recent critically praised movies I've watched, ""Silence"" is the one I don't get.I mean, I understand what's happening on screen, and I like the fact that Scorsese realized his long-planned non-mainstream spiritual project... But I find it boring. The first hour or so especially.Also, I was not much impressed by the spiritual side of the story. For starters, there's nearly not enough deep conversations and thoughts for this 161 minute movie. Often it feels that the story is really not going anywhere and the main attraction is Garfield's character having glorious mane of hair and making sad faces.The result would mean probably more for Christians but for others, the far and few meditations on God, faith and human nature offered here may wear thin soon. Or maybe I read too much spiritual literature to be carried away by couple of deep lines thrown to us here and there.The Japanese side of the conflict is actually better fleshed out and more interesting than missionaries'. If it was the intention all along, why is the main emphasis on the latter?After watching Hacksaw Ridge"", I quite like Garfield but his character is one-note and doesn't offer many opportunities to flex that acting muscle. There's a limit to how long I can be interested in watching him look sullen and pout around.Driver's character has even less screen time and ends up unused and bland. Neeson is solid as usual but his role is also quite small.Silence"" felt like a Terence Malick movie, with less beautiful sights and more monotone story.I should try to rewatch in the future. Maybe I will understand then why it's so highly acclaimed. If the name Scorsese wasn't attached to it, would the movie lovers still love it so dearly?I watched the trailer before the movie itself and it felt quite generic, just flashes of action and epic moments searching for a proper common ground. Having seen the movie, I gotta say this approach makes a lot of sense. If one wants to promote ""Silence"", one has to make it look livelier than it really is, outside or in.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Silence"" (2016) is a good movie made by one of the best Martin Scorsese. This is surely not the directors most involving movie, but that is because of story. It is an important and unique one, as movies goes. But its also its kinda weak point in my opinion, because at running time 2 h 40 min this movie does drag a bit, but only because of story which is like i said is fresh and important, but as a movie subject does involve kinda hardly.That said, ""Silence"" is a one gorgeous movie to look at. Craftsmanship is a first rate. Acting was great, especially by Andrew Garfield. Script was also very good one because during the whole movie i wasn't bored by it - i was involved but like i said because of amazing craftsmanship, not the story.Overall, ""Silence"" is a very good movie.

life will constantly force you to lose your way,"Silence plays like a religious version of Apocalypse Now, with Liam Neeson being the Marlon Brando type who is stranded in a foreign land and lost his way. Two Jesuit Priests are sent to find him, and the tests and trails of their missionary are a brutal sight to behold. It is a story of persecution, of foreign invaders, of stubbornness and strength of will, and these traits are present with the majority of Scorsese's movies. Scorsese has approached religion in his films before, most notably Jesus Christ in the Last Temptation and the Dali Lama in Kundun, but Silence is his best stab at it because it shows not a crisis of faith but how life will constantly force you to lose your way, going from an innocent and naïve state to a full on corrupt one. Sounds like classic Scorsese any way you cut it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A thought provoking film.,"Silence is a story adapted from the novel by Shusaku Endo, & is based on true events. Two Portuguese Jesuit priests named Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield) & Garupe(Adam Driver), find out that their mentor Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson), has gone missing in Japan. Father Rodrigues & Father Garupe travel to Japan to find Father Ferreira & promote Christianity in Japan. However, propagating Christianity was strictly forbidden in Japan.Silence is an excellent movie. Director Martin Scorsese has given us yet another unforgettable movie after, The Departed(2006), Shutter Island(2010), Hugo(2011) & The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). The script by Jay Cocks & Scorsese is engaging & has flawlessly adapted Shusaku Endo's source material for the big screen. The highlight of the film is the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. All the locales in the movie, look absolutely gorgeous. The lack of a background score, is a one of a kind effect, that works wonders. Not everyone will like this movie though. It moves along at a slow pace & the long run-time doesn't help either. There are also many scenes that are hard to watch & may make some viewers squeamish. The performances are another strong point of the film. Andrew Garfield is mind blowing as Rodrigues. Garfield portrays the various hardships his character goes through, effortlessly. Adam Driver is brilliant as Garupe. Liam Neeson is superb in his small yet significant role, as Ferreira. Tadanobu Asano is good as the Interpreter. Ciaran Hinds is effective as Father Valignano.

God Is Dead . Let Us Pray That Scorsese's Talent Isn't,"Martin Scorsese ? I do remember being asked about religion in a University film class and replying that as far as I'm concerned Martin Scorsese is God . He is in my humble opinion the greatest living film maker in the world today and has been for several decades . It is noticeable that since the turn of the century he has tried a little bit too hard to wow the Oscar academy and considering the big name award ceremonies have effectively ignored SILENCE I did wonder if Scorsese might have shot himself in the foot by making an all too obvious Oscar bait type movie ?The simple , bitter truth is that SILENCE hasn't been snubbed due to Oscar politics but simply because it's not a good film at all . First up it's rather plodding and disjointed movie featuring two protagonists travelling from 16th Century Europe to Japan to find a former mentor and spread the Catholic faith . At no point in the movie was I aware of any time frame . The two priests find themselves established in Japan with Catholic converts but all this seems unnatural from a credibility point of view . There's narration filling in the gaps but this use of voice over is obvious and clumsy expositionThere's also a problem with the acting . Garfield and Driver make for two uncharismatic leads and they're not good enough to carry this mediocre , disappointing film but the supporting Oriental cast are even worse . I noticed this was another serious problem with Scorsese's KUNDUN where a non English speaking amateur cast struggled and failed to bring life to English dialogueThe fundamental problem though is the obvious elephant in the room - religious faith . One wonders if Scorsese is having a test of faith within his own head . The Lord works in mysterious ways . So mysterious in fact that it could be there is no God and our prayers will be met be silence ? It's often impossible to listen to the voice over without thinking Scorsese is having a meta-fictional conversation with himself . Marty if you're reading this every true fan of cinema has total faith in you and we want to see you come out compelling films with existentialism mixed with redemption that even cynical hardcore atheists will enjoy .",5.0,Anonymous,History

A monumental story of persecuted faith and colonial conflict.,"The history of humanity is also the story of violence between conflicting belief systems. The worst of it has always existed along the thin dividing lines that separate the religions of the world. These are perhaps the biggest themes that film can portray, overarching the primal emotions of love, hate, and fear. This is the grand stage on which Martin Scorsese's Silence (2016) plays out an historical drama of epic proportions. It is a political treatise on the nature of faith viewed through a post-colonial lens that explores how one belief system sought to impose itself upon another.As complex as its themes are, the film's plot line is simple. Set in 17th century, two Jesuit priests journey from Portugal to Japan in search of their monastery leader who has reportedly renounced his faith. It was a time when every vestige of Christianity was brutally suppressed by Japanese rulers through extensive public renunciations, torture, and executions. The Jesuits find villages of underground Christians who welcome the priests as messiahs. They administer sacred rites and preach to the faithful who believe the path is restored to the kingdom of heaven. The authorities hear of the Christian resurgence but even torture and killings will not force the villagers to betray the priests. They are finally captured and their choice is to renounce their faith or be forced to watch more killings.Up to this point in the story it is a sweeping narrative of bold adventurism, religious persecution, and richly detailed contrasts between Christian and Oriental cultures. Two hours into the story, the film turns into a psychological thriller when the surviving Jesuit comes face-to-face with the renounced mentor he once revered. The dialogue of this meeting is some of the most existentially challenging commentary upon the nature of faith you will find on film. In portraying the immense chasm between apostate and disciple, the film explores the arrogance of religious colonialism; the interplay of personal ego, faith and self-sacrifice; and the incompatibility of two culturally divergent belief systems. The final chapter of the film provides the narrative space in which the Jesuit must confront his god and himself.By its nature, this is a polarising film. It is criss-crossed with political and religious dogma and the history of colonial conquest. It is rich in Christian metaphor, with several scenes evoking the Passions of Christ, the Crucifixion, and the nature of sin and salvation. Some audiences will view it through the lens of their own religious beliefs, but most will recognise this as a monumental Scorsese work. At two hours and forty minutes it requires investment and some will find the pace uneven. Even here, metaphors are at work as the compression and de-compression of time mimics the tides of religious history. As similar stories could be told in different lands, some might find the portrait of cruelty in Japanese history one-sided. But there is no doubting that this is masterful storytelling with a fine cast and stunning cinematography that offers provocative insights into the nature of faith.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A good film, a great story","Silence is not a film you enjoy. It is however a film that grabbed me from the outset and did not let go. For me the film was simply OK; Scorcese has done a great deal better. Missing for me was a sense of where the main characters were (yes, it was Japan) with regard to the rest of the country. The film had a look of a film with too low a budget to really project time and especially place. That said, the questions raised by the film are questions about the existence of God which I have heard raised many times before. The difference in Silence is that there are actual answers. Not necessarily answers with which I agree. But answers well-enough presented for me to understand how the characters were as enthralled in the Church, in their beliefs, as they were. In short this film gave me a lot to think over. Which is good.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The renunciation of faith, and belief in silence","t the height of his 74 years Martin Scorsese returns to a theme already touching on his filmography, faith, with a dream of being a priest as a boy, Scorsese dominates the subject and enchants the heart of all those filled with empathy, being they religious, Or not (as is my case), but it is impossible not to be touched by Scorsese's narrative which is based on a truthful event. ""Silence"" the new Scorsese film that is one of the best films of the year narratively and technically, was unfairly ignored of the festivals but nevertheless, it is still a great film. The script that follows in a linear way, and even can accompany several points of view, focuses on a single character, centered on an introduction, a beginning, middle and final well defined in his acts the film is complete and even with almost 3 hours, the rhythm does not drop for a minute. We have the story here of two priests who are willing to get more information about a priest who apparently renounced the faith, but that mission is in Japan where Catholicism was a bandit and any reference to it is tortured, psychologically and physically. The name of the film being ""Silence"" is not by chance, the word silence is repeated several times in the film, which denotes a perfect parallel with the Catholicism itself in Japan, where faith had to be exposed in silence, where the Catholics and Jesuits were silenced and suffered in silence, they believed in silence, they hoped in silence, and continued with their faith as quietly as possible, although it became commercially strange, Scorsese was precise and metaphorical his title that accompanies the whole plot of the long . The first technical resource that jumps the eye is the photograph of the film, it is beautiful, it seems alive, it gives hope and at the same time it passes frustration, always illuminating and enriching the details of other sets that are very well too, like the Art direction, make-up and costumes, it's no wonder that photography was the only thing remembered for ""silence"" in Oscar, the film also has great mixing and sound editing, and an assembly that helps the script to leave a movie Long look short and do not annoy the viewer, even if it sometimes gets repetitive. Andrew Garfield is great, and is the big standout in terms of acting, his partner Adam Driver is also great, even appearing little, and what less appears is Liam Neeson, even so, the actor has a giant screen presence and it is impossible Not being fascinated with his character, Tadanobu Asano, who plays a character who serves as an interpreter, also commands very well, his performance makes the viewer stay with one foot behind always in relation to being a character. Martin Scorsese, shows that he knows how to make any kind of film, even though he already works with similar films, Grandpa deserved another Oscar before finishing his career, unfortunately it was not this time, where his film was unjustly ignored, despite being a Great long",8.0,Anonymous,History

My fav Marty movies are usually the violent ones but just because this flick does not have that engaging of physical confrontation I loved about the Departed and Mean Streets does not mean it does not have the same impact. It slaps you across the face especially if you are Christian, especially if you are a person who believes in freedom of religion.Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield played priest ( Even though I think both actors are Jewish) who go to japan to bring back the man who turn them to the faith and bring back the faith to japan only to find a country truly determine to purge Christianity from it. It is not the faith film that I was expecting to let you guys know about, but it was such a powerful story on Christianity that would have you talking like The Last Temptation of Christ.Plus it's a movie that really makes you think about things as everyone will have an opinion about what happen and everyone's opinions would be right and wrong at the same time.Marty proves that he's still a spectacular filmmaker with this one.

Deserving of better.,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that many of those who give this film a low score are rather transparent in their bias against the subject material - we get it, it's hard for you to sympathize with the Christians in this film when you share your disdain of Christianity with the people persecuting them throughout. i.e. you need not be religious to appreciate this film, but atheists without a shred of respect or understanding of faith and religion need not apply.For those interested in a well-written, well-acted period piece highlighting the trials of early missionaries and the persecution they faced at the hands of a culture they didn't understand and whom did not understand them, you may be delighted to find a thought-provoking, if not altogether sobering film about faith and ignorance.One of Scorsese's best and most beautifully shot films to date, but unfortunately won't receive all the praise it deserves in this current world climate; a problem much akin to the hate directed at Christians in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
God and humanity: Scorsese at his deepest,"I had quite distorted expectations towards this film. One review I scarcely read called it a ""sado-maso flick with priests"". And, considering Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield's sleazy mugs, I was almost expecting some perverse variation of 50 Shades of you know what. Well, truth be told, I have never been so wrong in my life.Silence is a story of two Jesuit priests from Portugal, who go to Christianity-intolerant XVII century Japan to discover the fate of their mentor. That's basically all the story on the surface. Beneath it, though, it's a journey much more profound and mind-provoking. A journey that, depending on how deep you're able to analyze the topic, might make you ponder whether religion is a virus that cares solely about spreading, whether the only thing multiple religions produce is people's suffering, whether your high spiritual beliefs and principles are worth letting people die, whether faith really needs the tangible symbolics, and whether god actually cares about people, or the only thing he cares about is being worshiped properly. And that's just the obvious philosophical and theological concepts Silence reaches for, and if you wanna look harder you might find even more food for thought here.Seriously, this is not a film you would wanna watch in a movie theater. Besides two and a half hours of its running time, I spent at least another hour for just pausing and debating over what's going on and what do those actions imply with the person next to me, sometimes digressing from the film's context towards the universal concepts of humanity and civilization evolution. And that rich ground for discussion, something way beyond the scope of a mere review, is probably the most impressive of Silence's achievements.Still, this film is not just its story, which is primarily a merit of the book the film is based on. It's the way that story is told. And I don't know what kind of cinema magic Scorsese put in here, but he has managed to do an almost undoable job: make the film clearly speak to you between the lines, conveying the most complex and confusing and even intimidating topics and concepts without saying much out loud. The silence that finally revealed to Rodrigues the voice of God is probably the same silence in which we can hear everything that this film has to say, and more. It may sound silly or trivial, but trust me: it's no small feat to raise topics of such magnitude - and make them obviously relevant to our turbulent world of today where people kill and die in the name of various gods every day - without being cryptic like Umberto Eco or pop and glossy like Dan Brown. My only complaint about Silence is its ending, opting out of the open interpretation and thus losing the precious ambiguity and at the same time the philosophical potential of such, but otherwise what Mr Scorsese did out here is nothing short of divine, whether you believe in god or not.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Worth Walking Out For,"Yup! I did it! I walked out within an hour of this movie.I solidly agree with a few of the other earlier reviewers who call it out for it's racism and religious propaganda. Sure the scenery and some footage gives it the idea of a ""powerful"" film, but that illusion quickly faded for me. The script was indeed overly narrational and pathetically simple. The depiction of the Japanese as a bunch of belligerent heathens or sociopathic Buddhists was offensive.I'll admit that the trailer sold me that this could be a great movie and I was convinced this movie could be at least half as entertaining and mesmerizing as The Mission (1986), but I am so proud of having walked out of that movie.",4.0,Anonymous,History

However, after a few days, I have come to realise that it was actually one of the most beautiful endings to a movie I have seen in a long time. Not only that, but it is a real ending, and one of sacrifice.I would recommend this movie to anyone, as Martin Scorcese delivers yet another solid installment to his ever-growing list of works.

Impressive,"Challenge: Hollywood managing to get actors who play Portuguese characters to at least pronounce their names as Portuguese people would. Just the surname, come on!It's not always the most engaging film, but by the time it reaches its final moments, Martin Scorcese has won us over with his story of faith, belief, and cultural differences. Even for someone like me, an atheist.Visually, it's a stunning film. At times, it's reminiscent of Herzog, at times Malick, at times Joffé, but also with its own personality and even some references - oh, the way the camera moves - to Japanese cinema. All of this is accompanied by an incredible score.Garfield is excellent (I personally like the narration), Driver and Neeson play their roles very well and credibly, but the soul of the film lies entirely in its mood and what it wants to tell us, more or less slowly.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Scorsese's 'Silence' speaks volumes,"Martin Scorsese has been the mastermind behind some of cinema's greatest triumphs. While some have become pop culture institutions ('Taxi Driver,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Departed'), others have not had nearly as much of an impact. 2016's 'Silence' falls into the latter camp, although this does not take away from the fact that it's a very well done film.In 'Silence,' we follow two Portuguese Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they travel through 17th century Japan in search of their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has gone MIA. While searching for him, the two priests try to spread Catholicism through missionary work - something that slowly tears the two apart, as the religion is under assault from the Japanese government.Scorsese's signature techniques are on full display here, From the meticulous cinematography - which earned an Academy Award nomination - to the use of symbolism and powerful dialogue, 'Silence' is almost a work of art. Between the raw emotion that comes through in Garfield's performance and the persecution that the Japanese common folk experience, there is a lot of pain and suffering to go around. But it's not all for naught. True, the themes at the heart of 'Silence' are dark, but the way the story unfolds on screen is something to be marveled at.Perhaps the biggest issue with 'Silence' is its runtime. At 161 minutes, the film is excruciatingly long. Some may argue this entire length is necessary in order to tell the complete story, but this really isn't the case. And while Scorsese is known for helming films with super long runtimes, sometimes this works better for certain films over others.While 'Silence' may not have been awarded with box office glory or Oscar gold, the film is one that will have a special place in Scorsese's catalogue.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Great filmmaking, cast and locations, but strangely inert (overlong) story","Released in late 2016 and directed by Martin Scorsese based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô, ""Silence"" chronicles events in 1640 when two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) journey to Japan to check on the persecuted church and find out what happened to their mentor, whom it is rumored fell from the faith (Liam Neeson). Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.The Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.In tone and theme, ""Silence"" is reminiscent of movies like the excellent ""Black Robe"" (1991), the solid ""The Mission"" (1986) and the surprisingly great ""Black Death"" (see my review). There are also elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate ""Silence,"" but it didn't work for me. Sure, Scorsese is a great auteur and so the filmmaking is top-of-the-line – the cinematography, the cast, the costuming, locations and score. Unfortunately, the story's not compelling and I never connected with the main character, despite Garfield's quality performance.There's some worthy mindfood (or spiritfood) to glean from the proceedings, however, like: Why does God allow the excruciating persecution of His faithful? Why is He silent? IS He silent? Can a believer be restored after cowardly denying the Lord in the face of torture/death? Can a Christian hide their faith while living in a thoroughly hostile culture? But I didn't buy for a second that the Japanese couldn't conceive of a Deity that transcends physical nature, like the sun, sea or mountain. While the idea may have been alien to their communal mindset at the time, it's absurd to think that no individual man or woman could discern the obvious (see Psalm 19:1 & Romans 1:20).Although I'm sorta glad I saw it, ""Silence"" is curiously dull and overlong; and so I never care to see it again. There are far superior movies that tackle similar topics. Those who give it the highest possible rating must be fanatical devotees of Scorsese.The movie runs 161 minutes and was shot in Taiwan and the Cathedral Of Saint Paul In Macau, China.GRADE: C-",4.0,Anonymous,History
Praise them!,"There is a fanatical absurdity about the premise of this story. Is the director secretly mocking his subject or does he believe that silent suffering is redeemed in the promise of a second life? I cannot decide which is more plausible.Silence does not deserve the time it has taken to write this brief review. Scorsese throws his all into painting Christianity and Christian suffering as a emotional and spiritually redeemer. We see the Japanese enforcers branded as the villains , but who is the devil and who is the innocent? At its most basic this is a racist film, look deeper and it becomes a lecture on supremacist colonialism. Watch it purely to see for yourself how reality can be twisted to create Christian propaganda so that we may settle into blissful forgetfulness and forget the suffering that this religion has caused in Japan and across the globe.This movie is simple, it is the lowest common denominator, it is base and shameful. I was disturbed and moved, not for the reason Scorsese had intended but by the agony caused of the delusion in this religion. We thank god, we suffer, god stays silent.

"""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message.","Martin Scorsese's historical drama ""Silence"" (R, 2:41) is set in a place, during a time and in a set of circumstances with which most 21st century westerners are unfamiliar, making it difficult for many Movie Fans to appreciate without a little background: From 1603 to 1867, Japan was ruled by a series of military dictators which held the title of shogun and were all from the Tokugawa clan. Early in the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan opened itself up to trade from Europe, which brought in new weaponry like the musket, and also led to the arrival of Christian missionaries. The shoguns soon began to feel that the spread of Christianity in Japan was a threat to their authority. By 1635, Japan passed a series of Seclusion Laws severely restricting trade and immigration. They also passed laws banning Christianity, which led to a Japanese inquisition to discover, torture and even kill practicing Japanese Christians.Based on the 1966 novel of the same name written by Japanese Catholic Shūsaku Endō (and made into feature films in 1971 and 1996), ""Silence"" is the story of three Portuguese Jesuit Catholic priests and their experiences in 17th century Japan. When Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a famous missionary to Japan, stops writing and is rumored to have publicly abandoned his faith, or apostatized, two of his students, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) volunteer to go to Japan to learn the truth, find Father Ferreira and, if necessary, save his soul.Rodrigues and Garupe get a drunken Japanese apostate named Kichijiro (Yōsuke Kubozuka) to help them sneak into Japan. The priests are enthusiastically greeted by Japanese peasants who had been earlier converted to Christianity, then driven underground by the Tokugawa shogunate's persecution. The villagers hide and protect the priests and the priests minister to the villagers by hearing their confessions and baptizing them. Word of the priests' presence soon spreads, which leads to increased demand for their services among the populace – and increased danger from the local Nagasaki-area Inquisitor who is also looking for the priests – and is willing to torture and kill in order to find them.The persecution of Japanese Christians takes a variety of forms as military and government officials try to stamp out the influence of the religion throughout the country. These officials often lay on the ground a stone carving representing Jesus on the cross and demand that accused Christians step on it as a way of denouncing the faith. Those who refuse are subjected to a variety of tortures, often ending in death, making many of them martyrs. As the local governor, Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata), explains, the Japanese have learned that it's more effective to get priests themselves to apostatize, so the officials use the lives of their own people as leverage to try to get the priests to comply. As the priests pray to God for help and wisdom, they become increasingly distressed that they're met mainly with silence.""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message. As such movies often do, this one transports Movie Fans to a different time and place where we can learn a lot and be engaged by a little-known story. In this case, the story is true (with the priests based on actual historical figures, but with some details of their lives changed) and the acting is terrific, but the message is muddled. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, all I'll say is that both religious and non-religious Movie Fans will identify with some of the characters, but many will get to the closing credits wondering what the film was really about and what the point of watching it was. Beyond the quality of the filmmaking and the educational value of the movie, when it comes to singing its praises as an entertaining experience, all you'll hear from me is silence.

A paean to Job,"Marin Scorsese's 'Silence' tells the story of Christian missionaries tortured into apostasy in 17th century Japan. The start of the movie, where the priests lie low, is confusing; the scenes involving murder almost unbearable to watch; the conclusion drawn out, undramatic and slow. We don't really get any sense of what Japanese society was really like, why and how people believed, or even how they lived day-to-day; the focus in relentlessly on the Job-like agony of the priests, heroically refusing to denounce a God who has forsaken them. Liam Neeson is quite good, but I found Andrew Garfield simply whiny in the lead role. In summary, it's not one of Scorsese's better efforts.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Now its known that in the years between 1603 and 1868 there was the Edo period affected by foreigners and different cultures which only led to a growth in economy and probably some Christianity influences, but to recreate an historical film into Japan believes and to make a Christian priest a martyr....no.

"Great for the cognoscenti, rubbish for the rest of us plebs.","Those who watch films for their meaningful content will probably like this, as will those who value the supposed brilliance of direction, production, customary and all the other flummery that goes with arty film making.Unfortunately, I value none of this. What I want is a good story, well acted, well scripted, well directed and with no pretension to be more than good entertainment; I also like there to be little in the way of background noise masquerading as a 'meaningful' score.""Silence"" fails on most of my criteria for being a watchable film. The story is weak and actually makes little sense, with Catholic priests from Portugal wandering around medieval Japan and having no trouble chatting to the natives - highly improbable. The acting does not really match the times and the direction is clearly a 20th century notion of what 17th century Japan was all about. The script likewise. The only bonus was the absence of the usually ubiquitous background noise.""Silence"" is a film heavy on 'meaningful' scenes and symbolism and utterly lacking in attraction to a normal, that is a bog standard film going, audience. It is slow and turgid. Frankly after less than 45 minutes I had no idea what the point was and I was bored rigid, so I gave up. It is clearly some sort of commentary on medieval religious ideas and activities but I'd much rather hear about such things from expert historians than pretentious film makers.Forget that it has Liam Neeson in the cast, he's been hardly seen other than a brief appearance at the very start. Ciaran Hinds likewise appeared very early on and most of the rest of the cast seem to be unknown, at least to western viewers, Japanese. Perhaps these Japanese actors are great stars in their own land but they made little impression on me.Those who have seen it will no doubt be split into 2 camps - those wowed by the cinematic genius of Scorcese and those, like me, who simply want a good film to watch. The first lot will give it 9s and 10s, the second anything from 4 down to 1. I award it 1 as I couldn't even find it reasons to watch it for more than 45 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Silence ShowMeTheMovies Review,"https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-silence.html Martin Scorsese's passion project of 28 years falls upon deaf ears with this reviewer.Upon first glance, Silence appeared to be a long-winded Samurai action flick, with the likes of actors Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver placing high expectations on Scorsese's new offering. In contrast, the film is about the tribulations of religion, and the Japanese' views on the outlawed Catholicism in the 17th century.The plot primarily centres around a character known as Ferreria (Neeson) - a Christian mentor captured by the Japanese - and a pair of his Portugese students Rodrigues (Garfield) and Garupe (Driver), whom, upon hearing rumours of Ferreria having apostatized (renouncing his religious beliefs for the purpose of saving his own life), travel to Japan in order to search for him, whilst remaining unseen by those who would object their faith.This plot, seemingly 90-minute-worthy, is dragged out by Scorsese to the point that the film becomes repetitive. Throughout, Christian persecution is a naturally recurring theme, but there are only so many times one can be shown the death/torture of people - or their forceable denouncement of Christ - before you become desensitised to its' occurrence.Silence, seemingly alluding to not only the silence of God during times of need for the leads, but also to the extrinsic lack of music and/or sound entirely throughout. On multiple occasions, Rodrigues (Garfield) is forced to test his faith, and finds it difficult to accept criticism of such; what he viewed as a slightly dangerous mission to recover his mentor transforms into a far more sinister quest - and Andrew Garfield shakily conveys this by breaking down in tears in almost every scene, upon which he is told that his God is not listening.The absence of music is another poor choice - awkward silences apparent and a disturbing lack of atmosphere. Moments within the film are essentially devoid of sound between dialogue, and special effects in this department are minimal. As a result, the intentional efforts to portray themes of isolation and loneliness fall short, and merely boils down to two and a half hours of little-to-no substance.Alongside this, the singular concept is over-played throughout the duration of the picture - any attempt to change its' plot direction just falls flat and then continues on the same course. Even when Ferreria's presence comes into play, it barely adds anything and Neeson is underused - just more torture, more apostatizing, and more of Andrew Garfield crying, to the point I would just roll my eyes by the end.The acting quality was shoddy to say the least; Garfield and Driver's attempts at (I believe) a Portugese accent sounded like they were trying too hard, and their chemistry lacked (possibly due to the lack of atmospheric noise) with awkward pauses. As Catholics who are meant to have been together for a long time, they did not seem like good friends in any way - arguing about their mission and then just being sad together does not appear to depict a brotherly bond. The chemistry between Ferreria and Rodrigues is slightly better, since Neeson did work well as a jaded fallen mentor - but still lacklustre.The story does not really get anywhere by closing credits - the film just feels very dense, as if I was meant to get the point in it; which seems like it is not apparent at all. The movie gives off a very pretentious vibe like this was supposed to be the next Passion of the Christ, but with the lack of soundtrack and awkward direction (namely, that particularly ridiculous scene in which Jesus himself talks to one of the characters) was closer to watching a film from the era of Ben Hur or Jason and the Argonauts when movies were far more limited.What can be commended is that the writing quality was not terrible - although the length of the film was completely unjustified, and the actors (particularly Garfield) did not pull off the intended notes - the themes are indeed very interesting, and the script itself satisfactory - probably because this film is an adaption from a book written in the 1960s.Silence has many issues overall, and I fail to understand how Scorsese invested 28 years on developing this project, or how the plot could have interested him so much that a 2 hour 40 minute run-time was justified (a 30 minute short would have sufficed). While not awful, it certainly needed much more refinement, and a change in cast that never came. I have little faith in this doing well at box office.",4.0,Anonymous,History

I had major problems with this ""narrator voice"" that goes through throughout the film. It is tiresome and makes it difficult to get into the movie properly. It's getting tiresome to hear, and this narrator also has a pompous language that makes it a little exciting. I think the movie fails to find a nerve that makes it good. Excitingly, it will not be. The film is also very categorical and portray for example Japanese as very one-dimensional. Last but not least, I think it's tedious.

He gives people terrible counsel, spends the whole movie whining rather than showing trust in God, and to say any more about why he profoundly disappointed any true Christian who watched the movie would be to give spoilers",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Troubling, and not in a good way","Scorsese never makes an unwatchable movie, but I was troubled by so much of this film feeling like ""European Christian guys good, Japanese Buddhist guys bad."" Yes, the Japanese tortured Christians during this time, but Scorsese leaves out huge chunks of history that can explain at least some of the behavior.During this period, the Portuguese were using missionaries as a vehicle to make inroads into the Japanese market, and they even trafficked in Japanese peasants in the global slave trade. So Japan wasn't refuting Christianity solely on religious grounds. It was a political rebellion, as well, which is understandable when chunks of your population disappear onto slave ships.But of course for Scorsese to tell his tale, he must make it all about religion, but even on that level, I've no idea what point he's trying to make. Towards the end, when we actually hear the voice of God as a narrator, I knew he had really lost his way. If you can't tell your story just through the narrative, without strange voices stepping in from who knows where, do you even have a story to tell?And then he dedicates the film to ""the Japanese Christians and their pastors."" WTF? Nice swipe at the Japanese on the way out, Marty. Yes, I know you made Kundun (about Buddhism), which I loved, but that was one seriously uncomfortable tribute on top of an already uneasy film. Not my favorite in the Scorsese canon.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Eh, ok. Were any Catholics involved in making this film?","The acting between the three Jesuits in the beginning is awkward and doesn't seem Catholic. The Jesuits seem plastic and not even begin to possess the full range of human emotion. The faith of the actors seem one dimensional. Doubt is what makes martyred missionaries & faithful so heroic. The disagreement by The Jesuits was accurate. The Japanese actors were excellent. The doubt of the Jesuit later was helpful, but still plastic, artificial to human range. It is impossible to capture the nuances of the faith. The grief over the beheading was a bit much. What were they expecting? The emotional outbursts of the priests are a bit much. Martyrs go to their deaths singing and rejoicing. God is not silent. He speaks to the heart for those willing to hear. The silence should be from the priest. The priest's relationship is with and for Jesus. He serves and loves the people for the love of Jesus, not the other way around. The ending was good, though.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Showing an untrue picture of Japan,"I only want to make a point about this movie and that is how it shows the Japanese in matter of religion. It shows them very zero while it is not true at all. If you are a little familiar with Japan or at least watched a few Japanese movies you easily find them very different from what this picture is showing them. They actually know many religion such as heaven, angels, hell, demons, souls, purgatory, wearing white for marriages and black in funerals and even when praying for god they looking to sky. They believe in immaterial totally and miracles too. They know too much that i began to doubt that perhaps in one period of times they had a prophet from themselves too. Of course in this movie the cinematography is excellent but with the help of some CGI so it is visual effects too and not pure cinematography. While if you compare it with a movie like Ida (2013) which won the Oscar for best foreign language film it was pure cinematography and it was in black and white too.",4.0,Anonymous,History

a 2 hour and 40 minutes swamp ride,"Shusaku Endo was a Japanese author who wrote from the rare perspective of a Japanese Roman Catholic. He often likened Japan to a swamp or fen. In the novel Silence, an official tells a priest who has apostatized, ""Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mud swamp, Japan."" One wonders how a native Japanese man could think this way of his own country. Maybe Endo was not a Japanese at all, but a plant from China trying to spread the seeds of Cultural Marxism. As you know everything goes with the Communists, Buddhism, Paganism, Judaism, everything is fine, except that one religion which is Christianity. It must have been a treasure trove find for Scorsese, this book by Endo, to finally direct a movie which puts Christianity away as a religion for fools only. What else can one expect from a movie director whose genre has seen so much cruelty and violence. But the worst of it is that the Chinese -- who are currently reportedly on the brink of purchasing all of the remaining Hollywood Movie production houses in one swoop -- seem to have the last of the remaining Irish Catholic actors, Liam Neeson, lined inside their pockets as well, ironically in the same way as depicted inside Scorsese's Silence. The 2 hour and 40 minute sit through is not only a disgrace for Christ but for Japan as well. Maybe it's time for the Christian Knights to gird up their loins and ride again to rid humanity from this evil filth for all times to come.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Millennials posing as 17th Century Jesuit Priests,"Jumping right into my criteria for movies:Do I believe the story?Absolutely not!Do I care about the story?Impossible.Do I believe the characters?Even less than I believe the story.Do I care about the characters?Not a chance.I wanted to like ""Silence"" -- 7.5 on IMDb, Liam Neeson's in it, and parallels have been drawn to ""The Mission"", right? Scene 1, I was OK. Unfortunately, from the moment I saw the millennials posing with their token superior, arguing their need to rush off to Japan to save their inspiration in some of the most preposterous accents I've heard in cinema, as though they were somehow entitled to make this dangerous journey, I knew the whole movie was on dangerous ground. When they arrive in Japan & meet the clandestine Christians from the local village, they are surprised that the locals, living under iron-fisted feudal Japanese conditions, do not travel around to the nearby villages to share their ideas about Christianity with their fellow countrymen & women -- right, thought I, they'll just grab their Lonely Planet & backpack and take a little tour of the countryside, eh? The best of the ridiculous is when our ""Jesuit Padres"" are in hiding in the hills & the Driver shouts out, that he can't take being cooped up in their little cabin, hidden away under these conditions any more -- I'm finishing his cry: ""I can't take being cooped up in here without my smart phone!""I was ready to turn the thing off about 20 minutes in, but figured I'd give it a chance to get better -- which seldom happens. I suppose I was waiting for Liam Neeson to come along and save the movie or something. I wasted the next 40 minutes of my life watching & then had an epiphany & left the room around the one hour mark. Who knows? Maybe Mr. Neeson did save the movie. I don't care to find out.The script is one of the worst I've observed in a very long time for a movie rated 6.5 or above on IMDb. One of the key premises, the invention of some adversarial relationship between ""Christian"" and ""Buddhist"" is preposterous. There was no ""Christian Brotherhood"" just as there was no ""Buddhist Brotherhood"" in the 17th century. The power brokers of the day used the sects to their advantage, in Europe just as in East Asia. Remember, Queen Elizabeth I lopped off the head of her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. Both Christians, to be sure. There was no ""Germany"" or ""Italy"" in the 17th century. Even the two dominant Catholic powers hated each other and required Papal intervention to keep each other somewhat in check. The same thing was going on in Japan, with different power brokers manipulating the different sects of Zen, as well as other non-Buddhist beliefs, if they felt they could do so to advantage, with bribery, corruption, violence, and torture occurring when convenient. ""Christian vs. Buddhist"" was not the issue of the day. The world wide issue was, anybody who's a threat to a power broker is an adversary, ""Anybody vs. Anybody Else"".Parallels to ""The Mission""? Give me a break! I don't even recall hearing any musical score in this ""Paterson Poseur Goes to Taiwan-posing-as-Japan"" -- must be what they mean by ""Silence"". The only parallels are Liam Neeson and the cinematography. ""The Mission"" contains things like a compelling story, a great script, a fabulous film score -- and extraordinary acting!On a slight positive note for ""Silence"", I did like the cinematography -- I have no objection to the Oscar nomination in that category.. Too bad there were a bunch of play-actors in the movie disrupting the fine cinematography!I will close this review expressing my bitter disappointment with Adam Driver in 2016. I really enjoyed watching his rise in different supporting roles over the past several years & was hoping to see him shine in a lead role. He was pretentious playing poetry-scribbler, Williams wannabe working stiff Paterson from Paterson, and just silly in Silence.As for Garfield, I had Hacksaw Ridge on my list of films to see, but I think I'll opt for the orange cat instead.

The Pharisees were a Judaic sect that interpreted Judaic prophesies that a descendant of David's would resurrect the kingdom of Judah to mean that he would resurrect people. The origin of the word ""christ"" is a Greek word meaning anointed as one anoints kings while the origin of the word ""messiah"" is a Hebrew word meaning the same. Saul of Tarsus used the word ""Christ"" to preach the notion of a new king of the Jews beyond Jerusalem through Greece to Rome.

Shamefully biased and one-sided,"As an expat living in Japan, as well as having studied Japanese History at university, I felt ashamed while watching this film, despite having also been raised Catholic.This frustration is not that the story is not historical but that it is sickeningly one-sided in its evaluation of these events of history. Catholics, both foreign and Japanese, were severely persecuted by the government in this era. It is a fact. However, in this story, anyone who is not Christian is depicted as as villain. I have not read the original book, so I don't know if that depiction comes from the source material.The Edo era remains one of the longest periods of peace in Japanese history. The Edo period brought an end to hundreds of years of civil war and division. Japan closed its borders because it did not want foreign powers interfering in that peace. Now, they did torture and kill people who violated their sovereignty, but those were certainly not a practices foreign to Europeans or the Catholic Church.While this film is an evaluation of faith, it is not honest with itself about the role of the Jesuits in this period of history. Despite that some Jesuit's may have genuinely wanted to convert people in the name of their faith, the true function of the order on a political level was that of a spy agency; reporting back information for the Catholic Church and its affiliated nations to take advantage of foreign counties. This was a system practiced by the church for centuries.The acting is excellent and the filming is beautiful.

For anyone else that likes to watch the good in human nature, this movie will leave you feeling alienated and turned off.This film is painfully slow to watch and didn't hold my attention. The audio engineers really stuck out in a bad way, with VERY noticeable differences between in field audio and dubbed voices. Heck, they couldn't even match the volumes from word to word! Usually these differences are only noticeable when using headphones, but in this movie they were so poorly done you could hear them through a cheap speaker setup.

The Most Disturbing Movie of the Year A Christian Critique:,"Why Christians would recommend or celebrate this film is beyond belief. They really should be ashamed, especially the Pope and his Jesuits. This is one of the most shameful chapters in their history and proves to me that they needed the reformation of the Bible in the vernacular of the people, that they rejected. Yes, it is fiction. The movie is based on a fictional novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo. What is clear is that Japan was at that time closed to the outside world, was a feudal system, had decided to reject Christianity, and reverted to reliance on its indigenous belief system, a syncretic mix of Shintō and Buddhism to bring cohesion to the nation and support its totalitarian methods. It is also clear that there was a priest named Ferreira, there was a great persecution of the church, many Jesuit priests apostatized, they trampled on an image of Christ, called a fumie, and Christianity was officially snuffed out for 200 years. The rest is fiction. How much is Endo and how much is Scorsese, I don't know. Beyond the history, which I find fascinating, I look for worldview and inspiration. This movie fails on both points for me. As far as inspiration goes; the opposite is the case. The movie left me disturbed and depressed. As far as worldview goes, there is a lot here but contra many Christian reviews; it was a story of capitulation rather than exaltation and therefore the exact opposite of the Christian message which ends in resurrection, hope and inspiration. I would not recommend this movie unless the person is mature and thoroughly grounded in the faith. It is potentially hazardous to one's spiritual health. I also look for lessons to be learned. I found a few. Totalitarian lessons: In America it is tempting to think of Buddhism as a benign philosophy that helps us relax and meditate; but in reality it can be a dangerous philosophy that can end in totalitarianism just like any other ism when in power. This movie shows this in graphic detail. The Buddhists that controlled Japan in the 17th century were totalitarian and brutal. They tortured their victims. They deserve to be categorized with all the other regimes like Nazism, Communism, Islam, and Catholicism when it contradicted itself etc.Theological Lessons: 1. Apostasy is real. But unless one repents of this, you do not belong to Christ. Holding a crucifix at the end but living a life of compromise with a brutal regime is a ticket to hell,not heaven. Jesus left very clear instructions about renouncing Him,saying: ""Whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven."" (Matt. 10:33) Leaving the faith is not faith. Wecannot accept the decision Rodrigues made and think everything will be okay in the end. This is what makes Silence so potentially dangerous.2. God has spoken in His word and in the person of Christ and His sacrament. Silence is silence. It is the opposite of speaking. It is a Buddhist and eastern non-logical idea that god speaks in silence. Yes,there is a still small voice sometimes, but it is not silence. All of creation is a universe – one symphonic voice and song. 3. Christ would never tell someone to, Trample on Him. He would never say, ""It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain that I carried my cross."" We know this because this is sign of apostasy, not faith. Hebrews 10:28-29 says, ""He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? Earlier in Hebrews 6:4-6 we read these words, ""For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, If they shall fall away (apostatize), to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.""",3.0,Anonymous,History

Awful movie,The worst movie as it shows that Christianity is better than other religion. The people of Christianity do not have any heart for others. The world knows that Christians are the only people who enslaved people for their greed and forced people to turn to Christianity. The movie shows that Buddhist are cruel. But the Christian people living in Japan are betraying their own country. The people should respect their country and not allow foreigners to change their belief.,1.0,Anonymous,History

Nah. Just Nah,"Just because Scorsese is undoubtedly a great cinematic genius it doesn't mean everything he does is great. The fawning reviews of Silence are, frankly embarrassing. For a very simple reason: despite the apparent themes, there's neither true faith nor spirituality here that remotely rings true. A true Christian would not allow so many innocent people to be tortured to death for what he pretends to believe in. There's religious self-indulgence here but very little heart, very little humanism, hell, very little genuine emotion. If a project takes 30 years to be born it should perhaps be let go of. This is a stillbirth right through. There's more humanity, emotion, love, hell, even Christian attributes in Ray Liotta's character in Goodfellas than in the whole of this movie with its assorted priests and their conceits. The idea of missionaries is a peculiar form of mental health issue spawned by the church empires of the European middle ages. But this movie skirts around this issue and never bites the bullet. While I do not for a moment condone the cruelty of the Japanese as depicted here, I totally get the sanity of their reaction time these invaders who would presume to change a centuries old cultural system. And Andrew Garfield does come across as someone mentally ill, living in a world of his own, totally divorced from the physical reality he lives in, a mission without real people in it. His gawky looks are also unfortunately not suited to this sort of project. His Adam's apple has a life of its own, a very distracting thing that costuming should perhaps have taken care of. The one single most brilliant scene is when the Japanese inquisitor narrates the story of the Japanese nobleman with the four beautiful concubines who were banished for quarrelling and vying for his favour. Thus he found peace. A powerful parable of how Japan saw the various European powers trying to infiltrate Japan. Emotionally I'm with the Japanese sentiment here, and I'm as European as Scorsese is. Scorsese should have listened to the point made by his very own script. Three stars for the gorgeous cinematography and the brief glimpses of Adam Driver.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Not for a contemporary audience,"Apparently Pope Francis loves this film, and I suppose that must be the target audience. Unless you're catholic, the theme of this film is simply out of date and the questions it asks are antiquated. As many have pointed out, a more contemporary question to ask today for this story would have been what the hell the Jesuits were doing in Japan in the first place. I know Scorcese touches on that, but the problems is that it amounts to little else than an obstacle to overcome for the main character in his struggle with his faith. The film does devote some time towards understanding the position of the Japanese authorities, but this is a completely toothless concession as the film simultaneously refrains from looking at any ulterior motives of the church or the foreign powers' interests in Japan. The only major question that is asked about the priests concern their faith in god, and that movie has already been made hundreds of times before. A less introspective perspective could have made this story actually interesting, but as it stands, it feels like a film from the 80s, a throwback to Scorcese's 'The Last Temptation'. Indeed Scorcese probably should have made this film half a century ago, and it might have been his 'The Mission', but as it stands, it just doesn't feel relevant any more.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Be warned: sacrilige,"1. The movie is deeply sacriligious. Martin Scorcese himself is not religious, and the film is way too liberal with passing judgment on actions that amount to sacrilige. Silly things happen, such as supposedly Christ telling someone that it's ok to commit sacrilige.2. There is absolutely no reason for the film to be 2.5 hrs long. It's about 1.5 longer than it needs to be. It's just boring throughout.Better to watch Paul, Apostle of Christ.",1.0,Anonymous,History
White man and his imperialist belief in masochism,"But seriously, this glorification of pain by Christians was unbearable with great cinematography and direction (which was on par in the 1971 version just the difference being time and budget) and amazing acting. And that too in the guise of questioning the silence of God while it is actually accepting God's silence as blessing for the afterlife through the suffering in this life. All of this while clearly seeing the other culture and religion as inferior. The acting and the fact that some of the anguish is being spoken so that you would see something else other than the Christian arrogance is the only thing that was better in this from the 1971 version.",5.0,Anonymous,History
TOO long TOO boring,There is another movie from 1991 called Black Robe. It was about the Jesuits trying to convert the indians in Quebec at about the same time.

"Watch ""The Mission"" (1986) instead...","Watch ""The Mission"" (1986) instead...Martin Scorsese is trying to copy his own material. And the original ""Mission"" was brilliant. Cant be copied.

Simply laughable. It actually could be funny, IF only I were drunk enough to forget I have ever seen the brilliant ""Mission"". But I am not drunk, hence this movie ""Silence"" is an afront, an insult, to the earlier brilliant classic ""The Mission"".For all those who have never seen director Martin Scorsese's earlier work, this movie might be edible.

Silence as in boring,"''Think of the suffering you have inflicted on these people,"" says the guard to one of the invading priests.Exactly my thoughts.Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Departed. It's all just high-gloss violence p-rn, explicit or implied, p8ked on to the screen to be lapped up by audiences already over-satured with cinematic (and real) violence. When he doesn't have explicit violence to splash across the screens, as in The Irishman, he's just super boring. In all cases he has almost nothing to say.Whining Samurai is just more pointless nastiness alternating with dull exposition and bloviating about faith.Other than that it's great !",3.0,Anonymous,History
