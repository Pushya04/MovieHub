Brilliant and motivating,"Ben Stiller is Walter Mitty, a man who looks as if he does nothing, is nothing and is perceived as nothing. Except for during his little fantasies in which he is a hero, but during these weirds moments in which he dozes off, others write him off.Until he finds a goal in life, which puts in him adventurous situations by accident, which transform him in the man he always was. A unique individual, an adventurer, a dreamer who fulfills his dreams and finds the appreciation he needs and deserves. But the appreciation doesn't come from other, but from himself.What the movie does brilliantly, is make the watcher feel connected to Walter Mitty and feels with him. You'll find him goofy, but likable. Your respect for him will grow with every minute, and at the end of the movie, you'll love him. Maybe you even recognize your own milestone moments, mountains you have climbed, seas you have sailed, so we all are bigger than we are perceived, as long as you have that respect and confidence from within.Props to Ben Stiller. Jim Carrey had his Truman Show, Will Ferrel had his Stranger Than Fiction. Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty should be in that group.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7.3 but still underrated,"My first watch in the cinema was ok, but somehow I was expecting more, what exactly, I'm not so sure. 2nd watch without the expectations was much better. 3rd watch and I now think this is an exceptional film, good story line, strong performances, the scenery, the soundtrack, it's like Indiana Jones decided to become the lead singer of The Strokes or something like that, nuts I know. A solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"In a busy world, Walter Mitty is our spirit animal (****)","It might be difficult for choosy audiences with cynical dispositions, but if we can look past the pesky product placement in ""The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty"", we're left with one very, very good film. Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a negative asset manager for Life magazine- basically, his is the department responsible for bringing in and processing the film from the field that will go into the magazine (and by his 'department', I mean Walter and his assistant (Martinez) ). In essence, in the time Walter has worked at the publication, the very soul of the magazine has been processed on his watch. It's prescient, that his seemingly simple position holds so much sway, but we'll return to that idea.His problem, it seems, is that he daydreams. Mind you, this isn't the type of absent-mindedness that you or I take part in. Walter misses large chunks of actual time in his fantasy land, jolted back to reality by silence, love interests, or transition managers. In his escapes, Walter is well-traveled and mysterious, interesting and not invisible to others. He's confident and allowed to pursue that which he wants. In other words, he's the full version of himself. I like how this film pulls back the comedic reigns here- Stiller too often becomes, well, Stiller, and overdoses on the comedy. Here, the humor is subtle and fits the tone of the film. It also doesn't pander, or make us feel sorry for Walter. There's a very good reason his life is the way it is, and again, it's presented without pretense.I mentioned a transition manager, profiled in full douchebag by Adam Scott. Well, the print version of Life is going under in this film, and switching to an online format. Positions like Walter's are likely to be eliminated, as well as accounting spots like the one Cheryl (Wiig) holds down. However, before the end, they want to send up one last issue, and long-time contributor Sean O'Connell (Penn), who has sent a roll of film containing an image he specifically wants to become the last cover. The problem is that Walter has either misplaced it, or it was lost along the way. This causes him to seek it out, thus finally spurring him to make his fantasies become, well, realities.I think a good portion of society can identify with an individual that finally lets loose a bit, that allows himself, finally, the adventure he deserves. A lesser film would make these emotional breakthroughs farcical, ala ""Last Holiday"", but this is subtle and decent. That's why the big reveal of what that last cover image is a fantastic moment. I believed in this Walter Mitty as a hard- working guy who missed out on life thus far due to some bad luck. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy.I caution those looking simply for a pandering, feel-good story around the holidays. That's not what this is. Instead, Stiller and crew have taken the spirit of the source material and adapted it to our world. Granted, there are a few goofs- for example, Walter seems keen on good rock music and skateboard culture, but he isn't aware of a popular David Bowie song? Also, how does one get a clementine cake, sweet as it may be, through customs? Those things don't doom the film, but I do feel it's another reason this will divide people- those that claim this has nothing to offer but cynical product placement messages, and those like myself that sense a broader theme of becoming who we want to be, and understanding where we lose our way. That's a powerful thought, and this quietly beautiful film has the sense to not beat us over the head with it. After all, the film does tell us that ""beautiful things don't ask for attention"". That's certainly a statement that a number of filmmakers could stand to hear more often.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a Shame...Ignored at the Box Office,"There is a World, in the Head of Walter Mitty that Does Not Exist, but don't tell Walter Mitty because that is His Escape.What a Movie it is, this Incredibly Infectious Film. It is a Humorous, Touching, Visually Arresting, Romantic, Beautiful Escape. You could say that it is an Atypical Film as it goes Against the Grain of Current Bottom Line Procedures.It is and most Likely was a Hard Sell. It's not the Latest Gross Out Comedy of Wallowing, Witless Pubescent Pandering. The Kind that Thinks that Creativity is Showing a New Way to Watch Someone take a Pee or Hurl Upchuck in Slow Motion. No this is a Somewhat Subtle, Warmhearted, Slice of a Life that No One Notices. He is a Plainly Dressed Man that Sports No Tie or Stubble.The Market Men, those Profit Pursuers were Right. They Know the Audience Out there and it has No Tolerance for a Masterpiece of Chicanery with Charm. The Movie was a Flop out of Gate. It Bombed in the U.S. and that was Predictable. But Ben Stiller has Made an Enduring Epic of a Production. The Film is about as Good as it Gets for this Type of Hardly Ever Made Movie that has No Target Audience, as it Presents its Comedy, Action, and Adventure Without the Aid of a Caped Crusader or a CGI Monster.Everyone Involved in this Glorious Film should be Proud. It is Life Affirming, Inspiring, and All the Good Things that We Need now and then. An Entertaining, Uplifting, Soul Searching, Artful Experience that Movies can be at Their Best. It may not be the Success Financially that Bottom Feeder, Bottom Liners want to make but in this Case it was Worth It.Nothing this Good should be Ignored and should be Seen by the Very People that won't See it. It just Could take the Edge off that Cynicism, and Make Them Feel Good. The Movie Might just Find a Place in Their Heart. That is going to Make Some Uncomfortable. Maybe that's why They Stayed Away in Droves.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Utterly Mesmerising Spectacle,"'Tropic Thunder', 'The Cable Guy', 'Zoolander'... Ben Stiller has created some entertaining comedies, but 'Walter Mitty' is by far his most audacious piece of direction so far. The story is solid and the cinematography is stunning, Stiller has created an utterly mesmerising spectacle that follows the same basis of the 1947 classic starring Danny Kaye. Whilst I found the majority of the film charming and entertaining, it's the beautiful cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh that really sells this flick, and in my opinion should have been worthy of an Oscar- nomination at the least. One of the most entertaining comedy-dramas I have seen in recent years, a film that Stiller should be proud of.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most beautiful looking film of 2013,"I saw this movie on a special sneak preview event. I admit being utterly mesmerized by some of the trailers. I did really enjoy the film. It has a nice message and is definitely a feel good movie. There is nothing wrong with that. For me, this is the most beautifully looking film I've seen this year. The cinematography and camera shots were fantastic - right up there with Life of Pi and Gravity. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I personally enjoyed Ben Stiller in a more serious role. The film has comedic elements but everything is a bit more subtle and reflective of a man trying to find his inner courage and voice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Those that dream and those that do,"For those who remember the Sam Goldwyn film on The Secret Life Of Walter
Mitty you will find this new version nothing like it. Ben Stiller got some laughs
in for sure, but his general treatment of the classic James Thurber story is far
different than the one that starred Danny Kaye back in the day. Goldwyn and
Kaye opted for straight comedy.Stiller's MItty gets a lot of time to daydream, he's got a job keeping all the
photographs that Life Magazine has had since it's inception. But new management in the form of Adam Scott is shaking things up as Life will now be strictly an on line publication. Still there's one issue to be gotten out and
Stiller has mislaid the negative he was sent from photographer Sean Penn.Penn lives the life going out to exciting and dangerous places to bring back the
news photographs for Life that Stiller only dreams about daily. So in that 
month's time Stiller embarks on a global search for Penn based on some 
very fragmentary evidence of where Penn is. Penn likes the solitary life in a
sense he and Stiller make a complete human being, Penn with the action and
Stiller with the purpose that never gets put into action until now.Some performances of note are Shirley MacLaine as Stiller's mother, Kristen Wiig as the object of Stiller's affections that he hasn't the nerve to speak to
until recently, and Adam Scott who is definitely representative of the Age of
Trump as Stiller's new boss come in for the liquidation of a great institution.Some nice location photography is also part of The Secret Life Of Walter MItty
which in the end isn't so secret any more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So many great moments,"Actually just one of them would make me want to give this a 10/10 and it is very close in my eyes. The scene I'm talking about involves a helicopter and a song that really got under my skin. If you don't feel a thing during that scene ... well I don't know what to say. The whole thing is build upon feelings and dreams. Obviously breaking out of them and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.Ben Stiller might be known for one thing, but we can see with this movie he has a wider range. And the visual/virtual effects he uses help support his vision. A vision of a novel that I haven't read, but sounds more than intriguing even after you've watched the movie. Which cannot be said about most of novels/movies that have been made this way. This is not your typical movie, even though it might hit some familiar notes and go ways that are to be expected. Take the journey and fly with it ...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ben Stiller's version of The Secret Life of  Walter Mitty was enjoyable enough for me,"Before I review the movie proper, let me just say that I'm familiar with both the original James Thurber short story and the Danny Kaye feature movie version. I think I remember liking both good enough but it's been awhile since I read the former or seen the latter. I did like this version starring and directed by Ben Stiller. When he's daydreaming, I managed to laugh heartily at most of them and when he's experiencing his real-life adventures, I marveled at how he's experiencing something he'll probably never do again but will now have tales to tell to future friends or family members. And Kristen Wiig does well in a more straight role that's much different from her more familiar cartoonish parts, like her recent turn in Anchorman 2, and has the same awkward vibe that matches well with Stiller's character. I also loved her singing of that David Bowie song in one of Mitty's dreams. My movie theatre-working friend thought the whole thing may have been too weird for his tastes but I liked it fine and wouldn't mind seeing it again. So on that note, I recommend this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
To see the world. To find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.,"I saw an advanced screening of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" last night. To the right person, this movie is life-changing, life-affirming, and truly beautiful. No, the narrative isn't perfect. The script isn't perfect.

"Colorful, musical, dreamy, and empty.","Based on the same James Thurber short story, this movie is the latest attempt as of this review.Walter (Ben Stiller) leads a complex life as he watches after his mother (Shirley MacLaine), is love-smitten by a co-worker (Kristen Wiig), and must find ""slide 25"" from his hero (Sean Penn).

The Main Problems With This Film (spoiler free),"There's a chance you may like this, in which case I don't really want to taint your expectations with the things that follow. If you like whimsical fantasy and tend to like everything you watch, then don't read on. If you have some taste and a good sense of judgement, then you'll certainly be irked by the film's problems.Its tonally uneven - towards the beginning, it mixes dry office based observational humour with slapstick action scenes. It works for a while, but then changes tone completely about a third in. Now its trying to be meaningful and spirited, but it doesn't quite work. Its still too fantastical to be taken seriously. Some scenes towards the end are so long and boring, lacking any humour or emotional punches whatsoever that you'll find yourself suddenly snapping and thinking ""hey, what's going on here? What am I watching here?""The film uses fantasy daydreams as a plot device, but then after about a third of the way through, drops them completely. They're barely referred to again. Yet, the rest of the film contains elements so fantastical, whimsical and absurd that you WISH he was still daydreaming. Except he isn't. It feels really jarring, and you beg that he snaps out of a daydream so that the film isn't so ludicrous. So many things happen which are absurd. Cell phone calls whilst he's climbing up the Himalayas, having been travelling for days by this point. Flies at the drop of a hat, with just his briefcase, then has an endless supply of clothes and appropriate gear. Hasn't been or done anything interesting but is suddenly an expert skateboarder. He jumps into a helicopter being dangerously piloted by a drunkard, based on some fantasy encouragement by one of his daydreams. What kind of message is that? Live your life! Be reckless! Do dangerous things whilst drunk! Your friend drink at the bar all night? Hey, live you life, let them drive you home!His motives are never really clear. He goes to search for a lost negative from a photographer - because he wants to a) travel or b) keep his job? If a), then he could have picked plenty more goals and destinations, and the drive to start now isn't particularly strong. If b) then there are plenty of other ways to do it, and it makes no sense (he could have just said the negative was missing from the package).His personality is never really explained. He processes incredible photographs for a renowned international magazine, yet hasn't been or done anything interesting at all in his life? If his imagination was that active for his day dreams, then surely he'd have put it to better use by now? And if he has some huge fear barrier to making decisions (as shown in the opening scene) then why? Whats the emotional truth here, and how will he resolve it? Its never answered - but when he does finally go travelling, he experiences no fear at all (except for a stupid scene where he literally fights with a shark).The message of the film seems to be ""make your life more interesting, and do things, so that the opposite sex will find you more attractive"". This is a really superficial, shame based message, the complete opposite of films which imply ""be liked for who you are, not for what you do or can provide for people"".Ben Stiller plays it pretty dry and wooden, without expressing much emotion at all. I can't remember him laughing, looking sad, scared, exhilarated, nothing. Even when skateboarding down a mountain, he has the same facial expression. His lack of emotion throughout makes it hard to really engage with the character or care at all about this fantastical adventure he's supposedly going on. Sean Penn's acting is, as ever, fantastic, but feels like it really doesn't belong in this film.By the end, it feels like a massive advert for eHarmony.It also feels like a very bad imitation of the much superior film Joe Vs The Volcano.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding,"I expected this to be funny and perhaps a little goofy. What it is is a breathtaking work of art. This is Ben Stiller at his best. The movie is just wonderful. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. It's entertaining throughout. The pace may seem slow at times to those used to action packed films, but I personally don't care for nonstop technically enhanced action scenes for no apparent reason. I've been hoping people would tire of those for some time now, so we can get back to good stories again. This was a great story, loosely based on the original short story by James Thurber. I wish there were more movies out there like this. That would definitely get me back into movie theaters. As well...the acting was superb all around. Kristen Wiig was outstanding--as usual. I think this may be her best work as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An enjoyable and endearingly odd picture with a surprisingly delightful, if obvious, message.","While the fantasy sequences seem a little out of place and ultimately become distracting within the overall narrative - though it's their absurdity that provide the majority of the film's sparse laughs and they are entertaining in isolation, 'The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty (2013)' is an enjoyable and endearingly odd picture that occupies that strange space between comedy and drama, once the realities of the narrative are set into motion, all while spewing it's impassioned and somewhat sentimental message about seizing the moment and living life to the full. Rather than relentlessly beat you over the head with it's life-loving lesson, however, the flick lets it lead the plot into new places and bring a heart-warming joy to the admittedly absurd events portrayed. Therefore, rather than annoy, it actually delights. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Walter Mitty"" misfires on several cylinders...","NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: The East Coast crowd was the first to finally get a look at Ben Stiller's long-awaited remake of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" in which he stars with Academy Award nominee Kristen Wiig and Academy Award winners Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. Expectations were high following a trailer that wowed many with its visual style and seemingly interesting premise. In the end, Stiller's take on the 1947 classic is rather bombastic and brings forth narrative clichés and messy executions. This isn't to say it's a complete misfire. There are definite and obvious positives to take away.The entire camera work by Stuart Dryburgh, most notable for his work on Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" twenty years ago, is smoothly appealing with stunning shots for the audience to sink their teeth into. As the film travels throughout different parts of the world including Iceland and Greenland, two places that haven't been explored that much in film according to screenwriter Steve Conrad, are stunning. We have to give credit to director Stiller who knows how to frame his films exceedingly well. There are elements where he takes his cues from films like ""Stranger than Fiction"" and ""Garden State."" At the press conference he mentioned watching ""The Apartment"" with the cast in order to get a feel for what he wanted this sprawling epic to feel like. Unfortunately, ""Walter Mitty"" doesn't resemble nor bring any of the feelings that the Oscar-winning Best Picture was able to achieve.Attempting to take Stiller on as a ""visionary"" director seemed a bit far-fetched when his filmography have included the comedic greats like ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Reality Bites."" This is surely his most ambitious effort he's attempted. One thing is for sure, Stiller hasn't been this good in front of the camera in his entire career. While the narrative structure of ""Walter Mitty"" is incredibly uneven and stereo typically constructed, Stiller puts some of his acting chops forward. It's good to see him in something like this. A Golden Globe nomination could definitely come his way. Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce, misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story. A ""Benjamin Button"" joke, though funny to watch, provides no purpose to our tale. I'm also tired of watching the ""nerdy office guy"" transform himself into the cool and collected man by film's end. Note to filmmakers, just because your main character is in a shirt and tie at the beginning of the movie, you can't just let them grow a beard, put on a sweater and jeans, and suddenly the audience is supposed to believe he's this ""new person."" This movie is an epic fantasy tale about a man who daydreams about things that would be more outlandish than the real world. There's a false sense of reality when we're in the ""real world."" Jumping on a plane, suddenly flying across the world, and then receiving cell phone reception in the Himalayas is not exactly something that would happen in today's age.Kristen Wiig really tries, god bless her soul. Playing our love interest Cheryl, Wiig is a recently divorced, single mom who, for no real reason whatsoever, takes an interest in Walter's ""mystery"" that he must solve. Wiig's ""moment"" is unfortunately cut short by a directorial choice by Stiller. A scene of her playing guitar and singing the first few bars of ""Space Odyssey"" by David Bowie builds up before being cut short by an insertion of the original number. Wasted. It did make me pop it in on my way home so I guess it's not a complete miss.Oscar winners Sean Penn and Shirley MacLaine are the best of the cast, using their veteran style and wits to make a wonderful and memorable impression. Same goes for Kathryn Hahn, who needs a great role in the near future. She's versatile in comedy as we've seen in ""Step Brothers"" but she excels just as well in serious, heartbreaking turns like in ""Revolutionary Road."" She doesn't have much to offer our tale in this case. No fault of her own. Should also mention that Adam Scott from NBC's ""Park and Recreation"" is probably one of the funniest villains of the year. His comedic timing is pretty spot on and continues to shine in sleazy, douchebag roles.Let's not forget that this tale builds up to a final image that is rather anti-climatic and much of a letdown. I can appreciate the respect and passion that Stiller has for the source material and more times than not, the film is entertaining. Mass audiences will probably fall for it in a big way especially around the holidays.From the looks of it, the film is going to be incredibly divisive. Some will love it, others will be disappointed. I unfortunately fall more towards the latter of that equation. ""Walter Mitty"" is a decent time at the movie and is definitely in contention for several technical Oscars. Things like Production Design, Cinematography, and Visual Effects are possibilities.""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" opens in theaters December 25.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film made for people and life,"From all the movies I have ever watched, this made me feel human. I never thought that a movie could personify unpredictability, loss and love as well as this move has. If you are a person, living the ""dream"", you will probably find this movie dull, or for the lack of a better word, boring. However, portrayal of the human condition is transcended.Some of us struggle to find joy in our daily jobs, despite touching people in a way we never realized. Some of us have lost hope finding someone special, even though the future is so unpredictable. Some may think our lives are basically over, unknowingly realizing that it has only begun. Some misjudge the value of family, discovering that family has been watching out for you all along.If you have ever felt like this, this is the movie to watch. A feeling of warmth will arouse you. True, you may never discover the world or perhaps find meaning in your day job, but being happy with who you are is a certainty. Ben Stiller, a traditional charismatic actor, has found a way to portray what it is to be normal. By doing so also portraying what it is to be extraordinary.I highly recommend this movie. Do not expect action, all out love or comedy. Who you are, as a person, watch this movie and open your heart to possibilities. Who knows? You might find inspiration!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
heartwarming,"Ben Stiller is a master of acting through reacting. This kind of role, where he is the straight-laced guy forced reluctantly out of his comfort zone into action, is the one he is made to play. As Walter Mitty, a man with no words to complete the 'been there, done that' field of his online dating profile, he gives a touching, genuine performance of a man who learns to enjoy life, and gets what he wants by doing what he fears. The trailer is full of the CGI explosions, helicopter jumps and shark attacks. But this film works best in its low-key moments: Walter's awkward exchanges with Cheryl, his chiding of Sean's haphazard handling of #25. There is a funny, lovely hug with a colleague in an elevator. And the final shot of this film, revealing a photo that I thought we were destined never to see, is truly moving, a quiet, powerful moment all too rare in cinema. The script has heart and resists the temptation to go for easy pastiche. A simple tale, well told, and honest in its appeal and payoff.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great experience!,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the preview. I was a big fan of the original story, and although I knew the movie would be very different, I could see that this would end up being one of my favorite movies. I was not disappointed.Ben Stiller is perfect as Walter Mitty. His performance was exactly what I wanted. There was one scene in particular that seemed a little out of place, but then again you have to remember that Walter Mitty has a very active imagination. Ben Stiller's performance was so engaging, a nice break from his usual slapstick roles (which I also love). If you are hoping to see him doing one of his usual humorous roles, you will be disappointed. If you want to see him capturing the emotions of a man that has a hard time expressing himself, you will love this movie.The visuals in this film were particularly fantastic. From the New York offices of LIFE all the way to Iceland. Every scene was perfectly captured and just beautiful.Finally, the soundtrack. While I was definitely distracted by the visuals and Ben Stiller's spot-on performance, the soundtrack deserves a nod as well. Every song fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There are a few scenes that stand out as particularly wonderful, and I'm sure you'll know what I mean once you see the movie. This will definitely be on my shelf once it is released.Really my only criticism is Adam Scott. While he is great at playing the jerk boss, his beard is very distracting. It looks fake, as if they pasted it onto his face. Other than that, I think the movie was pretty much perfect and can be enjoyed by anyone looking to see a beautiful movie about a man with a very active imagination.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring and banal......,"Definitely one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Stiller's mediocre acting ability isn't even worth one tenth of Danny Kaye's and this feeble attempt to remake the glorious original is an insult to the greater (and hugely funnier) actor. The Stiller character is just a geeky, annoying loser who I found difficulty finding any empathy for. There were a few genuinely funny moments in the film but mostly long periods of complete tedium. Sean Penn was wasted in a pointless cameo role and the entire storyline was implausible and lacked any real substance or depth. The female love interest wasn't even very interesting, but then, looking at Stiller's character, it's unlikely that he would be aiming high.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very very rewatchable,"I didn't get the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Danny Kaye always made me uncomfortable. This is a much different remake about a photography processing expert at the to-be-revamped Life Magazine who has to locate the negative for the shot which will cover the last published edition of the magazine. Ben Stiller is usually very accessible as an actor, we can get into his head and relate to his predicaments and his solutions. That is never more true than in this movie, maybe because Ben also directs as well as stars. Kristen Wiig is also fine in an understated manner as the girl Ben would like to get to know better. Some of the fantasy sequences (Walter has a penchant for day dreams, often at the wrong time) were a little hard to follow. But some of them worked grandly, particularly Wiig's acoustic rendition of Space Oddity at the Greenland bar, which is a magical and pivotal moment in the movie. There are many breathtaking panoramas of the places visited by Mitty, mostly filmed on location in Iceland. Each time I see this it grows a little more on me, and the enchanting musical score compliments things very well. This sort of has to be taken on its own terms but on those terms it is a very very nice work.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent and elegant.,"I loved this movie. I know some critics say this movie is like flicking through a National Geographic magazine. I disagree, this movie is a well-balanced triumph. Fantastic views, simple yet wonderfully poignant story line and strong lead actor. Kristen wig and Sean Penn had unidimensional roles within the movie but they are not the leads. The humor was tasteful, adequate and well placed. It was such a pleasant surprise from your day to day blockbuster and I strongly prefer this movie to the desolation of Smaug which I watched the night before. Ben Stiller has managed to achieve an impossible feat with this movie, an elegant contemporary film without excessive emotional histrionics or sexual overtones. Strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a modern take on life. Just like the lead, Walter Mitty is your everyday guy doing an everyday job faced with realistic modern day issues. One day, he takes a leap of faith and that has made all the difference. How can anyone not love this movie?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Walter Mitty comes along with a happy holiday movie!,"Remember a few weeks ago how disappointed I was after seeing ""Saving Mr. Banks""? I warned you all not to take your children - and without spoiling the movie - told you it is not all mice and princesses - this Disney movie? It was not a feel good movie AT ALL. So imagine my JOY when - halfway through - I realized Walter Mitty WAS a GREAT movie - and I actually felt good when I left. No depression. No worries. No tears! For The Win!!! I have always been an optimist, a big time dreamer. There have been many times in my life people have looked at me like I am INSANE for ""trying this"" or ""going there"". I recently saw a Cary Grant quote that resonated big time with me: For example, I always wanted to be around actors and film making, and I am a movie junkie (obviously). I love movies because of what is going on that the viewer never sees. I love the imaginations that bring these stories to life. So I spent 40+ years on the outside looking in - until I decided to start making things happen. Yes, I know..Turbine wasn't even in theaters, but I got to be involved - and that was a BUCKET LIST moment and I was TERRIFIED and no one can ever take it away from me. Yes, I know - it's only a small broadcast station in Missouri - but I still work there. Yes I know, I just sell TV ads for my real job - but I still get to work with talented artists who help bring dreams to life. Yes I know, I am not a ""real movie critic"", but I still get invited to screenings, I have interviewed two actors and have my first author interview later this month. Yes I know my review segment on TV is less than five minutes long, but I still get to talk about the movies that I love EVERY SINGLE WEEK on television. So go ahead - sit in the stands if that is what makes you happy, but some of us like to get in the game. Some of us don't care what others think - we have been the ""have nots"" our entire lives and that is what makes us ""artsy nerds"" the fairest of them all. END OF SCENE....moving on to my review...lol Walter Mitty gives us all a chance to be dreamers; with every step he takes we can drift off into our own sea of dreams, and wonder quietly - would I? could I? - if given the chance? Too many people live their lives with ""Ifs and Buts"" and poke fun of those of us who are dreamers.There were so many things I loved about this movie, too many to mention really - mostly I loved the ""Do You know ANYONE in Los Angeles moment?"" That was my favorite.No wait, I also loved the big ""Cover Reveal"" of the LIFE magazine- I loved the way Sean got so close to Mitty but never met him in person - his purpose was profound.Or was it the physical transformation of Mitty that I didn't notice until the very moment Cheryl notices? Because I really loved that moment too..I loved the casting of Sean Penn - perfect for the part. One of the greatest lines in the movie: ""Beautiful things don't ask for attention"" ~ Sean O'Connell I saw this movie on Christmas Day, which is a pretty risky move. It was a risk well worth taking. This was one beautiful little movie. And this chick highly recommends!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ben Stiller's Labor of Love,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a short story written by James Thurber way back in 1939. It was about a henpecked man who escapes into a fantasy world of danger and heroics to compensate for the depressingly dull real life he leads.Screen writer Steve Conrad adapts the title and the name and over-active imagination of the main character and tells his own original story. Ben Stiller directs and stars in this obvious ""labour of love"" of a movie project.Walter Mitty is a timid guy who tends to ""space out"" and enter into a world of his own where he is able to do wondrously heroic exploits. He would rather join an online dating service than to meet this girl Cheryl at work that he fancies.One day, he misplaced the precious negative of the photograph meant to be the cover of the last issue of Life Magazine. As his job is on the line, Walter needs to look for Sean, the globe-trotter photographer who took that missing photo. Upon deducing that Sean was in Greenland, Mitty suddenly decides to throw all caution to the wind and just go on a difficult quest, which will be the biggest adventure of his lifetime.Visually, this film is perfect with its breathtaking cinematography and unobtrusive special effects. Many scenes, particularly those showing Walter skateboarding in Iceland, or climbing the Himalayas, were very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles.The script does fall into melodrama, but I did not mind this. Ben Stiller was very good as Walter, capturing his shyness and cluelessness so sensitively. I liked Walter's moments with his mother, played by Shirley McLaine in a subdued likable manner. I also liked Walter's awkward romance with Cheryl played by Kristen Wiig, in only the second role I have seen her since ""Bridesmaids."" She was also very relaxed and natural here in a straight role. Too bad we do not see the full strength of her comic skills.I cannot deny that I was disappointed with how the story went. Once we reach the second half of the film when Walter actually stops having fantasies and does things for real already. I know of course that this was the point of the film, that dreams were there to be fulfilled. I just felt it somehow lost the spirit of the source short story.Overall though, this was an entertaining feel-good film that will bring us to places we rarely see on screen. The spectacular photography of the exotic settings demand that you see this film on the big screen.Despite lofty comparisons with Forrest Gump, Walter Mitty admittedly does not exactly reach those heights. However, upon watching this film, you will wonder how something so beautiful-looking could have been totally shut-out from Oscar or any other award consideration.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Surprising, and Hopefully Not Lost, Treasure.","December is when big movies come out. 2013's December was no different. The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug and Anchorman 2 were destined to be blockbusters based on the success of the first film's in those franchises. American Hustle, a David O'Russell film that featured Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence (who he had success with in 2012's Silver Linings Playbook) as well as Amy Adams and Christian Bale, was released in the month, as well as Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, which featured fan favorites Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. Critically acclaimed Disney's Frozen was also still attracting viewers in December. With all of these movies, and others that were not even mentioned, there was another great film released in the month: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I read the short story in middle school and saw the vague, yet intriguing, trailer, which feature Of Monsters and Men, over the summer. I almost didn't make time to see Mitty because of the hectic activities of the holidays, work and other movies but I ended up having a free night and watched it. I am so glad I did not pass it up. Ben Stiller is best in his serious roles and Mitty is a surprisingly serious film. Wiig, who also starred in Anchorman 2 last month, also acts surprisingly well in a fairly minor role. The film focuses mainly on the idea of really living your life and by the end of the film the viewer should want to make their own life more active. Truly delightful and perhaps Stiller's second best performance of his career (the first being The Royal Tenenbauns).Let's hope this film was not lost because of the films it was released alongside with.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Present,"In Afghanistan on the snow covered Himalayan Mountains grizzled and world wise Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn gazes at his coveted photo moment. Sean says that all he wants is to be ""in the moment"". Sean Penn is selfless gravitas in this moment as he confides in Ben Stiller's exasperated mild mannered Walter Mitty, who literally travels to the ends of the earth to track down the maverick old-school legendary photographer. Be in the moment and be present in life--are the eloquently poignant lyrics of Director Ben Stiller's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"".I loved the James Thurber short story which Writer Steve Conrad based his update. Walter is the chronic day dreamer, an escape from his ordinary life. At times Director Stiller and Writer Conrad teeter capriciously all over the narrative landscape including a hysterical and touching eHarmony thread. Granted they humorously frame Walter's ""zone outs"" from reality. One obscure gag from ""Benjamin Button"" is nearly wacky enough to spiral into incoherence—fortunately it does not. There is the amazing upside. In a joyously freeing scene Walter skateboards down the winding roads of Iceland; spectacularly filmed by Stuart Dryburgh. Kristen Wiig in a touching turn goes unplugged with David Bowie's ""Ground Control to Major Tom"". All the curious rifting I think is forgivable for its noble purpose. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" celebrates being present in life. No one is alone.Ben Stiller is quietly heroic navigating Walter's transformation into the unknown. His blank stares as Walter ""zones out"" touch the depth of our own vulnerabilities. He is bold, funny, and aware. Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a photo negative archiver at Life Magazine. He has given up on his dreams, taking on the financial and emotional stress of his aging Mom brilliantly played by Shirley MacLaine, about to enter a care home. His sister is flighty wannabe actress Odessa (good Kathryn Hahn), dreams of playing Rizzo in ""Grease"". Walter joined eHarmony so he can date Cheryl Melhof (Kristen Wiig), who works in the same office. Wiig charms as Cheryl, the quirky single Mom of skateboarder son Rich (Marcus Antturi). Cheryl is smart and pretty, and is actually interested in Walter, if he had a clue.Life Magazine has been taken over by another Company. To transition over to an on-line magazine, Ted Hendricks (brilliantly arrogant Adam Scott) heads the restructuring corporate team. Ted is a major jerk— arrogant and not as smart as he thinks. Walter is the sole personal contact of legendary cover photographer Sean O'Connell (Penn). When Sean's photo negative for the cover of Life's last newsstand issue is missing, Ted focuses his attention on Walter. Sean claims this is his best photo of his career. Walter must find the missing negative to save his job and possibly win over Cheryl. Working with Cheryl, Walter starts his search in Greenland. Somehow diverting to Iceland, Walter calls Cheryl from a Papa John's Pizza there. It all ties in.Ben Stiller is inspiring, as ""Walter Mitty"" amazingly never takes itself seriously. The movie joyfully celebrates life as illustrated by the beautiful soccer game with Walter and Sean in the Afghan mountains. Stiller makes us pull for Walter as he reclaims his power. Kristen Wiig is funny and compassionate as Walter's gentle muse. She is surprising. Sean Penn is awesome as Sean O'Connell, strong and whimsically wise. Shirley MacLaine anchors in her Mother's unconditional love for her son Walter, without many words. Patton Oswald nearly steals the movie as Todd, the eHarmony profile adviser. Warm and hysterical he punctuates Walter's transformational journey. Stiller reminds us with humor and soul that Life is wonderful when we are present in it. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is funny and beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is an imitation of a heart, but not a cold one.","When the first trailer of The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty hit the internet, we were in awe. Set to an Of Monsters and Men song that immediately grew on all of us and without giving anything away, it hinted at a cathartic epic that would make us feel creative and free. As a young writer and daydreamer, I loved the idea of incorporating casual fantasies into a script and was very excited to see how it was done in a major picture. It's a shame that this highlight reel was the limit of Mitty's allure. After an over-saturation of marketing, the mystery faded and few were left still intrigued. During that short period of hype, I decided to read the screenplay and it was a huge mistake. Thank god, it was not the draft they shot. I don't even know who would write the draft I read. I loved Steve Conrad's The Weather Man but The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty was terrible, both in how it was written and what was written. It was a rambling mess. I really hoped they changed it but reviews had me concerned.Fortunately, Ben Stiller tightened up the script a lot and although it kept the main storyline and twists, it moves a lot smoother. I have a soft spot for Stiller. He was one of my favourite actors when I first started to get into films. If it wasn't for him, I would've never watched The Royal Tenenbaums and began my Wes Anderson obsession. He's not perfect, but I like his style. Zoolander is great fun, if extremely silly and dated now. Tropic Thunder has its moments, but it's way too bloated. Even though he's exploring something a bit more light and twee, Mitty also had the danger of being bloated but Stiller was able to keep control and let it flow more intimately. Unfortunately, although he's growing in confidence as a director, his presence as the star may the film's biggest downside. We're simply too familiar with him. He isn't believable in his timidness and his moments of growth feel forced. We have a supposedly untraveled introverted character, but we already have many stock images of Ben Stiller in extravagant landscapes in our heads. His Walter Mitty adventure isn't anything special and that affects the film severely.Perhaps this could've improved if he swapped roles with Parks and Recreation's Adam Scott. I know he's talented, but he was simply awful as Walter's boss, a role that Stiller could have just don the White Goodman beard and rule again with a much better sense of humour. But then, would Scott have been believable climbing mountains and evading shark attacks? I don't know. But it would've felt better to watch. He's more of an underdog type. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig, who seems to be in everything these days was pleasantly charming in a role that she could've easily overdone. In Walter Mitty's first forty minutes, it is yet again a victim of its marketing. In its most confident and entertaining sequences, you can't help but shake off the feeling that we've seen this setup again and again condensed into its several two minute trailers with only a few scenes added. It's difficult to invest in his journey with that much familiarisation. The initial fantasy scenes are hit and miss, some fun, some plain weird. The problem is that the 'real world' of Mitty is a different planet to ours so his fantasies aren't as distinct as they could be and pop culture references feel strange and out of place.However, if Walter Mitty is assured in anything, its the aesthetic. That's what everyone talked about when that trailer hit, it was all about the cinematography. Now, it's certainly an improvement on Stiller's other films but it comes with its problems. Too often the frame feels too wide. It makes the characters too grand rather than capturing isolation. They don't feel like ordinary people doing extraordinary things, these are movie stars and it takes us out of the fiction. But the film still has its wistful charm with its palette of blues and beiges and its wonderful score. Although sometimes its quirky humour doesn't fit the pacing, it can have a sharp wit, particularly provided by Patton Oswalt's sole in-person scene. It's a film that makes you feel good in shards but it's as mildly irritating as it is mildly entertaining. I'm just relieved that Stiller fixed the script so significantly. The buildup works but it loses points on the weak payoff. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty will work for some who remain believers and even if we could criticise who Stiller is to tell us these messages of how to live our lives when he can clearly afford such luxury. But then who can deny a bit of well-meaning cheerful optimism?6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Visually Stunning But Lacking in Story,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) tells the story of a man on his quest to travel around the world for work duties. But mysteriously the photo is misplaced, leading Walter on a global quest to retrieve it from the enigmatic photographer (Sean Penn). The resulting journey of self- discovery is both physical and psychological as work becomes secondary to personal fulfillment. The film is uneven and episodic by nature, with some awkward transitions between fantasy and reality, showcasing everything from broad comedy to effects-driven action sequences to lighthearted romance involving a sympathetic co-worker (Kristen Wiig). That playfulness is a better fit for Stiller's versatility than the flimsy mystery and the soul-searching voyage that bogs down the second half of the film. Those not willing to completely buy into its concept will find the story logic fundamentally flawed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing special,"Many reviewers' sense of imagination must be really weak to find this film so good.

And as drama comes in destroying his mediocre existence (consisting of his job) he finally finds that experiences out of the ordinary may be more appealing than his stereotyped mental adventures. Wow... There're some nice comedy moments and a nice photography but also some poor goofs.

I just created an account to review this masterpiece of a largely misinterpreted and underrated movie,"Here's a warning for you: I'm probably biased with just how much I love this movie.Reading through the other reviews of this film baffle me. While I find it completely understandable for pretentious people to find this feel-good movie cliche or too unrealistic I cannot possibly understand how people find it boring, I've watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty multiple times and am always completely enraptured with not only the characters and scenery but the use of framing and color. The structured lines, the blue-ish palette that ultimately changes to use red as Walter comes out of his comfort zone. It's obvious and cliche but its beautiful and the humor in it is great even if, sure, I'll give you that it plays off Walter's social awkwardness maybe a little too much- especially given that Ben Stiller isn't exactly giving an oscar worthy performance.I also think that this movie has some of the best uses of product placement I've ever seen. Rather than including a single meaningless and out of place shot of a product to promote it like you might see in a Nicki Minaj music video, this movie incorporates the product placement into the story. Papa Johns has meaning, its not just a pizza place the characters show up to and comment on how good the pizza and service are, it's Walter's first job after his dad dies- he doesn't even like it due to the bad memories it brings up for him. The same goes for eharmony, its not just a way for Walter to get involved with Cheryl, it's a malfunctioning website with a good employee that ultimately plays a role in Walter's journey. How could you complain about product placement like that? Movies cost money and if you think that a movie is bad just because it has product placement you need a reality check and a step down from your ego, especially if the product placement is like this.The hardly talked about soundtrack is a wonderful blend of José González's songs and an instrumental score that combines motifs and González's humming. I had a playlist of it playing on repeat for a week after I watched the movie.This has almost definitely all been said before, but I couldn't leave help myself after reading these reviews from what must be miserable pretentious people who think that a movie is only good if its dark, dramatic, and has no clear resolution. I could tell it was a good movie At The Least from the very first time I saw the trailer. I couldn't care less if you disagree with me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should become a beloved classic.,"'THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY': Five Stars (Out of Five)Ben Stiller directs, produces and stars in this second film adaptation of James Thurber's classic short story (following the 1947 version starring Danny Kaye). The screenplay was written by Steve Conrad (who also wrote such critically acclaimed drama films as 'THE PURSUIT OF Happiness', 'THE WEATHER MAN' and 'WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY'). It's about a day-dreamer who's always dreaming of adventure and romance (often involving his new co-worker) who finally goes on a real life adventure to find a missing photograph. The film also stars Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. I found it to be visually beautiful and emotionally breathtaking; the perfect adventure-drama film for the kid in all of us!Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a day-dreamer in his 40s who is constantly dreaming of a better and more exciting life than the one he seems like he's trapped in. He works at Life Magazine and has recently became romantically interested in his new co-worker Cheryl Melhoff (Wiig). Both their jobs are threatened though as Life Magazine is transitioning into an online magazine and will be laying off a bunch of employees soon. Mitty has worked there a long time (16 years) but his job is especially in jeopardy when he can't find a special photo that Life's photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Penn) has entrusted him with; the picture is supposed to be the cover of the last magazine. Mitty must follow clues, from other negatives, and travel around the world in order to find the missing photo (by tracking down O'Connell).I was really looking forward to this film, from seeing the amazing trailers, and I wasn't disappointed (in the slightest). Stiller has never been more likable and his direction has never been more beautiful. I like his other films ('THE CABLE GUY', 'TROPIC THUNDER', 'REALITY BITES') but this is his masterpiece. The music is moving and perfectly placed and the visuals are stunning. Most of all it's a very relatable and inspiring film (for me at least), these are my favorite movies. The fantastical dream scenes get a little too cartoonish and comedic but at least that element of the film is contained just in the day-dream sequences (which makes sense). The rest of the movie is emotionally dramatic and extremely touching and moving. I don't see anything to really complain about in it; it's a truly beautiful film and should become a beloved classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Q1b3lZ2TY",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Any Resemblance to the Thurber Story or the Kaye Film is Purely Coincidental,"Anyone expecting Ben Stiller to recycle the two principal intertexts for this story - the James Thurber story or the classic Danny Kaye comedy from 1947 - is likely to be highly disappointed. Superficially the plot remains the same, with Stiller playing a put-upon employee of LIFE magazine who is bullied by the new boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), but eventually discovers himself as a result of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to find elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), who possesses an elusive negative needed for the final print copy of the magazine. Needless to say everything ends happily, with Mitty discovering to his delight that the photograph celebrates the work of all LIFE's employees - journalists, printers, editors, photo-staff - who made the magazine such an American institution. He also manages to convince the love of his life, Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) of the sincerity of his intentions. At heart, however, WALTER MITTY is a story of the importance of discovering yourself, even if the odds seem stacked against you. Walter learns to follow his inclinations, and by doing so fulfills his mother Edna's (Shirley MacLaine's) aspirations for him. Stiller gives a delightful performance, his character gradually changing from one of wide-eyed stoicism (which provokes him to daydream) into a person of quiet strength, who is not frightened of confronting Hendricks and telling the boss exactly what he thinks. At another level WALTER MITTY can be seen as an elegy for LIFE magazine, that bastion of American journalism, which has now become an online-only journal due to falling sales and changing reader preferences. The film uses archive material to show how it chronicled all the major events and personalities of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and how its staff (for the most part) were dedicated to their work. It's the kind of magazine that doesn't deserve to be taken over by superficial ignoramuses such as Hendricks, whose principal concern is for profitability rather than journalistic integrity.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a 'nice' film,"I enjoyed the film, it works well as a 'feel good film', some of the scenery is great and there are some fantastic shots. The soundtrack is fantastic and is an important part of the emotion that comes from the film. The plot itself is, however, a little bland, a lot is predictable and the characters are all pretty dull. The message of the film is a good one, 'get out there and see the world - don't spend your whole life working etc etc' - something like that, but it's sort of ruined by the underlying 'do it so you can get a girlfriend' and that throughout the film all of the amazing things that Walter does are mostly just to impress some coworker that he fancies, not to help himself. It's a bit of a soppy film really, and for the amount of the film that is just about Ben Stiller's character, Walter, you'd of thought that you might become a bit more attached to his character, but i never did. Finally, another running joke in the film was Todd from the online dating website, which was very mildly amusing but i felt that it actually ruined some of the more magnificent moments - the same way a phone call ruins a good film (I'm not sure if it was meant to be ironic or not). I wouldn't go and see it again, nor would i strongly recommend it to anyone - unless they're looking for an easy feel good film. I'd of preferred it without the comic relief scattered throughout, and maybe without the 'romantic' aspect - for a man so fed up with everything he shouldn't need a girl full of cheesy sayings to push him out into the world.fin.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
from LIFE to National Geographic,"The 2013 edition of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' starts very well. The titles are clever and original, and the introduction promises a quality comedy (with Ben Stiller the actor skillfully instructed by Ben Stiller the director) and a romantic intrigue, with Kristen Wiig, beautiful and acting well, embodying the object of the hero's dreams. For a while, things are getting better and better. The film is a 'remake' in which the story of the shy middle-aged man who jumps from time to time with his imagination into an alternative reality different from his banal life is combined with the story of the last days of the printed version of LIFE magazine. The illustrated magazine might have been at the peak of its success in 1947 when the original film was made (in which Danny Kaye gets in trouble in an espionage story). Walter Mitty, the hero of the film, not only works for an obsolete magazine, about to be replaced by a full dot-com version, but also has the function of 'negative administrator', i.e. those photo clichés on film that became useless at once with the introduction of digital photography. Complications do not take long to appear, the hero's life becomes more and more interesting, but not the movie. It is one of those cases where the film is a collection of beautifully filmed scenes and interesting ideas, but the result is less than their sum.What did I like? As I already wrote, the beginning and the first 20-25 minutes of the film. The 'alternative reality' scenes that the hero experiences. The respectful nostalgia for the illustrated press half a century ago, which was a key vehicle of information but also a part of the American popular culture. The magnificent landscapes through which Walter Mitty runs, worthy of the most spectacular films of National Geographic. The cinematography in general. The chemistry between Walter (Ben Stiller) and Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn having obvious fun in supporting roles.What did I like less? The story is too predictable. The film begins very well and ends banally and melodramatically. Walter's alternate visions end abruptly and without explanation. The last one (Wiig singing a pop clip) is pathetic. The character of the 'transformer' of companies, in this case the LIFE magazine which from the illustrated magazine becomes an internet site, is a caricature stereotype and who also disappears for most of the second part of the film. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' seems to have started with great ideas and big ambitions, which where all but forgotten during the production, and the result is just another feel-good comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Iconic,"I have given this a ""10"" rating. There was one minor issue I had with the movie that would make it not quite that in my mind, but a ""9"" rating would be an injustice to this extraordinary film and, since I'm unable to give it a 9.75 or something like that, ""10"" it is.This movie strikes an incredible balance between indy/art-house and Hollywood epic. The pathos of the main character is well-captured in subtle ways, as are the feelings of triumph when he is able to go beyond his own self-imposed limitations. The cinematography is extraordinary-- this is a drama that *must* be seen in theaters. I expect that most adults with any sensitivity at all will find this a highly satisfying experience that speaks to their very cores. My wife and I were privileged to see it in an advanced screening, and can't believe we have to wait another couple of weeks for the official release to go back and see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time to stop dreaming and start living,"Ben Stiller, stars and directs in this powerful and uplifting film based on the short story from James Thurber. Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a white-collared daydreamer who works as a ""negative asset manager"" at Life Magazine. He is responsible for collating and processing photos from freelance daring photographer Sean O'Connell.Walter escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. But when Walter misplaces the 'photo of the century' and his job is threatened, he embarks on a real-world adventure more extraordinary than anything he could ever have imagined.""The Secret life of Walter Mitty"" is interlaced with a humour that Stiller is cast perfectly for, but you wouldn't define it as a comedy, this is an adventure tale which is well balanced between a Hollywood blockbuster and art house cinema. Accompanied by a great soundtrack including Hall & Oates, David Bowie and Arcade Fire This movie will inspire and keep you warm hearted right from the beginning.The supporting cast are a little hit-and-miss, Sean Penn oozes charisma as Sean O'Connell, he only has a few lines of dialogue but they are all profound, deep and reflective. Kristen Wiig's Cheryl Melhoff is adequate as Walter's love interest but lacks chemistry and Adam Scott portrays the perfect amount of jerkiness as executive Ted Hendricks.The visual landscape is the movie's best feature. Like many other blockbusters this year including ""Oblivion"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"", much of the film is shot in Iceland and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh's use of wide angle allows for some poetic views of the stunning panoramas, you can't help but wonder why Twentieth Century fox didn't push for a release in the larger IMAX format.The ending is predictable and even unnecessary, but ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is not about the destination, this is a story all about the journey. Whether he's jumping from helicopters, fighting sharks, climbing the Himalayas or skateboarding down erupting volcano's, Walter inspires us that it's time to stop dreaming and start living.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Two Hours of Fantasy That Has Something to Say About Reality,"Loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty explores the idyllic fantasies of its titular protagonist, as he attempts to escape the mundane motions of his daily routine employment at Life Magazine. When Mitty (Ben Stiller) discovers that photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has misplaced negative 25, intended for the cover of the final print of the publication, he sets out on a larger-than-Life journey to locate the missing photograph, while reducing his need for daydreams as he discovers that not even his wildest fantasies are a match for an adventurous reality.In addition to starring, Stiller also takes on directing duty, and does a mostly wonderful job of collaborating with writer Steven Conrad in adapting Thurber's classic tale of a man's yearning for more out of life.A fantasy adventure with glimpses of comedy, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is, in one word, pleasant. Envision a pyramid of qualities; the film's dreamlike sequences comfortably and rightfully sit atop its magnitude of highlights. With the lines between fantasy and reality often being blurred in Mitty's zoned out state of paralysis, he invites us into his crazy, hazy, even mazy lapses into daydreams of romanticism, adventure and pleasure.Why are The Secret Life of Walter Mitty's fantasy sequences so successful? Because of their relation to our own imaginations: the things we wish we could say but don't; the places we wish we could go but won't. The film's fantasy references are inspired by popular movies such as The Matrix, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and pretty much every superhero film ever. This hilarious and creative approach to Mitty's fantasies offers an insightful look into how uninsightful our own imaginations can be, as they crave originality but settle for what has been imagined before.Perhaps a slight disappointment to Mitty's on screen daydreams is their quantity. While Thurber's short story is dominated by the character's constant drift into his fantasy worlds, Stiller's adaptation favours reality and narrative over fantasy and themes. The film's aforementioned highlights are too few and far between throughout the 114 minute feature. Thus, it may have been Beneficial for Stiller to lengthen the film slightly in order to incorporate more of Mitty's fantasies, which would have better established his dissatisfaction with life.Despite this, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty does have a story investing and intriguing enough for it not to be the film's demise. The secrecy behind negative 25 drives the film along, with love interest Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) also spurring Mitty on in the passenger's seat, inspiring the anxious and rigid dreamer to take his unpredictable ride and become the person he desires to be.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is refreshing in its lack of reliance on dialogue. Instead, the film's beautiful soundtrack and score, cinematography in exceptional landscapes and even the quietness of Mitty, tells us pretty much everything we need to know. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty consists of visual wonderment, with superbly selected and composed music to harmonise the scenery, complementing each other as they stroll hand in hand through Mitty's perfectly paced journey.""Life is about courage and going into the unknown."" If you fail to relate to Mitty's early illusory state, cautiousness and absence of courage, then you probably live a somewhat audacious lifestyle, in which case good for you! For the rest of us, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a relatable, pleasant and semi-inspirational modernisation of Thurber's story.Just as the film's concluding third appears to have little payoff considering its memorable opening two, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty wraps up with a revitalising, picture-perfect moment, fulfilling enough to make cinema-goers reconsider 2013's most impressive movies.In spite of its imperfections in almost keeping Mitty's secret life somewhat of a secret from the audience at times, and preferencing the film's plot over his fantasies, this adaptation is nonetheless a satisfying, fun, visually and audibly pleasing present for the holiday season. Not even Walter Mitty would fantasise about battling you through the streets of Manhattan if you waited for The Secret Life of his on DVD or Netflix, but this delightful film is definitely worth the time and box office cost if you find yourself looking for inspiration for your own imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ben Stillers best picture? I think so.,"I would like to open with one word; Wow. I had been wanting to watch this movie since I had seen the first trailer. After being invited to an advanced showing I got very excited. The movie was outstanding. The cinematography was perfect and the character development was extraordinary. The film was very well paced and at no point did i believe the film was too short or that I felt rushed during the movie. It has its action moments and satire, but overall it is a very happy film. I will most likely see the film in the future again because this is up there with Forrest Gump and Django Unchained as a near perfect movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pleasant romance for the holidays.,"""Life is about courage and going into the unknown."" Cheryl (Kristen Wiig)Forget Bridesmaids and Hangovers, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a comic romance for everyone that eschews raunchiness for real life challenges a dweeb named Walter (Ben Stiller) faces daily. He is everyman, a dreamer who gently supplants his daily dreaming with real life romance.The first part of the film loosely adapts James Thurber's short story in which the now famous introvert dreams of various heroic adventures, mostly as he tries to impress his co-worker Cheryl. The latter part of the film concerns his real adventures tracking down a famous but reclusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Director Stiller plays it low key while he gently shapes the passive hero into an active one. The director calmly moves into a reality more exciting than Mitty's dreams.The multifaceted film, however, loads on the schmaltz and one- dimensional characters while it also touches on the curse of downsizing, using the demise of Life magazine as a setting for the loss of jobs, which Walter experiences. Yet, Mitty is lovable enough for the audience to hope this formerly introverted dork can save himself from unemployment and loneliness.The entire family can enjoy a spirited albeit superficial comedy without scatological or romantic excess. And the lesson about living the dream comes gently and believably. An enjoyable comedy this is.""To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to...."" Life Magazine",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful!!,"We live in a world where we forget the beauties of life sometimes. This movie has waken me up and made myself to ask the question whether i want to live the life i live right now or whether i was dreaming about the right thing. It made me realize that the world we live is moving extremely fast. The technology, the work life and everything has caged us like we are in prison. The secret life of Walter Mitty can guide us through the freer life we want to live but we are hesitating. The movies which have solid messages regarding life have always attracted me.

Truly says what we should be doing with life,"After working in office with 12hrs work everyday i felt this movie truly brought out what IT guys and everyday job people want and should do. Never in life saw a movie so inspirational. Though there was some fiction and imagination and the movie overall sent a clear message. Being in India having so much competitiveness. And Politics and other stuff going on we simply forget what is meant for life. We are just running after money like dogs but what once you have it !!!. I went for a small trek Valley of flowers in India. Met lot of people who were in their 40's and 50's . They only told me that their only regret in life was that other than job and money they never did anything else. Looking back at their life days they felt they never did anything actually to enjoy life now they have money but due to health and age cant do anything. Maybe people should strive for friends, family, visiting nature, seeing world ... Money is nothing but a piece of paper that will come and go but the experiences and memories will be something that will be with you forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Not-so-secretive Life of Walter Mitty,"There is nothing secretive about the life of Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty. Nothing extraordinary or even remotely interesting about it, yet here we are.The film adds nothing to the genre, in fact Ben Stiller uses all the oh-so-familiar cookie-cutter techniques. It is plagued by comically one dimensional characters like the despicable boss, harassed protagonist looking for redemption, female love interest who adds nothing to the narrative; even Sean Penn appears in a self-parodying cameo as the brooding, I'm-so-much-deeper-than-you Sean O'Connell. Add to this the contrived plot which stretches plausibility to make sure all odd ends are tied up and the clichéd theme of taking control of your life, you'd expect quite the train-wreck on your hands.Despite all expectations otherwise, the film works, barely. The themes may be familiar, but they still retain familiar human appeal. The film is shot beautifully, helped by varied geographies and some inventive camera work, especially in the credit sequences. The music too befits an undertaking of this nature and overall, the film, while not uplifting, manages a marginal elevation of spirits if one has reasonable expectations of it. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Remarkable!,"6/2015 I adored this film. From the cast, to the plot, the scenery and the score. This film is beautiful in every way. Its uplifting, a spiritual journey for a man who needs to find himself. There are no dull moments, instead it jumps quickly from scene to scene leaving you with beautiful land and oceanic views. Sean Penn is wonderful in the role of Shawn. The use of ""ground control"" give the whole movie a ""larger than life"" feeling. This is an A++ film. Ben Stiller is wonderful! This is a comfort film. Snuggle down with snacks, a fluffy blanket and a cool breeze and just go far far away. If I were able to gush more I would. I'll just leave it at a must see and if you haven't already watched, what are you waiting for?!Update:8/2016 Still in love with this film. It's timeless. Even though I have watched Walters adventure more than a handful of times, I still go back. This movie has replaced ""Hook""(W/Robin Williams) as my ""sick"" movie. If or when I'm not feeling good, I put on Walter, and feel loved and warm almost as soon as his first daydream. This is NOT the original movie. It feels and moves nothing like it. This movie is timeless. Much the same as the '95 Pride and Prejudice. Though others may try to imitate or even replicate this film, no one will really be able to hold the impact of Stillers version.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Long & Boring,"This movie wanders aimlessly for the first 45 minutes or so before anything happens. When the plot finally gets started it ends rather abruptly and then starts going in a different direction. It does this yet again and then seems to be over but keeps showing more scenes so that I asked my companion ""why is this movie not over?"" I had no idea what the point was or why things were still happening.The plot was paper thin. Find the lost negative. It never thickened or got any more complex then that. Ever. There really was no developed storyline. After about the seventh ""zoned out"" episode that Walter Mitty had I became very disinterested in these sideshows and just wanted them to get on with the story. If I was alone I would have walked out I was so bored, but I was with friends and family so I stayed for the whole movie.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Feel-Good Experience!,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of the most thoughtful, pleasant movie experiences of 2013. This seemed to be a really decisive movie, But I'm firmly camped with those who loved it. It is a very unique film and tone is completely different from which we are accustomed with when it comes to Ben Stiller. Tropic Thunder is excellent, and this film is excellent for different reasons. This is an ambitious film which explores the meaning of life. The film features gorgeous cinematography and a rather progressive soundtrack that I personally liked.Ben Stiller's film is about a man named Walter who worked for sixteen years as a manager for negative assets for LIFE magazine. After his and many others jobs are threatened, Walter goes on a personal journey through means of his own fantasies and his own physical journey.The acting is excellent. Ben Stiller leaves his normal comedy style behind to create an endearing, heart-warming performance. I think the same can be said for Kristen Wiig, as Stiller's love interest. Adam Scott is great at playing the jerk boss, but his beard seems a little off. Sean Penn makes a delightful cameo, but I would have liked to see more of his acting here.Overall, the Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very good movie and it seems to be more of a personal meditation made to guide you through life. I cannot see why some people despised this film, but I guess they must be a miserable as Walter Mitty himself. This is a beautiful-looking film that has such an enjoyable, abstract movie. I rate this episode 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A tribute to The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"Technically and objectively speaking, this is a good movie. It has a good balance of ups and downs, surprises and fulfilment, color contrasts, moving shots and stills (pun intended) and an imaginative use of special effects.Emotionally and subjectively speaking, this is a phenomenal movie. This movie connected with me on a deep level. Let me tell you why.Ever since I was a kid, until halfway through my thirty-first year on this planet, I did not really understand traveling for pleasure. I accepted that it was something other people liked. I understood the charm of a nice view and meeting nice people. But I never *really* understood.Growing up, I had always been relatively distantiated from my emotions. I would suppress my emotions to some extent, take the sharp edge off. I was making sure I would let some of the good emotions shine through, and suppress the bad ones, venting them through music. Later in life, I found that I was suppressing too much of my emotion. I started trying to change this aspect of myself. To allow stronger emotions. To allow myself to fall in love again.It was not until seeing this movie that I felt like I truly understood why certain people travel. That I am succeeding in changing myself. This is living.Thank you, C, for recommending me this movie. You have made me grow.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Imaginative, funny and charming","This is probably my favourite Ben Stiller movie. There are plenty of so-called 'adventure' films out there, many of them are dull and uninspiring, but 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is one of the few that is genuinely interesting and enjoyable.This is a funny film, silly in parts, but the humour isn't overdone or forced. The plot in itself is verging on ridiculous, far from believable, but the film makes up for it in charm and entertainment value. Stiller is a naturally funny actor and he delivers an extremely good performance as Walter Mitty, a relatable and endearing character.This is a terrific adventure movie, one of the best in the genre.

Nothing quite like it,"I don't even know where to begin with this film. It shot straight up to the top of my favourite films list so much so that I created an account here just so I could review it and give it the 10 stars it deserves. I think everyone should watch this film at least once. You might not like it as much as me but I still think it is important to see it. The cinematography is breathtaking, the soundtrack is moving and transporting; reeling you in to each scene and emphasising further any feelings of empathy you will have already had with Walter Mitty. The ending completely caught me by surprise and made me cry for a while, and does so every time I've seen it after. Ben Stiller is amazing in this role, truly exemplifying his true talent as an actor, and also a director. Many critics or want to be critics could find flaws or weak spots of the film, but personally the story was so heartwarming, encapturing and inspiring that I didn't notice anything that would even be considered wrong or out of place. This film inspired me, a person who relates to the shy anxious Walter we meet at the beginning, to say yes to more things and speak my mind more often, and to see the world.

"Ben Stiller's surreal, dramatic turn","Ben Stiller is known for being a comic actor and an occasional director and with his latest film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty he takes more serious turn. Based on the short story of the same name about a man who daydreams Stiller gives us a very dreamlike looking world with his wide shots and bright, white colour pallet. Even the real life world had a surreal quality to it, particularly when Walter is travelling to find photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn).Stiller gives a strong performance and he works well with Kristen WIgg, Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn. Some of the daydreaming sequences were better then others, some being a bit too long. The best being a sweet moment when Walter's love interest comes back and sings 'Major Tom'.Unfortunately the ending for the film does drag on as the film attempts to be a life affirming experience.This is film that has an excellent soundtrack.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How anyone could like this is beyond me...,"So the guy (Ben Stiller's character) has this average paying job in charge of developing negatives at a magazine for the past 16 years. He's unmarried, in his 40's with his aging mother and unemployed sister depending on his salary. The magazine called ""Life"" is undergoing downsizing and other major changes apparently forced onto it by nothing but the new manager, who is portrayed as the super-villain/typical suit sporting a double digit IQ.Anyways, it seems the main character, Walter Mitty (Stiller), has two main objectives. Getting the girl of his dreams who started working in his office a month ago to notice he's alive and finding the super important 25th negative sent by an ultra-adventurous super photographer employed by the magazine that doesn't ever share his whereabouts with anyone. Obviously Walter is threatened to get fired if he doesn't produce the all-important 25th negative the next time his (probably) clinically retarded douche-bag manager sees him (SPOILER: He does get fired, which results in him having to sell a piano. SPOILER2: it (the negative) is in his wallet the whole time, because the photographer-extraordinaire whom he never met in his life thought it would be a cute joke... SPOILER3: The negative is DRUMROLL - A PICTURE OF WALTER MITTY and it eventually gets published as the last ever COVER of the magazine after he goes through a ridiculous, unrealistic journey around the globe (having never traveled before) to find Sean Penn taking a picture of a snow leopard on a mountain in Afganistan! He had to use his mother's cake to bribe Afgan warlords to be allowed access to the mountain...Obviously).It is really quite incredible how people are able to convince themselves they like some piece of crap to pretend at their grasp of some sort of deeper meaning hidden within. How else could this movie get a 7.7 average rating? You can talk all you want about how we're scared to change our habits and how we need to take more risks, but there are much better movies with relatable stories and characters whereas this movie is just Ben Stiller's self-indulgence in its purest form and I regret staying to finish watching it with my wife (who regrets convincing me to stay to finish watching it) when I knew we should've left when our friends did (about half an hour into the movie) or better yet avoided it entirely, which brings me here.And so here I am now, wasting another 10 minutes of my life writing a review hoping to discourage a like-minded person or two from going to see this utter nonsense of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Portrayal of someone who discovers and has the courage to be themselves,"I thought that this was a very moving and well done movie and I wasn't a Ben Stiller fan until watching this movie. I think Mr. Stiller did a magnificent job in his portrayal of Mitty who is an average individual living a life of quiet desperation until he has the courage to follow his heart. It's one of those movies that you will want to watch more than once.Walter Mitty, played by Ben Stiller, might remind you of yourself as living an insignificant and repetitive life at the mercy of institutions, society, politicians and circumstances. While Mitty suffers through life, he has moments in which his imagination provides him an escape from this prison into a world of his own making as hero and adventurer.Mitty appears pathetic and weak as he learns and reacts that ""Life"" magazine, where he works, is being repurposed and downsized. The new transition manager and his lackey's tease and humiliate Mitty for being out of it and call him Major Tom referring to the song by David Bowie which comes to play an important role in the movie.Despite the abuse from the transition manager, Mitty continues to accept his plight in life until he freaks out when he sees that the most representative negative of Life magazine's history that is to be used on the last issue of Life magazine is missing. This leads Mitty to start a personal journey that forces him way outside his comfort zone and his routine into a real-life adventure as he tries to find and retrieve the negative. As the movie progresses Mitty becomes more and more committed to this self quest and finds himself traveling the world and experiencing real life adventures beyond what he had previously day dreamed. This self quest to follow his unique path consumes and nourishes him in ways he's never known before and which results in an admiring self evolution.I won't give away details of the film, but highly recommend it. Well, maybe just a peak... There is some awesome cinematography in this movie. The scenes of Mitty skateboarding through Iceland are fantastic and are guaranteed to evoke an emotional reaction from you if you like adventure or nature by any measure.Even if you have already seen this film, it's fun watching again. Especially if you like films depicting individuals discovering and following their own path. The travel and skateboarding scenes by themselves are worth watching the movie again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Every Secret Yearns To Be Told,"Walter Mitty isn't a deep or complex character. He is defined by his actions — where he goes, who he speaks to, how he speaks to them, what decisions he makes. What he is, is the majority of the population. Most of us have plans to do many things. We want to scale Everest. We want to swim with grey whales. We want to bunjee jump or fly to the moon. Walter Mitty represents our laziness, and ultimately our failure.But he isn't a loser. Ben Stiller is known for taking on roles and degrading them to the lowest possible social status. His characters usually have no place in the real world because they're unable to live in it and function on the same level as normal people. Consider White Goodman, with his puffed up blonde hair and thick moustache. He is a caricature. His speech, motives and actions require him to make a fool of himself, and then he ends the movie in a position worse off than when he began it.Walter Mitty, by comparison, begins the movie in a position that's already pretty stable. He's the chief negative assets manager of Life magazine, which means he's in charge of processing, maintaining and preserving film negatives. You can bet that by the time the movie ends, he will be better off. Of course, he has a crush on a fellow worker, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), and the movie begins with him trying unsuccessfully to leave her a wink on her eHarmony page. This whole eHarmony thing is important, because Walter's profile page is blank; he's done nothing worth mentioning in his life. He compensates by projecting his desires onto a mental canvas where he sees himself leaping through the air and into flaming buildings, rescuing Cheryl's three-legged dog and inventing a mechanical prosthetic leg in the process. ""Zoning out"", as his sister calls it. I'm pretty sure everyone calls it that.So Life magazine is moving to new management. It's going 100% online, like Progressive Car Insurance, which means most of the staff will be let go. To commemorate the final print edition, famed photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has sent Walter a gift: A reel of film containing frame 25 — the most perfect photograph he's taken, one which will send Life magazine off in style — along with a note and a wallet. But there's a problem. Frame 25 is missing. And the new boss, the bearded prig Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), wants it immediately or Walter's job is no more.Frame 25 essentially becomes the MacGuffin that allows Walter to embark on a journey through Scandinavia and the mountainous regions of Afghanistan as he seeks not only to find Sean O'Connell and determine the whereabouts of frame 25, but to discover himself. Here is a man who has not travelled outside of America. Now, because of one frame, he is led to Greenland, where he will leap out of an unstable helicopter into icy-cold shark-infested waters. To Iceland, a land of great beauty — its winding roads resemble streams that weave themselves around grand mountains and lush greenery. And then to the Himalayas. Yes, at times The Secret Life plays like a travelogue of these places, but you know what? I don't care. Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan are spectacular.The movie is directed by Stiller, and it's his most mature and fully realised project to date. It is grounded in Walter Mitty, who is aware of his surroundings and what's going on outside of his mental projections, but able to focus on the task at hand as if he's MacGyver crossed with Carmen Sandiego. He's also funny, which is good. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in this movie, and they lend an interesting balance to a story that could easily have gone astray and fallen into cheesy clichés.There are nice little touches. Shirley MacLaine and Patton Oswalt make quick but effective appearances as Walter's mother and an uber friendly eHarmony customer service agent respectively. And Penn's performance as Sean is handled with love; his appearance borders on a cameo. But ultimately, the star is Stiller who, at 48, is as alive and energetic as a 10-year old discovering a theme park for the first time. His lust for adventure is infectious, and the journey he embarks upon is altogether touching, gorgeous, and completely satisfying.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A little too dour for its message of hope and call to action, but eminently watchable nonetheless.","In theory, there's a great deal to enjoy about The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. It's an adventure epic about a downtrodden worker bee who discovers the meaning of life and the importance of living it, which gives two fine comedic talents - Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig - the chance to dig deep and play some genuinely emotional drama. The special effects on full display in the film are gorgeous, perfectly bringing to life the dreamscape into which our protagonist would rather escape to become anyone other than himself. It's a shame, then, that the film never quite manages to embrace its own message of joy, courage and celebration. For all that it plays up the importance of doing rather than dreaming, this is an oddly sombre affair that would benefit from an injection of adrenaline and cheer.Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has worked in the offices of Life for his entire career. The custodian of the magazine's photo archive, he processes and develops negatives sent in for publication - and has done so for so long that he's highly-regarded by someone he's never even met: fabled free-spirit photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Walter nurses a crush on his colleague Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), but has never been able to gather up the courage to do anything about it. When obnoxious corporate transition manager Ted (Adam Scott) turns up to shove the magazine literally into the digital age, Walter must leave his life of quiet mediocrity to hunt down the photograph that will grace the cover of Life's final issue before it becomes an exclusively digital publication.For the most part, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is a pleasant if slightly over-constructed watch. Walter's dream sequences are probably the best parts of the film, filled with such glorious examples of derring-do and bravery that it's no wonder he would rather live there than in the real world. In these moments, Stiller manoeuvres his camera and marshals his special effects expertly, capturing the thrill and sheer escapist fantasy of a man who exists more fully in his dreams. Walter leaps off buildings and into windows, and morphs into a rugged mountaineer ready to sweep Cheryl off her feet. The visuals are no less spectacular once Walter embarks on his quest to find Sean - one that takes him to the most far-flung corners of the planet, from Greenland to Iceland, through shark-infested waters and bubbling volcanoes.But, amidst the quite beautiful cinematography and sweetly-designed plot (the unveiling of Sean's final cover photograph for Life is really quite wonderful), Stiller the director appears to have forgotten to tell Stiller the actor to have a little fun with it all. He plays Walter in constantly perplexed, largely inexpressive mode, even when he has quite literally circumnavigated the globe in the course of his adventures. There's hardly ever a sense that Walter is enjoying himself, even a tiny bit.If that's Stiller's point - that people can still get caught up in the horrors of chasing deadlines and deliverables when they finally decide to pursue their dreams - it's a grim one, and one that isn't borne out by the rest of the film. We're supposed to see this as Walter's chance at a new, braver life, one in which he doesn't just fade into the background and live inside his head. But that heady sense of joy, excitement and liberation rarely comes through. As such, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty often seems to lack heart, a crucial ingredient in a film so eager to appeal to the dreamer in all of us.Stiller's cast, at least, is great in an unmitigated way. He might march through the film with too little joie de vivre, but he does have a nice, yearning chemistry with Wiig, who is as effective in her role as a frazzled single mom worried about losing her job, as she is as Walter's unsuspecting muse. Penn is, perhaps, one of the few actors with enough gravitas to pull off Sean's elusive and determined artistry - he's the sort of man who tracks a snow leopard for ages, only to decide that he'd prefer to enjoy rather than capture the moment on film. Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn are excellent as Walter's mom and sister respectively, the former trying to get her son to enjoy himself more, the latter flighty in a way her brother will never be.As a director and actor, Stiller has cut his teeth on more comedic fare: from Zoolander to Tropic Thunder, he's demonstrated a flair for the absurd and ridiculous. It's ironic that what's missing from The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty - his evident attempt to move beyond comedy as outlandish as it is outrageous - is that burst of silly, warm-hearted levity that is clearly his stock-in-trade. As a result, the film is good and certainly watchable, but falls somewhat short of what Stiller no doubt hoped it would be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Inspirational, for me at least.

Please give it a look.Ben Stiller's role is one of his bests, if not the best, of all the movies I've seen from him; the ""hidden"" messages all across the movie, the sound management, the colors... It might not be a ""work of art"", but it certainly is a well done movie, without huge thriller aspirations, but by keeping it simple, it makes the message even more powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You Can Be President!,"Walter Mitty delivers what you would expect from watching the trailer, there are no surprises here. The film is a nice watch, though not due to the lack of surprises, but the earnestness of the main character who is struggling to deal with having lived a mundane life that never met his fantasies.As children we are told (mostly) we can do and be anything, its a nice positive sentiment but not remotely true for the large majority of people. We can't all be the one percent who make it! This film touches on the sentiment that 'my' dreams should be attainable and my life is disappointing because my dreams haven't become reality. Using that pain the movie now has a springboard for the 'crazy' to happen, I have nothing left to lose, I may as well risk it.So the foreseeable adventures begin and so does the fun and the 'Hallmark' moments of attainable dreams.So the film works by hitting a nerve and then doing its best to make you forget about it :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Escapism Beyond Limits,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty heightens James Thurber's short story into a large scaled inspirational film about making big dreams come true. It's a nice way to suit for the idea. There is a makings for a totally endearing picture. Director Ben Stiller obviously pours a lot of ambition to the film which brings an absolute visual stunner. It may have pushed the fantasy stuff too hard, even at the scenes that aren't even imaginary anymore, but then it still manages to provide plenty of charms in every moment.The adventurous parts feel nothing more than a simple dazzler, it's a much compelling movie when it focuses on Mitty's everyday life by getting to know about him. Keeping him in his dull ordinary reality reveals his special daydreaming. It's quite decent when it comes to the characterization of his fancy condition, relationship with the good people around him, and lack of assertiveness to the mean strangers; which results a pleasant and admirable enough portrait to show the simplicity of the character's loop cycle. When it separates him from the ordinary world, it becomes a different movie. This is where it is free to express its dazzling panache, showing off its cinematic creativity. While they all look good, they seem nothing more than whimsical images to impress the viewers how spectacular these exteriors look. It doesn't exactly help the plot that much, other than putting Mitty away from his comfort zone and searching for Sean O'Connell.The largeness of the journey also kind of brought a little inconsistency, like ever since Walter begins traveling, it just strays the extraordinary anywhere and cares less about the difference between the impossible of his imagination and their reality. It would have make more sense if the daring situations didn't happen too quick, but again we shouldn't fault for someone who wants to make things creative. This certain (and silly) flaw won't be a big deal if you don't think too much about it. Besides, it's actually not a bad thing. The cinematography and the special effects brim wonder and that's all what you need to know.It's difficult to dislike The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, the same way it's difficult to dislike Ben Stiller in movies, even when it unbalances the unbelievable and incredibly fills with creepy amount of product placements. But who wouldn't enjoy a light entertainment that tends to inspire and has a very likable lead character? Because when blockbusters go dark, you sometimes need a pleasant escapism that serves undeniable lovely warmth. It's not yet the perfect vision you expected, but all the hipsteristic filmmaking and genuine heart still makes it worth the experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pantomime fail,"Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What should have been a truly enthralling, captivating and magical tale is here turned into product placement, CGI and reasons for the film crew to travel to odd and interesting places. Ben Stiller may have been the correct choice as Walter but for heavens sake, everything else is wrong. Simple things e.g. making the dream sequences black & white would have made the story more 'genuine' - instead we and he can't decide what is true and what is imagined...to the extent that when he does have his real life adventures we don't care. In any case, by then we're looking at the scenery - nice, been to some of those places, nice to see them on screen. Pity the focus is on some stupid goings on that are just beyond far fetched (you know, a moon distance far fetched.)As a UK TV interviewer noted, ""Ben, you have very long legs for the size of your body"" well, what else could the poor guy talk about. This film is a dud.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What an excellent movie,"I just watched this movie for the first time. What excellent movie, what nice script, what nice cast, the vistas, the emotion. Good. I love it that I could watch this movie with my family with zero G rated stuff. This is probably Ben Stiller's equal to Adam Sandler's Reign Over Me. Very deep, yet very pleasant. Ben Stiller delivers, so do the others. Very good movie. I've had a very fulfilled life and yet this movie gets me to rise up again and go explore the world. I love that it has the simplicity of emotions and the greatness of luck and coincidence. Everything very well combined. Man do I want to go to Iceland now. Right now.

Surreal Masterpiece,"Very rarely does a film make me think like this one did. The film is a grand representation of what a film could be artistically. There was a quite abstract theme to the entire film, adding an entire new layer to the meaning. The film is a reminder to live life in the moment. To take opportunities. The cinematography was brilliant across the film, with gorgeous wide shots and clever use of merging text with the environment. There were very few scenes that felt forced and pushed in to pad the run time. Stiller, the director showed competence in blending the artistic setting of the film and comedy, so that it didn't feel that the comedy was dumbing down the film or its meaning. It was mainly a way to pull in a broader audience. The performances were excellent, from the lead, to the child actor in the film. It had a professional, yet creative and imaginative air throughout. There were a couple of poor moments across the film. For example, sometimes, when the film didn't have a proper solution to a problem that was laid out, they would go down the Ex Machina route and create some sort of cheap cop out to resolve the scene. Other than that, there were a few other minor details that are so minor that they could easily be looked past. Overall, this is definitely up there with my favorite films.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A fantastic movie, not ashamed of its little flaws","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is without a doubt the best surprise for me in these holidays movie season. Even if it's not a major cinematic achievement in any particular way, it is incredibly confident with a clear and universal message.In time when movies always try too hard and tend to be excessive, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' seemingly effortless delivers a timeless story to its audience. The movie is beautiful, charming and funny, yet it achieves all that without taking itself too serious. That's its real trick in my opinion.It is unfortunate the movie wasn't off to a great box office success, but I'm sure the movie will find it's audience. You probably won't find any Oscar worthy performances, but that's not always everything. From time to time we just need to be reminded how beautiful life can be, and the movie does just that brilliantly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Missed Opportunity,"I think that the idea behind this movie was fantastic. As soon as i saw the trailer, i was immediately determined to go see it as soon as i could. However, after seeing it i was a little disappointed. The potential i saw in it before just wasn't there and by the end of the movie, i was just sitting there craving more. Mainly, i expected the movie to be mainly action based. I liked that there was a bit of a romance and i liked how it really drove the action to take place but i think that they sacrificed too much of the adventure and action in order to develop the movie into more of a romantic adventure. I might just be me but i feel that when Ben Stiller directs a movie, it's always missing something. Don't get me wrong, i love Ben Stiller's style but i'm always left wanting more after seeing one of his movies. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it but over all i think that the producers and directors missed out on an enormous opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Critics get it wrong AGAIN!,"A totally unexpected film. First off preconceptions are; Ben Stiller is going to be a goof and do some American blah that isn't funny. I am happy to say that I was very wrong.The film begins with a neurotic shy man with no confidence (Stiller), waiting out an ordinary bland life. A life changing event forces him to engage life, an unwillingness to let life pass by and a need to address past issues, thrusts Walter into a life he always wanted.A great film that takes you on a mesmeric journey. A really touching film, you can empathise with. Beautiful soundtrack that complements the story fantastically.

Ben Stiller is simply not convincing, I never liked him anyway, the storyline to unbelievable.

"Good picture, but a bit silly","One of the few films showing the beauty of Iceland, and just the beauty of real adventures with the motivation of the characters. What is surprising is that Ben Stiller is both the main character and the director of the film, which is extremely rare to see.In addition to the beautiful scenes on the landscapes of Iceland, it has an easy and understandable plot that will affect almost everyone. Motivational. Overall, the film is quite well-crafted. I liked the ending.But there are things in it that spoil it. Like the fact that the movie is a bit too long for this story. The plot is silly in places, and some of the dialogue is made for a pretty picture than in real life.This movie may not appeal to certain people, but it may inspire and motivate others who would enjoy such an adventure, even though it has obvious flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ben Stiller Does Great in Front, as Well as Behind, the Camera","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by and stars Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, a man with a boring job and boring life. Most everyone that works with him makes fun of him, mostly because he zones out a lot. He daydreams. He daydreams of himself being a Latin mountaineer, or saving Cheryl's (Kristen Wiig), a woman he's interested in, three legged dog from a building explosion. At his job, he processes negative photographs, sent from a mysterious man named Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). One day, he doesn't receive a particular negative from Sean; the one he claims is his best photo yet. After too much pressure from his superiors, he takes off and goes on a real life adventure to find Sean, taking him to Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan.To start, this film is directed beautifully. Ben Stiller does a great job in front of, as well as behind, the camera. The cinematography is some of the best cinematography of the 21st century. I'd even dare to compare it to Avatar, especially since these shots are real life, and not CGI. The wide shots of mountain landscape in Afghanistan, or the volcano is Greenland is amazing. Ben Stiller's camera work is really good, which isn't too common in actors-gone-directors, but he does great.The acting is also pretty good. Ben Stiller, like I said, does great on both sides of the camera. Kristen Wiig does good as well, which was unexpected. Sean Penn, given the little screen time he has, does amazing. He really owns the role of a danger-seeking photographer. Adam Scott, with his fake beard, plays a great jerk- off boss; constantly making fun of Walter and calling his ""Major Tom."" There's also a child actor in this film, and he's about 12 or so. He does okay, but didn't really excite me in his performance like I wanted him to. He just seemed like a normal kid trying to act in a middle school play.The plot seems a bit weird, but it plays off very well. The film was based off of a short story, written by James Thurber. It's hard to turn a short story into a feature length film, but this movie does it, and does it very nicely. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty also has some good comedy. There's a scene in this film that pokes fun at The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), and it's freaking hilarious. That's all I'll say, because I don't want to spoil anything.The main negative in this film is a certain character. It's hard to talk about this character without spoiling anything, but his name is Todd. Todd is periodically in the movie, and almost for no reason. Towards the end of the film, the audience gets to see why he was placed there, but it feels like a rushed excuse. It seems as if the writers got to a certain point, and got stuck on finding a way out. So, they threw Todd in random places throughout the movie, just so they could get out of a sticky situation.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a really good film, and I quite enjoyed watching it. I think the movie's pretty underrated, and deserves a bit more credit than what it's received. I'm going to give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
21st Century Secret Living,"Based on the same short story as the 1947 Danny Kaye film of the same title, this is a vastly different big screen adaptation, updated for the twenty-first century with a basic story that is more grounded in reality. The film begins on a similar note to the 1947 incarnation with Mitty (played here by Ben Stiller) tripping in and out of fantasy and reality, however, whereas Kaye in the 1947 version gradually found himself involved in a real life conspiracy more fantastical than any of his daydreams, Stiller finds himself on a more humdrum quest to track down a photographer and a missing negative here. This narrative deflection leads to the Stiller version being less funny (the 1947 film derives much humour from nobody believing Kaye about the elaborate conspiracy). The most disappointing element of the 2013 film though is how Mitty's fantasies so quickly take a backseat to reality in line with a positive thinking and 'living life to its fullest' message. Mitty's fantasies are not valued here, whereas in the earlier film they are what makes him so good at his job in the first place. Comparisons aside though, the 2013 film is not half-bad for what it is (though at two hours it feels incredibly long). Stiller makes for an excellent milquetoast Mitty, the vistas on display are breathtaking, and Mitty's office building, full of blue hues, is an incredible feat of art direction. The film also has some nice, offbeat moments too (Stiller realising just how large certain beer mugs are) in the parts where the filmmakers do not try too hard to be funny, touching or sentimental.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Walter Mitty ..?  ..You Cannot Be Serious ..!!,"This is not a remake of the 1947 classic ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"".

E Harmony is the first in a long line of adds. The movie is over the top with the day dream sequences and (of course) C.G.I. is used in abundance. It is well photographed (if you like scenery this is your film) , but is this a comedy ?? The use of the name Walter Mitty is the only (sick) joke I can think of. The guy who came up with that was thinking ONLY of the novelty (and the money).Mitty is used in many dictionaries...after Danny Kayes wonderful performance in the REAL FUNNY Secret life of Walter Mitty.

It's a wonderful and imaginative movie,"The main charm about this film is how the audiences can actually connect and relate with the protagonist of this story. About a average guy that has a vivid imagination and the habit of zoning out, going on a journey to see and go on a adventure. Although random it's enthralling to see Mitty's imagination come to life in his mind. This is a well made movie that is immersive and imaginative.

An absurdly underrated masterpiece!,"Despite it not being perfect, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is my all-time favorite movie, full of spectacle of both the fantastic and natural, as well as having some of the most naturally acted performances I've ever seen put to screen. These aren't super heroes or grand adventurers. They're everyday human beings with quirks and flaws going through their daily lives. Then Walter goes on a grand journey of his own and must have his own coming-of-age story years after he has grown from boyhood to realize that he can't just wait for something interesting to finally happen to him. It's a funny, emotional tale which will appeal to not only the child in all of us adults, but it will genuinely make the audience think about what they can do to not only explore their own talents to contribute to the world, but what they can do to make sure their lives are full and happy.

Keeps me coming back and inspires the best inside us all,"As the years go on I find myself revisiting this film. Every time I do I find myself falling more in love with it. Ben Stiller should be very proud of this one, because I think it has found a place in so many people's hearts, and for good reason.On the surface one would think, ""oh fun another action comedy adventure I can consume easily, forget, and move on"". When I first watched this movie I was 21 and it didn't stay with me for whatever reason. I mean I found it fun, creative, and entertaining enough at the time, but it didn't leave a profound impact. I was 21 and I didn't realize just yet that I saw one of my all time favorite pieces of art for the first time.When I revisited it a couple of years later in my mid twenties, I started to appreciate the craft and approach to optimism Ben Stiller was trying to convey. He spun such a nice balance of humor and whimsy that you couldn't help but enjoy the ride just a little more this time around. I mean at this point I had lived a little more, experienced more, travelled more, loved and lost more. . . So of course I understood it on a deeper level now.Now in my 30's this has become one of my favorite movies and one that brings me more comfort than a gravity blanket. In times of trouble it reminds me that you can always change and grow. In times of abundance it reminds me to cherish all that I have and always remember this too shall pass. In times where I feel lost its sense of wanderlust reminds me that being lost isn't forever, it's just part of a journey until you find where it was taking you.This movie may have flown under the radar but I believe the audience that found it loves it so much because it can lift us up when we're down, inspire us to be more than we think we can be, and even make us chuckle at Ben Stiller and Adam Scott fighting over a Stretch Armstrong while surfing on NYC asphalt.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yet Another Ben Stiller Masterpiece,"Just watched The secret life of Walter Mitty a mind blowing movie but it has it's own up and down's but still worth breaking our necks cause we're the only peoples sitting in the front row of a movie theater. When i saw the first trailer of the film i have then decided that i would watch this cause duhhh it's directed and stared Ben Stiller the king of comedy and adventure like the Topic Thunder which did both stared and direct. So in to the film it was amazing and loved the concept of the film and give a hats off to Ben Stiller for the site he picked for the film it was beautiful i couldn't believe that Afghanistan would be really wonderful. And now for the casting part it was a great casting choice by Ben Stiller like Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty was perfect for him another hats off for perfectly enhancing the role of Walter Mitty, Sean Penn as Sean O' Connell was the best i know it was just a cameo but this was the best cameo of 2013 and he really was a good fit to the role, have guys even notice Shirley MacLaine as Edna Mitty was really a good job well done in this age thumps up for you, and last but not the least Adam Scott as Ted Hendricks is Walter Mitty's boss was great the role of Ted Hendricks is a mean boss who doesn't know his employees to much but Adam Scott has nailed the role now i kinda like him in the film but i don't want a boss like that never. Now the plot of the film was kinda mixed but after watching the whole film i really liked the plot but the concept of Walter Mitty is a normal guy who does not have much friends and love life but the best part is that when he imagine some random things that's possible but at the end he does them all And the down part of the film was casting Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Melhoff was no different at all cause in the film if you don't cast her it's no problem cause Ben Stiller stole the show and her acting was to low standard and don't want to see her again but still the film was wroth watching LOVED IT!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Zoned Out at Life,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. In the moment, daydreams can feel like real life. Such is the existence of Walter Mitty, the milquetoast main character of James Thurber's 1939 ""New Yorker"" short story. This is no remake of Danny Kaye's 1947 movie, and thank goodness for that ... no one wants to see Ben Stiller singing and dancing. Mr. Stiller not only takes on the role of the zoned out Mitty, but he also directs (quite effectively).Walter is a quiet, photo lab geek at Life Magazine, the long time publication that is closing its doors. Of course, in real life, those doors closed years ago, but the magazine name makes for the perfect contradiction to Mitty's existence. The transition team is in place led by the snide, bearded corporate presence of Adam Scott. Photographer extraordinaire Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn) has delivered the perfect shot for the final cover. Only one problem: Walter has misplaced it.This gaffe leads Walter to cross paths with a co-worker played by Kristen Wiig, whom he has secretly admired both across the office and by staring at her eHarmony profile online. Their investigative work leads Walter on the first real journey of his life. He even breaks free of the family bond of his mom (Shirley MacLaine) and sister (Kathryn Hahn) and gets a pep talk and well timed boost from Patton Oswalt.Walter's expedition leads him to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas, and Afghanistan by way of Yemen. He also encounters a wild helicopter pilot and ride, sharks, an erupting volcano, drinking beer from giant glass boots, a sad and aggressive Karoke singer, and takes a speedy ride via skateboard. Rather than changing Walter, these experiences just bring out a lust for life that was previously only flashed through his periods of fantasy zone outs.The acting is very strong in this one, and that comes from a guy who is not much of a Stiller fan. His beaten down demeanor and stone-faced expressions are spot on for the Mitty role. Ms. MacLaine, Ms. Hahn, Mr. Oswalt and Mr. Scott all add very nice comedic touches and Sean Penn captures the rugged fearlessness of a world weary photographer who recognizes the depth of Mitty.If you are a fan of Thurber's short story then you must know artistic license is taken to turn it in to full length feature. Screenwriter Steven Conrad provides Life magazine as a foundation, and some of the most beautiful places on earth during the journey. He even gives us a poetry falcon (my first) and a parody of Benjamin Button (a bit out of place). Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh delivers these locations to us in stunning fashion. The film is beautiful to look, and thanks to the score from Theodore Shapiro, it's complimented by well fitting music.This is one of those crowd-pleasing movies filled with sentimentality and charm. Critics will bash it, but most of us can relate to the underdog lead and his delusions of grandeur. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Avoid the Tedious Life of Walter Mitty,"This is a poor film.I was given free tickets to a preview of this film and I have to report that I have never seen as many people walk out of a film as I did with Walter Mitty.The plot is predictable and clichéd, relying too heavily on what is supposed to be a feel good factor (it isn't) and the quirky qualities of its lead characters (they aren't).Just to make it clear, this film isn't quirky, it's irritating, tedious and deeply frustrating. There are several problems with the film not least the central premise of the plot. For those of you who are unaware the Ben Stiller character regularly drifts off into flights of fantasy where he imagines he is a super hero, or an alpine ski God, or Benjamin Button and here is where the movie really loses its way. The 'dream' sequences are misjudged and out of place. They add nothing to the plot and actually take you away from the narrative of the main story. As a result when he drifts off it becomes increasingly frustrating as you just want the story to progress without the constant (and irritating) disruptions. As a result the story is unevenly paced, and you lose all sympathy for the lead character.While I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller, he was miss cast as the nerdy office worker who is transformed into the would be hero in this misfiring story. His performance is wooden and he is not helped by a corny script, and the decision by the director to surround Walter Mitty with a series of parodies of office workers (the shy beautiful girl, the ball busting out of touch boss, the put upon overweight co-worker etc).The film seems confused as to who is its audience, and as a result it falls between several stools. It isn't really a comedy, a art house movie, a drama or a romance.This was one of the least enjoyable experience I have ever had at the cinema.Avoid, just avoid.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quintessence of Life,"""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life.""This epic journey of a man who escapes reality by ""zoning out"" to images of his inner feelings to cope with his anxiety is more than visually pleasing. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a man whose job as a negative assets manager at Life Magazine is his whole existence, but knows there is more to life than just the daily grind. In attempts to find a lost negative that will be featured on the final cover of Life Magazine, Walter experiences the world, breaks through his emotional barriers, and finds love.The way Ben Stiller (director and actor) used the rules of thirds throughout the film made a beautiful story even more appealing.

It will always be a thought-provoking and a really really beautiful movie for me.,"Ben Stiller directs and stars in THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, James Thurber's classic story of a day-dreamer who escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job along with that of his co-worker (Kristen Wiig) are threatened, Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey that turns into an adventure more extraordinary than anything he could have ever imagined. Watching this movie, there was a smile on my face the whole time. I wanted to drop everything off and go out on an adventure just like Mitty did. And that is right. Sometimes you do have to take the leap. There is so much beauty in this world waiting for you to notice it. Just like John Green mentioned in TFIOS: ""The Universe wants to be noticed."" This is exactly what I felt and understood while watching this film. In a way we are all like Mitty: we imagine so many things, keep daydreaming about how we are going to face every obstacle in our lives with some super hero strength but in reality, we are afraid. We are oh so afraid to do what our heart tells us. But we have to take chances in order to live. I should be reviewing this movie about how perfectly Ben Stiller did his role, how beautiful the landscape was, how the special effects were spot-on. These all things were there and surely played a major role but the message this movie contains is far too important than any of these things, Hence; my totally philosophical rant above. I just saw this movie and I think it deserved a freaking Oscar. It was that awesome. Nevertheless, this quote from the movie justifies the cruelty of Oscars: -""Beautiful things don't ask for attention."" It will always be a thought-provoking and a really really beautiful movie for me. And those of you who have good taste in movies will definitely love it too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The scenery is phenomenal, acting is beyond professional, and I must repeat, the cinematography is stellar! This should be sought out by film lovers and artists everywhere because I can not emphasize in words how stirring this film was for me. It is emotive and encouraging. This film has suddenly leaped into my life as a significant mesmerizing experience. Thank you to the writer, Ben Stiller, and that special cameraman who caught all the best shades of light!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning,"The Visual aspect of Walter Mitty is excellent, but something was lacking. The previews held the film to a high standard therefore causing a raised level of expectation. It did not meet my expectations. I give Stiller props for taking on a film that's been in development hell since 94' and causing such a beautiful outcome. The soundtrack and editing style were also bothersome. I felt as though more epic and majestic music was necessary for certain scenes and would have served the film a great deal. Certain cuts were an issue for me as well, they felt uncomfortable. Though the film felt crammed into two hours , the locations, actors, and visual wit was overall superb.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""God, you're noteworthy!""","It seems that the later half of 2013 has proved those (including myself) wrong about 2013 being a bad year for films. I'm not saying that this is the best of 2013, just that it's not as bad as I thought this years movies would be.When I started watching this, I wasn't in the best of moods. Which can be seen as a problem, because this is what's branded as a 'feel good film'. We'd got to the cinema late, in the hope that ads would run for around 20 minutes before the film, as they always do. This time, they did not. We didn't miss a lot, probably just the first 3 minutes. However, finally settling in wasn't made easy by my mother frequently tapping me and stating, ""that Ben Siller's quite small, isn't he?"" (That's not a typo, by the way, she still thinks his surname is 'Siller').Anyway, this movie is not bad. Stiller really seems to know what he's doing, and I think this is a brave move for him, as he's usually typecast as a comedy actor. With this film, he's demonstrated that he understands how to use the camera to represent peoples everyday daydreams. Everyone does it, which makes Walter instantly relatable (to some degree). The feeling of escapism is brought across quite well, with clear contrasts to his mundane work life to his wild daydreams and eventual traveling.The acting is also noteworthy. The problem is, however, I feel that a film like this had a lot of potential for brilliant performances, which it didn't quite fulfill. They weren't bad per sè, but they didn't stand out like they could have. Slightly predictable, in a sense.Wiig's character is likable, but that's pretty much it. You see her as a love interest, and a kind of asset to him, but she's not enough to make you feel involved. I don't think that's because she can't do it, rather I think that she wasn't in it enough. She's a great actress, but she was mainly in this just for Mitty to daydream and awkwardly stare at.Stiller gives his signature acting style, however more played down, as this isn't a comedy. This style fits the character, for sure, but it could have been more alive. His Mexican friend and the Parks and Rec guy were pretty good as well, but it just seems too centered around Mitty. Character development was an issue, but that could possibly be because there was a baby sitting behind me making rather interesting chewing noises (though, to be fair, I must say it's parents kept it quiet quite well).There some decent laughs in this, too. Not like, ""HAHAHA oh boy I can't breathe! Really! Call the cinema doctor!"" But like, ""Aha. Ah. Man, I need the toilet. But I'd rather see how far this joke goes before I go"". The daydream sequences are comical, because although they are cleverly done, they are so out of the ordinary and enjoyable.It's not just the daydreams that were directed with care, though. My favourite scene is one that takes place through an x-day scanner. You seen everything happen through this screen, which is simply effective and comical.There is a scene that parodies a certain movie from a couple of years back. Now, when I heard that, I was instantly interested and couldn't wait to see what it was. Alas, when it got to it, it just didn't make sense. It didn't fit in, and was just there for an extra laugh, which it didn't need.A feel good soul searching film that was good, but had a lot of potential that it didn't fulfill, mainly due to the acting and oddly placed comedic scenes. Yeah, that's probably the best way I can put it. It's worth a watch, and it's not on the level of 'Walking with Dinosaurs', but we've seen better films this end of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thoughts after viewing,"The colors of every scene in this movie are very bright, which makes people feel that even when the protagonist is daydreaming, it is so real. It may be that the audience is left to guess whether the protagonist is daydreaming or actually achieving something.Every song and music in the movie echoes the protagonist's mood and stage of life at that time, allowing the audience to understand the protagonist's state of mind. The songs and soundtrack are all very nice.The protagonist in the movie goes from daydreaming all the time to actually fulfilling his responsibilities. Time makes him more and more brave, and life is no longer just a fantasy. Even if he loses something, as long as he has the courage to do it, he will get different things and results in the end. In the second half of the movie, the protagonist records all his adventures so that his life is no longer blank and no longer just a daydream. This is a turning point in his life.Do you also daydream a lot?What state are you in? What imagination do you have?No matter how you daydream, what is happening in your life will always force you to do it. You may escape it, you may miss it, you may fail, you may succeed. Each one is a choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In Your Face Product Placement Ruined What Could Have Been A Great Film!,"Sorry, but the product placement was so blatant it ruined the illusion of the story. Let's face it, unless your making a documentary all filmmaking is based on creating good illusions, like a talented magician! When a particular fast food company that serves gross food infects a story - like a flu virus - it wrecks the fantasy created by the filmmakers! James Thurber would be spinning in his grave!Such product placement is totally unnecessary unless the producers of the film felt The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was going to be a big flop. Or, those making the film want to squeeze every last cent they can to make money by treating filmmaking like a commodity, such as toothpaste or underarm deodorant! Hey, that's a great idea, since we get to know over and over again Walter Mitty's favorite crappy fast food restaurant, why not let us know what his favorite toothpaste and underarm deodorant are, too?!! And why stop there? Let's find out his favorite type of paper towel, toilet paper, laundry detergent, car, soda, vodka, beer and on and on.

Has good aspects but generally doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and is only consistent in one aspect – its unevenness,"I'm not overly familiar with the source material but the name Walter Mitty does tend to mean something even to those that haven't read the story – and accordingly it is of a daydreamer, a man lost in his own thoughts and being ineffective. This film version of it using this as the starting point and from here we see our main character forced to overcome his inertia and take action and thus having the type of adventures that he would only experience by spacing out for a while. I remember seeing the trailer for this recently and both me and my partner came away with the same impression – we had no idea what this film was but for sure the trailer didn't make it look good at all. Sometimes this can be the case with difficult films though – because if the film isn't one clear thing, then perhaps marketing struggle to sell it and you end up with trailers that either present it as something it isn't, or just don't sell anything. As a result I decided to see it for myself.The answer is clear before you are too far into the film; the trailer doesn't know what to sell because the film doesn't know what it is. By turns it is a simple message to ""seize the day"" to the target age audience of workers seeing their youth fade; but then it is also a travelogue of beautiful scenery in beautiful places; but then it is also a special effects film with big sequences of superhero fights and explosions; but then it is also much more introspective and character- focused; but then it is also a comedy with goofy slapstick and movie spoofs. All of this is in there in many different ways and almost none of it works when you put it next to another aspect – which is a problem in a self-contained 2 hour film. By the end the film felt so aimless and meandering that I wasn't sure why I should care Perhaps some people will be moved by the ""just do it"" message, or the ""all ended well then"" conclusion but these were so simplistic and unmatched with so much else that I really was left cold.Bits of it work in isolation and I did enjoy some aspects of the film, but the whole thing is uneven and seems to be lacking in consistency in its tone and its aims (if it even has any). I am all for films that can pull off a complex mix of ideas, emotion at different levels, tones, but this is not a film that pulls it off – this is just a film where a lot of things tend to exist very close to one another. The script seems to be the problem but I am not convinced that Ben Stiller knows what he is making here. His direction seems directionless outside of getting some great shots. This is even more evident in his acting; he delivers a performance that is whimsical and introspective but he does it in the middle of a film with nothing there to support that performance. Wiig is actually pretty good in a simple role, because she is pretty and likable without being so unreal as to become part of Mitty's fantasy herself. The rest of the cast are solid enough but again everyone is just acting out their scene in isolation.Maybe there is a beautiful, moving story in Conrad's script; it is impossible to tell here. The film will give you some laughs, it will give you some nice moments, it will give you some beautiful landscapes and it will give you some spectacle but it will not do anything consistently and this is what ultimately sunk the film for me. For once the movie trailer was accurate and honest in its reflection of the movie, because the film doesn't know what it is, and it doesn't work.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"uplifting in parts, but felt the plot was a bit weak","Given the hype surrounding this I was looking forward to seeing Ben Stiller's ambitious directorial and acting opus. I found it quite inspiring (yes, I agree with some reviewers it did feel like an ad) in parts, yet I felt there was something missing about the film. His quest to search out the legendary photographer he had been working with (but never met) becoming a sort of 'finding himself' through being adventurous.etc, I don't know if it quite worked as well as it should have. I mean was it really realistic that his main motivation would be to travel all that way for a simple photograph? I just felt it could've been done better. The cinematography and acting was pretty good, I think Stiller isn't bad at dramatic roles, although I agree with some reviewers he tends to play the same character in many of his films, whether they be comedy or drama, e.g. in Meet the Parents, Along Came Polly. I kind of miss him doing his more outlandish roles like Zoolander, Dodgeball or even his bit- part in Happy Gilmore. I wasn't a big fan of Tropic Thunder btw.

Beautiful,"This film is a triumph. The cinematography and the locations are both captivating and shockingly beautiful. The story is well paced, exciting and and engrossing. The daydreams of Walter Mitty are endlessly entertaining, but it's the accomplishments Walter makes in facing his fears and living his life to the fullest that serve as such beautiful inspiration.Very few films have the power to stay with me for years. This one sticks to my bones. As a photographer and cinematographer I relish the beauty of the images portrayed in this film. As a writer and a director, the inspirational power of the story leaves me changed, improved and impressed with the brevity of life and the importance of living it without the hindrance of fear or regret.Ben Stiller is wonderful as the title character and Kristen Wiig is charming as his love interest. Time truly is our most valuable commodity. Sometimes I finish a film and I am painfully aware that I have invested poorly and lost that time, never to regain it. With this film I feel that I am improved for investing my time in watching it: a better filmmaker, but more importantly, a better human being. This film is a rare gem indeed. Bravo, Ben Stiller.

Really enjoyable,"This film is about a man in charge of the negatives of a prominent magazine, who goes in search for an important lost negative.Wow is what I have to say after watching this film. The first half has a few funny and also visually impressive fantasy scenes, showing us the fantasy world of Walter. It's entertaining and fun to watch. The second half doesn't have much fantasy scenes anymore, instead focuses on emotional aspects of Walter. I was so touched by many scenes, including the mountain encounter and of course the grand finale - the magazine cover. I am very impressed by the plot, it tells people not to give up, venture out of their comfort zone and just do the things they are dreaming about. It's such a positive film. The only complaint is tee over the top product placement, otherwise ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a really enjoyable film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unexpected delight,"Walter Mitty, photograph curator for Time-Life, fancies new employee Cheryl Melhoff from afar: imagining himself in heroic persona, he does nothing about it. Then Life magazine closes and Mitty appears to have lost the key photograph for the cover courtesy of legendary photographer Sean O'Connell. Mitty has no choice but to track O'Connell down.Let me say that I haven't read Thurber's short story and I haven't seen the Danny Kaye movie. I suspect this version takes little from either other than the idea of a mild everyman with a vivid fantasy life. But that's OK, because this film, directed by and starring Ben Stiller, is very much its own thing, and successfully so, too.Although it has humour, it is not a comedy. Although it has fantasy, it is rooted in real people and relationships. Mitty suits Stiller's established screen persona (or a variation on it), and Kristen Wiig is a genuine pleasure as the object of his affections. Stiller's direction is also very good, with action and effects set pieces well handled, and titles and transitions proving a strong element from a production design point of view.If I had a criticism, it is that the film is a little overlong: I felt that the pursuit of O'Connell could have been trimmed somewhat.But, while I thought I would enjoy this film, it delighted me much more than I expected it to.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A film about life, but also a film about Life.","Starring AND directed by, Ben Stiller. The man is full of surprises.Good, if not perfect, film about life. And, about Life (you'll see).The Life Of .. Walter Mitty, i felt several times that it was a 8/10 film that shoots itself in the foot back to a 7/10.There is one principal gag, which then repeats itself a dozen times, over and over. By the time i was 47 minutes in, i thought i was near the end of the film, but NOPE, CHUCK TESTA for another hour.I really liked ALL the versions of this gag, but someone should have told Ben Stiller to streamline the whole affair, even at the cost of losing some scenes which, individually, are worth watching.But nobody did. And so you got a film that has sooooo many scenes that, you will like, and then you will never want to watch the film again. Because it's too much. Because, it doesn't get to the point.Take instead, let's pull a random film out of a hat, Zoolander.

another predictable stiller movie,"This is another move where Ben Stiller plays the same basic character as he does in all of his movies, (A loser/underachiever) and comes out full swing at the end overcoming his loser persona. The plot line is a little thin and extremely predictable. Admitlitly the story is likable but it is the same basic story that you see him play in most of his movies. (His acting hasn't improved much either) The soundtrack was surprisingly very good, and helps you get through the movie with a little more ease.

Pointless Journey,"When I heard this movie was coming out and seeing a trailer of it I thought it looked like a really fun movie. I heard it was based on a short story by James Thurber, so I sought it out and listened to an audio version narrated by Ben Stiller. The story was really short, only ten minutes, about a guy with a dull life who escapes in daydreams that are so dramatic they are silly. I thought, is a ten minute story really enough to fill an entire movie. That is the main problem with the movie. They took a ten minute story and stretched it to... twenty minutes, and then they had to fill the rest of the time with something.The movie does well enough with the daydream sequences and capturing the boredom of life in an office. The daydreams are too heavy on special effects though, but they are entertaining. I would rather they had saved their money on the effects and prolonged those kinds of escapes, since that is all that works in the movie.The biggest problem with the movie is the convoluted and pointless reasoning for Mitty's journey. What is it that causes Mitty to live life and explore the world? He is looking for a photograph. That's it. A photograph was mailed to him and one of the slides was missing and his job is to process the photograph. But why is one photograph so important we ask? In a contrived manner the film explains the photo is incredibly important because it is meant to be the final cover of Life magazine which is ending it's publishing and restarting online only. It seems unlikely that after twenty years on the job of never losing a photo Mitty would loose one now, which is called by the arrogant photographer: ""The quintessence of Life."" If I was Walter I would simply say to the boss that it wasn't my fault, but the photographers' fault for being careless and I would be in the right, upon which the boss, who is a jerk would reply: ""You can say that on your next job interview,"" upon which I would rejoinder ""up yours I will do that."" But why not just contact the photographer with a letter or phone call, tell him he screwed up and lost the photo. In the most tiresome manner the movie explains this jerk has no phone, no mailing address, no way to contact him, and he is out in the middle of nowhere. Well f--- him you might say. But Walter Mitty, maybe wishing to impress the love interest, decides to go on a world spanning journey to find one photograph.Maybe a better way for the story to go would be to have Walter laid off by Life, and then he snaps, and decides to get a job that involves world travel, and finally living a more exciting life.Walter's search for the photographer takes him to Greenland, where he meets a very drunken and unruly man, who informs Walter that he is a helicopter pilot and he is the only one who can take Walter where he can Possibly find who he is looking for. Walter thinks for a minute that this is not a good idea to ride a helicopter into a storm with a seriously drunken man. Then, in one of his fits of daydream he is inspired to say ""screw it I'm going to live life."" He gets in the copter and then ends up plunging in the water and nearly gets eaten by sharks. He seems to think this experience is positive because he is finally living life, even though he nearly had his limbs torn off. Similarly later he travels to a place with an erupting volcano, because what traveler hasn't, and that adds to his excitement. It's like the real life scenes are like daydreams and not believable. Is reckless behavior that nearly leads to disaster a sign of personal growth that is inspiring and something to be used to impress the love interest.As he goes on his journey he passes through very beautiful scenery, and you have to think it is so strange that this one photograph could be worth more than the millions of dollars that went into filming all this. Why couldn't he have brought a camera with him? Maybe he isn't a professional but how hard could it be to look at a vista of mountains and say to yourself ""that is the quintessence of life,"" *Click* then turn in the photo to the boss who would be impressed. That would be a better ending than what we have. When we see what the elusive photograph is, it is a let down, because clearly the writer had no ideas and wrote himself in a corner.Another thing that bothered me about this movie is it's use of product placement. At first it started out cute when he talked to a guy on the phone from Eharmony. Then this character kept recurring, until you see that Eharmony is an entire character. Likewise they include Papa John's in a strange and distracting way. The restaurant had a deep meaning for the character because he worked there when his own father, or ""Papa"" died, which is sad, and makes me want to eat there. Then when he is in Greenland, a country which is describes as having 100 people, he finds a Papa Johns restaurant in the middle of nowhere, and eats there, because the whole world loves Papa Johns. I was paid to say that.I wanted to see a positive and inspiring movie. Maybe I would be more inspired if it was good. 2/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Visually stunning, emotionally lacking","Setting out to prove to the world that he is more than mere male models and zipper accidents actor/director Ben Stiller has chosen James Thurber's famous short story as inspiration for this wannabe life changing movie that whilst featuring many an incredible image and playing out with an inoffensive charm, is a tale that wants us to believe that it is more than it is and upon reflection is about as meaty as a vegetarians banquet.The downfall of Stiller's film is that the actual real life tale of dreamer Walter who must enter reality and finally do something with his life is not as grand or wonderful as it thinks it is, scenes played out in Walter's imagination are enjoyable yet slightly too silly (a scene with a Stretch Armstrong doll in particular) and the journey that Walter takes to discover the lost negative is rushed and almost as unbelievable as his dreams, giving off the sense of too much fantasy when we should be partaking in a reality based journey. The sense of playfulness is a major factor in the romance of Walter Mitty feeling unbelievable also.Stiller and Wiig's chemistry while not bad is not fully utilised in the film, with perhaps a mere 10 minutes or so screen time dedicated to establishing and growing a bond between Walter and Cheryl. Stiller spends to much time coming up with spectacle when an ace up his sleeve may have been more time spent in the real world letting the audience see and feel the love blossoming between the two lost souls. With a story that does not live up to it's full potential the film does however showcase a talent Stiller has never shown before with a keen eye for detail, a well edited pace and perfectly chosen musical score all adding up to display that Stiller is more than a mere comedy director.Walter Mitty is an enjoyable tale sure to please many both young and old, even though one feels that deep down there is a more profound and fully formed version that could of sprung to life. As a tale about finally doing not merely dreaming it's a perfectly adequate movie with many a stunning image, an easy going atmosphere and the movie is hopefully a stepping stone for Stiller to tackle even more challenging material in the future and create a classic for the ages that he wanted to do with this movie.3 and a half Stretch Armstrong's out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sweet story drowned out by too much CGI,"Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a meek daydreamer working as the negative asset manager in Life magazine. He hasn't been anywhere noteworthy. He is infatuated with Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) who joined Life a month ago. The problem is that he keeps spacing out as he daydreams. Life got taken over and Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) is there to close down the magazine. Legendary photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a specific photo to be developed by Walter for the cover of the final issue. Only Walter can't find it and he goes off to find the unreachable Sean O'Connell. Also Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn play his mother and sister.There is a sweet likable story here. It strives to be poignant. Ben Stiller directed this ambitious film and he does a reasonable job. He just needs a few adjustments. Walter's daydreaming wore out its welcome as he and Ted do battle. Stiller is doing too much. That also goes for his trip to Greenland and Iceland. It's too outlandish. He is stuck with this idea of making his daydreams come alive. It would be so much more poignant for Walter to have real experiences. The Afganistan trip is still unreal but it feels more real than the rest of the movie. In that sense, it works better. The artificial nature of everything just strips away some of the real feeling. Just because there is advancements in CGI, it doesn't mean that it must be used.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't believe the secretly paid hype in the other reviews!,"If not for the interesting scenery, I would have given this self-indulgent stinker one out of ten stars. Indeed, there is very little of substance to be found in this remake of the Danny Kaye classic, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.It's a shame really because the main players involved here (Stiller and Wiig) are capable of such fine work. But you can't make a likable movie without any real drama, comedy or, at the very least, mystery unless your intended audience is either underage or senile. Neither of which was the case here.However, the real shame of this movie is the vast number of extremely blatant product placements placed throughout the whole bore-fest. As such, this film just seems like a money grab for Stiller, the producers, and the movie company which owns this travesty.I strongly urge anyone who wants to see a real movie with terrific comedy, mystery and drama to check out the 1947 original Walter Mitty starring Danny Kaye and the very lovely, Virginia Mayo. You won't be disappointed with it no matter what age you are.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
STOP DREAMING! START LIVING!,"I never had a best movie, I guess I was saving that spot for a really awesome movie. Watching this not just put that spot at risk, it occupied it. This is truly a captivating motion picture. I don't suppose anyone might read this, considering it's been 5 years. However, if you had a choice between this movie and another, I'd recommend you watch this. It truly is an amazing piece of work, a terrific story and a great cinematography. Thanks, Ben Stiller for not just a motivating and mind-blowing movie but also for the message you passed across. 
I suppose this adds me to the list of people who joined IMDb just to rate an awesome movie.

Ignore the critics. Watch this,"TBH, who hasn't found themselves daydreaming?Based on the 1947 film of the same, Walter Mitty follows the story of a regular guy who dreams of larger adventures... and achieves it. This is a feel-good, motivational film. How close within our reach are our most insane dreams without us realizing?I'm not too big of a Ben Stiller fan, but this has to be his magnum opus.The film is innocent yet adventurous. It highlights the potential in us and the ability for us to reach our dreams. The viewers feel connected to Walter Mitty in their own experiences.Maybe you'll recognize your own milestones in life and the internal confidence used to achieve those goals. Instead of daydreaming of what we want, we can start working towards them and live our life.And I didn't even get started on the cinematography.4.5/5.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty- This Admirably Creative Attempt from Ben Stiller Results in Overstated Metaphor and Shallow Misunderstanding,"""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams, and live the life you have imagined,"" stated author Henry David Thoreau expressing a naturalist sentiment that bemoans the vicarious escapism of pure imagination and pleads with us to discover life through direct experience. This is the central theme that surrounds the emotionless title protagonist in the newest film adaptation of the infamous James Thurber short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and though it's sound advice to be sure it seems oddly displaced to be a driving refrain for the dreaming power of cinema. Within the latest remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty we unfortunately see director, producer, and star Ben Stiller in rather weak form despite his admirable decision to branch out creatively messily guiding Steve Conrad's overstated script to never fully articulate the true meaning of intended self-discovery. The film reeks of overt desperation attempting to fully separate itself from the original Norman Z. McLeod adaptation in utilizing state of the art pristine visuals and engulfing panoramic surrounding but inevitably loses touch with the heart of the message by embodying in the end an all too generic presentation. It might be too gracious to even suggest that Stiller knows of the influences he's admirably trying to invoke, but his The Secret Life of Walter Mitty tries to bridge the life affirming discovery of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru with the comedic thoughtfulness of John Schlesinger's Billy Liar without ever approaching the depth of either. Stiller's fifth film as a director sees him trying to lift himself out of the conventions of his overbearing low-brow comedic past and though his impressive visuals are skillfully conceived the film's message gets lost in inflated clichés and naively mistakes living for reckless endangerment. As it is with most adaptations it's clear that this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty leaves behind the intention of Thurber's original story about dreaming beyond the confines of the mundane by replacing that contemplation with a theme of actual life affirming self-discovery that unfortunately falls flat due to the indiscernibility of consistent impeccable imagery, the blunt underlining of obvious metaphor, and an inability to humanly connect with our more adventurous sensibilities. If there's anything to take away from this rather uninvolving film about making the implausibility of dreams a felt reality it's that Ben Stiller in his admirable attempt to grow as a filmmaker has given us a demonstration that perhaps imagining something is actually better than seeing it become a reality.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-CK; Other reviews: generationfilm.net",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic,"The cinematography is beyond beautiful and outclasses a lot of films today. It is a very heart warming story that really makes you get behind the protagonist Walter Mitty. It isn't a film that has an intellectual plot and isn't particularly ground breaking in any way, but that in a sense is the beauty of it. It is ' just ' a story. I think that it doesn't take itself too seriously yet it still delivers an amazing cinematic story. I found myself getting very invested in the characters and really rooting for Walter.

"Fun, Charming and worth a watch!","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty see's Ben Stiller not only star in the lead role as Walter but direct and produce an enjoyable fantasy family film. When watching this film dubbed 'the next Forest Gump' I have to be honest my expectations were not huge. I was however pleasantly surprised. If you are looking to escape for two hours then this film is for you. It takes you on a huge adventure and blurs the line between fantasy and reality.The film is funny, sweet and charming and the fine acting performances complement the excellent special effects. Ben Stiller plays a relatively straight role and does it very well, although he still has a few moments involving long hair and silly runs so don't worry Stiller fans! This film is quite predicable and you can figure out the end before you even see the opening title sequence, however there are some twists and turns that engage you further than the average family film.A decent film that will not change your life but maybe question it.

"Globetrotting adventure, alternately inspiring and desultory and in the end, ordinary","I very aware of this film when it hit theaters back in the day, however the mixed reviews dissuaded me from seeing it in theaters. Now that I have viewed it in its entirety, I do not regret that decision. Ben Stiller had a lot of ideas when he went to work on this, but his execution makes for an uneven and at times frustrating film.Perhaps this story could have benefited from more editing as certain scenes feels interminable. I cannot fault the performances. For a film so heartbreakingly conventional, there are committed characters throughout the film, both heroes and villains. But the story's overlong and meandering approach is what chokes the life out of the film. By the time, we get to the heartfelt conclusion, it's questionable how much we still care at that point. I wanted to like Walter Mitty, maybe even love it. But it was too much of a slog, more so than the protagonist's excursion through Iceland and Afghanistan.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film that inspires,"When I say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an inspiring story is an understatement. This film really grabs the idea that even a secluded desk job worker can go on the most amazing adventure. Sure, some of the scenes are corny, but the story is so mesmerizing that it makes you want to walk outside and climb Mt. Everest. Moving from the story, the cinematography of this film is unreal. Each shot is a work of art, doesn't matter if it's in Greenland or New York City. Most of the scenes were actually shot on site which means you are getting the real deal. The music to this movie is also my favorite from any film. Jose Gonzalez is what makes the adventures of Walter Mitty even more epic. Also, you cannot go wrong with Arcade Fire and David Bowie. In summary, this is not a movie to skip over.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Greatest movie in the entire world.,"The love I hold in my heart for this movie is so vast. My favourite things about this movie are the cinematography and the soundtrack.Diving into the cinematography first, wow. Walter adventures from Greenland, to Iceland, to the Himalayas, to Afghanistan. The views of these places in the world are astonishing, and important for Walter to see, since he lives in the lovely concrete jungle with little to no nature. The camera shots are perfect and scratches an itch in your brain.Next is the soundtrack. If you ever want to feel like a main character exploring a new place, you need this soundtrack. I've made a Spotify playlist for when you want to feel like Walter because of how great this soundtrack is. José González is a god.Whenever I'm asked for a movie recommendation, before asking what genre they're looking for, I always recommend this movie. It changed me, and everyone I know who has seen it loves it too, just never as much as me lol. Go watch this right now if you haven't seen it, I can't recommend it enough.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Walter Mitty's Inconsistent, Yet Beautiful, Journey","I mean, c'mon, who hasn't daydreamed about a more exciting life in which the girl of your dreams is now suddenly in your arms. Something The Secret Life of Walter Mitty surely promises is empathy. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a ""negative assets manager"" over at Life Magazine who spends most of his day in his thoughts rather than in reality, and a fellow employee (Kristen Wiig) he works with has certainly caught his eye. Consequently, he contemplates, zones out, and pleasurably imagines heroically and properly introducing himself to her- true romance commencing from thereon. However, once someone taps him back to life and he wakes up, Mitty can only approach his crush with deepening awkwardness and nervosity. Sad is the truth, but when can we finally stop dreaming of a more invigorating and interesting version of our life and embark on that exhilarating journey we so clearly desire? The film hopes to explore that question as Walter Mitty travels across the world to locate a missing negative, and from that point forward, he finally encounters the danger, energy, and pure vastness of the real world.A major highlight of this ambitious project is its downright gorgeous visuals, taking us to the open spaces of Iceland, the grandiose Himalaya Mountains, and the dark depths of an ocean. The camera places you into some frenetic action sequences and then counters these with beautiful establishing shots of various landscapes, representing the expansive terrains of the sheer life out there, patiently waiting for us whether you're a middle-aged, distressed white-collar worker or an intrepid young adult. The editing is smooth and remarkably prevalent, playing a significant role in conveying this inspiring narrative. The soundtrack complements that sense of excitement and adventure, providing us with lively tracks from the likes of Arcade Fire and encouraging ones from artists like Of Monsters and Men. Now, the first half of the film is driven by that level of realism, relatability, and quirkiness, which I found to be very satisfying indeed.With that being said, the second half takes on a cheesier and less believable tone/path, obviously attempting to accomplish its thematic goals. Hollywood's involvement becomes perfectly transparent once the film reaches the last act, and that happy ending becomes ever happier (and unnatural). In addition, a movie that's partially fueled by comedy unfortunately doesn't deliver on enough laughs. It got a few chuckles out of me, but a considerable portion of the jokes/overall humor fell flat and simply appeared clumsy in delivery. In essence, TSLOWM works much better as a drama than a comedy (with dramatic elements). So, if you are to enter the theater with the expectations of it being a drama, you'd likely end up leaving more satisfied rather than if you entered it thinking it's another fun, inspiring comedy for the holidays. At the end of the day, if you just can't bring yourself to enjoy Walter Mitty's (inconsistent) story throughout the entire duration, chances are you still might be mesmerized by its dazzling look and spectacular production value. Regardless of its predictable and slightly corny conclusion, there is much motivation and zeal to be found in this uplifting, inspiriting tale.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Expected Better! 3/10,"Review: I didn't really like this film. I found it pretty boring and it seem to drag in places. There were a couple of scenes which were brilliant, when Witty let his mind wander, but apart from that, I struggled to stay awake. I had high expectations of the film because of the posters and the fact that Ben Stiller was directing it, but in was very disappointed. Watching Stiller going around the world to find a negative to go on the last issue of LIFE just didn't work for me and I did find the serious side of Stiller quite uninteresting. I loved Tropic Thunder, which was also directed by Stiller, but this film really needed some wit. The whole look of the film was pretty impressive, which it should be with such a big budget, but for a 2 hour movie, it just didn't work for me. Disappointing!Round-Up: I think that Stiller was trying to show another side to his acting ability which I didn't really enjoy watching. Everybody knows his phrases and silly jokes now, so I can understand why he was trying to do something serious, with a touch of comedy. The movie would have been much better if his mind wandered much more, but he chose to stick with a road movie which was extremely epic in some scenes. Anyway, the film looked good but I wasn't that impressed.Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $188millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a man going around the world to find a negative to publish in the last issue of LIFE. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most pleasant films ever,"Just a super pleasant film where you occasionally giggle at a joke but mostly just smile all the way through. There is a small amount of silliness that detracts from this, but it is far outweighed by just how charming this film is. I would compare this feeling to that when I watch Field of Dreams. Sure it's a good story line, but you just feel good all the way through it. The office scenes with the takeover people are silliness that you have to get through. But all the while that he travels, the people he meets, the things he does, just really feel-good.

My top 1 movie,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film that takes audiences on a captivating journey of self-discovery. Directed by Ben Stiller, who also stars in the lead role, the movie weaves together elements of adventure, fantasy, and poignant human connection.From the outset, the cinematography is a standout feature. The film's vibrant and breathtaking visuals transport viewers to different corners of the world, capturing the essence of each location with remarkable precision. Whether it's the vast landscapes of Iceland or the bustling streets of New York City, every frame is a testament to the film's commitment to visual storytelling.At its core, the narrative revolves around Walter Mitty, a daydreamer who escapes his mundane reality through vivid fantasies. Stiller's portrayal of Mitty is both endearing and relatable, allowing audiences to empathize with his desire for a more fulfilling life. The transition between Mitty's daydreams and reality is seamless, creating a narrative fluidity that keeps viewers engaged.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to balance moments of humor with poignant introspection. Stiller injects humor into Mitty's character, providing much-needed comic relief amid the film's more contemplative themes. However, it's the moments of self-discovery and personal growth that truly elevate the movie.The soundtrack, composed by Theodore Shapiro, complements the film's emotional beats perfectly. The music enhances the sense of wonder and adventure, underscoring Mitty's transformative journey. Each musical cue is carefully chosen, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes.The supporting cast, including Kristen Wiig and Sean Penn, deliver commendable performances that contribute to the overall authenticity of the film. Wiig's chemistry with Stiller adds a touch of romance to the narrative, while Penn's character serves as a catalyst for Mitty's transformation.As Mitty embarks on a global quest to find a missing photograph for the final issue of Life magazine, the audience is taken on a vicarious adventure. The film's pacing allows for moments of quiet reflection as well as thrilling sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Beyond its technical and narrative merits, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" imparts a powerful message about embracing life's uncertainties and pursuing one's passions. The film encourages viewers to break free from the confines of routine and dare to dream, resonating with audiences on a deeply personal level.In conclusion, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a masterfully crafted film that seamlessly blends captivating visuals, heartfelt performances, and a meaningful narrative. Ben Stiller's directorial prowess shines through, making this cinematic journey a memorable and uplifting experience. With its universal themes of self-discovery and the pursuit of a more meaningful existence, the movie earns a solid 10-star rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sweet tale of living life to the full.,"With Zoolander and Tropic Thunder as his last couple of directorial efforts, Ben Stiller is on a red hot run behind the camera. This film is less memorable and (intentionally) not as humorous compared to those comedic gems, but with a greater dramatic depth and Stiller wearing his heart proudly on his sleeve, this Oscar-buzzing picture proves he has grown as a filmmaker. There's the occasional scene that doesn't gel - most notably an airport scuffle behind a security screen and a Benjamin Button parody - or visual flourish that feels too whimsical or forced, yet for every misstep there's a handful of entertaining sequences waiting around the corner to regain control. Swimming with a shark, skateboarding towards a volcano, traversing the Alps and saving a three-legged dog from an exploding building are just some of the noteworthy parts of Walter Mitty, although the jewel in the crown is a sensational Greenland-set musical number that sees Kristen Wiig's waif-like Cheryl inspire Mitty to jump into a helicopter piloted by a drunken buffoon. If it sounds a tad weird, that's because it is, however it's also possibly the best few minutes Stiller has ever committed to celluloid. In front of the camera Stiller demonstrates exemplary refrain as the titular protagonist - an average man who is worth rooting for - and Wiig is stellar in a downplayed role that also expands her repertoire. It doesn't quite soar like it should, but this is a sweet and solid tale of living your life to the full.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a Ben Stiller movie so....,"When considering seeing this movie just think this one thing.....it is a Ben Stiller Movie. Just think of any movie that he has starred in and you will know what to expect. You will have a few cheap laughs....as always, you will have some quirky moments...as always. There will be desperate attempts to make you laugh...as always and of course, as he is the master of embarrassing and uncomfortable scenes, there will be plenty of moments to have you cringing.With stereotypical Stiller aside, there is one difference. And that is this films visual superiority against his previous films. Some of the shots in the movie are stunning and the emphatic soundtrack that accompanies them is awe-inspiring. It is the combination of those that make it worthwhile. Everything else is sub standard, the message it tries to convey isn't as powerful and focal as it should be.Still..er a really good film and worth the viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For today's film goers, this is Inception but without the confusing action but it was worth the admission. A bit loose though","""My second time seeing a cinema-released film on Christmas Day since Django Unchained last year. What would you make out of life if you lived in a dream-like, lucid state of mind? Well, Ben Stiller responds to this question with this esoteric, psychedelic or hippie-influenced, and quirky remake of the 1947 film of the same name and film adaptation of James Thurber's magazine story. Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty seems like an earnest choice since his character, remembering from some clips and pre-evaluated knowledge, is not over-the-top, raunchy, or stoned as today's comedic actors would come across.Stiller evokes a sort of Truman Show-esque vibe to this character and his peculiar episodes dealing with his dreams, his love interest, and adventures through Iceland, Greenland, and the Himalayas. Mitty is done in a way, and with some of the film's choice of environment and place, like an 80s or 90s film where there the technology is there but it feels minimalist and too kind to be out-there and a bit too rough and stylised to be considerably respectable to the older generation. Given this element, I found myself laughing little in this film but being intrigued by the cinematography and oddball events that Mitty encounters more than the humour alone. The Iceland and Greenland scenes were well-done and the beginning scene (which is cleverly done comedy by being subtle) but the scenes set in the Himalayas and elsewhere felt a bit stale and overlooked.The plot does feel a bit loose too with scenes going on for quite a few minutes without any kind of intriguing traction or element of suspense and emergency which adds to the good but not always brilliant ""hippie/psychedelic"" label to this film (not to say, the excellent choice of David Bowie, nature shots, quotes of strength, and other pieces of music in it). It did not help that the film used the same title twice which could be an editing error in the opening credits and I honestly wish there could have been more dream sequences or ending the film like it was a dream as that concept flew over the cuckoo's nest 1/3 into the film. The possibly perceived anti-corporate, anti-TSA/pro- privacy, pro-nature, pro-culture message might be off-putting to some but it was done within the confines of exploring out of your surroundings and feeling life for what it is almost like a travel guide on Globe Trekker or a crazy episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations but without the food or all-out vulgarity.One thing that intrigued me more (not just how much product placement there was which was something that didn't bother me really but it was funnily done) was the PG rating (which is more appropriately granted here than a PG-13) for this film given it has no kid appeal and features language (ass, hell, damn) and adult humour (a heroin and genitalia joke) which might scratch parents' heads more for a PG than if it was another animated work from Disney or DreamWorks. Aside from that, I probably might have missed this film if it was not for the PG curio element to a film that looks like it would be another commercial PG-13 film aimed at adults these days. As a film, it works to be a modern-day homage and it does its job and does not squirm on over-the-top elements here which add to the film's dryly comic yet ultimately dramatic presentation.It also works by allowing you feel like in a place other than somewhere else which is ultimately what Christopher Nolan's Inception did three years ago but considering how overrated and confusing I though of it, Walter Mitty (the two versions included, 1947 and 2013) was better done with the lucid concept. I watched this film during Christmas day knowing of a family relative's respect and admiration for the original and being from the new generation, I gave this title a chance and I was not disappointed as much as some of the critics have said. It was far from perfect but it was nicely done and the Iceland/Greenland scenes were worth the admission at least and the PG curiosity to it.""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Very good, Updated, different version from Danny Kaye classic","A very good attempt by Ben Stiller that hits the right marks on most occasions. I'm not a big Stiller fan but he performed admirably here. He provided depth & likability to the classic day dreamer Walter Mitty. This version was more heartwarming, a little more adventurous & slightly less funny than the 1947 movie with the same title. However, there were enough chuckles. I despise Sean Penn & pretty much all he stands for, including the vast majority of his movies but even I could tolerate his short role in this one. His character had a major impact throughout the film & while he was much more subdued when we finally get to meet him, Penn pulled it off. You understand why he does what he does. Being a fan of the original, this version could have used 1, maybe 2 more funny day dreams from Walter. Stiller also missed out on an opportunity to give a nod to the original by having just one dream sequence with Kaye's classic ""ta-pak-a-ta, ta-pak-a-ta"" sound somewhere in the background. This movie is about a 7.4 or 7.5 therefore I had to go with a 7. If Stiller could have squeezed in what I came away missing, I could have easily elevated it to a 9. All in all, a strong effort. Go see it, you'll have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Walter Mitty"": A Triumph in Every Possible Way","I've had my IMDb account for over 8 years, but I've never written a review before; that is, I've never felt compelled to, until now.I gave the film a 10, but here's a little caveat about my grading: I don't 'kinda' like films. I either do, or don't—so it's a 1, or a 10. A flawed system, perhaps, but there are a lot of redeeming qualities that I can find in a film: directing, cinematography, acting, writing, story, music... in fact, it's difficult for me not to like a film in some respect. Clearly, I like ""Walter Mitty"" but don't let my pass/fail grading criteria fool you. This film is clever, touching, and—most surprisingly—authentic, and it accomplishes this in a multitude of ways.I'm not going to summarize the plot of the story; surely, you know it by now and are simply wondering whether it's worth a viewing or not. The short answer is: yes. But if you want to know /why/, continue reading. I will, instead, examine the movie based on what I perceive to be its artistic merits.First, the cinematography is splendid. The film possesses a very clean, sharp look. The colors are quite vibrant, and nearly leap off the screen (helped immensely by the truly awe-inspiring locations the film takes place in, from the busy streets of NYC to the solitary landscapes of Greenland and Iceland). ""Walter Mitty"" is pleasing to the eye, which is always a plus.Ben Stiller's directing is smart and inspired, and surprisingly high- octane when needed (the first daydream sequence comes to mind, as Stiller's vision caught me quite off guard, in a very good way). Visually speaking, I knew the film was in good hands from the opening scene—it's a simple sequence of Walter sitting in his apartment pining away on his laptop, and yet Stiller's framing is careful and deliberate, conveying Walter's sense of isolation and loneliness. Indeed, Stiller's directing throughout the film is always thoughtful, and never lazy. There are some directors who maintain the same style of filming throughout their careers, but there is a very clear and traceable evolution throughout Stiller's filmography, and ""Walter Mitty"" is his best yet.The screenplay overachieves to a great degree. Ostensibly a film about an awkward, stagnating introvert (in conjunction with what was revealed in trailers and television spots), the audience will surprisingly find themselves on an international adventure. My biggest fear—as a writer myself—was Walter's goal: of course, he wants the girl but what will separate this film from others of the same genre? Or is it just another clone? Fortunately, there are indeed two conflicts (including wooing Cheryl, played by Kristen Wiig) that propel the story on its improbable course. And the two main characters themselves are thoroughly fleshed- out as the story goes along. We accompany them on this grand journey and truly witness a transformation occur in both of them, and you can't help but feel happy. In the end, the story is crafted with the utmost cleverness and care (the dialogue is especially rich if one pays attention), and with just enough over-the-top sequences, it manages to find glimmers of humor, action, and humanity in every little nook possible.I often feel bad for composers for comedy/romantic comedy films because they never really get to show off their chops or introduce complex melodies when all they're scoring is dialogue- and humor-based scenes; there's just not that much opportunity to really shine. With that being said, however, composer Theodore Shapiro does a commendable job. The music that accompanies ""Walter Mitty"" is often whimsical, with a slight air of hope, and touching when it needs to be. There were indeed two or three scenes where the music was rather noticeable and really bolstered the emotional punch, and that was a very pleasant and welcomed surprise.Just a few words before I end: I'm not a very big fan of comedy films. In fact, the last comedy film that I voluntarily watched was probably ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin."" With that being said, however, I don't consider ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" to be a comedy. Rather, it comes across as a drama/adventure film with humorous moments sprinkled throughout. To be quite frank: I didn't actually laugh at all during this film—but I enjoyed it immensely, and can say with all honesty that it is on my shortlist of favorite films for 2013.Strangely enough, I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller's work. I just find his characters and acting to be relatable and authentic. I have a few friends that scoff at his films and the fact that I like them, perhaps the way some scoff at Adam Sandler for seemingly losing his touch after ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison."" But there's just something about Stiller's movies that are borderline outlandish (if not outright), and yet, I find them to be extremely honest to the human condition—and his latest directorial work is no exception. All in all, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is an excellent character study and a touching coming-of-middle-age story. It bubbles with vitality in every scene and conveys a fun carpe diem message. In fact, I enjoyed this film so much that I re-watched it immediately after my first viewing. Simply put, you will not regret watching ""Walter Mitty."" Instead, you will find yourself filled with a poignant sense of hope and—for lack of a better word—happy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most cinematic & beautiful storytelling ever seen!,"This movie is gorgeous! The way it's filmed really sucks you into the world of Walter and how he see his life.It's a very relatable movie, having a job where you see other people achieving things and travelling the world while you're stuck in the same city you've been in forever.This movie inspires imagination and daringness in a very real way that doesn't make it a cliche. The writing is so good and every line has a meaning to the story and you always get to know Walters' thought on it.I've watched this movie at least 5 times and it's always as beautiful and well written every time. If you like adventures you'll love this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious and deeper than expected,"Funny, interesting, great acting and with more depth than one might expect. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty isn't perfect, but it's still very good and well worth the money spent.Walter Mitty works on a magazine called Life Magazine, living an organized and dull life and is constantly pushed around by his boss. A stressed, organized person, Walter's life contains little to no room for spontaneity. He dreams of adventures and is secretly in love with his co worker Cheryl, and tries to contact her through a dating site. Life Magazine is coming to an end, the last issue is on the way, and when the negative of the picture for the front page is missing, Walter sets of for an incredible journey, in which he tries to find not only for the negative but also himself.When I was about to watch this film, my expectations weren't exactly spectacular. Sure, it seemed to be a funny movie, and I would probably get some good laughs, but I really thought that would be it. I couldn't have been more wrong. This really is one of those movies that is just impossible to dislike.One of the things that I liked the most about this movie is the character of Walter Mitty. Played by Ben Stiller, who (along with the rest of the actors) does a fantastic job of making his character come to life, Walter is a character that is very believable and one that could very well exist in real life. His dream of being adventurous, and the struggle he experiences while trying to take the step out of his comfort zone, is something I think a lot of people can relate to. When Walter takes the chance and does something unexpected, he develops in a fantastic way. By the end of the film he's almost unrecognizable, and he is, by all means, a great main character.I also liked how the movie was shot. A good part of it takes place in Iceland, which has some amazing landscapes SP that are a beautiful addition to the film. The soundtrack is also very good, and does a great job at emphasizing the mood of the film, as it should. It doesn't lack humor, either, and made me laugh out loud many times. There is, however, one thing in this film that I thing could have been done better, and that's the plot. It's a great story, but it's a little to easy to tell what's going to happen. The ending was fairly easy to predict, and I think the movie would have played out a lot better with some sort of twist or unexpected ending.Despite SP its shortcomings, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is still a fantastic movie. It tells an incredible story with a great moral lesson, that most people can relate to. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty can be seen by anyone who appreciates a heartwarming, encouraging and believable story with both humor and depth, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in that. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and if you haven't already, I would highly suggest that you go see it, as soon as you can. Don't let yourself miss a masterpiece like this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A movie with great promise falls short due to fractured plot,"This is certainly a movie with great promise that falls apart due to a rather incoherent and disjointed plot. The basic elements of film making seemed to have been ignored by its producers. As a result, the movie can easily lose its audience in the first 40 minutes. The movie is another example that the sum of its parts does not lead to a complete piece of art. I am even surprised that it has done well financially, perhaps due to its cast. Furthermore, its underlying themes do not make it a good family movie. Too much time is wasted on trivial pseudo-funny scenes that seemed to have been borrowed from a mediocre sitcom.In summary, the storyline could have been handled better by savvy production designers.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Acting of Ben stiller was amazing, I was astonished by his character development through the movie. And I was shocked when I discover that he is the director too.

Excellent film - prerequisites are an open mind and an appreciation of life.,"***Mild Spoilers*** Most of the reviews have touched on what makes this film such a fantastic film and also some that take it down a peg.I think the longeboarding scene is a litmus test of the type of person you truly are. My personal feeling is that if you watch the longboarding scene with wonder and joy than this will be a powerful film to you and easily a film that touches you. If not then this is probably not the film for you.Walter Mitty starts out slow and in this slow beginning there are many crucial details to pick up that make more sense as the film begins to pick up. The film truly comes alive as Walter plunges into the icy waters of the arctic. I can't help but think of it as a metaphorical plunge into the unknown, with salvation of one type or another as the only possible outcomes.As some have noted the daydreams go away mid-film. That is the point. As Walter begins to experience life in the truest sense he has no need for daydreams. I honestly felt that this is the entire point of the Film. Another reviewer stated that Walters real-life adventures are more entertaining than his day-dreams. To this I agree entirely. Walters life sequences are unrealistic, beautiful and captivating. There is no real possibility that they would happen and yet they are shot so beautifully that they are easy for US, the audience to have our own Walter Mitty day- dream moments. In those moments we think about and take stock of our life.I think that this is the real power of the film is to reflect on moments of the film. From the major scenes to the closing credits and their uniqueness. The credits and photography are the most beautiful I can remember seeing on film.Go into this film with an open mind and appreciation for life a you will leave with a sense of wonder, more perspective and joy than you entered with.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The scenery and the movie itself are beautiful. The story is brilliant and even inspiring.I think what made this movie so good is that it's relatable.

A lovely feel good adventure. Stiller nails it yet again.,"This movie was quite magical. It had moments that rival the best of them. And to think Stiller directed it? What can't he do? It was what I would describe as magical realism, but without the nonsense. There were a few scenes that were a little far out there, but the leap of faith required was not beyond the pale, which is a lot more than I can say about most Hollywood films, that have any level of action, these days. It was a very creative endeavor, and I give Stiller a lot of credit for it. The cinematography was wonderful. The locations were amazing. The spirit of adventure was admirable. The characters were believable. Some great spoofs, especially the boneheads with the beards. And Kristen Wiig was believable, sincere, funny, and charming. In all, the cast was great.Considering that the last film Stiller directed was Tropic Thunder, which was hilarious, this guy has some real talent behind the lens too.Many are knocking this film, as being too positive, too optimistic, too lighthearted, or too insubstantial. I just do not get all that. It is a feel good film. I suppose, in this day and age, for some that is just too much to deal with. For some of us, it is just really good entertainment. Have we really degenerated to the level where that is not OK anymore?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Witty' and heartfelt but this Stiller is a 'Bitty' off the mark,"Ben Stiller stars and directs James Thurber's short and interesting story about a day dreamer who escapes his life through constant day- dreams composed of heroism, romance and action.Stiller has an impressive portfolio as both an actor and director but his adaption of Thurber's tale doesn't quite excel in the way it could have done.By no means is this a bad film. You really feel an empathy for Stiller's characterised take on Walter Smith - he does a fine job. But this film requires a little more meat, ambition and . The fact is - even though it is humorous in parts - it just doesn't feel like it should have been set up as a comedy. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is as its best in its most heartfelt moments and during an incredibly journey. The drawback from the latter is that its only brushed around the edges; its all very bland as feels like an unexplored journey rather than an explored one.Stiller is part however of a very good cast which all perform amiably. I'm not sure its really worth the time and effort to view it at the cinema however you could see far worse. My suggestion is that you buy the DVD when it arrives if its something you have an urge to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cute new take on the James Thurber classic, see it!","Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has a secret life in his daydreams. When he wants to kiss the girl or take a swing at his boss, he can do it in a pretend world that is very realistic. Most times, someone has to say something to bring him back to earth. As an employee of the photography department of Life Magazine, he is very respected. But, his world is turned over when a beautiful divorcée, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) joins the staff. How to approach her is his burning question. At first, he joins a matchmaking site and tries to ""wink"" at her profile. She doesn't wink back. But, when a new owner arrives at the magazine and starts throwing his weight around, Walter and Cheryl have a bond. The two become worried that they will be let go. This is especially true when a valuable negative turns up missing and Walt will take the blame if its not found. Believing it is with a world traveling photographer, Walter breaks away from his comfort zone and jets to Greenland and Iceland to catch up with the shutterbug. Will he make it home? Will our dear Walter also win the day with Cheryl? If you have never read the Thurber story on which this film is based, do it now. Even so, this new take on the tale is cute, funny, and worthwhile without that foundation. Especially fine is the cast and the breathtaking scenery in far away climes. Yet, the script, costumes, and direction are wonderful as well. Secretly slip out the door and surprise your family with this fine little flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"The 1947 version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has long been a favourite film of mine, certainly one that's lingered from childhood, although it wouldn't be in my top-ten nowadays. That film was the epitome of what a star vehicle could be during the forties; especially for a talent such as Danny Kaye. It's bright, fanciful, puts Kaye front-and-centre with opportunity to showcase his many talents, whilst offering a gorgeous love interest in Virginia Mayo, and a risible villain in the ominous shape of Boris Karloff. Plot-wise, this was paper thin, and whilst Ben Stiller's recent version could have been a like- minded project, this new story far exceeds what was done in 1947 and presents one of the most engaging, uplifting and joyous films of the past year. Directed by Stiller from a screenplay by Steve Conrad, this story of a daydreaming photo executive for Life magazine is a mightily impressive and very sincere effort from Stiller, whose Mitty jumps from train station platforms to burning buildings, battles his new, obnoxious boss like a superhero would a super-villain on the streets of New York, and romances his office crush, played by Kristen Wiig. But this is all in Walter's mind, of course, and part of an imagination wonderfully and creatively realised by Stiller, whose framing, composition and ability to find humour in Mitty, without making a clown of him, is hugely impressive and highly endearing. Even the opening credits are a simply effective visual treat, whilst there's genuine sadness in Stiller's facial expressions, delivery of his lines and the way which he shoots and frames the lonely, grey Mitty. As the story progresses from fantasy to realism, such care and attention to who the character is and what he needs allows for a leap of faith to be taken with Mitty when an important photo negative goes amiss and he decides to find the photographer, played by Sean Penn. There's shades of Hearts of Darkness here, as Penn is almost akin to the elusive Col. Kurtz with regards to Mitty's quest, and if there are a few broadly comical missteps, perhaps Stiller, as a director, felt occasionally unsure of himself in territory largely new to him. But he needn't have. This is utterly charming, life-affirming cinema that I enjoyed tremendously, especially with Stiller on truly ace form both in front of, and behind the camera.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful story about life,This movie is made for dreamers who yearn for the actual excitement for life. The message behind this movie is strong and will leave you dreaming about a wild adventure.

Feel-Good Call to Adventure for those with Wanderlust,"A sweet feel-good adaptation with a more modern approach to the classic short story. Like the 1947 adaptation, this one also lets Walter Mitty get a taste of a real adventure after several scenes of amusing daydreams. While I'd argue that the 1947 Walter Mitty feels more relatable and personable with his everyday struggles and heavily implied ADHD symptoms, this version feels more cinematic and has a more fulfilling adventure for Walter to encounter. I've heard many people say that this movie inspired them to travel abroad, and I can easily see why. A nice reminder of how amazing and vast the world truly is, and how often we so little of it while we're cooped up in our mundane everyday routines. Ben Stiller is decently likable in the role. He starts off a bit stiff, but he gest better as the story goes along and I thought his scenes with Kristen Wiig and Sean Penn were cute. Patton Oswalt was great as the eager eHarmony spokesman. The Adam Scott character felt kind of cliché, but his role as the face of soulless corporate buyouts with little personal interest in what the company actually stands for or the people working there felt spot on. The daydream sequences were amusing, though not as present as I would've hoped for. The travel scenes in Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas were the best parts of the movie with some excellent landscape shots and all-around solid cinematography. The indie rock soundtrack was cute and added to the feel-good vibe of the film. It's not an amazing adaptation, but it's still very charming and even a little inspiring for those with wanderlust.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Must Watch for any Desk Jockey,"The only real downfall of this movie for me is the product placement that happens occasionally, other than that I absolutely love the way this was shot. Perhaps it's merely just the fact that I see so much of myself in Walter Mitty, as I imagine a lot of professional desk jockey's do. It's just such a fun story and told so beautifully. Ben Stiller isn't always the greatest, but for me, this is his best work.The true hero of this film is the cinematography, granted they have exotic gorgeous locations to work with, but they are executed to near perfection. This movie is just simply inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable but no Big Fish,"When I think of those great adventure films, I think of Life Of Pi and Big Fish. In those films I was not only blown away by the visuals but was emotionally moved to the core in each. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has a good message but never takes me out of just a normal movie going experience and into something special. The trailers were mesmerizing and I thought it may be a movie to compete with Gravity and 12 Years a Slave for best picture. It results in a fun and adventurous ride, but doesn't do much else.Ben Stiller is perfect as the day dreamer who has never done anything that important in life but gets stuck in this case of Sean Oconnel and what he wants the last cover of Life Magazine to be. I have to say the movie takes just a bit too long to actually reach the adventure parts. But I did really like Kristen Wiig, and I can understand why Walter Mitty cant get his mind off of her. But on the other hand, Adam Scott's character is unrealistic. He comes off as a grade school bully, rather than some sort of business world jerk.Even though the point of the movie was to get Walter out in the real world by himself and realize his worth to others, there was a part of me that wished Cheryl would have gone with him. I feel if they would have made this movie more of a complete romance to go along with an adventure, it may have helped hit those emotional highs and lows I was looking for. For Ben Stiller its a good directorial effort and its something to be proud of because the movie looks fantastic. Like I said the visuals are top notch but thats the only aspect of the movie that was an A+.I would recommend waiting until this one is on cable, but make sure your watching the HD version, because it is a true spectacle.+tremendous visuals+Kristen Wiig-not what the trailers promised-would have liked more romance/emotional appeal7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
omg,"This is an unwatchable film sans for the 15 minutes of Iceland vistas. Horrid. At no point in the film did I feel any connection to any character. Kristen Wiig is normally hilarious and should be able to carry a film if there were any lines written for her that were interesting. Wince might have peaked in Zoolander and should definitely have not have tried to add directing to his epitaph. Better writing, better directing and more Iceland would have been the formula for this to have not been a complete failure. Did anyone see the last 15 minutes ?

"An honest film that will make you laugh, possibly cry and maybe even re-evaluate some aspects of life!","Where to begin, well I know I'm late to the party after only just finishing the film months after it being released but there was something about it that has caused me to sign up and type this review for you.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, This film can be described in many different ways, funny, moving, touching, inspiring are just a few words that come to mind which sum the movie up. This may seem like bland information but to truly understand the roller-coaster I went on during this movie makes it very difficult to describe it to you, you would have to watch it yourself. But I will try my hardest to give you the how this film was portrayed in my eyes!Walter is a man who will make you see things differently, he has a unique way of showing what he is thinking and this gives you a great insight to his thoughts and feelings but sadly he doesn't seem to be brave enough to make come true. This makes me sympathise with him. This is where the roller-coaster begins.Walter seems semi content with his life but you can tell he wants more and after a while we get to see him chase after that thing he has been missing in his life when he is forced on an adventure I won't say why, but on this adventure our minds and hearts are played with as we grow closer to the character and the film in general. We start to really see that Behind all of the hilarious jokes, puns and some form of funny stereotypes that this movie really has a proper meaning to it, this meaning was described perfectly in the film when one character is describing what David Bowies song ""space oddity."" Is to her. She not only described the meaning of the song well but that meaning also transferred over to what this film meant to me, that was that it was about courage. Now courage can come in many different forms but to me this filmed told me not to be scared to leave my comfort zone and to do whatever it takes to be happy and Walter Mitty truly did this, he left his shell and went on a journey that will stay with him forever and has lead him to a new, happier life.This movie really made me smile and honestly I think it would make you smile too, although the movie may not appeal to your taste, it will certain grasp you in some form or an other and that's the beauty, it can relate to everyone. I thank everyone who worked on this film, it's a real eye opener to what can be achieved if the true desire and meaning is there!Thanks for reading this, it was my first review.

Nicely done!,"Walter Mitty is a quiet, meek little man who works at Life Magazine as a ""Negative Assets Manager"", the guy that receives all of the pics from the photographers and preps them for print in the magazine. Problem is, the magazine is printing their final issue, and lay-offs are coming. Second problem is, Walter spends half of his time in DEEP DAY-DREAMS, to the point where he completely spaces out and is oblivious to everything - and everyone - around him. Third problem is, the masterpiece photo slated to be the final cover shot has gone missing. He's never going to get to talk to that pretty new co-worker at this rate...Pros:Walter Mitty is a feel-good story at it's core, with plenty of up-and- down moments that move at a pretty good pace. The 2 hour run time moves pretty quickly. - Ben Stiller pays the part well, while still sliding in a bit of his comedy shtick in. It's a nice job.Adam Scott nails the role as the asshole executive. That's pretty much his role in every movie, for a reason.The visuals are beautiful, and they make some clever use of the landscapes to push the story along, like having a text message appear in the side of a mountain as he's reading it from his phone...Cons:I've got an issue with a certain plot hole. I won't spoil it, you can ask me later if you see it, but...come on, Walter...This is more of a beef with the marketing for this movie than anything else...the commercials were calling this ""The Next Forrest Gump"". It's not. And it never had to be. This movie is good on it's own, but it doesn't hold up to Forrest Gump. Ben Stiller isn't in Tom Hank's league, something I'm sure Stiller himself would admit. If you go into this movie trying to make this comparison, it's going to take away from Walter Mitty's own merits.They REALLY overshoot the value of a Stretch Armstrong.Overall, Walter Mitty is a nice, feel-good story that has a good pace to it, and a fitting pay-off for the ending. I don't know if it will live up to the hype and comparisons, but it was a nice time at the movies. 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Hey guys, thanks for checking out my review.

Visually Stunning but Lacks Depth in Storytelling,"While The Secret Life of Walter Mitty offers stunning visuals and a few inspiring moments, I found the story lacking the depth it needed to fully engage.

Despite the breathtaking cinematography and some well-crafted scenes, the characters and storylines felt somewhat underdeveloped.

The parts that are clever or heartwarming come at the expense of being a paint-by-numbers cliché.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Secret Life of Walter MittyThe upside to online magazines is that there will be free tablets with old issues on them at the dentist's office.Alternatively, the downside to this digitization is explored in this comedy-fantasy.With the final issue of LIFE magazine ready to publish, it's up to negative handler Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) to present the last cover photo shot by famed photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn).The only problem is the negative has disappeared.Now it's up to the daydreaming office drone to place the misplaced image before the issue goes to print.To do this, he must travel to Iceland to find O'Connell.While Walter's trajectory from skateboarding punk to milquetoast adult is incongruent, it is this film's sappy ending that gives the James Thurber's short story a bad name.Furthermore, with Life magazine now out of the way, there's less confusion between Life cereal and Life the board game.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should of kept it a secret!,"I am a Big Ben Stiller fan , so was very excited to see this film. I have liked everything he's ever done. Until this! Pretty early on its established that there was confusion on what genre this film should take, comedy, drama or romance. It does them all but very poorly, it struggled to stick to a cohesive plot and finds itself struggling for direction.Stiller is great in his role and I can't fault his acting, the effects were cool and the idea was fun , but by the end I was left thinking it was stupid and frankly pointless. Bridesmaids was a great film but sooner people see Kristen Wiig can't act the better, she's funny as a back up but is so emotionless it's hard to see what the directors see in her.I wanted to stay to the end and I managed it, it's a pointless big budget flop which achieves nothing in 114 minutes. It's neither inspiring or entertaining. Comedy actors should stick to comedy films, Adam Scott who is normally hilarious was awkward, unfunny and had the worst fake beard I'd ever seen. It's clear directors are getting lazier and less imaginative but rely more on over complicating a silly film to make people confused. People need to realise confusing doesn't mean deep or intelligent, it's a film which is flawed!.A poor film, a bad end to 2013 along with walking with dinosaurs! I hope 2014 raises the bar again and puts at least 1 film which will amaze.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best of all time!,"Simply put, this movie should get at least a 9/10 . When I saw the title I didn't know what the movie was as I hadn't read the book, I thought it would be a plain bore. Man was I wrong. This one is my top 5 movies of all time!Anyone who loves travel or who just want to move forward in their lives should watch this. It's about picking up and making a move to unknown but desirable territory.Every single thing about this movie is excellent: the acting, the cinematography, the scene shots, the locations, the plot or storyline, the balance of action and love, the music, the intro and ending, etc.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of Ben Stillers best roles.,"What can I say, Ben Stiller makes one of his best roles on this movie about a man in his middle age who has the ability to dream away from his reality when it might not be the most perfect time for it.The Movie mixes drama with comedy in a very good way and there's a lot of really funny scenes that I laughed my way through.The movie is very nice and it has a lot of beautiful pictures and environments that you wish you would see for yourself in real life and with a message that appeals to me personally and tells me that I have to wake up and do something major in my life.I really liked this movie and it's on the top 10 of my favorite movies from 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A must-see!,"If you expect funny acting from Ben Stiller like usual, you will be disappointed. Here, Ben Stiller is more serious, but very suitable for the role of Walter Mitty. The supporting actors like Kristen Wiig and Adam Scott play their roles well too.The story is very good. Adventure-themed with a little mystery, we would not be bored watching until the end. Awesome scenery also fills this movie, makes it so enjoyable. From the freezing waters of Greenland, volcano in Iceland, and the mountains of Afghanistan. The pace is just right, not too fast, not too draggy. Character developments can be seen, portrayed very well. With good cinematography, very good soundtrack which supports every scene perfectly, this movie is a must-see of 2014.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Spectacular and Inspiring  But Doesn't  Reach It's Potential,"More of an original than a film version of the short story, the Secret Life of Walter Mitty has some great points but in the end does not reach the potential that it started with. Perhaps that is a little ironic because The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is about Walter reaching his potential to find greatness and excitement in his life. At times the story was not engaging enough and had a thrown together feeling, and that may be attributed to Stiller both acting and directing in this one. All the same the film should inspire many to take charge of their lives and do the interesting things they fantasize about. The cinematography captures the epic grandeur of stunning places like Iceland and the Himalayas and should rekindle your sense of adventure. During Walter's travels, you will also see how his journey is not just point A to point B, but also one of personal discovery and finding his true self. We start out seeing him as a meek office worker but by the end you will realize how large his contribution to his family and work have been. And that is a really beautiful thing about this film. It might make you see how much you have given to life, and show you it's possible to do the things you have always dreamed about.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not remade, but well made","The main reason I went to see this film was my love for the first Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I already knew from all the teasers and previews that this was going to be something completely different, but I had to see what happened to Walter in this incarnation. I can say that in my opinion though the mutual literary source is evident, this one is really a completely different movie, with no intention of being a remake. Which is probably the best decision they could've made. Ben Stiller, is no Danny Kaye, and had he tried to be, I can only imagine the catastrophe it would've been. As is, he strike a perfect balance between the real dreary life and almost dreary character into which Walter's life has turned him. And the ragged adventurer hidden inside him. He manages to show the would be ""loser"", the fantastic day dreamer and the ""adernalin junkie"", and show them as one real person never making him heroic or super when the adventure is real, and even managing an ending that wouldn't be a typical Hollywood one, in the best way. The supporting cast is very good, the cinematography is practically superb. The inter-film jokes work nicely, and a sharp barb or two are being sent at the modern success driven internet age and the society we live in - making me all the happier. My actual rating is 8.5, but the stars system won't allow me to grade it thusly so I had to say it here.In a single line - it's a real life fantastic comedy - go see it and you'll understand what I'm speaking about.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed and sad I wasted my Christmas movie passes. Ben, if you're reading this I'm upset. How could you do this to me? And after everything we've been through.

Absolutely worth the watch,"Ben Stiller made the best out of every tool he had for this film. There are multiple times during the film where I dreaded that it would take an easy way out, and it did not, the pace build perfectly, it's cohesive and to top it off the cinematography, the soundtrack and the motivations are spectacular.

Surprisingly in my top 5!,"So ever since the Meet the Parents movies I never thought I would like Ben Stiller again. This movie has changed my mind. It is really hard to pinpoint an exact reason this movie makes my Top 5, but it does. It may be the coming out of your shell fell to this movie or the music placement in the scenes. Every time this movie comes on I find myself watching it. I really wish Stiller would do more movies like this one. The comedy that he does is good at times, but this movie was by far his best to date.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overdone,"Decent movie. Glad I saw it. I especially liked the way it was adapted to modern life, with cell phones and internet playing central roles. Great soundtrack. I loved the ending.But it was still kind of disappointing. It required me to suspend too much disbelief. Some of Walter's adventures were just impossible, especially in the supposed time frame. More importantly, Walter's character transformation just wasn't believable. It came out of nowhere. Maybe it would've been a bit more believable if he had shown us more flashes of adventurousness in the first few minutes.All of that said, I still recommend the movie regardless of whether you read or liked Thurber's original short story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Maybe the one daydreaming scene with the Benjamin Button reference is a bit too weird but on the other hand – that is more the typical Ben Stiller humor.Also to mention is the soundtrack with fantastic songs from Jose Gonzales. The music fits the many great nature scenes from Greenland, Island and Afghanistan and makes the movie a pleasure to watch on the big screen.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a strong comedy drama that at the end of the day gives out a really enjoyable movie that is well paced, shot and acted.Directing is good, I loved some of the creative touches and moments. Like the intro and the mid movie montage. Some of that type of creative editing van feel cheesy in other movies, but it fit very well into the context of the movie here. Besides that we have just solid directing.Story is fantastic. But I couldn't help shake the desire to have this be a much more dramatic and emotionally gutting movie. I get that they went for a lighter tone, especially with some jokes and characters that work most, but not all the time. And it now is just a good family movie. But there's potential here that could just given it that extra edge of a emotional gut punch. Imagine if they really honed in on that loneliness, and that desire to be loved and seen but only being able to in his daydreams. To break out of that, and turn around. There's a real deeply emotional movie here laying beneath this family comedy drama. Wished they lingered in the finale a bit longer as well. As I still found it really touching.Music is good though not too notable, the songs were used fittingly. Acting was good all round the board. Ben Stiller does great, he transitions well from a silly comedy actor to a serious one. Adam Scott was a also really great loved his role. Jokes and comedy work most of the time for me, but some felt a little too out of whack.Also a really annoying nitpick the the scene where he trades the doll for a longboard, seriously what? If it was a attempt at comedy it missed me but otherwise that scene really pulled me out. Cause the movie does try to ground itself as much as it can.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
pretty good,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was really excited. It looked like an modernized terry Gilliam movie with spectacular visuals and imagination. And on that front the movie succeeded. Every shot in this movie is just gorgeous, Ben stiller's directing really gave this movie an almost dreamlike feel.But sadly this movie also contains flaws (in my opinion).First of all, although all the shots and dream-sequences look spectacular, they don't always fit as well in the story, some scenes seems to be just there as an excuse to go crazy, which is fine, but they feel kinda unnecessary as they don't really add much to the story or characters, I mean Okay we know Walter really, really likes the girl, you don't need 5 dream-scenes to establish that.secondly Adam Scott's beard is hilariously badand lastly, it can get kinda cliché at times.I know it seems like I'm bashing this movie as there are more cons than pros. But I liked this movie, I just feel kinda divided, because it looks beautiful, there where some funny moments, but it just feels like the movie is trying to be deeper or more meaningful than it is.So yeah Walter Mitty 7/10It's a fun, gorgeous movie, just don't take it too seriously, and if you do, nothing wrong with that, I agree with the message the movie's portraying, just feel its kinda too simple for something as complex as life.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well thank goodness for Great Movie Experiences!,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Walter Mitty. Ben Stiller hit it out of the ballpark with this one. His acting style and expressions were perfect for the odd Mitty character. The comedic timing was very good and caught me off-guard most of the time...you know when you don't expect to laugh and then something so cute or funny causes you to crack up. Out loud. I was not too familiar with Kristen Wiig but her portrayal of Cheryl was spot on. She is interesting to look at and her demeanor really fit with Walter's. I enjoyed watching them interact. Shirley McLaine playing the mom was good, too. Actually I like Ms. McClaine's performances much better as a older woman than I did in her early movies. The CG stuff was not overdone and I did not see too many ""oops"" moments in this movie. You know the scenes where you can tell it was CG'd. I cannot end without giving kudos to Sean Penn. Another perfect casting choice as he played his character to a tee and was very believable. His ruddy, rough looks fit well with his character's profession.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbearably childish and uninspiring,"I tried on two separate occasions to digest this film and I just couldn't waste another second. I got my only laugh with the elevator fight scene but then it just became silly.I can't imagine why some people call this ""art"" but then again it is a subjective term. Ben Stiller's character is about as dry as week old dog poo and the plot is unoriginal. He plays a hopeless schmuck who constantly escapes reality with his so called ""imagination"" that apparently never matured past age 7 as he tries to pick up on a woman co-worker. It has been awhile since I have been so repulsed and uninspired by a movie with a supposedly reputable cast that I shut it off thirty minutes in. You are better off watching a Mexican soap opera.

"Ben Stiller, You Deserve An Oscar.","I don't know where to begin with this movie. The whole movie was masterfully directed, the acting was incredible, and the story awe- inspiring. Usually, I don't like to see ""feel-good"" movies because I think they are cheesy, (ahem Internship). But this did not give me any of that feeling. I enjoyed every second of it. Every shot was beautiful. No matter where Walter went, I felt like I was there. His daydreaming was very well done, and at times hilarious. The acting was superb, except for Adam Scott. He felt flaky and unreal, hence the 9 instead of 10. Other than that, amazing acting all around. The soundtrack was beautiful, and I loved every song that played. It fit perfectly with the mood of this movie. Finally, Ben Stiller was an amazing director. I can honestly say, without a doubt, that this is some of the best directing I have seen in years. He honestly deserves an Oscar, or at least a nomination. He handles the drama and story of this movie perfectly, at is a great non-comedy directorial debut.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"likable, predictable","like a date all hopped up on schnapps, you know yer gonna get some, its just a matter of time.As entertainment, i like it. It was a fun, energetic movie that kept you wondering if the adventure was real.As a movie it lacked depth, believable characters, believable story, and under developed characters. you never felt like you were growing with Walt. In fact, I never felt like Walt grew as a character. He regressed back to his teenage self. And perhaps that is my disconnect.the one moment that you were hoping for, Walt telling off his boss, never really hit home as one might expect. Instead it was the exact thing his boss needed to hear.as a final moment of valor, it was WEAK! But the final shot, negative #25, very predictable, but satisfying.

Enjoyable,"This movie, about Walter who takes action by embarking on an adventure more extraordinary than anything he ever imagined, is a good comedy movie!The storyline is very slow and I think the movie struggles with its pacing because I thought several times that it was going to end - not that I wanted it to end, but I was automatically expecting it because of mood of the scenes. Anyway, it has a stunning cinematography and surprisingly ambitious effects. The inner story and some other elements are cliché and simple, but valuable, and even though the movie is slow, I still had a good time following the protagonist, Walter Mitty.While the pacing may be leisurely, this movie captivates with its visually stunning adventure and heartfelt message of embracing life's possibilities.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The scenes towards the end became excruciating to the point of embarrassing.Some little surprises near the start which suggest the film might have some originality to it but it is all down hill from there!

A fun filled movie with lots of heart.,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the story of Walter Mitty(Ben Stiller), who is a daydreamer. Mitty has these surreal daydreams where he does many heroic things & gets together with his office colleague, Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig), who he has a major crush on. When his job & the job of his colleagues is threatened, Walter Mitty goes on the adventure of a lifetime, where everything he dreams about comes true.Ben Stiller shines in his directorial debut. One of the highlights of the film are the locations. Be it Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas, or even America, all the locales have been captured beautifully. The special effects are mind blowing. Ben Stiller is brilliant as Walter Mitty. Stiller makes his character adorable & hilarious at the same time. The scenes in which Mitty 'zones out' are some of the funniest scenes in the film. However, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is not just a comedy. It is also an emotional journey of a man who starts out as just a dreamer but, overcomes his fears & actually does something. Kristen Wiig is spectacular as Cheryl Melhoff. Adam Scott is hilarious as Walter's mean boss, Ted Hendricks. Kathryn Hahn is great as Walter's sister, Odessa Mitty. Shirley MacLaine is amazing as Walter's mother, Edna Mitty. Sean Penn is outstanding in his cameo as Walter's inspiration, Sean O'Connell. I would like to conclude by saying, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a must watch, for the dreamer in all of us.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just my self-inspiring story,"Watching the secret life of Walter Mitty remind me a little bit about myself, a day-dreamer. But not as terrible as Walter Mitty, I still can realize something happen in my daily life - I'm not a guy that imagine the refrigerator-man as a husband of my crush in a sudden, hahaha. Okay! what was attracting me about this movie is, off course the cinematography. The camera work, angle and visual are some reasons that helped this film to keep breathing scene by scene. I really love movies that capturing a beautifully of the cinematography because film is an art, it can't be presented just like that, at least the movie was done, or it has a plot and it's enough. Yes, the main point of a nice movie is the story line, but a good camera and visual skill will also make a movie is going a step further.Then, the story itself. The Walter Mitty personality made me wanted to know, how this low confident-guy and a dreamer wants to change and get out from his comfort zone. Plus, he likes a single- mom and tries to grab her heart. In this story, he needs to find the lost negative-25 that given by photographer, ' '. How he forces himself to travel outside USA to find the negative-25 and he needs to overcome his dream and imagination by start living in reality. This movie inspired me a little bit for becoming brave to take risk in this life and stop dreaming too much. Achievement in real life by your own struggle and confident are the best thing you get than dreaming. Dreaming may reduce your frustration, but it won't help you to rise. Oh wait! the music score that follow with the scenes of ""Mr. Mitty's Running"" also has an impact of the movie.After I watched this movie, I didn't feel the comedy after all because before I'm gonna watch it, I thought there would be a usual comedy because I saw Ben Stiller. But what I really felt was the story is very close to me. There are somethings good and lesson in this film. Yes, that story is all about, the origin is to give lesson to the human.

I'm always hoping for a movie to be more realistic, but that obviously is not the style of directing Ben Stiller usually jives with. In its defense, the film is definitely not supposed to be taken too seriously.It has a satisfying ending that ties everything together and really rewarded me for sticking around until the end. (Not gonna lie, I almost switched off the movie during the early scene with the shark)This movie is rare in the fact that it becomes more enjoyable the longer you watch.

Ponderous and stunningly pretty,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an interesting prospect. At times it's a very pretty film, as Greenland, Iceland and the Himalayas are some of the most beautiful locations on earth. One could argue that the plot does a good job of merely framing these gorgeous shots.To me this film doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a metaphor for one man's mindset, or is it a literal tale of an everyman's adventure. For me it falls somewhere in the middle and thus isn't really successful at either. It isn't really funny enough or exciting enough to be the latter, nor is it intriguing enough to fit into the former category.I felt at times that the film is trying to drift into the metaphysical, but if it is, then it's so subtle it's almost lost. All this didn't sit that well on my palate. If you take the plot at face value, then it's merely an adventure story of a man finding himself and learning things along the way. All in all, it's alright.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most insightful PG movie since 2001: A Space Odyssey,"OK, film buffs can call me out on this one... ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was actually rated G. But you get what I mean. Sometime after the late 90s, G and PG (and even many PG13) movies became synonymous with Disney kid stuff, while if you wanted some depth and ""adult"" fodder it generally came with a lot of disturbing, angsty, profane and graphically violent/sexual stuff. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a great throwback to films geared at adults, provoking deep thought, while remaining firmly family-friendly.I'm not sure why that's so significant I had to open my review with it, but maybe you'll get the gist. This is a film that tells a simple story without flashy, gritty plot sensations, and yet it doesn't treat you like you're an idiot for watching a PG movie. And although I'm something of a cynical old geezer, I'm sure kids can enjoy it and find just as much meaning as I did.Walter Mitty is a dork. Not quite a loser because he has a good job and is quite capable, but, well, the opening scene of him struggling for 5 minutes to click a ""wink"" button on a dating site ought to tell you he's not exactly captain of the football team.From there we learn that he has an odd habit of zoning out in his own fantasy world because obviously his real life bores him (and everyone around him) to tears. But that doesn't last long. Suddenly a bizarre mystery appears, and as you may have guessed from the trailers and movie posters, the film involves dorky Walter (Ben Stiller) trekking across continents and doing battle with all sorts of disasters as well as drunk Icelandic pilots.There's also a mild romance brewing (so he wishes) between himself and his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), but this is not a formulaic romcom. It's really about trying to get the most out of life. And whether you're a middle aged career schmoe like Walter, or I dunno, a punk rocker or a soccer mom, the message will appeal to you because it's about finding adventure everywhere it exists.The humor keeps things rolling nicely, but don't expect anything zany like Ben Stiller's earlier ""The Cable Guy"" and ""Zoolander"" or really any of his films. This movie is basically a serious tale, complete with nice artistic touches and GORGEOUS cinematography, peppered with Stiller's quirky tongue-in-cheek humor the whole way.I have to add a word about the music. Oh the soundtrack kills. If you are versed in the 80s classics like Hall & Oates ""Maneater"", Rupert Holmes ""The Pina Colada Song"", and a great appearance of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" you will love the tunes. There's also a modern classic or two, such as Of Monsters and Men ""Dirty Paws"". Something for everyone.I was really impressed with Ben Stiller's directoral maturity and the way he kept things fresh and breezy despite this being a serious soul-searcher. In that respect I was reminded of one of my favorite directors Wim Wenders (his later films such as ""Million Dollar Hotel"" and ""Lisbon Story""). There's also, as I mentioned, a quirky tongue-in-cheek attitude throughout, reminding me of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch Drunk Love"".""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is well worth the price of admission.

Different,"This film is one that gets better with age, the more I watch it the more I can appreciate the story board. The synopsis and the message behind the movie.

A must watch movie of the decade.,"I wrote this review after watching the movie on board the plane and then watched it a few times on Blu-ray. 
Walter Mitty is a methodical, middle aged man who leads systematic and quiet life as a negative assets manager for Life Magazine in New York which publishes beautiful photography of life events over many decades. His life, at first glance, appears to be well planned and almost down to a routine. But early on in the movie you get to see glimpses of his secret life where he disappears into an action-packed adventure world of fantasy. But they remain just that - fantasies, until something happens on another day of boring routine. 
It starts off as a simple missing photograph film negative; in the movie, this is referred to as ""Negative 25"". Mitty had never lost a negative in his long years of experience. Understandably, when this particular negative goes missing and when retrieving that becomes absolutely important for him to retain his job, the movie takes on a different tone. Mitty ends up chasing an adventurer-photographer by the name of Sean through various parts of the world, in the process, experiencing life to the fullest. 
The movie takes you deep into the absolute devotion Mitty has shown towards his mother, sister, his job and even his assistant at work. You could almost feel the heavy burden of responsibility throughout the movie and how miserable he feels with the fear of letting these people down. There is some flashback to his childhood when he was landed into this responsibility after the unfortunate demise of his father and how this stopped him from experiencing any adventure for himself.
There are some very powerful scenes in the movie. Mitty goes up to this cliff somewhere in Iceland and looks over this enormous landscape from where he has to somehow go down to pursue the adventurer Sean. You could tell from his facial expression - this is such an enormous task that he has ever faced in his life. For a moment you think - is he going to give up? And then you see that look of determination on his face - he deploys all that he has learnt and innovates his way out of the problem, claiming his credentials as an adventurer himself. 
In another scene in the movie where he is in the back of a New York taxi, after failing to retrieve the missing Negative 25. The scene only lasts for around 10 to 20 seconds and there is no dialogue. But Ben Stiller does such an incredible performance that almost take your breath away. His look says it all -expressing a mix of disappointment, self-defeat and the misery of failing those who trusted him. 
In that sense, the movie very much plays into your moral compass. Clearly, one would at least sometimes sacrifices one's own desires and dreams. But how far does one take these sacrifices and for how long? Would those people that care about you not understand that you may have your own dreams? Ultimately though, one may end up sacrificing a bit too much and may be the things you had attributed so much of importance in life don't mean that much after all. Perhaps at some point we need to let go. In the movie, it is a piano, of sentimental value to his mother. They end up having to sell this eventually, but his mother is quite happy to accept it is time to give it up. 
The philosophical tones in this film are enjoyable and I guess each person will reminisce in their own way, even after finishing the movie. To me, the most powerful message from this film was that you don't always have to win - sometimes, losing is the best form of winning. Life has a funny way of placing that seemingly small hurdle that allows you to review and challenge your own routine existence. Whether you rise to the challenge, or simply dream on, is the question!
Overall, this movie is such a gem and the last thing I was expecting was the incredible acting and direction from Ben Stiller (whom I hadn't really liked before as a comedy actor). Steven Conrad's story is fantastically full of subtle twists, the dialogues are just right. Add the beautiful photography and an excellent musical score - you have a movie you can easily watch over and over and get a a warm glow! Enjoy...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not great, but pleasant, light, and will leave you feeling a little inspired","I must admit I was hoping for a bit more from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The trailers made it out to be one of those potentially life-changing drama/comedies that can leave you on a real high when they hit the mark (I'm thinking Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Good Will Hunting, Up in the Air etc.).TSLOWM comes close, but doesn't quite make it. It's more like, let's say, The Truman Show or Miss Pettigrew lives for a day, in that it's a perfectly good way to kill two hours but it might also frustrate you because it could have been much better with just a little tweaking. Mitty's character arc, from daydreamer to life-liver isn't as clever or as subtle as it could have been. His moments of realization aren't quite as high on the emotional scale as they should be. Also the romance between Stiller and Wiig could have been a lot more exciting, it seemed as if they were always going to get together without question - there was very little anticipation or sexual tension involved.Gripes aside, it's a beautiful looking movie, full of scenic landscapes and nice transitions. And it's got a good heart and a sensible core message, so unless you're a pessimist of the highest order it should at least leave you feeling a little happier and more inspired than before you watched it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why the public goes to movies,"I'll keep this short. This could have been a really cool movie which represented LIFE magazine in the right light. Instead, Ben Stiller starred in a commercial for EHarmony, Papa Johns, Cinnabun, and GreenLand's Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The movies used to be the one place where the public could avoid commercials and gorilla marketing. Now my greatest fear has arrived, I can't go anywhere without being marketed to. Thanks Stiller. Only Hollywood would figure out how to make money before anyone even buys a ticket......Now I'm writing to get to 10 lines so my post will be posted. What happen to the Dog Day Afternoons, True Romance with that scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken in the trailer....they didn't talk about how good a big mac was at Burger King (You'll get that joke near the end of this movie).

HK Auteur film review - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"Typically I am not a fan of Ben Stiller's comedy, whenever he dons a wig and plays a crazy character, it is one-note and awkward. Stiller fares best when he is a normal person reacting to an awkward situation as opposed to being the source of awkwardness and the nebbish Walter Mitty character certainly plays to those strengths. Stiller's other brand of 'costume play' comedy in the fantasy sequences is fortunately reduced to a minimal. Here he is at his most naturally charming and Zoolander fans may disagree, but this is now officially my favorite thing Ben Stiller has directed and acted in.Kristin Wiig is also naturally charming as Mitty's love interest and gets to shine in a musical sequence where she does a cover of David Bowie's Major Tom. Sean Penn has a funny supporting role as artsy photographer Sean O'Connell. Penn's trademark intensity is smartly sourced for laughs in a self-deprecating fashion similar to when Chris Rock quipped at Penn's humorless comeback over Jude Law at the Oscars.The production design is impressive, with its visual compositions practically lifted from hardcover graphic design books and nifty editing transitions accompanied with cool looking fonts, which to some extent owes itself to Stranger Than Fiction. Stuart Dryburgh's photography delivers a true sense of awe for New York's urban cityscape and Greenland's natural landscapes. The story reason is to make Walter Mitty look like an ant in a big world, but that overwhelming sense of the environment towering over man seeps over onto the audience.The reality of the film's own world is suspect, like the logistics of how an employee is able to leave work and fly off to a foreign country, or how much of a jerk the new corporate supervisor played by Adam Scott is being. None of this matters because the story is a fable after all. The viewer may feel in moments they need to give the story the benefit of the doubt. If that moment should occur, go along with it. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is imaginative and humorously made, and even in its weaker illogical moments is ultimately compensated by its charm. The lesson of someone who realizes he is missing out on life from daydreaming is just darn compelling, and it is emotionally cathartic watching Mitty wake up.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Movie with memorable scenes,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" Is a 2013 movie that goes for 114 minutes. Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by Ben Stiller. He has directed a lot of comedy movies so some people didn't think he could pull of a non-comedy movie but he did a great job with it. It does has comedy bits in it but for the most part it is a more serious movie than comedy. So the genre is Adventure, Comedy and Drama. This movie stars Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, Kristen Wiig as his love interest Cheryl and Adam Scott as the boss. The story is about this guy named Walter Mitty that has this condition to constantly zone out and imagine himself in these different and weird scenarios and this is one of the main technique for the story telling for at least half of the film. Walter Mitty has a boring life in New York, having an average job, lonely in his apartment and doing the same thing over and over again without real change. This this is one of the reason why he zones out and imagines himself in these situations. He went to work and found out that they are cutting people off because the magazine company that he is working for is going to be an online magazine and Walter has been sent images by this photographer named Sean O'Connell and one of his images is going to be on the front of the final magazine but Walter can't find it so he sets off to a journey to find Sean to these beautiful and various locations and to ask him where the missing photo is. The actors in this movie is well casted and there weren't any bad actors nor the characters they played except for the eHarmony subplot that they put in, so Walter Mitty had some trouble sending ""Winks"" on the website and called one of the workers at eHarmony to help him with this situation but this guy keeps calling him throughout the movie and it gets annoying and a bit unrealistic. The camera work and the editing in this film was very well done, there was a scene where he was running to catch a ride in a helicopter. This action sequence was in the slow-motion with David Bowie's Space Oddity playing in the back ground. This made the scene very impactful and getting the viewers to know that he is on his first step on his adventure. He travels to Greenland, Iceland, Yemen and Afghanistan and all these locations give this film a lot of life, especially with the camera shots and the music along with it makes it feel like an adventure. The viewer feels like you are inside his head and seeing life through is eyes and makes the film has a very unique style of storytelling. As a viewer you start to realize that Walter zones out a lot less since he has done so many amazing things and seeing beautiful sights, and as viewer you realize that he is making his imagination a reality and this is pretty impactful by the end of the film. So in conclusion this a very solid film with very well done story-telling and having hidden messages having you to figure out some of the elements by yourself. There is some characters with unrealistic characteristics and personality's but the rest of the characters are pretty solid and well written. The theme of the movie is very well structured and shows you what an adventure can be like, feel like and look like. I give this movie 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Don't  dream, it's over.","I loved the original Golden Age Mitty movie starring Danny Kaye, but really apart from retaining the title and being about a guy who daydreams a lot, this Ben Stiller directed and starring vehicle has nothing to do with it. That said, Stiller for me has the right degree of little-boy-lost meets downtrodden-little-guy pathos to just about make it work as a very convoluted plot unfolds. This Walter is a long-serving back-room, basement-floor worker at ""Life"" magazine charged with processing photographs for publication and in particular those of the magazine's legendary yet elusive star photographer Sean O'Connell. Even though the magazine is closing down its print version to go on-line making most of the staff redundant, its dropped-in nerdy transition boss, played by Adam Scott wants to end up on a high with a big splashy cover and when O'Connell sends in a special picture (it's not that great actually), the decision is made to hold the front page for this one shot. Only thing is, Walter and his long-time co-worker can't find the darn thing which sets our hero on an impulsive quest to track down O'Connell incidentally taking him to Greenland, Iceland and eventually the Himalayas where at last he catches up with the enigmatic snapper.Along the way, we also meet his dotty sister and widowed mother as they help the latter move home where much is made of her late husband's piano and also watch as his budding romance with single parent Kristen Wiig blossoms as he daydreams her into his life. Personally I could have done without the forced, clichéd humour over his family particularly as Shirley MacLaine plays her part more like his grandmother but Wiig is very watchable as the winsome object of his affection with a love for early David Bowie, references to whose ""Space Oddity"" hit become something of a running gag in the film.Forgetting about the over-thin and too-fantastic plot, it's hard not to be impressed by the flashy dream-sequences, especially the very first one where Walter executes a flying leap Jason Bourne would be proud of to save his fellow workers from their building on fire. The problem is though that the dreams are too big. Nobody has C-Gen dreams like this and they seem too much like excuses to insert eye-catching SFX sequences. There were subtler, better directorial touches though, like when a flock of birds forms Wiig's face and a subliminal message from his work-mate appears on a hillside but other ideas like Walter's skateboard trip around Iceland and especially a weirdly unfunny reference to ""Benjamin Button"" seem over-contrived. That said, the cinematography of the Greenlandic and Icelandic locations is very well done with lots of panoramic eye-catching shots.Like I said, I liked Stiller and Wiig in their parts while Walter's interaction with bearded weirdy Scott is also good for some laughs but the celebrity cameos of MacLaine and Sean Penn as O'Connell didn't add anything to the film, for me.On the whole I found the movie patchy and a bit too slight and kooky to really hang together, likewise the mix and match soundtrack of 60's, 80's and contemporary music in the background. It would have been nice if someone had thought to reference the original movie even once by way of tribute and what happened to the phonetic links into Walter's dreams which in the original made you at least know exactly when our hero was actually dreaming. As it is, I'll stick with Kaye's Mitty over this slightly hit and miss remake.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the Best Movies to watch over and over again,"This movie was such a lovely surprise. An true indie-art-house movie with great acting from Ben Stiller, Kristen Wig and others. The visuals are stunning and is to be enjoyed on the large screen format. I loved this movie and continue to watch it whenever it replays on TV. The cinematography capturing Iceland (Greenland) or Yemen (Afghanistan) and subtle references is stunning, unique and captivating. Ben Stiller portrays the role of a nerdy dreamer with a rich inner reality so well that it is quite inspiring. The movie has so many inspirational lessons to borrow from. The journey with Walter Mitty as he finds his inner hero and enlivens himself again is beautiful. His imagination is vivid and rich and is captured so well in this wonderfully filmed movie. I don't know why the critics panned this movie. It is definitely must watch. There are a few flubs and commercialized plugs (juxtapositions and paradoxes) superimposed on a pure background. The story is beautiful, simple and really leaves a deep impression much after you've seen it.please ignore the negative reviews and critics ratings- take a look for yourself.

Didn't live up to its potential.,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. It had all of the pieces in place to be one of those great movies that combine a certain innocent charm with insight and introspection to deliver a heartfelt and emotional movie that anyone can relate to. However, instead of putting that all together in a fashion that feels genuine, like The Truman Show for example, it just feels like it's missing something. Ben Stiller is great and Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine, and Patton Oswalt (among others) do a great job in their supporting roles, albeit far shorter than they should've been. I think the big problem was Adam Scott's character. People like that are so seldom they almost don't even exist and this movie hinging on his ""bullying"" made it tough to relate to. I don't mind that the pace was slow either. I expected that. I didn't expect for the film to build to a moment of revelation only to end abruptly and without much to hang your hat on, so to speak.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There is heart and raw emotion to this film that is unique and steady throughout. The visuals are stunning and Ben Stiller is earnest in his plight for purpose.Unfortunately, the plot itself bounces around quite a bit, the timeline is difficult to follow (how long he was travelling to Iceland and Afghanistan and how he made the final TIME deadline) and I felt that Kristen Wiig's acting fell short. While I do not love the movie, there are moments that completely blew me away: the TIME motto scene, the longboarding sequence in Iceland and the final cover were beautiful.

"Despite a wonderful heart and the best intentions, Ben Stiller's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" adaptation can't quite elevate itself beyond ""pretty good.""","There's something to be said for the directorial efforts of Ben Stiller. He is a very capable visual storyteller, who is able to explore different tones, styles and genres with style and competence. Even though there have been hiccups here and there (""The Cable Guy"" garnering mixed ""love- it-or-hate-it"" response, for example), he's got great talent behind the camera, in addition to his obvious talent in front of the camera.So I went into his adaptation of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" fairly open, with the expectations of seeing a potentially great film. Was it great? Well, no, unfortunately. But was it good? Yes, most certainly it was.Stiller directs this feature, and stars as the titular Walter Mitty, a socially awkward man working for Life magazine who feels his life is of no note or consequence. He spends his time daydreaming while ""zoning out"", having grand fantasies about all of the things he wishes he could do- be a suave foreign lover, be a romanticized hero like those from the movies, save lives, etc... He constantly dreams up wonderful situations that he wishes he could live out. He is also quite smitten with a co-worker named Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), though he hasn't worked up the courage to ask her out yet.After discovering that the magazine is being shut down to go exclusively online (which will cause many workers to lose their jobs), and realizing that he apparently never received the film negative for the intended cover-image of the last issue, Walter is forced to overcome his demons. He finally breaks his silence and befriends Cheryl, and then proceeds to go on a true adventure of his own, just like the ones he imagined, as he tries to track down the photographer who took the photo he cannot find, and figure out where it went.The cast here is wonderful. Stiller is absolutely perfect for the Walter Mitty character, and he does a great job showing not only the various sides of the Mitty character, but his personal growth throughout the film. Wiig is absolutely charming as Cheryl, and gives the role an absolutely immense likability, even though it isn't very well developed beyond a basic ""love interest."" Supporting roles by the likes of Shirley MacLaine, Sean Penn, Patton Oswalt, Adam Scott and Adrian Martinez are similarly very well played. I particularly enjoyed the roles of Oswalt and Martinez. Oswalt plays an eHarmony customer service representative working with Walter to make his online dating profile more palatable, and he is a lot of fun to watch. And he almost becomes a sort-of makeshift ""map"" for the audience, as their continued phonecalls show how much Walter is growing as a character. And Martinez, despite having one of the smaller roles in the film, is a bit of a blast as Walter's understudy. Martinez has been getting more and more roles lately, and I'm quite glad. He's a very talented actor and it's nice to see him getting more recognition.The production is also fantastic for the most part. Stiller's direction is completely captivating and very, very cool. This is problem his most well put-together film from the standpoint of visual storytelling. The cinematography is just plain gorgeous. It was some of the best image- work I've seen in a film in the last few years. The visual effects are spellbinding and really bring to life the situation. Especially Walter's fantasy sequences. And the musical score, costume design and set design are top-notch. Really just a phenomenal film production- wise.That praise all being said, this film does have some serious flaws that hold it back. And it's quite sad, because this film has so much going for it, that it could have been flawless with just a little bit more work.I think the biggest problems here are some issues I have with the script, some very weird hit-and-miss jokes, and a few scenes that try too hard to have a ""quirky"" and ""indie"" sensibility that backfires.The script by Steve Conrad is very tight and well-paced, but I don't think it's clear enough, or focused enough, and there are many moments that feel contrived and confusing as a result. The handling of the material left me confused for a while, and was probably my biggest issue with the script. Especially when Walter leaves to go on his own real- life journey. I spent 20 minutes unsure if I was watching something ""real"" or just another of Walter's day-dreams. (It didn't help that his daydreams were constantly leaking in, thus making it more confusing to figure out what was happening.) I also felt that many characters were under-developed, including Wiig's love interest, which made them seem somewhat flat.Some of the jokes also rubbed me the wrong way. I can't say exactly why, but sequences like the eerie ""Benjamin Button"" reference joke felt dated, contrived and just too ""out-there"" even for this film. And I do think that the film had a slight issue with trying to be too ""quirky"" and ""indie"" in nature during some scenes. It's become popular lately to emulate the cliché ""indie-style"", and it almost always feels inorganic and forced.But those issues being said, I still think ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a fundamentally solid film. It just sadly is never able to quite elevate itself beyond the level of ""pretty good"", even though it clearly aspires to be something great and something special.I give it a 7 out of 10. It's well-worth checking out. Just don't expect a cinematic revelation... merely expect a pleasant little film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beautiful scenes but a somewhat incredible story,"I still remember the version of 1947 of this story with Danny Kaye and it is much funnier than this one. This is the story of an ordinary man who has got an ordinary job but who is a daydreamer engaging himself in extraordinary and sometimes terrible imaginary adventures in which he is a great hero. However for a certain moment on he's got a problem at work which forces him to engage in extraordinary unbelievable adventures in the real world which take him to such places as Greenland, Iceland and the Hymalaias in a short time so short that makes it also unbelievable as real. It could be accepted if it was object of his usual daydreaming. This is the weakest part of the movie.

How to make an Impression,"I was a little apprehensive going to see Walter Mitty. I'd read reviews and didn't expect anything too exciting.Whilst it may not be the most exciting film, it really did make an impression. Underneath and all skits and jokes, the recurring theme of getting out there and living is constant. First of all, as most people have said, the visuals of this film are breathtaking and the people behind the cameras deserve a lot of credit. The soundtrack is also a big plus, really fitting each scene as it carries on.I've never been a great fan of comedy actors trying to be a little more serious but Ben Stiller did a great job here, using jokes wisely and appropriately, rather than a constant barrage of laughter.But the best message I got was that, after seeing this film, I need to be a little more exciting. You will see something in yourself that resembles a piece of Walter Mitty and that's what I liked most about this film. Everyone needs to live a little more, no matter who you are.If you've read the critics reviews, don't read any more. Go and enjoy a really good film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It can be a little much at times, but it still mostly works","I do really like what this is going for, but I think it lays it on a little thick, and can feel overbearing at times. It's got charm and some nice/funny moments.It looks a little over-saturated, but otherwise looks betters than the average comedy, and it's nice when a decent sized budget goes towards a non-action/non-superhero movie, because it's rarer to see from the early 2010s onwards.And overall, I should say I do like a good heartwarming crowd pleaser when it's done well, but this just felt like it was straining to be that movie at times.That still doesn't mean it's rotten at its core, or that it has a bad heart- I just thought the sound of it beating could be distractingly loud at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
See this movie. Bring a date. Bring your kids.,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is triumphant, captivating, affirming, quirky, and original. With this film, Ben Stiller proves himself to be a director of vision and depth. Writer Steve Conrad also deserves accolades for his imaginative and uplifting screenplay. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) reassures us that there is beauty within us all; that we have a magnificent world to explore; that there are many kind and compassionate humans to cross paths with; and that it IS possible to reclaim our dreams. The ""Space Oddity"" (""Major Tom"") scene with Kristen Wiig is sheer perfection, one of my favorite cinematic moments of all time.This isn't to say that the movie is without flaws. Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the film takes a couple of ""cute"" risks that don't quite pan out. The whole eHarmony guy thing could have been done SO much better, and the great Shirley MacLaine is pretty much wasted here. That seems like a lot of flaws, but this movie's weaknesses are so far outshone by its strengths that the faults don't matter. As Walter might say, it is easy to suspend disbelief.See this movie.

Instead he created an eHarmony profile to perhaps hook up with her that way.The magazine was in the process of shuttering their print magazines and they wanted the last magazine cover to be iconic. Their most celebrated photographer, Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) submitted his final set of negatives to be developed, except negative number 25, the quintessence of Life, was missing. With the urging of Walter's crush, he set out on a journey to find Sean and negative number 25.TSLoWM has a familiar theme. It's about experiencing life. Walter hadn't experienced much of anything as was exposed when he was trying to put together his eHarmony profile with eHarmony rep, Todd Maher (Patton Oswalt). It's not a movie that will wow you, bring you to tears, or melt your heart. It's a safe and decent movie that can be enjoyed with virtually anyone.$3.99 on Amazon Prime.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stiller at his very best!!,"Saw this at a preview last night and absolutely loved it! Ben Stiller does an amazing job here as both director and star, some very touching moments and some very funny moments! Kristen Wiig delivers a fantastic subdued performance as Cheryl much unlike any character she has portrayed before. Patton Oswalt is hilarious as an eHarmony assistant who helps Walter along his adventure. The cinematography in this movie is inspiring and if it is not nominated for an Academy Award then i will be very surprised. I also expect nominations in Best Picture Comedy/Musical at the Golden Globes and even an outside chance for best picture at the Oscars. So if you get a chance to see this movie please do, It is a must see over the holiday season!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doer Vs Dreamer,"A daydreaming magazine staffer realizes he hasn't accomplished anything noteworthy. He follows her workplace crush's advise and embarks on an exciting journey one day. He battles sharks, avoids volcanic eruptions, and scales Mount Everest. He eventually understands that the actual meaning of life is to be brave and take risks. This film has a emotional and happy conclusion. Ben Stiller's performance, as usual, is stellar.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie that will stay with you awhile.,"When I first saw the trailer for this a few months back, I was absolutely mesmerized and couldn't wait to see this film. Now that I just watched the movie, I can honestly say it met every expectation I had for it. Ben Stiller does a remarkable job directing this movie and portrays Mitty, the way he should be played. Stiller brings humor and subtlety to this role, and I don't think any other actor could have played Walter Mitty. This is definitely a feel good movie, about taking chances and making the most of ""LIFE."" Stiller captures all the elements of a great film. There was never a dull moment in my opinion. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and beautiful, along with the special effects, that add not only awesome daydream scenes, but witty humor, that Stiller does so well. To go along with all of that, the soundtrack fits perfectly with all of the scenes. The breathtaking scenery, along with the perfectly placed humor makes this film exciting. Stiller did a fine job in not overdoing this. He takes us on some adventure. Go see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: It will change your perspective on life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Travel film,"I actually wanted to see a comedy, since Ben Stiller was in it, but it turned out to be a drama. Nonetheless I'm not at all disappointed, I very much liked the content, full of unexpected turns and beautiful, surprising images of icy, remote places - who could've thought that, when starting to watch the film. The funny bits are there too, to be correct. The plot, camera-work and acting all make it a very watchable piece. Ben Stiller plays a guy, many can relate to or have the same experience. However, his story has a happy ending. Some places stretch the imagination, but this is not really a problem, since a large share movies do that, most from start to finish, but in this case the first part was really credible, detailing the main characters' issues. The latter is done with humor - always a good way to solve all problems one can have.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Secret Life of What A Pity,"Don't believe the hype! My wife and I were really looking forward to watching this movie. Granted we are not big Ben Stiller fans but this looked promising, especially as we like deep thoughtful movies.I felt like I had spent two and half hours + having my cranium bashed in with pretentious monotone.I'm sorry I cant type anymore, the numbness of watching this film has taken a hold of my soul and is slowly strangling the life out of me.OK some of the cinematography was visually stunning. The effects, were good, but the premise and story were nauseating.This is a film you will either Love or loath.I'm loathing",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Resonates with you, hours after the movie has ended.","I can not get this movie out of my head. It truly stays with you, for hours after the credits have rolled and you've returned home. It has been a while since a movie has done that for me and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty achieved this easily. Every aspect of this movie was immaculately done, from the characters to the acting to the cinematography to the music. Everything fit so well together, like pieces of a puzzle that only you were looking at. From the second the film began, I could tell that this was going to be a movie that would resonate. The music is extremely well-chosen and the score is perfect for each scene. Each song made me feel the emotions that Ben Stiller wanted me to feel; excellent music. The colors and the scenery of this film are impeccable. I can not get it out of my head. The scene where Ben Stiller longboards through Iceland may be the most beautiful scene I've witnessed in a movie to date. There's something about that scene, with no words, and the music...It's a beautiful scene. More than anything else that this movie does, it makes you feel something. Something more than ""Well, that was a good film"" or ""What a beautiful movie."" It was a feeling that there is really something more out there for everyone. The feeling that Walter Mitty is in all of us, especially in this day and age, where we're stuck more than ever. The feeling that we can do anything. And if a film can make you feel that, then what more could you want?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simple. Beautiful. Fantastic.,"Quintessence. After watching this tonight, I can honestly say that it is definitely worth a watch. It is a modern depiction of the short story written by James Thurber. Although I haven't read the story you certainly can notice the differences – in the advancements of technology - since 1939 when it was originally published.Ben Stiller director and protagonist does both perfectly, keeping you gripped throughout. There are characteristics of romance, comedy and mainly adventure. At times your thinking is he daydreaming, or not? Is life just one big daydream? You catch yourself sympathising with Mitty as the film seems to say something about modern society, about how technology is revolutionising today's society and the daydreams we have about LIFE.A must watch, just marvellous. 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
review of beginning-only,"It is creative and so far I like it. I wanted to post this where the writer would see it.There is an historical inconsistency in the beginning. Life Magazine (which I used to enjoy for the photographs) went out of business in 1972. Dumbledore did not first appear in J.K. Rowling's novel until 1997. ""Walter"" tells a guy in the elevator ""beards look good on Dumbledore, not on you"" then he walks into the Life Magazine office, which is being bought by a dot.com. But there was no world wide web in 1972, that was before there was any Windows, or personal computers. The reference to being bought by a dot.com in what is suggested to be the early 70s also is a plot failure. There should be some link between late 60s to early 70s attire, graphics and the dot.com boom, which occurred 20 years later, but there isn't. So we are asked to file this inconsistency away and keep watching. The voices he does, the special effects that sprout out of situational remarks is funny, a bit Woody Allen, but original in form.The reminder that ""film"" was once sacred to photographers (blood stained and sent with a handwritten note) is good. I'll keep watching and perhaps I can update later.I did not check the spoiler box because I have not seen the plot yet, we know from the summary that ""Walter Mitty"" is a day dreamer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing,"Possibly the best feel good film ever made.I'm not a professional film critic, but I bet i've seen more films than a lot of them. So heres my take.The first trailer with no dialogue is what grasped me. As the later trailers came out i feared it may go down the same route as 'The Councillor'. I however still decided to attend the pre screening. Best decision of my life.This movie in every way is how a film should be made. Epic, wonderful story and i think one of the most relatable films I've ever seen.Look its not Django, or Argo or even similar and this is why I think it will be over looked as i think Hollywood has it's own ideas about what a Best Picture should be, especially at the Oscars. But it sets a new standard for Rom-com/adventure/feel good films all around the globe.I personally will put this into the best cinema experiences of my life and i doubt it will be knocked out any time soon.Just magnificent! Utterly beautiful and perfect in every way! Thank you Ben Stiller!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pretty good work,"It didn't depict what exactly the main character's work in the company. So how valuable is he to the company, or what does the company and the job mean to him I didn't understand fully. It's a shame that the story didn't show how hard he worked for the company because he like his job and the company. I think it would have been more interesting if those things were depicted in the story. Also, the importance of that one piece of the film is not well written. For example, all the other pictures were scraps and that one could be the only one that would be on the cover. Or depict the trust of him to the photographer. If so, I think I would have understood the situation better. I don't think the situation as a whole was well explained. It was just the flow of the story and the atmosphere around the main character and all that kind of stuff that made me understand what was going on in the movie. Those things made up the story in the lack of explanation and I was able to get into the film.
Personally, I don't like movies that are obviously aiming at masterpieces like this one. But if you're not a cynical movie fan like me, I think you'll be impressed by this movie, so I'm happy to recommend this to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A check goes in almost every box,"The first thing you want out of a film is good flow, check. Then great acting, check. Great production/etc, check.And if a movie can make you laugh and tear up inside a five minute window, something brilliant is happening. This has to be one of my favorite films.There are things I could complain about, like the corporations that are used/propped. But, I can easily shoot that frustration down because there's a point being made. It's sad where this world can head if we forget about the explosive element inside simplicity. Simplicity is all around us. It's so dynamic. This movie taps into that wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yawn...,"Movie is incoherent and boring. Right form the start, the progress was lackluster and incoherent. It doesn't explain the backdrop well whatsoever, leaving one to constantly wonder what is really transpiring and why. I know many enjoyed this film but I found it painful to watch and disjointed in the narrative - especially with what was transpiring as a whole for the storyline. Main character is extremely dull and desperate for life. To live in such a fantasy land as he does is just awful. If this is how the majority live, there is little hope for us all. Found it depressing, slow, and uneventful at best.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Celebration of Life,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a celebration of life. It's a feel good movie that not only inspires, but motivates its viewers to go out and live life to the fullest. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, stop you from seeking adventure and making the best of this precious gift of being alive. It is a fun and heartwarming tale that is worth watching.The story and screenplay don't necessarily excel or surprise in the narrative department, but they provide a emotionally satisfying experience nonetheless. However, this film really shines from a directorial stand point. Ben Stiller does an excellent job of balancing the fantasy and real world moments in the film. I really felt like I was watching a person's daydreams when Walter would zone out. It's exciting and beautifully executed and when the character snaps back into reality, it is very much like me when I daydream.The cast does a solid job, but nothing really stands out performance wise. Having said that, I find Walter to be an incredibly likable character. He's odd and a bit awkward, but he never feels hopeless so we can always root for him when things don't go as planned. And Ben Stiller's natural charisma adds to the character's likability.Overall ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is an enjoyable feel good movie that will warm your heart and make you appreciate life. The film doesn't excel in any one particular area of film making, but it does hit you were it counts. Accompanied by a great soundtrack/score, this is a movie that is worth watching and you'll come out of it with a new found appreciation for life. I give it 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ben Stiller And His Eyes Take Us On A Masterful Feel Good Journey,"I never realized how blue Ben Stiller's eyes are. This was my first thought in the opening scene of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Indeed, Ben's clear, intensely blue eyes feature prominently throughout the film, and help give the character of Walter Mitty a poignant humanity, hooking the audience into his story. And what a story it is.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is based on a 1939 short story written by James Thurby and originally published in The New Yorker. It revolves around mild-mannered Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), who works in the film department of Life magazine. Walter processes the amazing photos from around the world published in the magazine, but has never been adventurous enough to discover the world himself.The film opens on Walt's forty-second birthday and he looks decidedly middle-aged when we first see him. It comes as a bit of a shock to see Ben Stiller looking so old (he is forty-eight in real life), however it adds authenticity to the film.The theme of the film is mid-life crisis and for those currently journeying through Middle Life, it's a wonderful reminder that it's never too late to do those things you've always wanted to do. Sometimes we just need a push to get us started.The film's cinematography is exquisite, with a classic retro feel due to the Time magazine setting and prominent use of iconic Time covers as backdrops throughout. The adventure scenes are a lush contrast to the New York scenes, and the soundtrack is perfect. Ben Stiller not only starred in the film but also directed it, and kudos to him for a job extremely well done.Kristen Wigg does a reasonable job as Walt's love interest, although it's not her best performance. Adam Scott plays an Office-esque nasty boss with a beard that deserves it's own ending credit. The supporting cast of off-beat characters that Walt meets on his adventures are great, including the wonderful Sean Penn as the elusive Time photographer Sean O'Connell.The audience is rewarded for taking the journey with Walt by an immensely touching ending, one that you'll never forget. Just like Ben's startling blue eyes. Four and a half stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Real beauty never asks for attention.....,"The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is an absolutely beautiful movie which is quite new and enjoyable.The problem with the movie is that the director, and write did't seemed to me worked much on story and its execution. Many moments became a bit boring and unlinked. Other then that, it was a nice time watching this movie and no doubt its a family movie.The best thing about the movie is its thought over thoughts. The title of the movie seems misleading but it can't be said to be inappropriate. I was expecting much more better thing but still it is an enjoyable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"By far, the best movie from Ben Stiller","I have to say it, I usually start watching a movie with good expectations, and there's just a little number of movie which I dislike, in short, I like movies and I like to enjoy them (I'm not a critic). So, leaving that in clear, I can talk about this movie; which I simply love it, I had the good luck to watch it in cinema, and several years after, I've watched it again, this time with my wife, and she love it too, as me quite a once. For me, this movie has an excellent message to all people, it's quite simple, ""stop dreaming and start living"". We don't know what we're capable of until you have to take the bull by its horns. This movie also shows the bunch of possibilities and moments your life can be made of, and let you uncover that there's nothing impossible and you are your bigger stopper in your own life. Once, I read something, ""you are just a decision away from the life you want"" (and deserve). This movie will tell you all that in a funny way (sometimes), you just have to listen, (watch and enjoy).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Walter Mitty is a stunning film that represents the seditary structure of life so many fall into and the expression of creativity and beauty that life has to offer. This movie for myself was a major inspiration when I studied photography as it demonstrates the importance of just sitting, thinking and then moving closer to your destination. For a feel good movie that has genuine human growth and beautiful art, expression and landscape you get to not only experience the journey of a man stuck in a deadly spiral of life but also the cultures of corporate America and the peaceful small communitys of Greenland.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting approach to frame the story elements...,Decent acting. Fine cinematography.Wiig's character very real and likable.

"Beautiful cinematography, gentle human story","Movie has some wise messagess about going out and meeting the world head onThat aside the cinematography in this is a very rare treat, so many movies are so flat picture wise, but perhaps because this movie has a background motif about photography, each scene is composed like a photoThe grain, color, placement of the actors in the scenes, use of lines, shadows & light are painstakingly composed as if to capture the ""quintessence"" of each shotThis wasn't mentioned anywhere else so I wanted to be sure to give credit to the work of the academy award nominated cinematographerStepping out of one's comfort zone is a beautiful thing, we all should have a few moments of experiencing it I think, movie reminds us take a moment to capture it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unquestionably the pinnacle of Ben Stiller's career,"Can a silly-comedy actor be held hostage by his previous low rated works? Looks like a few detractors who badly reviewed ""The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty"" unjustly giving it a 1 think so. Probably cheesy parodies lovers with no taste who just want to sweat out their beers and eat popcorn. I am surprised some of them even admitted they missed Stiller's previous whack comedies...Don't get me wrong, when I heard Ben Stiller was going to remake such a great comedy with Danny Kay, I was scared to death and somewhat mad. ""How dares he"", I honestly thought. I was expecting another unfunny Christmas gag-movie with nothing to tell, Ben Stiller's style.I was wrong.Although this film has practically nothing in common with the original one, it is indeed a good story with believable acting, visually great and full of unspoken meaning. It even manages to be rather funny now and then, and yet there's a lot more to it. Watch it and you will know where and why.Here and there a bit emotionally basic, if you know what I mean, but still a remarkable movie.Ben Stiller will have a hard time in the future trying to maintain the substance he achieved in this ode to the good man.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A truly amazing movie,"I went into this movie not sure what to expect because the trailers were not very detailed as to what the movie was about. From the beginning Ben Stiller does a great job at bringing in an element of light comedy that makes you laugh but is not over done or raunchy. This movie is one of those few movies that you watch and leave the theater thinking about life and what you are doing with yours. The music in the movie compliments to story so well, and the main reason I went to the movie is because I am a big fan of the band Of Monsters and Men and they happen to have a track in the movie. From start to finish I was captivated by this movie and I made it a point to go and buy the DVD as soon as it came out (which I never do) so I could watch this beautiful movie again and again. By far the best movie of 2013.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Atypical Stiller,"I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected. The message is really strong. Ultimately, if you head in expecting and wanting Stiller comedy, you'd upset yourself - there are nods to elements of Stiller as you'd expect, in some of the fantasy, lost in the zone moments, but it's a much more serious Stiller movie, ultimately it's about someone just breaking away, or waking up!There's an Eharmony story element that took me out of the movie a few times, and was bad enough to pull a star away. I'm being generous with 9, considering how much it annoyed me, but the rest of it was so good that I can't let that segment pull it down too far in my mind. It just didn't need to be there, but ah well - it was! It was actually fine in the intro, but beyond that it got out of hand. I'll say no more about that.Otherwise, apart from a few other odd moments, it touched me in all kinds of places. Got me a little teary at the end, and in a few other places!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so good but i liked it,"This movie takes a long time to tell the story, but I liked it.The beginning is good, but as the plot progresses it becomes a bit boring since it seems that nothing happens, although I enjoyed seeing every moment of the protagonist's journey, the plot twist can be disappointing and very silly, but I feel that it means that we must never give up to get something we want, and I also think it means that what you are looking for and think is unattainable may be closer than you think. Still, I think the movie lacks more character development and the way the story is told lacks rhythm. It has decent performances, it can be funny in certain parts, it has good special effects and good photography that allows you to admire the landscapes where it was filmed.It is not a very entertaining film, but it seems to me that it works by empathizing with the protagonist by accompanying him through a long journey where he overcomes his fears and achieves his goals.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There's so much beauty and awe during the travel scenes. If you've never been to Europe you will want to after this!! There are so many moments that capture your heart and make you feel something. This film will make you take a deeper look at your life and your purpose and what truly matters.

"Well-done but tiresome, like Russian ice skating","There are a lot of movies worse than this to watch. That being said, if you are a highly-involved, personally vivacious individual who lives and loves in the way you wish, this movie will not speak to you. It is a cautionary tale for hemmed in, workaday drones who struggle to be seen despite their conformity and microscopic vision of themselves. As if it isn't known that breathtaking scenes of volcanoes and near-death experiences are profound. Of course they are. Only in your microscopic world of urban kitsch and self-absorbed resource gathering could the major experiences of human life evade you. This movie is about the (seemingly lost wisdom of) living life and not hiding from it. The people that made the movie could afford to learn the lesson.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Movie For Introverts,"There's a little Walter Mitty in all of us, and less on the screen in Ben Stiller's take on James Thurber's short story about the ultimate daydreamer.By imposing carpe diem purpose on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty - although no deeper than a Nike ad - Stiller turns Thurber's everyman into every man for himself. If you have a dream, get your own movie. Little about this one is embraceable or teachable, and nothing swells your chest with emotion. It's the sort of oppressively pop cultured pep rally that Thurber's Walter might have faced an imaginary firing squad to escape.Parts of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty equal Inception in making dreams real and The Avengers in sheer CGI bombast, like an asphalt-churning chase on Manhattan streets. But it's all so flashily packaged that this seems less like a movie, and more like a 2-hour Super Bowl commercial selling self-help snake oil.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fantastic film that embraces the ""everyman"" and the endless possibilities of our world.","Let me start by saying that I was skeptical to go see this film, mainly because it starred Ben Stiller. Given his track record of ""comedies,"" I found myself avoiding his films just because I knew that they'd be crude and not the type of comedy I would enjoy. Much in the same way I was surprised by Will Ferrell in Stranger than Fiction (2006), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) was a pleasant surprise. I don't know if it's because he also directed this film, but I truly enjoyed it on many levels, both as a lover of movies and a lover of photography.The strength of this film lies in its imagery and presentation. The beauty of our world and the way it's captured in the travels of a man coming out of his shell is truly inspiring. I can honestly say I haven't seen a film nearly this encouraging in quite a while. As someone who often struggles to find the courage to try new things or break out of my tried-and-true routines, I can confirm that the daydreaming fantasies of those lacking confidence are merely the coping mechanisms of introverts too scared to risk failure, thus inevitably missing out on the fantastic adventures this world has to offer.But even the message to get out and experience the world is tempered by the reminder to truly be ""in the moment."" Each time I watch this film, I cry every time the world-famous photographer lets the perfect picture pass him by, merely so he can be fully present in the experience of the moment. I have taken these ""snow leopard moments"" to heart, embracing the ability to enjoy a special time without having to document it for social media. Oh, and on a final side note: what cellular service does Walter Mitty have? I ask because the calls he got in the Himalayas were crystal clear!A fantastic film that embraces the ""everyman"" and the endless possibilities of our world, I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life.,"The meaning of life described in one movie.
Overcoming fears, trying something new and not listening to what other people want you to be, is what takes Walter Mitty in the end of his journey to his true self. The meaning of the movie is to show every viewer that he can achieve the same as Walter and hasn't to be bounded by his own dreamworld in his head.
To explore the world, to love, and to appreciate everything around you is the meaning of life; lectured by the movie.
Even though the film has a lot what could have been done better, it still keeps being one of my favourite movies.
After watching it you will also have the urge to change your life aswell and that impact is what makes the film exceptional.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should Have Remained The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"Ben Stiller has so far this year had what may be called a 'quiet one', however fortunes look set to change with the latest blockbuster 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. Viewing of the trailer promises a touching and majestic piece of cinematography, a warm and heartfelt theme is vowed as Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) drifts in and out of his own nine-to-five mundane reality through increasingly outrageous and awesome daydreams To which I'm sure many of us can relate.A film which is involved with routine, lost dreams and online dating has all the makings of a relatable canvas. Walter is a non-descript human, when asked to complete his online dating profile over the phone we are pulled into the first of many 'visions' where Walter emerges from a burning building only to claim the damsel – in this case a colleague whom he has been following online for some time yet struggling to pluck up the courage to persuade her to even acknowledge his presence at Life Magazine – the truth, Walter handles photos for Life Magazine.When Walter is eventually cornered into a conversation with the coveted Cheryl Melhoff played by the elegant and desirable Kristen Wiig his life comes to a crossroads as she challenges him as no-one has before. Walter sets off around the world à la carpe diem in search of a photograph from the illusive photographer Sean O'Connor played effectively if only briefly by Sean Penn.There are moments of beauty and splendour as his travels see him traipse through Greenland, Iceland, submerged in the Atlantic Ocean and finally back to the office cubicle. Despite this, the film's script is ropey at best, when promising to deliver a picture of the 'quintessence of life' for the final issue of Life Magazine we are promised so much, unfortunately, the conclusion to the photo mystery is rather trite and aspects such as the closure of the magazine is trivialised by absurd characters.The problems with Walter Mitty's Secret Life is that the fantasies which both we and Walter experience eventually descend into the slapstick and satirical, forcing a film, which promises so much on an emotional level, to become farcical in so many manners.Breaking out from the restraints of his role as a 'negative asset manager' and blossoming one would expect Walter secret life to contain deep and meaningful means to an end, despite this Walter's secret life is riddled with hilarities such as an inebriated helicopter pilot and even moments on the Himalayas are trivialised as Walter searches out Sean only skimming the surface of emotional connection before moving swiftly on.It is hard not to get caught up in the energy of Walter Mitty's adventure, only to be let down when Stretch Armstrong and Bejamin Button 'sketches' are thrown into the equation. The film may stem from a short-story but that is no excuse for 'filler', the victim; sentimentality.Ben Stiller recently talked of his desire to be behind the camera as his zeal for screen time diminishes with a heightened desire to direct. A somewhat natural step, even if he hadn't confessed that in an interview it is very hard to escape that feeling while watching the tired and lacklustre 'feel-good' family Christmas film this year. Sorry kids.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you need reminding that there is beauty in the world...,"This ranks as close to a ""perfect ten"" as you can get in my book.If you want to see the beauty of life and this world encapsulated in a movie, watch The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.I understand why it got mixed reviews. This particular type of film isn't for everyone. If you've never stared in wonder at an amazing photograph in National Geographic...or wanted to cry when you saw a fierce big cat in a cage...or thought the deep lines in an old woman's face were striking...then this movie may seem overly stylized to you.It is also surprisingly short on dialogue. I'm a wordsmith by trade and you'd think that would bother me. It didn't. The lines were perfect. They conveyed emotion without gimmick. (Hey, I love pieces that are all about the dialogue...Pulp Fiction, Before Sunset, anything with Robert Downey Jr in it...but you don't always need it.)Often a film can let you down at the end...I've reviewed a few, like Noah, that captured my interest but left me feeling dissatisfied when the credits began to roll. This movie was consistent...interesting, thinking, all the way through. Without giving anything away, the screenplay writer didn't seem to feel the need to resolve every little issue, or tie up things too neatly.My advice...avoid comparing to any other big fantastical story films like Big Fish. Try to judge this film on its own merits. The cinematography is incredible. It jives perfectly with the soundtrack. With quietly powerful performances by Stiller, Wiig, Penn, MacLaine, Martinez, this flick is engineered to touch your heart. Nothing wrong with that!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The end of LIFE.,"Everyone after this is nothing but a corporate automaton.Only the real creatives get to live their lives fully.Great that they used the daydreaming of Mitty to carry the story, but what this movie is really showing is the end of life as well as the magazine.Everyone else has to goose-step to the mostly empty lives given to us by the LIFE-less corporations ruled by dead-from-the-neck-up idiots like the corporate headhunters depicted in this very good movie.Even dating is corporatized now.This great movie is not in any way a ""re-make"" of the old Danny Kaye movie.Well worth the time to watch and it's a very funny movie.Great story.

Day-dream of nobody.,"This is a daydream about the nobody . When we were teenagers we had unlimited visions and fantasies about the future, we wanted to see the world, to breathe the air from the mountains, to touch the ice and snow melting in our hands, to see the sun rising from the horizon. The chores of survival trap us in the net of the city, and we rely on daydreams to do a silent rebellion, so uninteresting on the outside of a person who has a universe inside. Maybe there are times when we have to be brave and venture and wander to faraway places. Courage is in the heart, we burn the fire in our hearts, even if the passerby only sees smoke.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of time,"Walter Mitty has been explicitly written to appeal to 40-year old losers around the world. How can anybody relate to this irrelevant guy is beyond me. He has a love interest that nobody cares about, a job going the way of the dodo, and a purported ""adventure"" nobody cares about either.This film is filled with irrelevant fantasy segments while devoid of any motivation or character development. The central character is forced into absurd problems that would never happen in today's world, and is also written to make decisions that contradict his personality, with absolutely no motivation.The reason for this guy to be irrelevant is that, provided this film was properly written, he would have taken his retirement package and quietly gone home to cry himself to sleep. He would never spend his money in this absurd adventure of his when he is on the verge of unemployment.The whole skateboard plot is trash; even though a guy with this personality could somehow be an expert skater after 40, the whole ride in the middle of the film is not only boring, but also unwarranted; he could just get into the car and avoid skating altogether.Films based on the assumption that moviegoers are idiots should be stopped.

A movie that hits you on a very personal level & makes you look at your life and how you live it. I really loved it,"""Let's make every moment count starting now."" Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a boring unadventurous man who daydreams all day and works for LIFE magazine. When he finds out the magazine is publishing it's final issue all he has to do is find the negative for the final cover. This turns out to be a life changing experience and Walter Mitty finally discovers who he is. I have to admit that I was not excited about watching this going in. The trailer seemed boring to me and I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. I am not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I was way off the mark on this one. From the opening scene you get to know and feel for Walter and during the course of the movie you root for him and share his experiences with him as if they were your own. Walter Mitty is the type of guy we all relate to and that's what makes this such a good movie. By the end he becomes someone we all wish we could be. This is not just a good movie its a very inspiring movie that needs to be seen by anyone unsure of themselves, and really who isn't? I highly recommend this movie and this is Ben Stiller's best work yet. Overall, a movie that hits you on a very personal level and makes you look at you life and how you live it. I give this an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A beautiful piece of art,"I watched this movie after a recommendation and I simply loved it. Properly, this is a very beautiful film. It shows the adventures of a day-dreamer having a monotonous life. The whole movie is based on the idea of experience, daily life and travel. The sceneries offer the movie impressive visuals and the adventures of Walter Mitty can be felt deeply from the person in front of the screen. The movie is not a comedy, although it has some moments of satire and if you think Ben Stiller only plays in comedies, this film shows that he can do much more than that. If you are searching for a realistic, fun to watch movie with a good story, this is the way to go. In three words: Experience; Feel; Travel.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Some might call it boring, and some might call it weird. I feel bad for those people because they have never learned to appreciate life.

Worth watching,"If you are an incurable daydreamer and often find yourself lost in thought, then ""The Secret Life of
Walter Mitty"" is a must-watch. This film revolves around an awkward and timid man, Walter Mitty,
portrayed by Ben Stiller, who frequently indulges in fantasies to escape his mundane and
monotonous life.One day, while at work, he encounters a unique opportunity that catapults him into one of the
most significant adventures he has ever experienced. This journey takes him to Greenland, Iceland,
and the Himalayas, where he ultimately breaks free from the confines of his own imagination and
begins to shape the world around him. I would say that the quote ""To see the world. To find each
other and to feel. That is the purpose of life"" perfectly encapsulates the essence of the movie.Prior to watching it, I had reservations about the plot's originality, but upon giving it a chance, I
was pleasantly surprised by the breathtaking visuals, which, in my opinion, are at the heart of the
entire film. What further elevates this movie is its exceptional choice of music, which effectively
complements the stunning landscapes.I wholeheartedly recommend watching this remarkable and inspiring film, not only for its
emotional impact from start to finish, but also because most of us can identify with Walter Mitty.We, too, often harbour unspoken desires and ambitions, and dream of visiting places we've never
been,",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
To the Strongest People on Earth,"The film I needed right now. I always appreciated Ben Stiller, even more in dramatic roles. I found his performance really emotional. It's his presence, his looks, his behaviour. His direction is also something worth mentioning.Of course I found this really emotional and close to my heart as I struggle every day with what you see on screen: taking risks, being confined in your own little world, social anxiety. What you see on screen is not even exaggerated and I found it to be very true. Kudos to that.But more importantly it's the message that the film wants to spread that I feel so tangible and true and not even a bit clichéd or somehow overused: you don't know what's on the other side until you try it. That's true. And I felt it on my skin. And when I had the courage to do it, to go to the other side, despite the anxiety, despite the shyness, despite the racing heart, it was beautiful and liberating, something close to true happiness, and some of those days will forever be the best of my entire life.So, thank you Ben Stiller for this rendition of the story and for your performance. It's a voice that represents some of us. In the film the fine line between dreams and reality is very subtle, that sometimes you don't understand what's what. That changes progressively as when go on. That's what everything should be.A person's life is defined by what he or she does, not what he or she says. Rule no.1 in screenwriting.

"Sometimes it doesn't even matter what the destination is, it's the journey that counts.","'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is not 'Into the Wild', it doesn't just tell us to live our life and do what we want to do and abandon society and humanly viles to explore world. It shows us that it's okay to dream and to fantasize the world because sometimes, just sometimes it can work.There were so many little details in the movie that indirectly pushed Walter to go where he needed to go to find himself. He had to drop the radio equipments, he had to imagine Cheryl singing, he had to drop the wallet and he had to send the piano.Man, I used to be good at writing reviews but I just can't seem to write my feelings for this movie. It's weird. Ben Stiller always appeased me. I always felt nice watching him on thw screen. This movie showed us that the journey matters and sometimes it's not even about the destination. For the picture he emptied his bank account, jumped into freezing ocean, fought a shark, climbed upper Himalayas, he didn't even see it until he ended up at the place where it was being sold. I always had the idea of what the picture would be about and where it would be. But, there's another lesson here, we seem to drop some trivial things in our life or fail to notice those trivial things in life because we think that life is tough and it can't get that easy or just there isn't enough time to spend a moment on those trivial things. Sometimes what we are searching for is right next door, or in our own hands.Go out and take a risk. Ask a girl on date, go to a tall building and see the world from above, or do something that makes you feel alive and not just a survival machine, working towards your own grave.Cheers to those who wish to dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"This movie is a true gem for some, like me, both in picture and story.","We were looking for a good movie to see for the whole family. The main actor, Ben Stiller, recalls good memories, so I checked out the popularity score. The score was surprisingly good, so I decided to give it a try. My expectations where not too high, as I looked forward to a pretty mainstream, funny and feel good comedy. Eventually, when the movie started, I got this strong and convincing feeling in my stomach, that this was really something very special. Do not ever mistrust your stomach feeling.This film is a modern adventure taking place in the life of a true but hardworking dreamer who secretly falls in love with a coworker.

But suddenly the fantasies inside Walter Mitty's head enforces him to take action and real life and real adventure truly begins.For those of us, spending too much of our lives working hard under the influence of a stupid boss, the struggle out of rude and choking suppression out in the wild unsecured adventure, is delivered in a thrilling, exquisite and beautiful composition of pictures, scenes, settings,music, moods and characters.This was the time watching it, more than well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Stiller has not just 'Crossed a Line' with this 'whore fest of product placement' but rather obliterated the line while winking at the camera, carrying the flag of the latest product/brand/company who will happily throw cash at him. Lets face it, this is c**k and balls of the highest order with the once 'mildly amusing' in a ""I feel quite sorry for Ben Stiller....he actually thinks he's funny"" kind of way, just happy to gobble anyone who'll write him a cheque....remember fellas, more zero's, more chance I'll swallow!!! This is quite simply Hollywood at it's absolute worst. Yet another unwanted remake demonstrating the sheer laziness of the US film industry who are all too happy to let self obsessed, ego-maniacal supposed 'Stars' deliver 'their vision' of any former classic. What Stiller may as well have done is pull down his pants,'Curled one out', filmed it for 2 hours and then release that!

Overrated Dull and Boring Remake,"The manager of negative assets sector of Life magazine Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has been working for sixteen years in the magazine and has a tedious life without going anywhere but from his home to his job and vice-versa.

Walter has a crush on the recently hired Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) but he is too shy to invite her to date and he is trying to contact her through the eHarmony, a site for online dating. The magazine is preparing to release the last printed edition and the loathsome manager of transition Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) is preparing an inevitable downsizing along the next days.Walter has been the liaison between the magazine and the mysterious independent photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that has sent to him a package of negatives and a wallet as a gift for his work. Sean also suggests to the senior management the use of negative 25 for the cover of the last edition. However Walter cannot find the negative that is missing. Walter has no means to contact Sean and finds a clue that he might be in Greeland. He decides to travel to Greeland to track Sean down in the beginning of an unbelievable adventure.""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is an overrated dull and boring remake of the 1947 movie. The plot is silly and predictable and despite the great cast and wonderful location, it is a letdown since the comedy is not funny, the romance does not have any chemistry, the drama is inexistent and the adventure is boring and dumb.

Too Subtle. Bland. Slow. Not Charming and Not Funny,"Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is about to lose his job as he cannot find negative 25 showing ,we think, Adventurer/Photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) which would go on the very last cover of Life Magazine. Life Mag is being bought out by another company. What to do? What to do?Before I watched the movie I had these thoughts: Do you daydream? Of course you do. We all do. Do you ever do anything about your daydreams? Probably not. Take heart, Walter Mitty does something about his daydreams. You are in luck. You can live vicariously thru Walter Mitty in this movie. Lucky you.Okay, maybe I daydreamed a bit. And, then I watched the movie and discovered you were not so lucky after all. Sorry. There was no secret life of Walter Mitty. James Thurber is spinning uncontrollably in his grave. We see a few daydreams in the beginning and think this will continue. Sadly no. No time for daydreaming, as he is in the real world and must find the missing negative and he goes off looking for Sean O'Connell in Greenland, Iceland, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. Not sure if the movie was actually shot in these locations or if a Green Screen was used. But, the scenery landscapes were captivating, awesome, and very beautiful. And, his dip into the sea with a shark nearby was pretty good too.What didn't work: The Benjamin Button scene, the drunk helicopter pilot karaoke scenes, the chemistry with Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) and Safe - too safe - dialogues.What would have helped? Traveling or some-such music when Walter goes here and there. Didn't happen. And, a better script with some funny and clever lines too. And, also another movie title as this one is grossly misleading.Normally, when we see a Ben Stiller movie we look forward to his looking like a deer in the headlights.. That's his shtick. It is quite humorous.. Didn't happen. However, we do see a lot Stiller close-ups (but no deer look) of his face - perhaps too many - but he was also the Director and he can do that if he wants.The movie is all monotone, slow and just another slice of life not going anywhere. The supporting cast were all good and Shirley McLaine as Walter's mother makes a short appearance. We did enjoy Sean Penn as he is always good.At the end we get to see the last cover of Life Magazine. And, it will shock you, make you weepy as you reach for the Kleenex box you didn't think you needed. That picture was the only good thing about this movie. It is pure gold.

Day Tripping the Life: Fantastic,"If you are craving to have your artistic soul fed, this is the movie for you. Moving at a slower pace with an attention to detail, this movie is not for the adrenaline junkie. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, takes you on a journey with an average man with plain Jane friends. Walter Mitty, a negative assets manager at Life magazine, is a middle age man that lives a routine and mundane life. He lives his life vicariously through the adventures of his photographer friend, Sean O'Connell. Sean is a free spirit who lands in far away places to document life. The negatives (how pictures used to be shot, as my young son would say, in the olden days) are then sent to Walter for review.Loosely based on current events, Life magazine makes a monumental decision to stop printing their magazine and go web only. With this comes a whole set of complications at work. Walter is put in charge of frame 25, from a negative that was shot by the famous Sean O'Connell. When frame 25 cannot be located, that is when all hell breaks loose. Walter is unable to find it, so his journey begins. Walter travels to Iceland, Greenland, on a shipping vessel, and through the Middle East on his quest for negative 25. As he travels, work is putting pressure on him to find this missing negative. His new boss harasses him regarding his recent travels.Walter suffers from elaborate daydreams that take him away from the moment. His daydreams are action packed, where he is the hero and says all the right words. In real life, Walter is slightly plain and not able to say any of the right words at the right time, which is very awkward.As Walter travels across the world and finds himself, the daydreams begin to slip away. He gains self-confidence and a new appreciation for life. I know that this sounds like a million other movies out there, but Ben Stiller does a superb job conveying the simplicity of making a change in your life. I would say that this movie is geared to a middle age crowd, some one who has been in their job for a bit and is feeling the dullness of life.The music is beautiful and perfectly placed with the story line. This is a soundtrack that you will want to buy after watching this film. It is music that is comforting and uplifting, not over bearing. The lyrics of each song are perfectly placed with the scene that it is accompanied with. The costumes are current with every day clothes and make up. The director does a great job conveying Walter Mitty's simple lifestyle. Right down to his apartment being styled in the way a man who lives a routine life would be. This is counter balanced with the apartment of his Mom, who is featured a couple of times. Her place is fun, full of color and memories that she shares with Walter and his sister.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty left me feeling thoughtful about my own life. It caused me to reflect on my own life and what a contrast it is to the life portrayed in the movie. I love adventure and I started to daydream about all the places I want to travel and explore. If only I had a mystery to solve while doing it. Can I please have a perfectly timed and lovely sounding soundtrack to my every day life? This movie is lovely and full of humor.

In these days of infarction-inducing, billion-dollar epics... if the title doesn't have some kind of hook to get viewers interested, most of us are just too busy watching other movies with what little time we do have to give this movie a second look. Only after all others have been seen (or by some happy and serendipitous accident) does this movie get the nod from most movie goers: ""Let's rent this one, we've seen all these other ones."" This is unfortunate because it is a visual, visceral, and inspirational movie experience. We absolutely loved it. I have 4 smaller children and even they ""stayed tuned"" throughout the entire flick. This movie is great for smaller-than-teen but bigger-than-baby age groups, by the way. It was inspiring for me and I'm almost too old to dream :) We actually discussed this film after watching it with them because they had so many questions: ""Is there really a place in Iceland or Greenland or wherever that has only 8 people living there Dad?"", and ""I want a skateboard like that Dad. Its faster than the one I have."" The only reason I gave it an 8 instead of the 10 it probably deserves is because the 10's must mean something and if you hand them out willy-nilly, they won't. This movie deserves an 8.5-9.5 for global visuals alone. Let's not forget the really funny parts we've come to expect from Scott and Stiller. There is no shortage of that in this film.

All diamond but no glimmer. ...,"The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty carries the tag of stop dreaming and start living.Directed by Ben Stiller himself, this movie has been filmed wonderfully well in terms of cinematography. The sceneries captured in the film truly deserves a special mention.The film looks good and succeeds in creating feel good moments.Moments that make you smile and even maybe cheer .But sadly they tend to stay to be just moments , like an advert of a coming of age film without having anything to show.you smile and cheer for the guy but then by the end of the film, you question what amazing feat did the guy actually accomplish??

Walter Mitty Type,"There are two things I have learned from this movie. The first being that there is such a thing as a horny Chilean. The second being, apparently, that I may be a Walter Mitty type. Oxford defines Walter Mitty as ""Used to refer to a person who fantasizes about a life much more exciting and glamorous than their own life"". I guess you could say that we are all Walter Mitty types. Who doesn't sit around and wonder how exciting it would be to do something other than sitting around. I spent the first part of this movie fantasizing. I was bored and imagined some place that would hold much more interest. That boredom did dissipate by the time we caught up with Sean O'Connell, played by Sean Penn. His talk about savoring a moment resonated with myself. The idea that you should enjoy the moment and breath it in. There is so many things in this world that we should be experiencing. Lately, I feel like I should be breathing in every single moment. Whether it be studying the colour of a beer or hearing you son speak of his new found interest in politics, every moment should be cherished.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Intriguing and beautiful,"I found it a little bit hard to understand the first part of the movie, the who's and why's, though I might not have been paying enough attention. But as it went on, a beautiful movie unveiled. The scenery is amazing, it's something that I value highly in movies. Also of course the whole point of the story. I've always wanted to see the world, travel, but I realize now that a ""bigger"" Reason to why has been missing. This movie kinda gave me that.The football scene in the mountains was my favorite, I don't know why, but it just made me thoroughly happy. Now I'm just writing nonsense trying to reach the minimum words.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, profound and funny, all at once!!","This is my all time favorite movie. It is beautifully made, moves you deeply, invites you to dream (and day-dream) with the main character, and has you crying and laughing at times!! I adore this movie because it truly does justice to Life's motto: ""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."" Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig are absolutely fantastic in their roles, as is Sean Penn. I recommend this movie 100% and still do NOT understand why it only has a 7.3 on IMDB. 10 stars all the way. Please watch it and allow yourself to dream life full of excitement and adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feel good,"There are certain films that you can watch over and over again. For obvious reasons Groundhog Day is one and so is Walter Mitty. In my opinion this is Ben Stiller's best film role by far. He is terrific as Walter. All the way through the cast list there are memorable performances. The Sean Penn episode in the Himalayas is just about the most original film scene ever.That is if you don't include Walter's skateboard ride in Iceland. Or his helicopter trip ,piloted by the paralytic drunken pilot! This is a real feel good movie.You come out of the cinema holding the hand of your loved one,just as Walter clasped Cheryl's at the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Feel Good Epic for our times,"A modernisation of the iconic short story, Stiller's version tells the tale of wallflower and daydreamer Walter Mitty (also Stiller), stuck in a meagre existence as a negatives manager for Life magazine. One day, he receives the last batch from an acclaimed photographer (Penn), only to find one of the photos, dubbed 'the best', missing. This sets Mitty on a journey away from his normal surroundings, and into the wider world, letting him have real adventures while also growing confidence to woo a fellow worker (Whig).A feel-good epic, Stiller's 'Mitty' is the sort of film that is rare nowadays; imaginative, but also cheeky with a good sense of heart. Stiller and Whig make fine and charming leads, Adam Scott is a hammily fun villain as the takeover manager, and there's ear and eye candy aplenty, whether it be the rather humorous daydreams of Mitty himself, from saving pets from a burning building to having a concrete surf battle with Scott on the streets of New York, or just the gorgeous and lush landscapes of Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan. Shapiro's score is similar whimsical yet also reserved and soothing at points, and the song choices all fit the 'life is an adventure' theme very well and don't overstay their welcome.Honestly, I was having such a good time that I couldn't notice much in the way of flaws. Really, aside from Stiller's daydreaming never being properly explained save for a throwaway line from his mom (played by the always lovely Shirley Maclaine), the only other issue is sometimes, the story will move along just to move along, and it can feel a little too drastic at times. Example, when Stiller has to go to Greenland to find Penn's character, after one 'What?', he just pulls together and strides confidently onto the next flight out. You could make the argument that Penn's little mantra about life, which also Life's slogan, entices him, and he's sort of in a daydream state, but before, he was just shy and nervous, and the daydreams are established as being in his mind, so he doesn't actually move. Why now? But frankly, the film's combination of charisma and scope won me over, and was able to smooth out any rough patches in the plot. It's a simple 'get out and live life' tale and executed rather well. Dare I say, it's one of the more likable films I've seen in a good long while, in an age often over-saturated with films that are bright, but really dumb, or dark, edgy blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing...,"This was a totally wasted opportunity. Great special effects but with no emotional connection to anyone they were meaningless. The basic story was uninteresting with very little stakes. If you are going to connect with any character emotionally they need to spend some time getting to know them. For example, why they do what they do and build on their relationships. The problem was they started the movie assuming we knew all of that and used lazy exposition to introduce backgrounds. Then there was yet another side story about his job on the line and obnoxious boss (like we haven't seen that before).For example, because Walter was a daydreamer and I immediately got to know that I thought everything was him just daydreaming so whenever anything happened where I normally would be sitting on the edge of my seat I couldn't care less because I knew or thought it was just in his mind. That is a fundamental flaw with this. They should have blurred the lines so I didn't know. An example is when he is in the water with the shark or the volcano erupts.It's not like we really learned a bunch about Walter throughout the film because they focused on the silly plot, not his character. There was no chemistry between Wiig and Stiller. It was like they just phoned it in. It was too wooden and sterile. It wasn't a love story that builds up over time.Also, the underlying premise was boring. Trying to find Sean over a picture he needed to publish. The movie wanted to be many things and ended up being none. Too little time on the so-called love story, or his relationship with his family, all could have been worthwhile, but no, they went to muddy it all up with this nonsensical adventure dominated by special effects, irrespective of them having been done well.In the end, this movie was all over the place in tone, style, and story. SKIP IT!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, Inspiring, Also a Little Cheesy","This movie has some of the most amazing cinematography I have ever seen. It is filmed very creatively and beautifully. The setting for a good chunk of the movie is absolutely gorgeous. The music choices are excellent and fitting. One of my favorite aspects of this movie is the character development seen in Ben Stiller's character, Walter Mitty. This movie is inspiring and makes me want to branch out into the unknown on an adventure. The only reason I give it 9 starts instead of 10 is because some of the comedy scenes are a little too cheesy for me, but that's just Ben Stiller's style. Overall, it is a great movie that hasn't received the praise it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop Dreaming. Start Living.,"I'm a fan of Ben Stiller's directorial work and comedic work and he's a pretty talented guy. Zoolander, a film which he starred in and directed is bold and hilarious and a very fun time. But The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is different. It's much more serious and dramatic than a lot of his other roles. It gives Ben Stiller a chance to expand as a filmmaker and show how well of a visual director he is and if he can handle directing serious material.I understand critics are split on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Audiences, for the most part, love it but on Rotten Tomatoes, critics have given this film a 50% which means 50% of critics enjoyed the film. It's kind of a love-it or hate-it film. I'm on the side that really enjoyed it. It's messages are simple, clear and relevant. America is known for being a generally lazy country and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is trying to inspire people to go and live their dream and do something great with their lives. It has a lot to say about following your dreams and says it clearly and in an entertaining fashion.Ben Stiller's performance as Walter Mitty is stellar and engaging. Walter Mitty is a mild-mannered, shy guy and Stiller hits the nail on the head. It's interesting to see Kristin Wiig take on some serious material. She still has a couple of funny lines but for the most part, her character is a dramatic one. She handles it very well and is likable.One of the film's flaws are the characters. There are a lot of generic characters that are hardly given any development including Adam Scott and Sean Penn's character. That didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the film, though. The film almost entirely centers around Walter Mitty and his character is given a lot of attention to detail.Ben Stiller proves himself as a dramatic director in this specifically and a visual director. The film is breathtaking in terms of visuals. The cinematography is something different than what you usually see in mainstream films. It sort of resembles Wes Anderson's without being a total rip-off.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very fun time and a very good movie. It's worth your money.I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't bother,"Wasn't sure about watching this as it didn't have that much appeal to it but thought it only fair to give it a shot. Really wish I hadn't. This was one of the most boring films i've seen for a while. I actually stopped and started watching again about 5 times hoping in would get better , it didn't. My next project will be to watch paint dry and flake with age , that will be more entertaining than this drivel. I'm not going to pan the acting , direction or photography but this just came across as a nothing film. About nothing , going nowhere and certainly nothing to warrant sitting through it. Only redeeming quality to this film is it might get an award as a cure for insomnia although it might give rise to an uptake of suicides.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

unexpectedly beautiful,"This movie came as a surprise to me. When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a comedy with unrealistic dream sequences. I was ready for some laughs. Did I laugh? Yes. Were there a few scenes with non-real drama going on? Yes. But was it also well written, well acted, and VERY well filmed? YES. This was a beautiful adventurous film. The trailer does NOT do this justice. And I think the title throws people off. The acting was superb. Loved the ending and just all the quirky little moments. The soundtrack was UNREAL. every piece of this puzzle was crafted together consciously and artistically. Powerful movie experience. Will be keeping an eye out for more Ben Stiller movies for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
for the right audience it's life changing,"This movie has stuck in my mind and held an important role whenever I'm faced with a certain choice - whether to do something scary, something which I don't have a chance to do again.Walter Mitty, our protagonist is a man who daydreams of doing all the things that he wishes he could do, but he possibly can't do any of them, who are we kidding? He has a job, and responsibilities.Except, when something happens, something as simple as a singular photograph going missing, Walter is determined to find it. This takes him on an adventure where he gets to do all the things he has always daydreamed, adventuring into the faraway corners where a working man would only wish to visit.This movie is special to me for the exact reason that it is one of the best in showing a message that is very important to me: You can do the things you want to make you happy. You think you can't but you can. And that message is something I hold near and dear to my heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Refreshing !!!,"A Movie that strikes a chord with its name itself, the secret life of Walter was meant to be something different. But what i did not expect was that the direction came from one of the most admired actors ; Ben Stiller.

A Journey from Dreams to Reality.,"Originally based on the classic story, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" written by James Thurber in 1939. Director and lead actor Ben Stiller plays the role of a day-dreamer Walter Mitty who escapes his boring life by disappearing into his world of imagination, where he is capable of doing heroic work. But in real life he sees himself incapable and not qualified to do so. All this changes when he finds himself in a complicated situation where he seems to have lost the cover photo of Life Magazine and the only way out is to find Sean O'Connell, the lead photographer of the 'Life Magazine'. Then he gathers all his courage to go on the journey he has only dreamed of.The movie is one of the feel good stories and tells viewers to live life rather than just dreaming. With a serious message ""Stop dreaming, Start living"" it urges the viewers to fulfill their dreams. It is quite inspirational and catchy. With an ordinary man dreaming to be something but struggling to achieve that and in the end finding his courage to live his dream, it truly is a common man's story. The scenes captured in the film truly deserve a special mention. Skate-boarding in Iceland and climbing the Himalayas are very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles. Though written in late 40's, it distinguishes itself from modern movies.Ben Stiller is perfect to play Walter Mitty. Against most of his humorous movies he has done, this one has serious message but also succeeded to introduce some light and well placed funny moments. Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Melhoff, the lead actress and with stunning cinematography the movie is overall good. Overall, story is well written with very good screenplay. The cast is well chosen and apt for the roles.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cinematography,"Cinematography in this movie is some of the best I've seen, and for me that's what makes it a ten. After watching it multiple times I've grown to appreciate its beautiful backdrops that really show the viewer how stunning nature truly is, and the soundtrack complements the movies feel good and hopeful nature which makes me personally want to go out and explore the world.The movie also shows that it is never too late to take that leap of faith and jump into what makes you happy, to chase that childhood dream to make it a reality making this truly a great movie to watch.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty to me is overlooked as, 'beautiful things don't ask for attention'.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underrated,"One of those slow burner films that has a lovely 'feel' to it created by the director. Or at least for me anyway. I'd liken it in some ways to Up in the Air in that the way it's shot creates a sense of detachment from 'the real world.' In Walter Mitty no doubt to allow the viewer to experience a dream like distance from reality and with Up in the Air that fake never never world of constant transit and never feeling 'grounded' in a fixed reality. Both do this in similar ways through colour palette, sharp focus on foreground only and eliminations / blurring of background and external noise.Anyway regardless of all that guff it's a lovely film, with a sweet whimsical love story underpinning it all and Wiig and Stiller are absolutely superb as the main characters. Special mention to Adam Scott as the external resource auditor guy. Lovely cameo.In summary block out a couple of hours, get in a decent headspace and you won't be disappointed. The perfect at home movie but one that probably didn't translate to the larger screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Daydreaming and living,"In a previous entry, I remember writing about the Oscars and how dramas tend to be the winners, almost like an amendment. The fact that such a film is not even nominated is quite sad. This is a statement of what Hollywood considers to be worth awarding. Drama? Yes. Comedy? No way. This is a loose remake of the same film directed by Norman Z. Mcleod in 1947, and an instant classic I reckon.Walter Mitty is a honest, simple man, and yes...a bit dull. He has a good job in the Life magazine, follows a routine of hard work and little or no fun at all, and no social life whatsoever. But you know how things work, most times it's all or nothing: suddenly a new girl starts to work in his company, a company that is about to be closed, and he accidentally loses the cover photo for that last issue.That's the a new life for Walter, just another one, so to speak...This project was associated to some top-notch stars of the industry: Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard behind the camera, and Will Ferrell or Owen Wilson as stars. Finally, it was Stiller who did helm it. Known as a brilliant comedian, Stiller is also a good director (Tropic Thunder, 2008 is just epic). He leads this story about daydreaming, living and not being paralyzed by fear; when you face the unknown, and dare to do the impossible, you just realize that in almost every case, impossible is just a word. it might take a lifetime to come to that conclusion, or it might never comes.I remember that after watching it, I felt so alive, so happy. Because drama and misery cannot be the only leitmotif in filmmaking. Sometimes the way you face life is great enough to be the plot of a beautiful and touching story. This one is, and I insist that these kinds of movies are more and more rare nowadays. So watch it, enjoy it and live, not because you only live once, but because there is only one life to live. Trust me, it's not the same meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"There's a little Walter Mitty in is all. This film was very heartwarming and fun and don't listen to the ""experts"" or critics on this one !!","There's a little Mitty in us all !!! Review!I don't think many people understood this film and for that reason said it was horrible and not to see it. Well what I have to say to them is ""Stupid""!!! . Walter is a regular guy that is like most people in the way he is an intelligent and a day dreamer. He ""zones out"" like all people at sometime or another do about adventures and a woman who he thinks is to far out of reach of his ""normal"" life . This film shows you that you can have an adventure and that you can push yourself beyond what you think is or is not inside of you. For all the dreamers out there who think that only day dreaming is the way of attaining something that in your heart you know that you, yourself can do. This being Ben Stillers first shot behind the lens (I believe) is a beautiful and misunderstood movie. It has a lot of dry humor and is a love story as much as an adventure story. The acting is great and the cinematography is beautiful in all the special places Walter visits and has his adventures in. I thought it was a heart warming and very fun movie which deserved better than the ""experts"" make you believe. Like I said ""Everyone has a little Walter Mitty inside them whether they think so or not"" and I believe that. I very much identified with this film and connected with it on a personal level. I gave it my own 8/10 for this reason and think it was a ""Wonderful"" film by a super talented actor in Stiller !!. That's my little review of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" .

His facial expressions, voice, and even his stature make character Walter Mitty feel like a real person and one we can relate to; a man afraid of living and taking chances. This is one of those films where you love to see an actor like Stiller, rather than a Brad Pitt. This film is visually beautiful and strange at times. It's quirky with some very odd scenes and characters throughout. This one didn't feel like a big Hollywood production to me. No nudity, no cussing, no crudeness, and no drinking/drug use; just a solid film with good acting, beautiful scenery, and a great and meaningful ending. Loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everyone will take something different from this extraordinary adventure,"I thought this was a great movie. Its uplifting, interesting and has an often relatable story filled with beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack. Its not the usual comedy you'd expect from Ben Stiller although there are still moments where he shines through but this maintains a more calm sense of humour throughout.Walter Mitty works for Life magazine in the negative assets sector. He lives a tedious and safe life, and spends much of his time lost in elaborate daydreams, filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job becomes threatened, Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey in order to obtain a photo negative from the mysterious and elusive independent photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that the magazine needs for its final issue.There are a lot of messages in this film, I would even say the whole premise is open to interpretation. Does he really travel to Greenland and Iceland? Battle sharks? Escape a volcanic eruption? Climb mountains? Excel at skateboarding -loved that scene- or is the entire movie just another one of his elaborate fantasies? I love movies that create dialogue or make you think and everyone will take something different from this extraordinary adventure. It's open for translation which is another reason I think this is such a great movie. I would definitely watch this one again. 3/6/16",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ben Stiller directs a new interptation of Jame's Thurbers Walter Mitty character.,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty(2013)Starring:Ben Stiller,Kristen Wiig,Patton Oswalt,Shirly Maclane,Adam Scott,Kathryn Hahn,Sean Penn,Terrance Bernie, and Adrian MartinezDirected By:Ben StillerMy ReviewI've seen both versions of this adventure with Danny Kaye and Ben Stiller who read the short story unlike me when he was younger in school. I saw both versions at the right time in my life,cause I daydream often about adventures and things going my way. When I saw the first trailer I was watching it like what the heck is this then I read what it was about and what it was based off of and that's when I thought to myself I must see this. I read a comment on YouTube when the exclusive footage went online that said ""There is a Walter Mitty in each of us, we live in a world were we work for long hard hours and don't have time or energy to go on some kind of adventure,they call it modern society but it should be called modern slavery.""In this re-imagining of Jame Thurber classic short story Ben Stiller plays daydreamer Walter Mitty who has a crush on his co-worker named Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig) and it's Life magazine's final days before it goes digital. Walter's new boss Ted(Adam Scott) is asking for the final piece of the telegram for the picture for the cover but Walter lost it. He goes on a global journey to find Sean O'Connel(Sean Penn) to see if he can help him.This film was actually a passion project of director Ben Stiller, he has been wanting to do this film for years. He does a great job of trying to pull his own performance of Walter Mitty who is another character that be considered relate-able. I saw comments on YouTube about people saying they daydream or know someone who does,I do. Kristen Wiig gives one of my favorite performances of hers cause it's out of what she use to which is comedy, like Stiller. Adam Scott was great as his mean boss Ted. Him and Stiller share one of my favorite sequences in the film. Sean Penn was cool as Sean O'Connel the photographer who sent Mitty the telegram with negative twenty-five. I am not very familiar with Kathryn Hann who plays Odessa, Walter's sister but I have seen Shirley MacLane once before I just don't remember where.The music is very important to the film it escort's its transcendent feel. While making the journey we take with Walter very real along with it's beautiful cinematography which is the best I've seen all year so far and I hope it gets nominated for that but I doubt it.This re-imagining of the short story should please fans of the story or the Danny Kaye version.. It hits the mark of film that it is Imaginative, filled with beautiful music, superb acting and cast, and makes you feel like your on a journey whether you relate to the character or not. I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An earnest and heartfelt story about self-discovery and living up to your potential,"THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY was one of many films that I was unable to see in theaters in 2013, and I was more than little worried given the rather lukewarm critical reception that it received. Thankfully, now having seen it, those fears have been assuaged. This film, while still a little overly earnest, is heartfelt and has a good message. And outside of the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies, it's also one of the few films Ben Stiller has done that's appropriate for families. The story is about Walter Mitty who, in this film version, works for Life Magazine as a negative asset manager. Basically, he keeps track of all of the photographs that come in. As the magazine is in transition to becoming online only, a famous photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a roll for use in the final print issue. In particular, one negative (#25) is to be used as the cover. However, it's missing and Walter has to track it down and find it. This serves as the springboard for Walter, a rather insular fellow who tends to zone out and daydream, to get out and make something of his life. One thing I really liked about this movie was the way in which it seamlessly blended Walter's fantasies with the real world. They offered insight into an otherwise closed-off personality (at least in the beginning), and were realized visually in a very cool way. I also enjoyed the overall visual aesthetic of the film, which had lots of wintry blues, grays and whites. The characters were satisfactorily drawn, although none of them were terribly deep, save Walter. I thought Kristin Wiig gave a nice performance, but her character was never really given much to do other than be the object of Walter's affections. On the downside, for all of the buildup to a few things which I won't spoil here, the end result is a bit underwhelming. Still, the journey to the end (and to the discoveries found there) is an interesting one. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected. It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far less than the sum of the parts,"If you look at the list of what this film includes - a strong cast, beautiful locations, spectacular fantasy scenes, and meditations on your place in the world and the pursuit of love - you would assume it was something special.But unfortunately, it isn't.Everything just feels too ""distant"". You don't get a chance to engage with Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) because as soon as you are introduced to him, he starts slipping into the daydreams that are intended to astonish the viewer but mostly just frustrate, because they disrupt the development of the story, and turn Walter into a weirdo rather than a hero. Staring absent-mindedly at female co-workers that you are trying to cyber-stalk is never a good idea.When he does begin his ""real"" adventure, it still feels like a fantasy. All the shots are of grand scenery and small people. It's not at a ""human"" scale.It's like one of those spectacular cakes they make for competitions. The finest ingredients, sculpted into amazing shapes, that doesn't tempt your appetite in the slightest. Give me a chocolate eclair any day of the week.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lovely looking movie with a great message.,"To start off with, this is not a perfect movie by any means (of course, how many are there really?). It has some issues with the length and pace in places. However with that being said, there is something here to really love without a doubt. The filming is incredibly gorgeous with visual popping from the screen. The idea behind this is also deeply endearing and often very funny. Imagining what could be with no limits of the real world. then there is the message of just living. Going out and doing instead of dreaming. This is a message that many should agree with and take on board as we all want to just do something we love. We all want to be happy with what we do and thus, you route for Ben Stiller as he puts his dreams into motion. He is very good in this film and I believe this is one of his best acting roles. I also love the score to this film and I think it is a film I could definitely see myself watching again. I really think, with all this put into consideration that all should see this. It is a fantastic movie and deserves credit for being a dazzling feel good piece. Props to Ben Stiller and his direction and I hope to see more like this",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thanks to the Producers of this film,"What I am writing is not a review and I apologize for all. I haven't seen the movie yet and upon reading a story about Casey Neistat, a film maker who was given a budget of $2500 to make a promotional video about Mitty this is what he did.Instead of making a promotional video, and with the approval of 20th Century Fox, they agreed to spend all the money to buy relief goods for the victims of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. I am a Filipino and is very thankful for the help and support of those who went out of their way and show kindness to humankind.Search Casey Neistat's Video on Youtube.

An entertaining and rejuvenating treat to eyes and mind !!,"I sat to watch the movie without any great expectations and it compelled me to write my first review.It had me hooked right from the start, throughout with its twists and turns, till the end. Its CLEAN ENTERTAINMENT (no censorship required) and I think the audience can easily connect to it.Its got a little of everything in almost absolute proportion supported by the great performance and scintillating shooting locations.I would say, maybe they didn't promote the movie well. Otherwise it would have been a great commercial hit. Go for it and you would thank me later for my recommendation!!10/10 and pretty well deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The producer should have been put in a cereals box and sold,"This movie looks like 4-5 postal cards glued together and sold at a tourists stand on a main street in some city of Europe. What is there besides the occasional nice imagery along with some catchy tracks? This movie is a text book cliché. Or is maybe that it touched many office workers trapped inside their cubicle. Let's see what these guys want the most... oh getting away from sitting in front of the computer and live some exciting life. Hollywood selling dreams since 1910. Not that dreaming isn't great, it's the selling thing that smells. Pretty close to that door sales man pitch.Besides, like said it is a poor movie, there is no story, just a Mountain Film Festival kind of a script and even then we have to wait one hour for a few nice images to show up.What now, are they going to project movies to make the cows forget they are trapped for life inside a massive farm? Wait, that may actually by a good idea.As a side note, what is up with IMDb displaying by default the best reviews of a film? I mean, doesn't that make reading reviews subjective? What if I don't know there is a menu to display the reviews in chronological order? If a movie is poor and I read on the first page only the positive reviews, do I get the right impression on the film?",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful,"I recently went and saw this on Christmas with my girlfriend, and my parents. I was excited to see a film that was wholesome for the family, but also intriguing in many aspects. As you watch the movie, you find yourself cheering for Walter Mitty as he uncovers the true meaning of what ""Life"", both his own and the magazine company he works for, is all about.The Secret Life is moving and encourages the dreamer in every person to step out and do something. It shows that any ordinary person can make extraordinary journeys and do incredible things with their life. As I walked out of the theater with my family, we all commented on how it made us want to travel, to just go somewhere, because we can. It truly makes you feel as though no matter how mundane life may be, there is always adventure lurking in the distance, you just have to be willing to find it.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an incredibly enjoyable film with some laughs in between that provides great joy and warmth to the heart. It may not be an award winner, but it makes an impact. Do yourself a favor, and treat yourself to indulging in the Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Such a wonderful movie,"This is the kind of movie we love....very unusual and an interesting story, great photography, great screenplay, great music, great cast. So many movies these days are so violent or graphic, and with terrible language. This movie was so much fun to watch, and, for a change, we left the theater smiling and happy, instead of disturbed and depressed!Ben Stiller was excellent in the title role. As he goes into his ""zones"", imagining things as he wished they would be, one is transported to exotic locales and wonderful characters. The transitions from imagination to reality are seamless. Shirley MacLaine has a fairly small part, but is her always wonderful self in her role as Walter's mother. We waited so long to go see this that we almost missed it at our theater. This is one to see on the big screen and with an audience. Our audience was of all ages, young to old, and everyone seemed to like it. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Cinematic Treasure,"This is a truly inspiring film that will have you leaving the theater in awe. The story and cinematography is no doubt Oscar worthy. Ben Stiller's character, Walter, is very charismatic and Stiller played him perfectly. Watching him grow throughout the film is probably the best part of the entire picture. The movie leaves you with that sense of satisfaction at the end that most movies seem to be lacking now a days. After watching this you're going to want to quit your day job and travel around the world. To certain people this movie might very well be life changing. I won't be one bit surprised when we see this win several rewards from the academy. A must see last minute 2013 film before the new year!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It will take your breath away,"The only reason I even considered seeing a film with a title that begins ""The Secret Life of..."" is because Ben Stiller is in it, and though he has most certainly partaken in a few bloopers he remains one of my favorite actors of our time. I figured that if the movie turned out to be a farce, I would at least have discovered a film with Ben Stiller in that I Didn't enjoy which would be a new cinematic experience for me.Now if you read just a few reviews of this movie you're going to hear the word ""scenery"" mentioned a lot. Let me just clarify by ""scenery"" I don't mean ""rolling hills of green and glistening dew drops on the golden screen"" - I.E monotonous visual CODSWALLOP that one may use to describe films like Lord of the Rings or The Sound of Music. I mean ""scenery"" in the sense of PREPARE TO HAVE A REVOLUTION IN SENSORY PERCEPTION.You are not buying a ticket to a comedy, or a drama, or by any means a movie that is any way realistic in a reasonable sense of the word. Bear that in mind.Also bear in mind the bigger the TV you can watch this on the better.Consequently this is one of the only movies that I would recommend actually paying to see in the movies. OR, if you are really cheap, wait until it becomes available on DVD, find someone with a really big TV, befriend them just long enough to watch it, and then tell them how much you actually hate them, and leave, taking your DVD with you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie I seen of Ben Stiller,"The movie trailer itself caught on to me on the very first seconds, and finally seen the movie I never imagined it would reach that benchmark. The picture, the story behind to it and most of all the one quote shown in the movie about the purpose of life will definitely reach the hearts of both young and old. This movie deserves an award when it comes to picture the pure crisp detail gone into the movie shows how much effort Ben Stiller put into the movie. The story put into the movie is very grasping and sometimes hilarious. The movie is not to be missed so be sure to check out the movie.I hope Ben Stiller or another great director makes movies like this with so much detail gone into it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dumb beyond belief,"This is one of the dumbest films of 2013.MW is a man to quote the famous philosopher, Alan Partridge, going nowhere, quite literally he's stuck on the ring road. He's shy, been stuck at the same job for 16 years, lives at home, can't attract the ladies and is incredibly awkward around people.The film starts off with him having dream like 'zoning out' visions. I thought this was the premise of the film but these are soon forgotten, did they run out of budget?Over night he becomes a dare devil adventurer, jumping out of helicopters into freezing cold water, wrestling with sharks, yep, this really happened, he wasn't zoning out.The film is so dumb that any profound attempts are simply ruined by almost impossible and unbelievable situations. Being left to climb the Himalayas without a guide, playing football at 18,000 feet, yes thats almost as high as Kilimanjaro, I've been there, and believe me, the air is so thin YOU won't be able to run around and play football. And what about his jabs? You don't just turn up to countries like Afganistan without having any, I assume as he is so boring that he hasn't had them done for previous trips to Phoenix. Any you cant take food on a plane and into another country. Dumb, dumb, stupid.The scenery is amazing at times, but the film is way to dumb to enjoy it.Oh, and when do online dating companies call you back. Never, it doesn't happen, its just a blatant piece of product placement. Shocking!This film should be called Dumb, dumb and dumber!!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Trust yourself - not the critics,"This is quite easily one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. I've been a big fan of the old Danny Kaye ""Mitty"" since a high school teacher showed it to our class during a free day in high school about 12 years ago. This is not a remake. This is a re-imagining. And it works. The movie is not boring or awkward as the critics have said. WALTER is boring and awkward- until he finds that spark adventurousness inside himself and stops living in his safe little dream world and starts living in the real world. The cast is fantastic. The chemistry is phenomenal. I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller, and it is great to see Patton Oswalt on the big screen. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot. I promise you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Walter Mitty's Life should be no  Secret - Noodles Review,"This is the movie I wanted to love the most this year. From the first trailer I saw of it so long ago, I was greatly looking forward to it. I really didn't know what to expect from it; you really don't know what the story's gonna be about until you actually see the movie. That kind of ambiguity really intrigued me. What also intrigued me was that it looked as if Ben Stiller was veering away from strictly comedy into a more serious role in this movie. It almost reminded me of Jim Carrey when he went and did Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And while Carrey was much better in that movie than Stiller is in this one, I think I enjoyed Walter Mitty's adventure more. So, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is about a guy who kind of lives a boring lifestyle, which leads him to be ultimately the biggest daydreamer in the world. He literally freezes and imagines some spectacular things going on, usually including him as a hero. And we get to see everything he imagines and how people perceive him when he zones out, all from Walter's perspective. From the trailers, these dreamlike sequences seemed really cool and I thought they'd be an awesome highlight. However, in the film, sometimes they're a bit drawn out. They do result in some cool or funny moments though. One of these is even so outrageous that some people may not like it. But it was just so ridiculous that I was laughing so hard; you'll know what I'm talking about if you see it, because it involves conversation of another film that came out in 2008. Anyway, Walter Mitty works for Life magazine as a negative asset processor. He gets all the negative slips of film and process them so they can be photos in the magazine. And this time the one photo that they have to use for the cover is missing, so Walter decides to track down the photographer so he can get ahold of the picture. From there, his real adventure starts and this movie greatly picks up. He starts to go into his fantasies a lot less since his actual life is becoming so lively and epic.This is testament to the directing of the film, which is done by Ben Stiller himself. I was really amazed with so many shots in this movie. The cinematography sometimes has such a large and epic scale, and then other times it has a really interesting and visually artful take. Some scenes really even gave me goosebumps because I really felt so sucked in and moved by some of the shots and sequences in this film. His acting isn't bad either because he plays a convincing Walter Mitty. He's hardworking and determined but also a bit quirky and awkward. Kristen Wiig's character, Walter's love interest, was also played well; I think this is the best she's ever been since it's the first time she wasn't playing an outrageously absurd character, and instead a desirable and somehow inspiring woman. The strongest role in the movie, however, is the small amount of time that Sean Penn is on screen. He plays the photographer that Walter is tracking down, and he's really in this character; he's so interesting and laid back, really encapsulating the presence of a photographer. Then, of course, there's the downsides. There are a few corny characters in this movie. Adam Scott, whom I know as the jerk older brother from Step-Brothers, plays an incredibly cartoony character in this movie. It's made in such a way that he's such an unrealistically mean a$$hole. I understand that he's supposed to be an antagonist but he really didn't fit. As with a couple other characters, like Walter's weird sister or Adam Scott's bearded friends who just act like henchmen. This sort of disrupted the tone of the film as well.A major gripe of this movie is its tonal inconsistency, since the tone was all over the place for the first third of this movie. It sort of got out of it. The daydreams, even, kind of come out of nowhere and most of the time don't have time to get you connected to them. Just as well, the movie has some very clichéd moments, and the movie overall has a lot of very predictable elements. As a result, the writing of the film isn't very strong. Even some comedic moments are hindered by this. But even so, the film does have a large share of funny scenes, whether they're subtle or laugh-out-loud. What I came to see this movie for wasn't the comedy, though; I came for an inspiring feel-good tale. And from the moment Walter makes his decision to go to Greenland, that's what we get. The location shooting is absolutely breathtaking and the transitions in this movie from scene to scene are even cool in their own way. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is probably the most visually stunning film of 2013 and the epic cinematography gives it such an ambitious feel. The real thing to this movie is Walter finding himself, and actually living life, and I can't tell you enough how satisfying that actually is to see. This movie polarizes critics and viewers as some can love it, some can hate it, and some can go straight in the middle. While I wasn't totally invested in the first act of the film due to tonal inconsistencies and some bad characters, once Walter Mitty embarks on his adventure, it becomes one of the most uplifting and awe- filled movies I've seen in a while. While it subtly disappointed me, it still impressed me",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No Spoilers ~ Heart-Warming, Fun & Thought-Provoking","In all candor, Ben Stiller's success at the box office has not been attributed to any financial contribution from our family. Possibly, you can find him near the bottom of those actors/directors that draw us to the movie house. That being said, a couple of friends insisted that I watch this film and they are generally right when knowing what films will tickle my acutely narrow funny bone, and they were right on.This movie is well written, acted, and directed all of which led to a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is no ""secret"" as to the message of this film, but the fine way in which the story draws you into a very common and ""human"" condition of living, albeit, somewhat to the extreme, is fun and poignant at times. I found as I watched this movie, that I reflected on my own life choices. I believe this is where the magic in this films resides, as it has the potential to touch the audience in a way that naturally lends itself to self-reflection, but more powerful than that, perhaps transformation.I've attempted to remain somewhat vague in my review for those who don't enjoy knowing everything about a movie/story before the watch it, but I hope that anyone that is not a Ben Stiller fan, and those that are, to expected something unexpected and outside his typical genre.This is my first review, so please don't judge too harshly. I do hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful movie,"I don't need to tell anything about the plot (of which you can read here on IMDb). But what I really want to say is that this movie is a great one: full of poetry, witty moments, fantastic landscapes, a nice soundtrack and an excellent Ben Stiller (and Sean Penn is always good). It is one of those movies that gives you something that will remain once you leave the cinema. The message is 'live with intensity, without being always scared, expecting things will fix themselves'. A very simple meaning, I know, but in this movie it was rendered very well without being cheesy or trying too hard. To me one of the best movies of 2013, no doubts about this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dull as dishwater.,"How is this movie getting so many adoring reviews? It's just an exasperating and uneventful two hour long waste of life. The title is stolen from an excellent short story that most British kids read when they're young. The film has no relationship with that story whatsoever.Nothing makes sense and the insane decisions Mitty makes defy any sense of logic. I think Ben Stiller is one of those actors that only Americans 'get'. All his movies are completely lost on me.If you like Stiller, you'll like this.

You can Bring the Kids!,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a unique film that will both entertain and inspire you. The story centres on Walter Mitty. Many were considered for the role such as Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson, Mike Myers and Sacha Baron Cohen but in the end Ben Stiller both stars and directs. He does a wonderful job bringing the down trodden Walter Mitty to life. The film focuses on Walter who stores negatives for the fictional Life Magazine. Walter is unhappy with how his life has turned out but lacks the courage to go after what he needs. Instead he turns to a world of daydreams which proves to be unsatisfying. What happens next is both wonderful and inspiring. I loved this film. Ben Stiller is believable and fun. Sean Penn is his usual charismatic self and adds some spice to the film.

Ben Stiller portrays the title character really well and it is one of his best movies. This movie, as stated in the summary is VERY relatable. In fact I don't see how anyone could not compare it to his or her life, which will disappoint some people who are looking to escape from reality.

"Dull, but for Iceland, Greenland & Sean Penn!","It wasn't an auspicious start for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in my life. With the screening due to start, the lights remained on and the screen remained black. For almost an hour. Then, when Ben Stiller's fifth feature as director finally started, the quality was so unbelievably, um, unwatchable (it appeared to have been bleached and mashed through a cheese grater), that approximately 95% of the attendees for the advanced screening walked out en masse. The hardcore ten or so remained, the film faltered, the lights came up, staff wandered aimlessly around the auditorium and finally, almost 90 minutes late, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was reborn.Was it worth the wait? Hmmm.It bears little resemblance it the 1947 original, starring Danny Kaye and adapted from James Thurber's short story, although modernization of such an old story is often essential. More distressingly, it lacks the magic and fun of the original.Walter Mitty (Stiller) is an anonymous worker cataloguing photographs at Life magazine and dreaming his dull life away; the scenarios that whizz around his brain being infinitely more exciting than his mundane reality. As Life prepares to publish its final print edition, Mitty clashes with his villainous new boss (Adam Scott), longs wistfully for the attention of co-worker, Cheryl (Kristen Whig) and looses one frame of a roll of film sent by legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), prompting Mitty to improvise quickly.It's a great idea poorly realized. There are sparkles to attract the attention (the opening titles on noticeboards etc.) and occasional, smile-inducing subtle humour. But mostly The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is dull. Predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull but with some beautiful scenery. The film reinforces my desire to visit both Iceland and Greenland and, yes, I want to experience many of the situations that Mitty finds himself in, in reality. Who wouldn't? That's where The Secret Life of Walter Mitty works.But mostly it's dull.When, at long last, Sean Penn wanders into the screen, or, rather, the camera finds him, the film blossoms. It evolves into an entirely different film of depth, joy and beauty. And when the camera has finished with him, guess what? It becomes dull. Lost, perhaps.There are a few 'action' sequences but they bubble along rather than flood, gush and hurl. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film of almosts. It almost works, it almost entertains, it almost finds a funny boneWhig does a reasonable job with a small supporting role and Stiller is a step above his Zoolander level but, scenery aside, the star worth watching is Penn.Find the DVD, fast forward to his scenes and quit once he's moved on. It won't take a genius to fill in the gaps. Like the protagonist, your imagination is almost certainly more colourful than the reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A visual pleasure with real warmth at the heart of it,"Ben Stiller makes what feels very much like a labor of love in the delightful ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" This is a visual pleasure that is also quirky and funny with real warmth at the heart of it. Days later, I recall scenes and how well they were executed, realizing that other than an awkward Benjamin Buttons parody (mostly it just doesn't fit), this film really clicks on all levels.Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a daydreamer who ""zones out"" somewhat more often than the average person, most likely due to the stagnant nature of his life as a ""negative asset manager"" for Life magazine, which sounds like a horribly dull way of saying he develops pictures that other people take. He spends his working day in the dark basement of the Life magazine building with only his employee Hector to talk to. Lately his daydreams involve a coworker that he is smitten with, played by Kristin Wiig. But his time at the magazine is running out, as the new owners push to make the transition from print to online, thereby spelling the end of many jobs at Life. Mitty is tasked with producing the last cover photo, a ""Negative 25"" from a mysterious photographer (Sean Penn) whom Mitty has been handling for years, only to find that the negative has gone missing. The effort to recover this negative is the impetus for Walter to make a journey to find him, wherever that may take him. As it turns out, that journey leads him halfway across the world to an adventure that rivals his own daydreams, which begin to abate as he gets closer to the goal of finding out the secret of ""negative 25.""TSLWM gets where it's going, offering many rewards throughout. The skateboarding in Iceland, jumping out of a helicopter into the freezing sea off the coast of Greenland, all the while talking to his Match.com representative who is trying to spice up his otherwise bland profileit's just a pleasure to follow him on this journey. There's something to be said for getting there the long way.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie for daydreamers,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty portrays daydreaming and how excessive daydreaming can become counterproductive and damaging to one's well being. Daydreamers at times use daydreaming as a coping mechanism expressing in their daydreams what they fail to accomplish in real life. The film is about rebuilding the bridge between whats actual and whats not while becoming more present. During Walters journey, the energies from his fantasies become redirected towards reality and shows in a somewhat exaggerated way, how Walter begins to live life more passionately. Experience is really the only thing that exists and the only thing that is real, everything else is fantasy. It's a great movie if you want a big change in your life. Definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Such a Pleasant Surprise,"I had very little (to no) expectations for this film based on the trailer I saw. I expected with a leading cast like Steve Carell and Kristin Wig this would be something light hearted and funny to take in. That being said, I was so pleasantly surprised by what I experienced. It was such a moving, emotional story about life. It struck all the right chords with me. The evolution of Stiller's character through the film was somewhat breathtaking to watch. I left the theatre feeling so bright and inspired by the film. That is the kind of thing one wants to experience when going to the movies. It had been a long time since I had experienced something like that.This movie was beautifully shot, well acted, and has an absolutely superb soundtrack (supplied mostly by Jose Gonsalez, solo and his band Junip) that just heightened the moments of beauty in the film perfectly. This film is a definite must see in my books.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
May not be the best but certainly is one of the most beautiful films of the last year,"Walter Mitty is the fictional character from the short story by James Thurber. It was first published in ""The New Yorker"" in 1939. Although the movie differs completely from the original story, one thing, the main character, remains relevant at all times. Walter Mitty is a person who spends more time in heroic daydreams than pays attention to the real world. In movie this is called ""zoning out"" and is characterized by the blank stares of the main character. Movie has increasing pace, constantly changing situations and people which both become more and more fancy and Mitty always deals with them in simple open-hearted dedicated manner. In these aspects this movie is very much alike ""Forrest Gump"" or Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"". In fact, this movie even equals them.In movie Walter Mitty works at ""Life"" magazine with photography negatives. His life seems to be so simple that even the suite he wears is gray. Walter has strong affections towards co-worker Cheryl Melhoff (played by Kristen Wiig) but is too shy to talk about his feelings. His everyday dull life also includes being bullied by human resources manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott). Everything begins to change in Walters life from inside out when it turns out that the ""Life"" will be publishing the last paper issue of the magazine and he receives photo negatives intended for the cover. It turns out that the important for everyone cover photo is missing. Encouraged by his muse Cheryl Melhoff he embarks on the journey of the lifetime. Soon main characters real life begins to surpass the imagined one and he ""zones out"" less and less often.Script is great and has no flows. There are completely no excess things as they usually reaper latter on in the movie having meaning and giving acceleration to the plot. Dialogues are well thought out. Acting is convincing and the cast is picked well. Most of the movie time, however, belongs to Ben Stiller and all other characters have only secondary importance. Mysterious maverick and adventure hunter Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn and Cheryl Melhoff character are the source of inspiration for Mitty and have short but effective both in timing and impact appearances. Worth of mentioning is also the annoying bearded boss Ted Hendricks who brings in mixed elements of comedy and injustice towards main character. Exceptionally well performances give all actors who play natives of Greenland, Iceland and Himalayas. Less talked about they seem to living in the scenes.Stiller as a director remains true to his comedian style and enriches this drama with comedy elements. This makes the movie easier to watch. The most exceptional aspect of the film is its cinematography. Landscapes, lightning in the scenes, takes and the storyboard are nearly perfect. Some exceptional scenes like football match in Himalayas are unforgettable. This movie certainly deserves Academy Award in the category of Cinematography. In addition to this, music and sound editing add warmth and comfort to overall experience of being in the search of adventure.In summary, this relaxing and heart-warming film leaves the feel that it is not about people but for the people. It has several many times heard before but rarely showed so breathtakingly important messages. Human imagination is a powerful tool which should not be quenched in everyday life as it determines not only how you feel but what you may tend to do in the future, joy in life lies in small things which we rarely see and etc. The secret 25th frame of Sean O'Connell film tells that the purpose of life may be the search in the meaning of life itself and that those who dare to seek it would feel very essence of living. The movie has the feel of freedom and relaxes audience. The best and the deepest work of Ben Stiller. Also, underrated which makes it a personal pleasant discovery for the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life is an adventure of your dreams,"Ben Stiller stars and directs The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Its based on a shirt story with Stiller playing a mild mannered negative processor for Life magazine who tends to space out as he lapses into daydreams. He dreams of adventure as his real life is so mundane.When Life magazine is shutting down he cannot find a negative for the final issue from ace adventurer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn.) A jerk of an executive brought in for the final days of Life magazine makes fun of him as he strives to find the negative.In search for the lost negative he travels the world to Greenland, Iceland, Himalayas. He escapes from a Volcano, plays soccer with kids in Afghanistan and views a snow leopard. As his adventure increases his confidence grows and the daydreams lessen.The film kind of starts out slow, we have those heroic daydreams, we see that Mitty is a kind of dullard. Nice guy but a bit of a loser. Yet he seemed to be an interesting teenager, he used to skate. Wait he can skate, that surely would be a plot point later in the film!The film is rather jagged, Once it gets going it does flow well at the latter part of the movie. The location shooting in the Nordic countries help. You can kind of predict the ending. There are a few good cameos with Sean Penn standing out in his few scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

10/10,"If someone wants to find a meaning in life just watch this.I teared up a lot watching this film, also having goosebumps at times because everyone is searching for something in their lives and Walter Mitty starts to live the life he imagines and ends up where he's always destined to be.For me, it's right up there with Amélie",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Adventurous, Brave, Creative!","Those three adjectives can be heard throughout the film multiple times, but it's also how I would describe Director Ben Stiller. The cinematography of this movie alone should have won multiple academy awards. The beauty of it is unmatched to any other movie I've ever seen. I am extremely disappointed by some of the critics scores regarding this film. Ben stiller is a revelation as both actor and director. This film takes you from New York City to Iceland to the Himalayas, sprinkled with amazing visual effects and scenery. It's one of those rare films you watch and days later you are still thinking about it. I can imagine many people being able to overcome something in their life by watching this film. My favorite Movie of the decade.The original score for this film is definitely worth listening to, especially the main songs ""Stay Alive"" and ""Step Out"".""Beautiful things don't ask for attention.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Majority of Review Hit the Mark, Excellent Film","Certainly Stiller's best ever. Fans who came to see comedy obviously didn't read/view descriptions of the film before coming to see it. Yes, there is comedy, but it is subtle. The main thrust of the film is the desire to look beyond, to push your limits, to live your life and not the one others expect of you. Walter has lived a life of expectations and duty, a respectful life of supporting his mother and sister. The re-awakening of his inner self connecting to the real world and leaving the realm of the fantasy was invigorating. Beautiful graphics with deep and poignant meaning. This is a film that will stay with me for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Show at the Box Office,"This is more of a prediction than a classic review. Regardless of performance or cleverness during very few very fleeting, transitory moments – this film will disappoint at the box office. Here is why. It will disappoint the viewer. Tell me where the uniqueness of this story is? Tell me how you saddle Kristen Wiig with a zero role, hiding her substantial talent behind a brick wall of nothingness. Why was Stiller cast instead of, for example, Steve Carell, who would have knocked it out of the park, even with this severely flawed role. A script that does not know what it is. A remake that does nothing to move the celebration of the original James Thurber work forward by one inch. It is basically a glorified ""Join the military and see the world"" one minute commercial – without the military - but with better, more expensive visual effects. WARNING: you will never get those 114 minutes back. Throw them away at your own risk.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rare Jewel,"It is hard to find good screenplays nowadays. Usually, what they want us to watch is some crap such as ""Thor"", ""Now you see me"", and ""Last Vegas"".This movie is a rare exception, it is very well written.There are some goofs which unrealistically put you away from a real life traveling experience, and I wish they would correct that. Also, there is too much exposure of eharmony and life magazine, we do not come to movies to watch corporate ads.However, overall, this movie rocks! It has great soul touching twists, great scenery of Iceland and Himalayas, extremely pleasant to watch. Hollywood, please do create more movies like this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just to feel alive again,"We always yearn to do something, but we dare not show our voices. We are afraid of outside speculation, we care about the thoughts of others, we are unable to bear the burden of life, and we often ignore the demands from our hearts. In the movie, the director has added some comedic elements. But there is no lack of sincere and enthusiastic healing power. From the perspective of ordinary workers, the movie has revealed the true meaning of life and life. Maybe everyone can find their own on the role: hesitant and cowardly, in the face of what he wants, he is not willing to give up everything that he is fighting for. The transformation of Walter has given us great courage: Whether facing life or work, we should lead our lives and dare to try and face it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well Worth The Time,"I saw the Danny Kaye movie when I was a kid. It was kind of corny and wasn't the most memorable. (I remember Boris Karloff and Virginia Mayo were in it though).I took my daughter to this movie because of the old one. I thoroughly enjoyed this one much more than its older relative. I would recommend it to anyone. I think I've seen one Ben Stiller movie a very long time ago. He was the perfect Walter Mitty. Totally believable.Beautifully filmed and it was fun. Was never bored. Nice family movie.I just found out from a friend that the professional reviewers panned it which was surprising. So much for taste. I guess they like the deep dark movies, brooding actors, complicated dialog, remakes/sequels, and loud special effects more. This movie didn't have much of that which was fine by me.Anyway, I would recommend it to anyone. Well done Ben and Kristen!! Look forward to your next movie together.

"a wonderful, inspiring fantasy drama comedy adventure","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a visually beautiful, wonderful fantasy drama comedy film that comes with a simple but essential life message that's both inspiring and make you feel good at the same time. This film is essentially about a boring, hardworking, single and lonely, middle-class daydreamer with an active imagination, who frequently 'zoned out' to undergo fantastic adventures in his mind.In this film, Stiller allows the character he portrays to shine, showing the gradual change in his character throughout the film without a differing core personality. Although the starting of the film suffers a few minor 'hiccups' due to a few abrupt, over-the-top fantasy dream adventures, the film starts to improve as Walter embarks on a life- altering adventure that manages to inspire and affect the audience without the feeling of being pretentious.Not sure why most of the professional critics dislike it so much, some even mentioning that his fantasy adventures are greater than his actual trip he embarked in the second half of the film. Although his fantasies are greatly exaggerated by the usage of modern CGI, his actual journey were nothing short of impressive as not many of us would be lucky enough to encounter such events in our travels.Perhaps the critics don't realise how hard it is to survive from a great white and very cold sea waters, cycle around the roads of Iceland, to witness the beautiful landscapes of Iceland, to daringly skateboard your way to a town, to barely escape from a volcano eruption, to encounter and barter with the warlords in ungoverned Afghanistan, to hike the mountains of Himalayas or even damn lucky enough to see a snow leopard in the wild (Snow leopards are very shy, elusive cats known for their solitary nature, are rarely seen in the wild.Total estimated population could be 4000-7000).The film also reminds us of the current problem of our generation, the obsession of taking great photographs. Yes, photographs are important. It lets us reminisce the good old memories of the past. But, don't forget to live the moment as well as they're precious and brief.Very highly recommended. This is a fun film with a whole-hearted simple story. Try to put your cynicism aside and just enjoy it, let Walter 'take' you into his fantastical journey. You'll not be disappointed.Rating: 8.5/10""Don't work too hard in life, live it. Don't just dream too much about doing something, do it. Don't just obsessing over taking photos for every great moment in your life, learn to live these precious moments as well.""""Life is about courage and going into the unknown""""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind wall, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.""http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/12/movie-review-secret-of-walter- mitty.html",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"What a Great Movie, Ben Stiller made a masterpiece!","I just saw one of the most brilliant movies by Ben Stiller. Its called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Although some may have different opinions about the film, it was fantastic. The beauty of the film was about a man who struggles with self assurance and opening his eyes and mind to the possibilities of finding who he really is within. With a little romance and a little comedy, the film is something you can take home with you in your heart that says, I can be more than what the world says I am, and I am not afraid to take risks that open my eyes to who I could be. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys being inspired to explore yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

NO WORDS........,"I have daydreaming issues. No other film had portrayed it with this accuracy. I saw a part of myself in Walter Mitty. Don't know why many people disliked this movie. It's probably because of the daydreaming part, which looked so artificial. But that's the reality. I've had similar dreams like the late night talk show one, dreams based on film scenes, intense action scene and all. That's exactly what my daydreams look like. They were so relatable. This film is so motivating. No one should miss it",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually stunning boring mess,"I loved into the wild movie and the book and I have watched it more than 10 times and it's one of the best movies I've ever watched! So, I was looking for recommendations of movies related to that one, maybe the high expectations or maybe I was just looking for something else from the movie but it is extremely boring without really a strong storyline it feels forced. It seems like for someone who also like to day dream and is stuck in a dead end job but would love to just travel around but is too scared and not really for someone who love nature and find peace in it- like in into the wild.The only good thing about the movie is cinematography. The locations, landscapes, shots are all beautiful but seems like a travel show than a movie. I'll never recommend it to someone who loves into the wild.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fanstastic Movie,"This is a brilliant movie. The first half of it is a little fanciful. However, in retrospect, it can be seen as some artistic licence used in the process of setting up the title character.The remainder of the movie is absolutely stunning. Coming from a music background, I see this as a true work of emotion. Stiller's true feelings shine through on this piece.Just like with silly pop songs or outrageous heavy metal, the content or structure of this movie isn't so much what makes the song as the emotion behind it. Having said that, there is nothing to fault with this film. It is extremely well made and executed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An attempt to be complex turns out very simple,"I really wasn't sure what to expect when the decision arose to watch this movie. I went into it hoping that the writing would be thought provoking enough to allow for more enjoyment than what I had only seen in the trailers. Not so. The story had interesting undertones to it, but the main story just kind of led you to believe it might get interesting at some point. Not so. I think the struggle was to try and decide whether or not that it was going to be more comedy than drama or vice versa. Therefore the scenes where comedy was attempted, just were not that funny. The best part of the movie was the cameo appearances, and even those were obviously influenced by who knows who, and not the quality of the script. The direction jumped around too much, and often without necessary relevance. The ending kind of made you say, ""Huh?"" However, ultimately, it really doesn't push any boundaries of imagination, thought, or even production quality.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film!,"Think this film is also good, but lost a little surprise. I think too it was revealed that the trailer of the film will happen. Tonight saw two films, in fact, the first one looks more ridiculous, but I feel pretty good, because the unsolved more interesting, but also because the story is true.Simply put, had a dream about but never had the people to practice, how to really walk into their dreams. This movie has a nice buckle ""Stop Dreaming, Start Living"" (stop daydreaming and start to experience life!). Even if we are in a dream fanciful to think of myself very great, very great, but in the eyes of others, we are just a ridiculous daydreams king.And when we come out of that step, I began to experience, the situation changed. Others daydream, we see in the world, is the sight of the facts. Travelers out of the house, is because it was remarkable. Note that I say here, is to travel rather than tourism.

Brilliant Movie,"You should realize before watching this movie that there will be parts where the traditional ""real world"" laws of physics will not apply. And do you know why? It's because it's a movie. People fail to realize that normal laws of nature do not apply to movies, especially movies like this.This movie is absolutely brilliant. Ben Stiller did a great job in directing this movie. His quick transitions between daydreams and real life work fantastically. I love movies where the setting is an intricate personality of the film. Midnight in Paris showcased Paris brilliantly, Collateral did the same for Los Angeles, and The Way did a fantastic job with Spain. This movie portrays the beauty of Iceland so vividly. Sean Penn's acting was superb.If you enjoy watching a movie with a good story and awesome cinematography, do yourself and watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very Impressive and Unexpected Work from Ben Stiller,","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a brilliant movie with a fantastic plot that is packed with adventure, some very sweet moments and an overall great message. I really expected this movie to be a total comedy since Ben Stiller was in the main role, and although there are many funny scenes, it is actually very dramatic and probably Stiller's most impressive performance to date. He also directed the film, which did not seem like an easy task, and did a stellar job at that.I did find the film lacking in character development for Walter Mitty, we do not learn very much about him prior to beginning his adventure. It is made well established that he works in the media and feels he has not lived an interesting life, but we do not get to really know anything about this life before the plot kicks in, which made it a little less engaging as a story.Kristen Wiig and Adam Scott also did a great job and suited their characters very well. The film has a warm message throughout about living your life the way you want to live it, embodying this message and never getting sidetracked away from it, I found it quite inspiring.It balances out comedy and adventure quite nicely in a way that neither end up feeling overdone. Funny and sweet, I would recommend The Secret Life of Walter Mitty to anyone looking for a good comedy drama.A man heads off on a global adventure that he has always dreamed of in order to save his career.Best Performance: Ben Stiller",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Likable ""Zoning Out""","Nice looks: both Life Magazine and the adventures to Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan. Ben Stiller is likable as ever, and a good match for the character of Walter Mitty. Sweet performance by Kristen Wiig. Perfect cameo by Sean Penn. Solid comedic performance by Patton Oswald. Nice plot development: Walter gives up his fantasies for reality; Walter's outer quest changes him inwardly. Pleasant romantic comedy thread. Other minor performances, including Shirley Maclaine, Jon Daly, Kathryn Hahn and Adrian Martinez, good enough. I did a search for the last Life magazine cover: there was a weekly (1972) and a monthly (2000). The movie does a better look, for Life.

Non-Spoiler review,"I wrote this while waiting for the bus after the screening, so its kinda rough. Hope you enjoy!Walter Mitty is the kind of film that brings out the hero in us, or more precisely the adventurer in us. Walter Mitty is a shy guy who daydreams a lot, like most people, and has a crush on the pretty, quirky girl and lets his new boss bully him around. At least until one of the photo negatives hes in charge of, for the first time in the last 16 years of his job, winds up missing. So Walter, breaks out of his shell and leaves his comfort zone, to travel across the world to find his friend, the photographer, who took the picture.Its great to see Ben Stiller in a more mature drama role that still has great comedic timing by all performers. I was almost worried that we wouldn't get a complete resolution to the film but by the time the credits rolled, everything is as it should be.Simply put, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, is about the daydreamer in us all and changing the reality around us and creating the best life for ourself in the real world.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a way to Destroy a Classic,"Let me start by saying I was excited when I heard there would be a remake of one of my all time favorites. If you have not seen the original, might I suggest you do. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a movie about a quiet and pushover man who daydreams throughout most of his day. Depending on the book or original movie, the nagging female in his life is either his mother or wife. I was kind in giving this movie 2 stars. To say it was a let down would be the understatement of the the decade. For me this version destroyed the innocence of it all, not to mention had less of a full movie plot than the original movie.

This movie made me fell like i was a lot younger again and with the spirit full of hopes and dreams. You will have a wonderful Sunday going to the movies to see Ben Stiller in one of his most philosofical movies he ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Stop dreaming, start living""","The only thing that I can say now is that I fell in love with this romantic Walter Mitty. When for the first time I watched the footage of this movie at CinemaCon last year, I thought that it would be a boring and not making any sense motion picture. Honestly, I even didn't have any desire and intention to go and watch the whole movie. But when the release date was getting closer, there were a lot of ads dedicated to it, many people talked about it and, finally, I changed my mind and decided to spend some of my time on this movie. And now I admit this film is incredibly amazing! Walter Mitty is so real and familiar to everyone because, I am sure about that, deep inside we all are Walter Mittys. This movie appeals to all people and personally to everyone at the same time. I guess everyone knows this situation when being children we dream about big, full of events and crazy adventures life, but when we get older, we forget about our dreams and desires, we turn into dull and boring adults who lose their interest for the life. But Walter Mitty, this shy and romantic guy, finally finds courage and breaks out of his gloomy routine and starts living the life he always wanted to live. When you watch this movie, you understand that no matter who you are and where you come from, what really matters is your dreams, your desire to live how you want to and not how others dictate you to live. The problem is that we lack this inner courage and confidence in making first step. And Walter shows us that once you do that, your life change completely. I guess this movie is both inspirational and motivational at the same time. Another aspect I would like to point out is Ben Stiller's work as a director and main character. He dealt excellently with both tasks. The way the film is done is incredible. Sometimes you really lose the touch with the reality, because you can barely distinguish where it is reality and where it is just pure imagination. Moreover, this movie is worth of watching simply because of the unbelievable landscapes. They are really beautiful. All this together make The secret life of Walter Mitty a breathtaking adventure that you live along with the main character and at the same time you feel that this is your story as well. I recommend this movie to everyone. I am sure you will also like Walter Mitty. He will prove you it is never too late to live the life you always wanted to live.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Life affirming Film,"After seeing the first trailer for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (SLWM) I immediately thought this looks great and after watching the film I was not disappointed. Ben Stiller has created a perfect film which personally I believe is a film for the ages. The film is as good as my other faviourate film Little Miss Sunshine.The film is very inspiring and it makes you want to go out and Experience the world. The Life magazine motto shown in the film sums up the message of the film well ""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer,to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."" Brilliant film, highly recommended for all!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
