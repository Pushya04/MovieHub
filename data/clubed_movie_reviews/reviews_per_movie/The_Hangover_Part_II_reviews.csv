Re-hashing of Old Material,"I was really optimistic going into the theatre, I didn't expect it to as great as the original, but I thought it would still be good movie. But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It' Happened Again ... And Again,"Greetings again from the darkness. Two years ago, director Todd Phillips presented a highly creative, hilarious, raunchy, unique film comedy called The Hangover. And now, he does it again. He presents that SAME film again. I am unsure whether this is a sequel or remake. The only substantial change is the setting ... Bangkok instead of Vegas.Now I fully understand WHY most sequels follow the formula created by the successful original film. Filmmakers want to keep their audience satisfied. If it worked once, it will work again. Especially when the first film grosses a half-billion dollars! So the chances are very good that if you liked the first one, you will also enjoy this one. But for me, I get excited for creative filmmakers ... not re-treads.The key characters are all back and played by the same guys: Bradley Cooper (Phil), Ed Helms (Stu), Zach Galifianakis (Alan), Justin Bartha (Doug), and Ken Leong (Mr. Chow). All of these guys have worked constantly since the first film, but it makes perfect sense to return to the scene that put them on the Hollywood map.This time around, Stu (Ed Helms) draws the long straw and has the storyline based on his pending marriage to Jamie Chung (Sucker Punch). Stu's ""wolfpack"" buddies agree to a one-beer bonfire beach bachelor party, but of course, something goes very wrong. The next morning finds our boys staggering to regain consciousness in a sleazy Bangkok hotel with no recollection of the previous night's events. The only clues are a monkey, a severed finger, a facial tat and international criminal Mr. Chow.No need for me to go into any details or spoil any moments. You know the drill if you have seen the first. What follows is nearly two hours of debauchery and moments of varying levels of discomfort, gross-out and comedic skits.Supporting work is provided by Paul Giamatti, Jeffrey Tambor, and Mason Lee (Ang Lee's son). There is also a cameo by Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. This role was originally meant for Mel Gibson, and later Liam Neeson. Cast and crew protests kept Gibson out and Neeson's scenes were cut when re-shoots were necessary.I feel tricked by Mr. Phillips. The first Hangover had me excited that a new comedic genius had entered Hollywood and would quickly blow away the Judd Apatow recycle jobs and copycats. Instead, we get Todd Phillips copying Todd Phillips.This is certainly an above-average comedy and there are plenty of laughs from the characters we kind of feel like we know - though, wish we didn't. Just know going in that are witnessing a clear attempt at cashing in, not a desire to wow.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A raunchy, funny roller coaster you've already ridden before","Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.Is the movie still funny? Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fiancée's father. During a night of drinking with the ""Wolfpack"" (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fiancée's brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don't remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City.Hangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didn't deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesn't help that Galifianakis doesn't have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples.Todd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of R-rated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire three-act structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him.Bottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the original---except it's in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangover's appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know it's coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter.diac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They're baaack...,"I enjoyed part I quite a lot and so I was looking forward to seeing part II, and it didn't disappoint me. It was actually quite a surprise, as I found part II to be better than part I.Why? Well the story for starters, it was more clever and it had more adrenalin rush to it. There was always something really strange going on and the guys were chin-deep in trouble. I was laughing a lot through out the movie, and had my toes curling as well because of the awkwardness of some of the scenes.And having the story set in hectic Bangkok was brilliant, because it really spiced up the movie quite a lot. However, I would personally have liked to see more of the seedy places that exist in Bangkok. There was too much focus on the rich and glamorous places. Not saying that they didn't use the seedy places, far from it, but they could have used it more, as Bangkok is well-known for them.Bradley Cooper (playing Phil), Ed Helms (playing Stu) and Zach Galifianakis (playing Alan) really have great chemistry and together they really carry the movie with excellence. Each of them make the other stand out and support the comedy of one another. They are so well-cast for these movies. And I must admit that this was the best part I have ever seen Ken Jeong (playing Mr. Chow) portray. His quirky blunt manner was so amazing in this movie.Be prepared for an adventure like none other. An adventure with amnesia, drug-muling monkey and lots of fun. ""The Hangover II"" is a great comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unfortunately Predictable Relying On Same Gags,"What made The Hangover fun and entertaining unfortunately leads to predicatability in The Hangover II. The only reason I got any enjoyment out of this movie at all was because I liked the characters in the first movie. I wish they had tried to do something fresh with the story and the characters, but it was the same old gags.When I first saw the original Hangover, I thought the movie might become a classic comedy. But honestly after watching it a few times, it seems less funny where as many comedies you pick up on small things on multiple viewings that make the movie even funnier. With the Hangover, the element of surprise is lost the next time around and the story loses its appeal.So taking what I just said into account, if you've watched the first movie multiple times and then have expectations that the second movie will be a fun adventure with fun surprises around the corner, you will be somewhat disappointed. The writers even wrote in another animal with the Monkey (Tiger first film) and baby with the old Monk (baby first film). The gags just didn't seem quite as funny the second time around.There was a lot of hype leading to the release of this movie. In fact, right after the first film was released rumors that a second was on the way already surfaced. Really a disappointing film of what might have become a pretty fun movie franchise. Rating 6 of 10 and this is being nice because like I said, I got some enjoyment out of the film simply because seeing some of the same characters from the first movie was nostalgic.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but don't expect the original","Remember that one movie that came out in 2009 called The Hangover? Of course you do. It was only one of the most talked about films of the summer, surprising everyone as one of the funniest comedies in a long time. Two years later it was only fitting that a sequel be made so that we could relive the original Hangover fervor and kick off summer 2011 with a bang. Well, the basic rule of thumb for a sequel is that it either a) needs to be a continuation of the story from the first film or b) tell a new story with the same characters. The Hangover Part II decided to invent their own option c) which is to tell the exact same story all over again, but just changing a few details.And that is what The Hangover Part II is. This time Stu, Alan, and Phil are in Bangkok, Thailand for Stu's wedding. The wolfpack reunites for another awesome bachelor party, this time brining along Stu's sixteen year old brother-in-law, Teddy. Stu promises only one beer and then he is calling it a night, but of course that isn't what happened or this wouldn't be The Hangover Part II. Nope. Once again a crazy night ensues and the boys wake up the next morning with absolutely no recollection of what happened the night before. They only have small clues to go off of, but they have no choice but to use these clues in order to find Teddy, who has gone missing. From here things play out much like they did in the first film with the same elements as the original. Instead of a tiger we have a monkey. Instead of a baby we have a monk. Instead of a regular Las Vegas hooker we have, well... I won't spoil that.I, like so many others, loved The Hangover. I was happily surprised by how funny and just how well made it was for a film that looked like it would be another silly comedy movie. Of course it was that but it had something great about the raunchiness of the jokes and the cleverness of the mystery story that unfolds. The Hangover Part II doesn't quite have that and it only seems to try as hard as possible to outmatch its predecessor. It is this excessive one-upping of the first film that also drags down the films story. For one, it is just the same story all over again, but I can get past that because it worked in the first film. I won't say it wasn't annoying seeing so much of the same things happen all over again, but I'll get over it.I was disappointed though because I loved the mystery aspect of the first film. The process of finding out where Doug was in the first film coupled with the incredibly entertaining humor was done just right. The Hangover Part II just tries so hard to go even further over-the-top that the mystery aspect here falls flat. It isn't nearly as interesting, thus the thing that made The Hangover more than just another comedy is lost in The Hangover Part II. The film does everything in its ability to be raunchier and more over-the-top than the first film, affecting all aspects. The obviousness of this effort actually ends up being distracting and it just reminds me why sequels too often suck, especially comedy sequels.But The Hangover Part II doesn't suck. It definitely hasn't lost all of the magic that was there in the first film. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms obviously love these characters and you can see it come through in their performances. The hilarious trifecta are just as great in this film as they were in the first, and I never thought for a second that they were losing touch with their characters in the film's attempts to one-up the original. And honestly, this film really is funny. I laughed hysterically at plenty of moments throughout the film and there is never a dull moment. Each moment just gets raunchier and and more insane, keeping you laughing from start to finish. The comedy in this film isn't as clever as the first film, and it really sort of boils down to fart, poop, and dick jokes, but I love the characters of this film too much to not be entertained by that.I won't say that I wasn't thoroughly entertained for the 102 minutes this film ran. I still think Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest human beings currently on this planet and I think Todd Phillips still knows how to make a funny movie. But The Hangover Part II certainly doesn't live up to the hype and it doesn't even come close to the first film. As much as I laughed during this film I really just can't think of it as much more than just another comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Gang is back, crazier than the first","The gang is back. This time Stu is getting married to Lauren in Thailand. After a quiet night, Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a seedy apartment in Bangkok. Doug is back at the resort, but Lauren's brother Teddy is missing. There's a monkey with a severed finger, Alan's head is shaved, Stu has a tattoo on his face, and they can't remember any of it. And Mr Chow is back.This is just like the first one, except this one is crazier and in Bankok. Everything is bigger. Alan is crazier. Mr Chow is more ridiculous. The humor is cruder. It's essentially repeating the same story and some dismiss it for that. I personally don't.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great comedy sequel,"Whilst the plot is basically the same as it's predecessor, The Hangover Part II is still a great comedy sequel. Once again, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are all great with really good chemistry and Ken Jeong is also great. Todd Philips' direction is fantastic and it's extremely well filmed and well paced. It's consistently really funny. The soundtrack is great and the music by Christophe Beck is good.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not All Sequels Are Forgettable,"The premise of The Hangover: Part II is nearly identical to the first – the same ""wolfpack"" from the first movie, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha) and the not entirely welcome man- child, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), throw a wild, out-of-control bachelor party that results in the loss of an important character.At first blush, it seemed as though this movie, with its recycled premise and familiar characters another painfully obvious attempt to wring the last few cents out of a Hollywood cash cow. However, director Todd Phillips, easily quiets these criticisms by playfully mocking the similarities and by upping the raunchiness, insanity, and humor of the movie.Galifianakis once again steals the show as the perfectly crafted weirdo Alan, who's sporadic and bizarre interjections enliven momentary lulls in the movie. Alan's antics are further accentuated by the return of the humorous and insane criminal, Chow (Ken Jeong). Combined with new, shockingly outrageous situations, the duo keeps the laughs coming and in doing so gets the audience to forget the movie's lack of originality.Regardless of my strong recommendation, wholesome moviegoers and those who are wholeheartedly convinced that this movie is nothing but a remake should skip The Hangover: Part II because, to be honest, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It is not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch and the storyline is weak at best, but if you're willing to venture into the bowels of Bangkok for a raunchy, silly, sophomoric, and extremely amusing movie, call up your wolf pack and head to see an amusing movie you'll never forget – hopefully.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious! A worthy sequel to a comedy classic!,"After seeing The Hangover in 2009, I could not wait for Part II to be released and it was worth it. I really don't get why people are saying this movie sucks because it has the same plot. What do they expect? Of course Todd Phillips is gonna use the same formula as the original but it works with this one. I can honestly say while Phillips did take this one a step up with how crude and nasty the jokes are, it still made me fall out of my seat laughing, especially Alan's new attitude in this. To me, the only thing that would make The Hangover Part II a failure is if Alan was the one the trio ended up losing the night before. Without him, The Hangover movies would suck! Sure, we got Phil's sarcasm and the craziness of Ed Helms but Alan is the one with it all. Overall, I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It was better the first time around,"The Hangover was a surprise hit in 2009 that went on to be not only a critically acclaimed film, but also a huge box office success. The Hangover Part 2 is exactly the same movie except this one takes place in Bangkok, and isn't nearly as good or as funny as the first film.This time around Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married and they're having the wedding in Thailand, which is his future wife's home country. Coming back along with him we have bad boy Phil (Bradley Cooper), the groom from the previous movie Doug (Justin Barth), and the person who practically stole the entire first movie, Alan (Zach Galafianakis). Once in Thailand we meet a slew of new characters who really don't ever seem to matter all that much and eventually we get to the next day and where the movie turns into an exact copy of the first one.Why the writers and director thought essentially remaking the first movie would be good is beyond me. Other than they figured it would make a ton of money regardless of how they made it. But to make almost exact scenes over again is just ridiculous. The gang loses one of their own again but this time it isn't Doug, it's Stu's soon to be brother-in-law Teddy. They wake up and have no idea as to what happened the previous night and have to go on another wild adventure to try and figure out everything that happened, only this time it doesn't seem nearly as interesting.They even go as far as to bring back characters from the first movie that have no business even being in this one. Ken Jeong comes back as Mr. Chow and while he was one of the few funny characters, he really served no purpose in being there. Mike Tyson also comes back for another cameo, singing once again. Only this time it feels like it was just crammed in because he was in the last one and had a really great cameo. In this movie it's just unnecessary and makes you wish he didn't show up.Our main characters this time around aren't even as funny as they were before. Alan just seems almost too outrageous and crazy, Stu freaks out every moment of the movie and Phil is just kind of there throughout. There were about two times that I actually laughed out loud and another few times where I got some chuckles but that was pretty much it.All in all, this movie felt like it was made just to cash in on the very successful first movie and they ended up just remaking the first one only this time it wasn't nearly as good.Rating: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

That being said, the film was hilarious and a good sequel to a hard to follow first film.

There was some racism but it was funny and not especially offensive.The only thing that bugged me about the film was that after watching the first Hangover, it was a but predictable. Thank goodness they were in a foreign land to make it interesting otherwise it would have been boring to watch. Overall a must see for Hangover fans and rated R comedy fans.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Funny!,"**This contains Spoilers**I'm not going to disagree with many negative-commentors-- it DID have the same style as the original Hangover. For example, it shows a scene close to the end from the beginning, there are VERY inappropriate pictures during the end credits, and, of course, the problem- what the **** happened that night.However, it definitely was not the same as the first. It was MUCH more inappropriate than the other one. There were many scenes with breasts, penises, and I can't remember if it showed a vagina. However, that sort of made it funnier. I did like the first one a bit better, but this was great too. It was a very guilty pleasure. I can't wait for the sequel!

"The Hangover Part II (2011) - What Happens in Bangkok, Stays in Bangkok!","The second installment of the box office hit, ""The Hangover"" was not that great through the eyes of critics, but I honestly enjoyed watching these guys drunk again, even if they were too lazy to come up with new material. The film reunites the gang from the previous movie, as they all celebrate Stu's wedding in Thailand, but once again, after a long night of partying, they forget everything and they have to find the missing brother of the fiancée, and go on a little drunken scavenger hunt.....again! Now, I did laugh at this movie a lot, but I honestly felt that it was too dark. Meaning that, some of the jokes went way too far. I mean, this movie was way too raunchy, when it was supposed to be raunchy at an appropriate level. But at least I laughed a lot in this movie, but it's just that the first movie was funnier. I felt that a sequel to ""The Hangover"" is just plain pointless. If there was a sequel, it would be too predictable, because you would already know what's going to happen next. I felt that this was a completely unoriginal sequel, with such lazy writing. I bet the writers didn't know how to make a Hangover sequel, so they decided to just add the same premise from the original, and thought nobody will notice. Not smart, and not good. But, at least I laughed throughout the movie, but there were just some scenes that just went way too far! I did enjoy the characters again, there were some funny scenes, but that doesn't mean that it's a great movie overall, just a funny comedy with an unoriginal storyline. But that's all I want in a comedy, just make me laugh! I was easily entertained by the movie, and I enjoyed watching these characters again, but just watch the movie to laugh, because you just won't care about the plot!

Now if we keep in mind that this is a comedy I did not heard many people laughing out loud like in the first movie. Surely it has its moments, but most of them are already seen in the trailer.

I couldn't wait for it to end so I could do anything else.Throughout the movie, the Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms characters were distorted into such idiotic caricatures of their roles from the original that it was insulting to watch.Outside of a few funny moments and Ken Jeong's time on screen, this movie about as fun as getting a root canal.",,Anonymous,Comedy

An extreme comedy that focuses more on shock than on creativity,"This time around they are in Thailand. Like last time, they have forgotten their night out, and as Phil confesses on a cell phone call to Tracy, things are bad this time. The good news is, Doug is okay, bad news is brother-in-law Teddy is missing and their answers may have gone crashing into a glass table.Bangkok is dirtier than Las Vegas, at least in this film it is. Everything is significantly grittier, darker, and ruder. At times Zach Galifianakis' character was less like the Alan we met first time around and more like Ethan from ""Due Date"". He was still very funny as are the other guys, but there was just an air of disrespect and insolence to the whole thing.Their references to the original ""The Hangover"" were quite funny, and although I probably would have rather watched it, this was another original take with the same characters and formula that I fell in love with. I laughed not as often as I did the first time around, but I still laughed just as much as I was expecting too.The problem when Hollywood gets their hands on a good idea, is that they need to make everything bigger and bolder. The jokes are more outrageous, less witty, their adventures are more shocking, less creative, and instead of intelligent, snappy dialogue we get chase scenes and explosions. Of course we do. They got to spend more than twice as much money.Although ""The Hangover Part II"" is an inferior product to the brilliantly funny original, there are laughs and everything is more extreme as they promised.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Same mayhem, different city","Of course the premise is more or less the same. But it's not like all the jokes that were funny in the first Hangover get repeated here. It's in the same style and if you didn't like the first one (yes indeed there are quite a few who didn't enjoy the first Hangover), then you will not like this one either.Since you've seen something like this before there is however a possibility that you feel this is a letdown. It wouldn't be fair to the movie to just judge it by its predecessor. Different animal ""craziness"" can result for you to either like that or hate it (had a conversation about the new animal depicted here with another person and she didn't like it a bit).Again, don't come looking for a different plot (or something that will distinguish it completely from the first Hangover), but only come in to watch this as an enhancement, another take on the Hangover theme, if you will.

The worst movie I've seen in a long time,"I haven't written a review in a long time but felt it necessary to try and warn people about how bad this movie is. It's unfunny and most of the plot and cinematography is copy & pasted from the first picture (which I loved.) The jokes are often crude and there are only one or two strong laughs mainly coming from Galifianakis. People will like this film or pretend too, just because of the first movie, for example laugh when Alan or Phil do anything out of the ordinary, like most of the audience did at my theatre. Overall an extremely unsatisfying and at times tedious sequel to a brilliant first act, that like so many comedies before it, didn't know when to quit.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just as outrageously messed-up as the first Hangover. Let the good times roll!,"I recently caught up with Hangover II during an early press screening held in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it was by far one of the best films I've seen all year - and most definitely the best comedy. After being horribly disappointed by The Dilemma, grinned occasionally at Hall Pass and Just Go With It (but not really carried away by either), it was about time we got a decent 2011 comedy - and here it is.Plot wise, Hangover II is more of the same from what we've got in the first installment. A lot of main themes and characters from the first film return in different forms, and there are a lot of nods to the aforementioned 2009 mega-hit.However, I will say this. It seems as if the writers knew that the concept isn't as fresh as it was in the first film. So instead, they went for sheer shock value. As a result, some of the things our guys run into during their mess-up in Bangkok are so controversial; I was surprised they were even allowed to show it on screen. Prepare yourself for a lot of in-your-face humor, awkward nudity and misplaced violence.Also, the dynamics between the main protagonists were believable and hilarious. You get to learn more about the characters, and you actually feel like you really know these guys and care for them, after hanging out with them during the first film. The Bangkok location also opened up a whole new world of possibilities and mishaps for our characters to run into, and at one point things turn so crazy I just couldn't stop laughing.Oh yes, there's a plot to explain briefly. OK. So this time, it's Stu's wedding and instead of going to Vegas the whole gang winds up in Thailand. You see, after ditching his bossy girlfriend from part one, Stu ended up with this incredibly hot Asian American, and they decide to hold her wedding in her homeland. So Phil, Alan, Doug and Stu all hop on a plane across seas. The night before the ceremony, the guys decide to go out for a drink, and take the brides' young teenage brother, Teddy.The next morning, they wake up with another of their infamous hangovers. This time, they are somewhere in Bangkok, and it's not Doug that's gone – it's the adolescent Teddy. Instead of a baby, there's a monkey in the room, Stu had a Mike Tyson style tattoo, Alan's hair is shaved and somehow Mr. Chow from the first film is there.There. I won't say no more. But I promise you this – go watch this film in the right state of mind, and you'll laugh yourself silly. While not as refreshing as the first one, the Hangover II does deliver a fun, memorable time at the movies, and that's all I really wanted.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"New gags, stale treatment...","I was waiting for this film for such a long time than I care to remember; and I must say expectations ruin the experience. Movie is highly predictable and is more like a ripoff from first movie. Althiugh a sequel is supposed to be following the original movie but HO2 but franchise followers would be disappointed with the movie as it lacks any freshness in form of content or treatment. Misses wit and humor like the first one.Warning for viewers, DO NOT SKIP end credits as it answers some questions that are not addressed anywhere in the movie. End credits in the first movie were a recap of the movie and this one relies on them for winding up the story and tying-up some loose ends.All in all an average movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie is awesome.,"I think this movie is great.Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with muscle relaxants and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags! All of them got high and gone wild.They don't ever know what they doing when they woke up.And they finding his friend's brother in law who name teddy. Then they found him in the elevator because Bangkok usually blacked out. But Teddy's middle finger was cut off. The Character that i liked the most is Mr.Chow. He's the Asian guy, he's really funny and wildest one. Also I liked Alan too. He's pretty funny. I liked to recommend you watch this movie.It's a really awesome.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The uninspired sequel part 347!,"'THE HANGOVER PART II': Three Stars (Out of Five)Following the likes of 'GHOSTBUSTERS II' and 'HOME ALONE 2' this sequel is an exact carbon copy of the original with mild variations for setting and time differences. It also plays on the Deja Vu 'it's happening again' formula (used by many unimpressive sequels) for shameless and forced comedic effect (like 'HOME ALONE 2'). Stu, Phil and Allan (Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis reprising the roles that made them famous) are once again completely hungover, missing a buddy and don't have a clue how they got so 'shit faced' or what happened to them. It's once again two evenings prior to one of the three's wedding except this time they're in Thailand and it's the bride's younger brother that's missing. The film plays out almost in step by step formation to the original. Tod Phillips once again directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong (replacing the original two writers). I think the writer change-up might be one of the film's biggest problems because the movie is not only unoriginal but it's not nearly as funny as it's predecessor, with many of the jokes (as well as performances) feeling forced and weak.This time around Stu is getting married to a young Asian beauty named Lauren (Jamie Chung), who's father completely disapproves of him. At Phil and Doug's (Justin Bartha also reprising his role from the original) insistence Stu invites Alan to his wedding in Thailand at the last minute. This causes problems from the get-go when Alan is immediately intimidated by Lauren's 16 year old brother Teddy (Mason Lee), feeling that he threatens his close friendships with the others. Stu doesn't want anything to jeopardize his ideal wedding so he refuses to have a bachelor party. After agreeing to one drink on the beach with his buddies though things get crazy somehow regardless.I was a huge fan of the original film, in my opinion it's a 5 star comedy classic (out of 5 stars), so I was especially disappointed with this sequel. I really wanted to like it (like many), so I didn't completely give up on it until I finished watching it. I kept really hoping it might turn itself around but it just didn't work in my opinion. It's not just the fact that it's a lazy duplicate of the original it's the fact that it's just not nearly as funny. The actors feel like they're just going through the motions again at times. I thought Helms was really funny in the original but here he's mostly just annoying. Galifianakis is funny at times but his material also feels the most forced (most of the time). Cooper is the only one that truly stays true to his original character but he's not enough. Although the film has funny moments and reaches new realms of disgusting crudeness the writing just feels uninspired. Phillips' directing would work if the material was fitting of it. The humor has just lost all it's freshness and joy. The filmmakers rely too much on the fact that most viewers are big fans of the original so they think the jokes will work just out of familiarity. They try too hard to recapture the magic of the first film when it's way too soon for that. The nostalgia feel really could have worked for a sequel ten to twenty years later, especially with the characters (and actors) being much older and being too old to be getting blackout wasted and involved in all kinds of drunk hooligan antics. That could be a hilarious sequel and now that I think about it I really hope they do that for the third chapter. Any sequel sooner than that will most likely spell DISAPPOINTMENT once again. Comparing the film to the first movie makes me want to give it something like a two out of five star rating but I know that wouldn't be fair. It's still at least slightly better than your average slapstick comedy film, just extremely disappointing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB9HKWgqhbY",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pornish comedy with average story line.,"The sequel has more crazy and shocking scenes, very gross and crass in parts but to be fair it does make you laugh out loud.The problem however is that the director has relied more on shock value than actual content. The story is predictable and very less imaginative.The movie tries really hard to cash the success of part one. In doing so it looses the freshness of a new plot.The acting however has been good, specially the usual suspects Phil, Stu and Alan. The highpoint of the movie has been as usual the wacky- man Alan (Zach Galifianacis). This time however he is in a darker shade and less likable than before.Overall the movie is no where near the smart comedy of Hangover I. This one is just a pornish comedy with average story.

A must see.,"Hangover Part II: Film Review Hangover Part II. what a great film, yet another fantastic storyline. People doubted whether or not it could top the previous film, and if the sequel would ruin the originality of the previous film... they thought wrong. Part II is still the same idea, they all go out loose there memory etc etc, but Part II offers so much more comedy and thrill, there is more at stake this time, more too loose. It was great to see the ""wolf pack"" back together but unfortunately Doug was not in the whole drama again, he went home early, it would have been nice to see him get more involved in the film. This time they do not live the high life glamour like they did in Vegas, they were in Bangkok, there seemed to be a much darker and depressing tone in the movie, they wake up in the grotty, dirty hotel were all the power goes off, they find themselves in the slums of bangkok. the film gets much more graphic, near the beginning and throughout there are strong drug uses and strong sexual actions and nudity. I would say that this film is really a teenage humor, for 15 to 28 maybe but adults will enjoy just as much To sum up this film i would say it is a fantastic must see, its got to be comedy film of the year, its going to win loads of Oscars and just a general fun and fantastic film to watch.

Not as bad as you may think.,I really wanted to hate this movie when i went in to see it so i assumed my opinion would be biased but it turns out that i ended up actually liking it. I'm not going to tell you guy's it was better then the last one cause it wasen't in fact after i left the theater i heard many people say they could of stayed home and watched the first one twice and save 10 bucks but thats not true. While yes it does follow the same basic formula it isn't exactly a bad thing the main characters are still funny and likable and all the new people added don't hurt the movie either. so in conclusion if you want a movie that can make you laugh i really encourage this one cause the wolf pack is back.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If you expect better than the first one, you gonna be disappointed...BUT:","if you expect to be entertained, well, you gonna have fun.HangOver 1 is one of the best mature comedies I've ever seen and probably no one could have topped that or even remained on the same level. The movie is actually so much of a remake that the storyline is just put on a different location, some dialogues became rewritten and you are done.Nevertheless, ONLY if you expect the same superb movie than the first part was you will be disappointed! I personally had a few really good laughs out of it and had a good time, but I've read that some people downgraded that movie because it was not on the same level than #1.

The Hangover Part II is what you'd expect of a sequel:  not as good but not so bad either,"I just watched this sequel to The Hangover with my two brothers-in-law on Netflix disc. Like the previous one that I also saw with them (though it was the second time for me), we all laughed at much of the same places though not always. We all agreed it wasn't as good as the first one but we all enjoyed it just the same. Really, the same leads of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and especially Zack Galifianakis, had some funny lines and scenes, just not as much previously. Also, the return of Ken Jeong and a certain boxer also were some highlights but because some of the surprise was gone, not as compellingly funny.

A Sequel That Recaptures the Chaos but Lacks Originality,"""The Hangover Part II,"" directed by Todd Phillips, is the follow-up to the wildly successful 2009 comedy ""The Hangover."" While the sequel replicates the formula that made the original a hit, it struggles to capture the same freshness and comedic impact, relying heavily on the established blueprint but with diminishing returns.Set in Thailand for Stu's (Ed Helms) wedding, the film reunites the ""Wolfpack"" - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - as they once again find themselves in a post-blackout scenario, piecing together the events of a wild night. This time, the stakes are raised with the missing brother of Stu's fiancée at the center of their search.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms deliver solid performances, maintaining their characters' dynamics and adding to the film's humorous yet chaotic energy. Zach Galifianakis once again shines as Alan, bringing his unique brand of humor, though his antics feel more familiar and less impactful this time around.The decision to set the film in Thailand adds a new and exotic backdrop, providing opportunities for outrageous situations and cultural mishaps. However, the film often resorts to clichéd and stereotypical portrayals of the location and its inhabitants, which might not sit well with all audiences.The plot of ""The Hangover Part II"" closely mirrors that of the first film, which is both its strength and weakness. The familiarity of the structure provides some comedic payoff, but it also feels like a retread of the original, lacking the element of surprise and originality that made ""The Hangover"" so compelling.The humor in the sequel is more extreme and, at times, cruder than in the first film. While there are genuine laughs to be had, some of the jokes and scenarios border on the offensive, potentially alienating viewers. The film's tone is darker, and the antics more outrageous, which may appeal to fans of the first film looking for more of the same but might disappoint those seeking something new.Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow, with an expanded role that adds to the film's absurdity. His over-the-top performance is a highlight, though his character's antics can be divisive in terms of comedic taste.The film's technical aspects, including cinematography and soundtrack, are competently executed but do not particularly stand out. They serve the narrative well but do not add significantly to the film's overall quality.In conclusion, ""The Hangover Part II"" is a serviceable sequel that offers a similar blend of humor and chaos as its predecessor, but without the novelty and originality. It delivers on the expectations of the ""Hangover"" formula but does not venture beyond them, earning a 6 out of 10. For fans of the original, it provides a familiar comedic ride, but for those seeking innovation in storytelling or humor, it may fall short.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Would Mel Gibson have made it more offensive?,"If you can't take the heat don't go back into this kitchen. The Wolf pack is back more raunchy then before. There is something here to offend almost everyone.The first ""Hangover"" had a certain charm and freshness along with the raunch. The freshness is gone, the charm has wained and we are left with raunch.If you like ""Hangover"" you'll like H2 as it is the same movie in a different location. The likable characters are all back and the plot is almost identical. One change, the tiger was replaced by a drug dealing smoking monkey (who looked like the monkey in the Pirate franchise.)If dialogue containing the ""f"" word was deleted it would be a silent movie.The pictures in the camera over the end credits showed it could have been considerable more raunchy.

Phil, Stu and Alan are on the run from gangs and drug lords in the search for Teddy (Stu's Brides little brother).

Replay of the Same Jokes,"The dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms) is getting married with Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Thailand and his best friends Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) travel for the wedding. After the dinner party, Doug, Phil and Alan invite Stu to drink a beer around a bonfire on the beach with Lauren's brother Teddy (Mason Lee). Phil brings a pack of beers and marshmallows to the group.On the next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last night; their room is upside down; Teddy is missing; there is a little monkey in the room; Teddy's finger is in a glass of water; Alan's head is shaved; and Stu has a tattoo on his face.The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover Mr. Chow on the floor under the carpet. They learn that they are in Bangkok and Mr. Chow sniffs cocaine before telling what happened last night. However he dies and Phil, Stu and Alan follow a lead to begin to unravel their crazy night.""The Hangover Part II"" is a replay of the same jokes of the first film. The main difference is the location, changed from Los Angeles to Thailand, and the animal with a monkey instead of a tiger. But the rest is the same structure and similar jokes, with Stu hysterical and Alan very stupid. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Se Beber, Não Case!

That having said...yesterday I was unfortunately invited to the cinema with some friends, tickets were already ordered, so no way out.I wanted to sleep the first 90% of the movie...only the last 15 minutes brought some original jokes and got me to smile a little bit.I really became annoyed when Alan fell backwards over a table and the audience bursted into laughter...I mean COME ON, the guy just fell!

No need to fix what's not broke.,"After the release of one of the most critically and commercially successful comedies of the modern era in 2009, it would only be a matter of time before director Todd Philips and his cast would be given a second go-round. This is in the form of The Hangover: Part 2, which is less of a direct sequel, and more of an 'alternative retelling' of a night they'll never remember.The film is set some months after the events of the first film. Doug (Justin Bartha) is happily married and it is now Stu (Ed Helms) who is the groom-to-be. He opts for a traditional wedding in Thailand to appease his in-laws, but a night that starts with just one beer on the beach with friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zack Galifianakis) is a sign that the trip will be anything but smooth. Cue the following morning, when the wolfpack awakes to find, among other things, a monkey in their bathroom, a tattoo on Stu's face, a barely-alive Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong, with a much larger role this time) and the severed finger of Stu's brother-in-law, who's nowhere to be found.So now you know what I mean when I say the film is essentially a retelling of what happened in Vegas. In terms of plot only, the parallels between the two films are obvious, and when you see it in full, you'll realise just how similar they truly are. The monkey replaces the baby, Thai gangsters replace Chinese gangsters, and an unconscious Chow replaces Tyson drugged-up tiger. In fact, every major set piece in Part 2 is in some way adapted from the original. Philips makes no attempt to hide this either, going so far as to recycle the majority of Part 1's soundtrack and even shoot key scenes the exact same way.Of course, this is not a huge issue, only because anyone who walks into this film expecting something entirely different is either far too demanding, or just kidding themselves. The crew applies the same style of jokes the whole way through, and it works because, quite simply, this is a very funny movie.I know it's a cliché, but the sequel really is on a bigger scale. At times, Vegas seems like a McDonald's play area compared to the horrors encountered in the red-light district of Bangkok. Wilder scenarios result in greater consequences for the character's actions, and you can overlook the fact that some of these problems (which might leave a regular person at a complete loss) are simply glossed over in the film to make way for a steady stream of gags.But a word of warning for anyone who may have found the first film overly outlandish and inappropriate in its subject matter. Part 2 takes this hilarity in a more sinister direction, resulting in more than its fair share of uncomfortable moments, punctuated by gross-out humour and jibes at other cultures that could even be taken as racist and offensive, depending on one's individual tastes in comedy. I didn't have a problem with it, but I can see how those with a low tolerance for political incorrectness would.Finally, it was disappointing to learn that Heather Graham would not reprise her role as a genuine love interest for Stu in the sequel. Consequently, we're just supposed to accept the fact that he's gotten over his break-up, completely lost contact with Jade and moved on to someone we've never met. This makes the film appear just that little bit shallow during the First Act, but it also becomes a non-issue as soon as the focus turns from the wedding to the manhunt. If The Hangover is the most highly-regarded and respected of modern comedies, then the sequel falls a little short of being its Godfather 2. However, it's hard to harshly criticise a straight-out comedy that makes you laugh as often as this one does.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It couldn't have been better,"Having seen the first part, you must be fooling yourself if you didn't expect the sequel to be absolutely crazy and awesome. The movie offers exactly that and much more. Its plot is more or less the same as the first, the only exception being Bangkok instead of Vegas. Even though the comedy is more hardcore and below the belt, it leaves you with tears of laughter and you're jaw stuck to the floor. Some scenes were so hilarious that for a second I almost forgot that it was a sequel.It may not be as good as the first movie, but it was a pleasant relief from the drought of comedies this year. The Wolfpack was awesome as ever with Zach leading the way. No offence to anyone, but, no one plays a weirdo better than Zach.Having said all that, I didn't quite like the ending, maybe because I knew what was going to happen next. This lack of originality may be the only reason for low ratings. But then, you don't expect the sequel of a movie like Hangover to be original, do you?

A Nutshell Review: The Hangover Parr II,"So I wasn't really that impressed with the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 in Todd Phillips' The Hangover, and my verdict for Part II is, well, quite the same because... drumroll, it IS the same, with the return of familiar characters getting embroiled in the same good ol' shenanigans to draw out laughter at the absurdity of it all, crafted using the same formula which already drew in an incredible opening weekend at the box office. As the saying goes, if it ain't broken, don't fix it.And scribes Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong did just that, sticking to what worked in the first film, and transplanting the formula over to a new country, that of Thailand and more specifically, Bangkok taking over Las Vegas as this installment's sin city. Which isn't a surprise given Bangkok's rather colourful and seedier side of night life that the filmmakers had a field day to go over, ranging from open drug dealers to go go bar owners, right down to the sex workers whom we all know are well, not quite who they seem. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble indeed.The wolf pack of the first film returns, with the dentist Stu (Ed Helms) having moved on and now in a new relationship with Lauren (Jamie Chung) and are getting married in a Thai resort. Knowing just how well the previous bachelor party went, Stu is adamant for only a safe weekend brunch, but that wouldn't be a lot of fun, would it? To get there, we need to spend close to 20 minutes with the usual suspects of Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) finally convincing Stu to involve them all at his wedding overseas, and what would be a safe campfire, single drink only event involving Stu's future young brother in law Teddy (Mason Lee, son of filmmaker Ang Lee, OK?) turning out to be nothing but a bad deja vu.The trailer had set it all up already, with the all too familiar waking up routine, replacing Stu's broken tooth with a bad ass tattoo ala Mike Tyson's, Alan getting bald, Phil well, going almost shirtless to show off his torso, and the new kid on the block Teddy being all but absent, which sends the troupe into a frenzy since Alan is the favourite son of Stu's soon to be father-in- law. Instead of a tiger, we get Crystal the (in)famous monkey which had made its name in various other blockbuster franchises joining in to well, provide fellatio jokes, and would probably irk animal activists with its constant smoking of cigarettes, whether or not faked (director Todd Phillips was quite adamant that the cigarettes were not lit, and the smoke was digitally added).So formula means having the group figuring out where their last few hours had gone, having no inkling of their mad party antics which we do get to see glimpses of when they traverse across the city trying to retrace their steps and locate clues as to where Teddy might be. So we get a slew of clichés and stereotypes from characters to situational set ups, each trying really hard to make the audience laugh, with the clock ticking toward an impending wedding to happen that they must return to, intact. It may seem that all the characters here were going through the motions of groundhog day, so much so that this outing seemed a little short on surprises, with everyone being relatively muted when compared to the crazier first installment.For instance, Zach Galifiankis being the revelation of the first Hangover, has his Alan character being a little bit stale, the man-child that you've grown to hate. Ken Jeong as Mr Chow as usual was the livewire, but alas he was absent for the whole midsection before coming back into the scene. He's the other actor that made The Hangover work with his rapid fire, thickly accented English, and his second outing could have been better if not for a comparatively more self-aware performance that didn't really go for broke.Will there be a Hangover Part III? From the looks of the box office opening numbers, I don't see how the studio can pass up the opportunity. My only wish is for the formula not to be repeated for another time, because then it would be really cheap and too coincidental for the same old shenanigans to be happening to the same old folks within too close a period of time. My suggestion would be to chug a few beers beforehand with a few like minded pals who go to the movies only for crass comedies, and the alcohol and company would help to boost the enjoyment factor of The Hangover Part II.Otherwise, you'll have to sit through everything before the end credits roll with what would arguably be the best bits of the film - that all revealing photo montage that spelt out exactly what the wolf pack had been up to, making you envious at the hard partying ways they got themselves into and itching or even inspired to be part of something similar rather than having to sit through the characters' agonizing return to reality.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not As Bad As Its Reputation But Still a Letdown,"The Hangover Part II (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4)While this sequel isn't nearly as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be, there's still no question that very little effort went into the film and what we've basically got is a rehash of the first film minus all the clever moments. This time out Stu (Ed Helms) is about to be married in Bangkok so of course Phil (Bradley Cooper), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) goes along with him and sure enough they wake up one morning not knowing what happened the night before. THE HANGOVER PART II has very little imagination and it's clear that they were just cashing in on the huge success of the first film. It's really a shame that the filmmakers didn't try to come up with something fresh and original, which was what the first movie was. Instead of them coming up with anything new we're basically treated to the exact same story with many of the same plot devices in full swing. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that there's simply nothing here to be excited about. The first movie gave us a great mystery, a great set-up and we're were having fun from start to finish. None of that is true this time out as the mystery just seems watered down and in many ways you don't care what happened the night before. Many of the raunchy jokes don't work because they seem to just be going for the lazy dirty moment. With that said, there are still some very funny moments scattered throughout but there's just not enough to make the film worth sitting through. The four leads are all in fine shape and they do what they can with the material. Of the four I'd say it's Galifianakis who once again stands out from the pack but then again there's no doubt that his character was given the majority of the good moments. Paul Giamatti and Nick Cassavetes both appear in fun cameos and Ken Jeong is back as well.",,Anonymous,Comedy
had there not been a 1st it would have been brilliant,"Had there not been ""The Hangover"" in 2009 how would the audience have reacted to the ""The Hangover 2""? I presume with arms wide open. I would have loved it and I would have said that it is by far one the best fast paced comedies of its kind. However this is not the same when you are a sequel! Its always a tough challenge to any director, writer or even the actors when patching a sequel. Especially if the 1st installment was a worldwide crazy hit and was accepted into our hearts and cherished dearly for us ""The Hangover"" fans. I will write this off with my verdict for a change. I scored tickets with the greatest difficulty and managed a screening in Dubai. Whatever said and done even after a week since its premier, tickets were selling of so fast even though it was on multiple screens. I walked out very happy. I found the movie funny, I found entertaining (Apart from a few scenes that were cut off from the censorship) it was almost as good as the first. But had there not been a 1st it would have been brilliant. So for starters, if you have not yet watched it, cancel all your most valued appointments and go score some tickets and watch how the wolf pack royally screws up in beautiful Thailand!It's Stus' time for marriage this time round; seems like this guy is like a rabbit, getting a round pretty fast and loves the ladies. The Wolf pack heads on down to Thailand for the wedding and since they had all learnt their lesson in Las Vegas, everyone decided to take it easy on the whole bachelors party and settled down for one beer each. This is all the synopsis I can spare, anything more than that , you have to watch it!Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bratha & Zach Galifianakis brings down the roof with there outstanding performances. They are equally supported by Ken Jeong & Mason Lee. These few men truly bring Thailand and Bangkok and the chaos to our feet. I am so glad that none of the original cast was replaced or none of the characters were removed. It would have been better is Justin Bartha got more screen time, either way it worked. Pulling the acting off to meet the heights of the 2009 release or in my opinion even better than the 2009 these men truly are a gifted bunch with a methodical approach to the performances. Although some of the humorous moments were always with Zach's lines, the interdependency on each other reactions really worked in this movie.Todd Philips has smashed it out of the ball park again. I firmly believe moving the story to Thailand was a very wise idea. Although the storyline on its own is more of a parody than an original , the change of location really works. What I mostly dislike in sequels is when everything happens so similar to the previous that its almost predictable. Good call on the location!Seems like everything falls into place with this sequel! The Acting, writing and direction and even location!The next most important question is what will the 3rd addition be like? Yes there is going to be a 3rd addition as per the gossip in Hollywood. I hope it comes out as an original since the whole bachelor party concept has been milked out dry.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I Felt Like I Had A Hangover After This Movie,"The Hangover Part 2 begins when Phil (Bradley Cooper) is on the phone with Stu's (Ed Helms) soon to be wife that someone has gone missing and the wedding may have to be cut off. Cut back to a week earlier, and Stu is getting married to his fiancée in Thailand. They bring along her little brother Teddy who Alan (Zach Galifianakis)despises. But suddenly the boys are drinking and wakes up with a hangover only to find Teddy missing and they must go through a series of events to find him.Hold on a sec, I seem to be referring to the first movie. Wait, this is the second movie. It's the same scenario all over again. Stu's now got a tattoo on his face that looks suspiciously like Mike Tyson's (replacing his missing tooth from the first one) and Alan now has a bald head. It's the same exact formula!To be fair, there are a few funny scenes in the movie that made me laugh out loud. I actually thought that the whole movie would be a rush job devoid of any laughs. The audience I saw it with was laughing throughout the movie, with a few down times here and there. Chow even makes an appearance but his return is mostly forgettable.The first scene that made me laugh was at the toast in the beginning when Stu's soon to be father-in-law compares Stu to rice. It was actually quite funny. Then Alan makes a speech and I really thought the film would really nail it if he struck back at the father-in-law who was obviously badgering Stu in front of an audience of people. However, that did not happen. So close. There were a few other funny moments in the film, but it never seemed to quite live up to the first one. Well, maybe one part involving a monkey, a monk and a bus. The audience was rolling on that one. In fact, the monkey was the real show stealer. I'm betting he will return for the third installment.The last third of the movie, however, felt very rushed. It was like the writers struggled to really find that ending that was just phoned in for the sake of finally ending this picture. Granted, the end credits helped salvage the rush job that they did, but it wasn't enough to warrant this a worthy sequel to the highly successful Hangover film.With the third installment greenlit, let me spoil the third one for you. Bradley Cooper will be on the phone with Alan's fiancée, and the wedding will have to be called off. Flashback to sometime earlier, and we lead up to the events where they wake up with a hangover, and a series of events will follow which will probably feel just like the previous two installments.

Better than I thought,"Maybe it's because I went into this movie with low expectations from having read so many bad reviews, but I thought Hangover 2 was fine movie.Yes, it's almost the same as the original. But it's also completely self-aware in that regard, and for that reason I really can't hold the similarity against it. It's part of the shtick.The ensemble continues to have great chemistry and the politically incorrect humor is darker than the first movie (an appreciated improvement), but almost always very funny. I don't know what else people were expecting to see here.No, it's not a perfect film, and a few things didn't work; Mason Lee was awful as Teddy - an admittedly small role, but he sucked the life out of every scene he was in nonetheless. And there were a few moments when Alan's antics were more frustrating than humorous.I just don't think it deserves all the bad reviews and disappointment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I can dig remakes, I can dig retakes, I can dig sequels, I can dig prequels but I can't dig easy copies... ARGH!","I'm not really getting Todd Phillips's intention besides getting more money. I can also dig a whole different ways to make money. I can dig remakes, I can dig retakes, I can dig sequels, I can dig prequels but I can't dig easy copies of movies you made before. Todd just did that. The ingredients to this comedy are the same.Instead of Las Vegas you get Bangkok, instead of a bachelor party we get a... bachelor party, instead of missing Stu you get missing Teddy, instead of a lion you get a monkey, instead of a missing teeth we get a face Mike Tyson tattoo, instead of Mr. Chow confusion we get another Teddy and so on. A recycled story based on the same content as the first movie. It's the same structure and that bothers me a lot. A movie about a hangover has various options of approaching. There isn't really much to say about where the story goes and how's the journey since it's the same. Besides these problems I have another big one with Ed Helms. he just overreacted the whole movie and felt really unnatural at times. Bradley Cooper as Phil feels like he's going through straight hell acting bored like realizing he's doing the same things he did in the first movie. The real stealer of the show however is again, Zach Galifianakis. His delivery is hilarious. His jokes are straight, funny and he is involved in all the comedic situations. Short reminder: Paul Giamatti's short cameo is amazing. Simply amazing.Overall the movie is funny, it's entertaining and it delivers a lot of laughs. Problem is you get all these jokes with a little bit of bitterness. I wish I could stop my rant and simply state things that I liked in the movie. I loved some of the landscape shots, I loved some of the locations, the decors used, the overall atmosphere... The songs used were did not have a constant good usage. It didn't matched some scenes like they did in the first movie. It is a very good directed comedy but pity that it's not at least half original. The worst part or the good part is that Todd already thought about a third movie. It's a good idea if he'll change the story and introduce new elements to it but it is an atrocious idea if it will be the same as the first two but in Paris this time...With that said, The Hangover Part II is not really Part II but The Hangover in Bangkok. It lacks big time in originality but Zach and the funny and ridiculous moments keep you entertained and at times forget the issues the movie has.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another Hilarious Part,"I made a review on the first part ""The Hangover"" and I said it was a hilarious one. This time I say that this one is very hilarious too. And I'm ensuring on this because at the time I'm writing this review it has a rating of 6.8 !!!!!!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!! I mean people say that it is the same story!!!!!! SO WHAT? The three parts of Matrix were the same story,,, the three parts of transforms were the same story,,, the five parts of Fast and the furious were almost the same story.... the three parts of transporter were the same story. I like to show the difference between two major types of movie stories: 1- A story that can not be repeated like most of the movies (King Kong, Crank, Memento, The Matrix, The three musketeers, ...etc) I mean they cannot be made in another series of movies (they still can be remade of course).... 2- A story that can have infinite parts like (Final Destination, The Hangover, ...etc) I mean when Final Destination had 5 parts with the same story why didn't you people reject it? This is the same situation here, We have a story that can have an infinite number of movies with different scenarios.Finally, This movie is as great and comedy as the first part and I'm eager to see the third part.If you want to die of laughter, watch this one.Thanks",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One Messed Up Movie,"The sequel to the hit comedy The Hangover is a sometimes disturbing, but often funny film. Director Tod Phillips takes his characters to Bangkok this time; to celebrate the wedding of Stu (played by Ed Helms), the dentist from the first film. The movie gets repetitive at times, but it serves as an enjoyable summer comedy.The plot is essentially a repeat of the first movie with the three guys waking up in a hotel room, not knowing what happened the night before. This time, Stu's soon-to-be brother in law has gone missing, leaving nothing behind except his finger. The movie has Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Zach Galifinakis running through the streets of Bangkok looking for the brother and trying to find out why Stu has a Mike Tyson tattoo on his face.The movie is very funny. There are some extremely disturbing moments that are there for no reason than to simply out do the original film, but other moments are genuinely hilarious. The Asian drug lord from the first film, Chow, shows up, and the guys search the city to find their friend, with no avail except the ominous answer: ""Bangkok has him now"".With a new team of scriptwriters, The Hangover Part II spends far too much time referencing the original. It's as if they don't believe the audience ever saw the first one. And the way the characters talk about their Vegas trip serves as a thinly veiled reminder of how good everyone thought The Hangover was. The parallels between this movie and the first are not really fun; it just seems that the script writers took the easy way out. It's when the film goes off in new directions (going to a monastery, the cameo by Paul Giamatti) that really get the laughs.Although the movie suffers from major nostalgia of the first installment, many moments of The Hangover Part II are funny enough to keep things interesting. Director Tod Phillips plans on making a third film in this series, and one can only hope the plot won't be so repetitive. But for now, this movie gets the job done.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover 2 is a lifeless and empty comedic experience.,"Not as bad as Caddyshack 2 as some are claiming but probably because The Hangover was no classic like Caddyshack. So, it has less farther to fall. The Hangover 2 is a below average follow up to an above average comedy. I really didn't share the over-the-top love for the first film even though I did enjoy it very much. The same can't be said for this go around. This particular incarnation isn't all that witty, sexy or even gross enough to distinguish itself from any number of similar comedy efforts. I hope fans of the first haven't set their expectations too high because this thing really isn't that funny. Releasing it in the summer means it will fade from memory FAST as other more entertaining films are released in this jam packed season.Bromances may have been all the rage a few years ago but I think most of us are sick of films like this one at this point. The writing is full of lazy clichés and the lowbrow alleged laughs on display are completely dumb and almost never funny. I couldn't decide who was more irritating Zach's character, Bradley and his arrogant one-liners or the thought that the writers of this trash actually got a huge paycheck to draft this nonsense. The Hangover 2 is a lifeless and empty comedic experience.Instead of a sequel to a funny film all they've given us an insanely unfunny and unlikable film. Way to cash in but phone in a sequel.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Here comes the new film, same as the old film","There are a lot phrases you could apply to The Hangover, Part II. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" comes to mind as to what was possibly at the forefront of director and co-writer Todd Phillips thoughts when he was assembling The Hangover, Part II, because if there is one thing you cannot accuse the sequel to the surprise comedy hit of 2009 of being, its original. The Hangover, Part II is a near complete rehash of the first entry, just with different locales and certain individual situations. That doesn't necessarily mean it isn't funny, but some of the sheen of the first film wears off the second time around.The Hangover, Part II finds buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galafinakis) in Thailand to attend Stu's pending nuptials 2 years after the events of the first film. Stu, not interested in being involved in a repeat of the events of Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, has decided to eschew that traditional pre- wedding event for a simple drink on the beach with his friends and his bride to be's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee). The next morning, the trio find themselves passed out in a seedy Bangkok hotel with a trained monkey, a pounding hangover, a visitor in the form of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the criminal gang leader from the first film, and Teddy nowhere to be found. In short order, Phil, Stu and Alan are prowling the streets of Thailand in search of Teddy via clues they pick up along the way as to the events from the prior evening. The search takes them to a tattoo parlor, a club in a significant state of disrepair, a strip club with ""interesting"" employees and a Buhddist temple, with a threat hanging over their heads from a Thailand based crime boss (Paul Giamatti) to deliver some information for a bank transfer the next morning or they will never see Teddy again.While it is not unheard of for sequels to films that seemed like a one- shot to try to replicate what made the first film successful, I can rarely think of one that almost completely remakes the original like The Hangover, Part II. Every significant plot arc, story development and twist is lifted wholesale from the first film. If you are really familiar with the first film, I can't see where it wouldn't be impossible for you to guess almost every major event that is going to occur in The Hangover, Part II and end up being correct. We are treated to the characters reacting in very similar manners to the events in the same way as the first film: Stu with complete, sheer bewilderment, Phil with a constant air of disbelief how things can keep getting so bad, and Alan with a degree of detached amusement. The only real element that is a bit different this time is that they friends are in communication via cell phone with Doug, who had decided to turn in early the night they were drinking. It's a way for the creators to keep Bartha involved to some extent without interfering with the trio dynamic that worked for the first film, I suppose.So, the real question becomes, is the Hangover, Part II funny? Well, yes, it is. Despite the familiarity of the situation in the broad strokes, the individual segments prove to have some decent humor to them throughout. One scene in particular, set at the aforementioned strip club, left me roaring in laughter. Many of the other outrageous moments provide more than just a chuckle, and a chase sequence in the latter part of the film is about as engaging as one in any action movie. Some of the reason the two Hangover films work at all is that, despite the fact that two-thirds of the main trio are rather reprehensible people, you can't help but imagine what it would be like to be in that situation and therefore you have some degree of investment in seeing them attempt to navigate themselves out of this mire they have become trapped in.As mentioned previously, there isn't a lot different to these characters in general. Phil is the debaucherous friend who is seemingly in a search of a good time to shake off the normalcy in his life otherwise. Stu is a straight arrow who is put face to face with his ""dark side"". And Alan is a clueless social misfit whose idea of getting his friends to have a good time is to drug them with paralyzers and hallucinogens. The actors sell their roles fairly well, especially, once again, Galafinakis, and are supported by Jeong as the subtly homosexual Mr. Chow, who still doesn't seem to be afraid to bare himself (entirely) to the audience. Giamatti, while scenery chewing with the best, can graciously be referred to as giving a ""cameo"" in the film considering his very limited screen time.The Hangover, Part II's unoriginality once again spills over to its ""moral message"", what little there is of one, and it is once again exclusively directed at the character of Stu. In the first film, he was able to give a comeuppance to his fiancé in a rather amusing, albeit crowd pleasing way. In Part II, there is a similar dynamic with a different character, but this time the moments where Stu must come into his own don't really work, and seem cheesy and, frankly, a bit uncomfortable and unbelievable.So, when all is said and done, should you see The Hangover, Part II? I cannot deny that I laughed at it more often than not once it got going for the most part, but not to the degree I enjoyed the first film. However, it is also difficult to overlook the complete lack of originality on display in the film, so The Hangover, Part II proves a mixed bag, and one that receives a mild recommendation from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Being a plagiarism of itself, ""The Hangover- Part II"" ends up being a real disappointment. But yes, you will laugh a lot","The Hangover! It was one of the biggest phenomena produced by cinema in recent years. Released in 2009, with no major actor in the cast, the comedy grossed more than $ 460 million worldwide, costing just $ 35 million. With the huge public and critical receptivity, the sequel to one of the best comedies of the past few years would not be long in order. Director Todd Phillips brings the cast back together for this second part, which despite being good and getting a lot of laughs, fails to be repetitive. This sequence believes to be intelligent when looking for situations to reproduce all the unusual situations of the first. It is not. ""I do not believe that everything is happening again"", explains at one point one of the characters. Me either. But it doesn't matter to me that in an appealing comedy the structure is repeated. The problem is to revisit all the jokes of the first, here simply exaggerated.As already anticipated, we have a repetition of ideas. If before, the four friends took the biggest drunk of their lives in Las Vegas on the eve of the wedding of one of them and woke up the next day without the slightest idea of what had happened or even the whereabouts of the groom, now, in The Hangover: Part II what happens is exactly the same, with very few - but significant - changes. Exchange Las Vegas for Thailand, the missing one this time is the brother of the bride, and the mission of the remaining three - the heartthrob Phil (Bradley Cooper), the flustered Stu (Ed Helms) and the crazy Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - remains to be clarified the night before and understand certain situations, like what a monkey does with them, like the drug dealer Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) ended up there, because an entire neighborhood in the city wants to see them far away, how one of them ended up with a Mike Tyson tattoo on his face and what made the other one completely shave his head? And these are just the main doubts, among many others, that arise during the new day. There is the prologue to the desperate call (which I think is brilliant in both films), the opening credits, flashback to the wedding plans, drunkenness, waking up from a hangover with no memory in a destroyed room.In the first few seconds of projection, we already received the alert: ""It happened again"". And this is really the spirit of production: everything happens again, but with small changes. So, there is almost no surprise. We know exactly what will happen in the course of the film because we already saw it in theaters two years before, killing part of the fun of the situations. Before even starting to tell the story, director Todd Phillips shows how Stu, Doug, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are now. Stu's wedding is the big event that is moving their friendship - especially after he ""almost"" married a prostitute in Las Vegas. In addition to the four friends who leave for Bangkok together, who is also with them is Teddy, the cousin of Stu's fiancee. And that already causes some disagreements in the group, since Alan feels rejected and is jealous for having to share the attention of his friends with yet another ""intruder"".""The Hangover! Part II"" follows the montage of the first one and shows the friends trying to remember what they did after taking something that made them lose their memory. Thus, Stu, Alan and Phil find themselves awake in a region of Bangkok completely lost and without knowing where they are. Alan wakes up without hair, Phil gets up stunned and Stu appears with the same Mike Tyson tattoo on his face. And the worst: Teddy is gone and no one knows where he is. In order to remember what they did, rescue Teddy and get Stu married, they will count on the help of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong).The big difference of The Hangover Not Married, both the first and this second film, is the fact that it is an adult comedy, made by adults and for adults. It seems a little redundant, but that order makes all the difference. Here nothing is forgiven, softened or treated more leniently, so as not to shock the naive or unsuspecting. After all, they are adult men involved in an adventure in which sex, drugs, money and other transgressions are common issues in everyday life, without increasing or decreasing them beyond what they really mean. Nothing is seen in a glorified way or, on the contrary, despised and subdued. What is on the screen is what any of us, on this side, would be facing if we were in the same situation. No heroes, saints or villains. Just ordinary people, maybe trying a little too much to live some really exciting moments. And that is how they live various adventures in Bangkok, dealing with Russian traffickers, then with Interpol and even with monks. In all this confusion, the greatest merit of the sequence is that, even repeating the style of telling the story, the film knows how to win over the audience with good jokes and, mainly, with the good dynamism and rapport of the cast.While the cast remains fun and the chemistry is noticeable, screenwriters Craig Mazin, Scot Armstrong and Phillips himself seem to have misunderstood the characters - who were created by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, who wisely avoided returning. Bradley Cooper continues in the right direction with Phil, again the team's brain, but the work with Stu and Alan is completely skewed. Ed Helms raises Stu's hysteric to an excess of caricature. That's because, again, the ""dramatic"" focus of the plot is Stu's lack of confidence, something we think the dentist had managed to overcome in the past film, not giving Ed Helms much new material to work on. Note that its narrative arc, with the exception of marriage, is identical to that of the first feature. But what Zach Galifianakis does with his Alan is the most unforgivable factor. In the original, the character was an eccentric with bizarre behavior, where here he is literally transformed into a child trapped in the body of an adult, bearded man. Having to see the character crying like a baby is absolute proof that the filmmakers did not understand why he worked so well in the original.For just repeating the axis of the previous film, ""The Hangover - Part II"" has to call our attention in another way. What would she be? More situations typical of eschatological comedies, with more of those low-slang jokes that were typical of the previous feature. In this sense, it is good to note that there is no limit in the elaboration of the jokes, now be aware of a very curious side: even though the adventures that the four friends live are very subversive, far from what they practice in their daily routine, their binge is still a little ""right"". Married Phil, for example, despite having the biggest hint of trickster, is never seen alongside other women - these adventures are for the bachelor (until he gets married, even though he is dating / engaged, he remains single) Stu; while the other married man in the group, Doug, always runs back to the hem of the woman's skirt before everything gets out of hand. We don't count Alan because he seems to be one of those people who is still unsure of his true identity.In the direction, Todd Phillips even repeats some angles and frames of the first film (such as the elevator sequence and the final shot of the photos), probably trying to ""pay homage"" to the first film. However, Lawrence Sher's photograph is right when he portrays Bangkok as a dangerous and deadly place, using gray colors and bright lights, which contributes to the feeling of danger. The setting lacks the cartoonish aura of Vegas, an oasis of comical fussiness in the middle of the desert. The capital of Thailand, under the lens of Phillips and Sher, is much more oppressive than funny. This oppression does not take long to be on the verge of violence, with armed gangs, shots and some blood on the scene. The director knows how to give rhythm to the story. He inserts a great chase scene in the middle of Bangkok, a better sequence than many action movies out there. The photograph explores Thai locations and their dangerousness well. The great soundtrack also helps the production to gain momentum and never get monotonous. Phillips is still a stylish director and still gives us great camera moves. He notices the turns around the actors during the hangover or the framing of Alan and Ted when they arrive in Thailand, in which the chubby man looks dangerously tense at the young man. Reaching the peak when Phil is suddenly assaulted by a motorcyclist, who was hiding in the background, blurred. Which causes the real feeling of the attacked character.The politically incorrect script remains present and their main moment is when they simulate a moment between the monkey and the monk they encounter, repeating the joke from the first movie that involved a baby. Some twists, good action scenes and the ending, which makes the tribal tattoo on Stu's face and the relevant previous use of the emblematic song ""The Beast in Me"", by Johnny Cash, save themselves among the reheated gags. Because it is a plagiarism of itself, ""The Hangover- Part II"" ends up being a real disappointment. Yes, you will laugh a lot. Yes, you will get what you were looking for when watching this movie. But, the truth is that the plot does not evolve. It is the most of the same. Even in central conflicts - Stu, for example, continues to fight people with stronger personalities than his own. And that is very little for what this film promised. The only part where we see a real show is in the final credits, with photos of the moments of the four friends' bangs in Bangkok. Then, yes, you will squirm with laughter.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A Good Sequel, despite borrowing Too Much from the Original,","The Hangover Part II is a great movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. As far as sequels go, I found it to be a very solid one that lives up to the fun and mayhem of its predecessor, taking the characters to new heights and higher risks. It had me in stitches, as well as enthralled by this adventure.I do think that it borrows far too many elements from the first Hangover, it felt like the writers were far too aware of what made its predecessor a success that they did not even bother to try to come up with fresher material. What happens to the characters is the exact same as the first, only bigger, but that does not mean better.The cast are as brilliant as ever, with them all still bouncing off one another brilliantly. It is an absolute pleasure to have Zach Galifanakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper return to their respective roles, and they are joined by many other cast members, old and new, that fit the ensemble terrificly.A fun sequel that is very forgiveable for not being perfect. The Hangover Part II is good fun that I would certainly recommend fans of the original check out.Stu invites Alan to his wedding, a decision he very quickly regrets after waking up in Bangkok on the morning of the event.Best Performance: Ed Helms",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I loved the characters from the first installment and Zach Galifianakis didn't fail to hit the funny in me again. The movie kept its pace and everyone in the theater seemed to be having a ball!

Rumours are that a third installment is already on its way.From a movie critic's standpoint, it seems like the creators watched Hangover turn into a hit and thought ""hey! we've got a franchise on our hands, let's make some more money!"" and they did manage to mint a butt load of greens through the weekend ($ 86 Million) and from what? A recycled script of Hangover! The writers played it safe. Too safe. Sitting in the theater, watching the movie, I felt like I had psychic powers. It's way too predictable. If you haven't watched the movie and you think you might not get the chance to watch it in theaters, don't worry. Just picture the plot of the first installment in a different location, except this time it's Stu's bachelor party. Seriously, I could've walked after the mid-point of the movie and know how everything would unfold. The same dilemma: four characters get smashed out, wake up the next day, hungover, one of the four is missing, they try to retrace their steps through last night's crazy events by looking for clues and links. The writers did try making it a little fresh with the she-males involvement and a spectacular car chase scene and honestly, I did enjoy that. I'd rate it a solid 6/10 because I like the characters. ""If only monkeys could Skype"" was one of my favourite lines in the movie. To conclude, I'd say: it is in fact a very entertaining movie if your just looking for laughs but if you're looking for reactions like ""Woah! I didn't see that coming!"" then you'd be disappointed. What's next? Alan's getting married in England and they lose the bride's step-dad after a crazy night climbing the Big Ben? The movie is Hungover from Hangover!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Predictable But Hilarious!,"The second installment in the Hangover franchise is very predictable since it almost exactly follows the plot line from the first film, but for some whatever odd reason, I laughed more in this film and thought the gags were a little better. The first film is a comedy classic, but this is just the film you wouldn't want to take too seriously. My favorite character in this film was the capuchin monkey because he was adorable and funny.Todd Phillip's film reunites the wolf pack from the first film and this time sends them to Thailand for another wedding, which is Stu's this time. After a supposed-to-be-innocent campfire, the gang wakes up in Bangkok in deep trouble as they are having yet another hangover. It all goes bad to worse when they realize the brother of Stu's wife-to-be is missing.The actors have really great chemistry and they feed off each other's energy. Bradley Cooper reprises his role as Phil and he is great again. Zach Galifinakis makes the perfect Alan since he is so weird. I just loved Alan's weirdness and that dinner scene where he is reading those notecard facts. Ed Helms is also really good as Stu who wants to take it easy but is resisted. I liked Ken Jeong's return somewhat but I found him more annoying in this movie than funny.Overall, this film is on par with the original film, maybe even a little funnier. This has a way darker tone as most films do these days but I was pleased there were many jokes here to counter that. Despite it's predictability, I laughed and laughed. I'm ready for the third film as long as it has something different. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The wolfpack is back.,"I went to the midnight premiere last night. With mixed expectations. I went in totally stoked to see the sequel to the funniest movie ever made. But, I was dreading the sequel curse.This movie, plays A LOT on the first movie. References to The Jonas Brothers being in town. The opening scene is exactly like the first movie's opening scene. When I say 'exactly'. I mean EXACTLY. Camera angles, characters, lines, stances., music. There are a few new characters added to the wolfpack. The two main ones being Jamie Chung's character as Stu's fiancé, and Mason Lee's character. Stu and Lauren (Chung) are getting married in Thailand. Which I don't get. Jamie Chung is korean, not thai. But I guess we're going by the 'all asians look the same' stereotype and have her play a thai girl. Anyway, I'll just get to the point. The boys go have a drink, and wake up with no recollection of what happened the night before.If you've seen the first movie, you've seen this movie. 98% of the gags, laughs and jokes are basically repeats of the first. All of them are recycled. Asian guy pops out of something and beats someone. Some sort of jungle animal is in the bathroom. Something is wrong with Stu's face. Scene by scene it's the same movie. I'll admit, it did have it's moments where I was cracking up and roaring with laughter. But I just sat there in the theater a lot, thinking 'I've seen this before'. It was a good sequel, as far as sequels go. But if this was the first 'Hangover' film, it wouldn't do very well. This movie relies A LOT on the first film. It does have a lot more vulgarity and potty humor, which is expected. However, I do kind of feel like the actors phoned this one in, which was disappointing.Bottom line. If you haven't seen the first movie, don't see this movie. You won't get any of the jokes. And if you have seen the first movie, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray. 98% of the jokes are recycled from the first one, you'll just feel like you're watching the same movie. I do give it credit that the idea of it happening exactly the same as the first one is funny. But it gets exhausting about 45 minutes in. It's a funny movie, I'll admit it. It just felt like I was watching the first film over again. I suggest you wait for the Blu-Ray.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Equally good as the first movie,"If you thought ""The Hangover"" delivered the goods, you'll just as much enjoy this sequel as I did. I expected not to like it as much, since most movie sequels are inferior to the first movie (or previous movie, if you're referring to further sequels). I expected not to like it as much because these guys are now outside of the U.S. (except for the beginning). Plus, their adventures this time around are funnier. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Don't listen to the critics who pan it - they knew this was going to be the same movie. This (and part one) are movies you don't need to be hung-over to enjoy. I can't wait to see what part III (and there will be one) has in store.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Same film, different jokes.","If you go in to this film thinking you are going to experience a masterpiece like the first film, then you will be highly disappointed. Hangover part 2, recycles the EXACT same storyline, changes a few plot details and where its set, and adds new jokes in ... but surprisingly it works. Hangover part 2 is a bit darker then the first film, with the jokes going for more shock value (a guy loses a finger, someone gets shot etc) then the first one but its still as funny as hell. Ignore the critics going for 'they did they bloody same thing' as this movie works. Its funny and that's all we really wanted. Not as great as the first one, but still really really funny. Instead of going to the cinema to see this movie, you can always just watch the first hangove and wait for a DVD release of the second because its pretty much the same thing",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What the f  **k is going on?!?!?   as Stu would say...,"In life the rule is, if at first you don't succeed, then try, try again. In Hollywood the rule is, if something works once replicate it again and again until the life is sucked out of it! By this I mean movies, in this case ""The Hangover"" which was one the best comedies I had seen in a long time.I believed then, like 2 years ago when the original came out, that this movie should NOT have a sequel, a belief I still cling to...though I guess I might be in the minority on that one. Does Hollywood listen to movie fans who these days crave for some original concepts, ideas, anything besides sequels and re-boots? The short answer: of course not! The long answer...well I don't have time for it.I could spend time discussing what worked in the first movie that does not work in this one, but what would be the point?! I only want to say that the joy-de-vivre, the excitement and the craziness of the original are lacking here by enlarge. ""The Hangover Part II"" has its moments definitely, but too many times it feels hollow and forced...That is the best I could come up with for an explanation as to why I was not particularly taken with it...it is not completely awful but by then end I was...meh! If you want to see a better, funnier comedy, my advice would be to go and see ""Bridesmaids"", a movie that hits all the notes that ""The Hangover Part II"" does not! ""Bridesmaids"" works on all cylinders, that is until the powers that be decide to make another ten sequels!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Part II refuses to take any calculated risks, though remains solid Saturday night Wolf-Pack fun.","""It happened again"", Bradley Cooper's Phil tells his fretting girlfriend via telephone. Indeed it has. The very words not only summarize into three words the plot of director Todd Phillips' Hangover Part II, the anticipated sequel to the 2009 comedic calamity of a bachelor party gone hilariously haywire, but they almost seem to mock the concept of the sequel itself, as the latest in lewd laughter refuses to take any sort of calculated risks with the series, leaving us with a tiresome, though still fairly fun, second round.Cooper returns with co-stars Ed Helm and Zach Galifianakis, who are all whisked halfway around the world for Stu's (Helm) wedding in Thailand. Determined not to repeat the events of their last little drunken escapade, the three down a single beer for the occasion. Of course, last call becomes first call, and morning glory in Bangkok sees an ape on amphetamine, Stu with a tattoo, and Alan (Galifianakis) with a cue-ball for a head.As per its predecessor, The Hangover Part II is all about the men's attempts to unravel the mystery of their wild night and to find a missing member of their partying party, as every backtracking step leads them farther from the truth and further into danger. Now, the original was outrageous, but that's what made it fun and relatable. We may not wake up to a tiger in our Vegas hotel suite every Saturday morning, but we've all woken up at one point or another having to digest an incomparable amount of intoxicated consequences sometimes we're laughing, sometimes we're not. Part II is well titled, because it does feel like a part, like an episodic continuum of the first instead of an honest sequel. It largely follows the same formula with seldom deviation, and is that bad? No, not at all. It's safe. But maybe too safe.Performance-wise, Galifianakis stole, and still steals, the comedic spotlight, though at times he kind of overdoes the idiot. I've become prone to calling this the Jack Sparrow syndrome, when an actor, under the pressure of living up to his successful role, acts over rather than under his dramatic quota. He's still pretty damn funny though, and Helm and Cooper are in no way useless. The trio, bolstered by the bulls*** that keeps testing their every vein of patience, are just as entertaining in Bangkok as they were in Sin City.Yes, it happened again, and that means you can predict The Hangover Part II's compliments to a tee. But if you're expecting the same number of shocks that labelled the Hangover, you won't find it here, mainly because you know the sort of shocks that await. Make no mistake, there are just as many outrageous scenarios plaguing Part II, but the subtitle alone tells you: we're recycling the successful and it's not as impactful this time around. It takes very few risks, to the extent that structurally we've seen all this before. However, if it's Friday night, you're looking for a few laughs, maybe even a few Wolf-Pack howls, then you can do no wrong by grabbing a couple of beers and giving her a look. Just a few words of caution: watch your drinks closely.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Unoriginal, crude, and offensive to Asian-Americans","I saw this movie last night and I thought the first movie was much funnier. It was less crude humor and more crazy, surprising, and original humor with a relatively unique way of telling a story.This movie follows the EXACT same format down to a slideshow at the end that they can only view once before they have to delete. I disliked this movie on several grounds.1) Raunchy/Gross/Shock-factor humor - Everyone has their own opinion on what's funny, I get that. But really is looking at penises, chain-smoking monkeys, naked transvestites, and amputated fingers stuck up noses what's considered funny these days? Maybe it is for some, but I personally just find it stupid and a sad state of affairs if this is where comedy movies are heading towards.2) Offensive - As an Asian-American male watching this movie I couldn't help but be disgusted. I dislike calling out the race card but this is one movie I feel it's warranted. First, you have depicted a relatively attractive Asian female with a white male. Now, I'm all into believing in true love and I have no problem with this by itself, but at the same time how many times can you recollect where you've seen a movie with an Asian male with ... well, anyone? It's hard not to notice the disparity when it's 100 to 0. It makes you wonder about how Hollywood works ...Secondly, one of the few Asian male appearances starts with showing what is likely is a pathologically small penis who of course just ""happens"" to be an Asian guy. How many movies have you seen an Asian guy's penis? Yet this is the one time they do show one?! In my opinion, and probably as any guy will tell you (just ask your bf/husband), the worst you could do to a guy is question their masculinity. That's just sickening that a movie tries to perpetuate a negative stereotype. I mean, I think most of the humor comes from shock value and sensation of superiority (i.e. laughing at another's misfortune). If the penis were extra large on an Asian or black male, would it still be funny?Anyway, on a side note, I've spent the better part of my 20s obtaining a medical degree and M.S. in health policy to improve the health system of a country that I love. But it's sad when every time I go to the movies, anyone who looks like me is often portrayed like crap. My suggestion is not to support this movie -- plus it's really only a cruder rehash of the first one. I think I might have to rededicate my life to improving media representation if movies like these keep coming out ...",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't think the fact the storyline was similar was a weakness...,"Clearly due to the nature of the film it was going to be about them hungover and I for one am glad they kept the same kind of format.

Urge to both swallow and spit out this sequel at the same time.,"It is easy palatable, following the same exact paradigm as the first film. A common analogy is comparing a movie to a roller coaster ride. Say ""Hangover"" is one of several roller coasters, and it was the favourite one you tried. So, H2 is like taking your favourite roller coaster ride again, except instead of sitting up front you sit a couple cars back.This film has just about exactly the same beats as the first one, where the right audience would start saying ""Uh oh, I know what's going to happen"" with great anticipation. The wrong audience would start saying ""Uh oh, I know what's going to happen"" with little interest at all. Well, is the film funny? Are there different jokes than the first film? Yes, some of the new gags have alternative punch lines. Things like the monkey don't work as well. The group has chemistry as an ensemble, and you enjoy their bickering most of the time. One thing I remember fondly about the first film is that it kept our main characters normal. That aspect is what made the movie special, and here that same approach is used, but perhaps does not resonate as much at the end this time.The Thailand location is utilised well, with a little local flare.But I am still on the fence whether to recommend this carbon copy sequel. If it was so much fun the first time, why not jump on for another go 'round again? On the other hand the idea of ""Oh no, here we go again"" should stop you dead in your tracks from ever visiting this sequel. Since I didn't stop watching once the obvious happened, I guess I will fall on the 'why not' side of the fence. But please, a THIRD sequel is just going through the motions.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarity and great surprises at ending.,"Don't worry, no spoilers. I loved this film. It was not as good as the first one, but pretty close. It made me laugh, it also made me sad. I don't understand what else it could have been. People complain that it was way too similar to the first movie. Have you seen the lord of the rings trilogy? Every chapter consists of walking, fighting, lengthy dialogue... My point is similarities can also make sequels, not just advancement of stories. If you loved the first one, you'll like this one. The acting is great, and it is just a very great film. There are many cameos that resemble scenes from the first film, a couple of familiar faces. I really enjoyed Leslie Chows longer duration of face time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't Fix What Ain't Broke,"Alright, here is the review for The Hangover, oh but wait, I already reviewed The Hangover. Is this the Hangover 2? I don't know, maybe because they are the exact same movie. After the success the original Hangover made obviously Hollywood milks the cash cow with a sequel. I'm not going to lie but when I first saw this movie I hated it. I hated how it was exactly the same as the first but after watching it again I started to appreciate it. Call me crazy but I am part of a minority that enjoyed it.Sure the movie was very similar. It opens with Phil on the phone after a day or two of crazy antics, which is the same. Instead of Stu losing a tooth he gets a face tattoo. Instead of a baby it is an awesome monkey. Teddy becomes lost instead of Doug, and it takes place in Bangkok instead of Las Vegas. Stu is getting married and I kind of expected to marry the girl from the first movie but they needed to go to Bangkok so for the story it made sense. It is his wedding and of course they have a bachelor party and they get drugged, again, they wake up in a mess, again, and similar antics return. Chow returns and when he comes in the movie slows down for me. I really don't like his character and he was a tad overused in the movie. His comedy was a little less forced but his crazy antics were too much for me and I didn't like them.The old saying ""don't fix what ain't broke"" probably works best here. I'm perfectly fine with them getting hung over again and finding a missing person again. I was fine with it because it worked and it was still funny. Scene after scene was still funny. Characters did little to change but frequently reminded us of the past adventure. This movie knew what was funny and they stuck to it.Allan was still the lovable idiot who said and did stupid things. Come on, you can't say you didn't laugh when he made his speech at his wedding. Sure the connection he had with the baby is the exact same as it was with the monkey but that monkey kicked ass. My favorite part of the movie was the monkey and it was funny. The movie was actually funnier the second time then it was the first. People complain and complain that the two movies were the exact same and yes it was but it still worked.I do agree to a degree with what fans were saying. I was OK with the overall story being the same and characters' being very similar but it was the small details that were the same that annoyed me. The opening scene should not have opened with almost the exact same lines as the ones in the first movie. Stu figured out where Teddy was in a very similar way he did in the first. There were some scenes you could take from Hangover 1 and put into Hangover 2. Lines could be interchanged and in the end this movie really is lazy filmmaking for a quick buck. I didn't like Mike Tysons unnecessary cameo and there were pictures during the credits again. The little things that made the two movies too similar. The problem with Hangover 2 is that it doesn't stick out as its own movie. It's basically called The Hangover.again.I understand where people are coming from. They wanted to see something new and different. In a way, this movie did do that. There are transgender people, monks, missing fingers, Allan is shaved, and many more things that raise the bar in craziness. Hangover 2 is a lot more crazy then the first. Meaning the night they had in the second was a lot more intense then the first. The movies are very similar and are no different in the end but it was still a good time. I still laughed and I want to laugh when I see these movies. It was very similar but most people I talked to about this movie said it was funny bit too similar to the first. I respond with the simple question, ""Was it funny?"" when they answer yes then it is mission accomplished for the filmmakers.I realize this is more of a defense then a review for this movie but it is worth talking about. Unfortunately, this movie is doomed to judgment. As a movie itself it is hysterical but since it follows up the first it is unpopular. It is doomed to comparison to its predecessor. If The Hangover never existed and The Hangover 2 was released instead, I guarantee everybody would have loved it even more then the first. This was a funny movie but I still agree that the first was better.Overall, The Hangover 2 followed the same recipe to the first. Not much changed and if the Hangover 2 never existed nothing would really happen. This movie doesn't push the story forward in the trilogy. This movie is literally useless but it was still incredibly funny. For what it is it is a good movie but since it follows up the first movie it is a bad movie. I still liked it because I was still interested in the story and every scene made sense. I was still able to piece together the crazy night with the characters and enjoy the experience. The whole gimmick was reused but it still worked. I still had fun. I would have liked if it wasn't a copy and paste replica form the original but it was still good enough to get the WillyT Honorable Mention award. That is really saying something. The first got the seal of approval and that is only one step above the honorable mention.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What did you really expect?,"First off, I always thought the first ""hangover"" was totally overrated. It was good, but best R-rated comedy of all time good? Heck no! So I wasn't that surprised when it turned out the second movie followed pretty much the exact same storyline with a few extra Asian jokes thrown in. As much as I love Galifinakas, Alan just was not as funny in this movie. He had his moments and his delivery of certain lines made me laugh, but it is hard to laugh at the same jokes we heard in the first movie. Lines about the ""wolf pack"" and pagers aren't as funny the second time they're used. A lot of the jokes were taken right from the first movie. Ed Helms was boring as usual and I was very disappointed in this film. Especially when Mike Tyson showed up at the end. What's funny about a washed up, former rapist/boxer who bites off people's ears when he can't scare them into losing a fight. Just his voice, and the fact that he thinks he has a chance at actually becoming an actor. A lot of sequels are bad, ""Hangover 2"" is one of the worst!

Was it as strong of a hangover?,"Was it as hard of a hangover?Memorial Day weekend opened up with a bang yesterday as Kung Fu Panda 2 and The Hangover Part 2 opened up. It seems that this weekend was destined to be sequel weekend and I'm here to discuss one of the sequels and whether it's worth your valuable time. The Hangover Part II fits the formula that its predecessor did two years ago. Despite the pact that is made early on in the movie by Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) , the guys get drunk on alcohol, wake up in a hotel, and start their journey off to find the missing friend, the bride to be's brother Teddy (Mason Lee) whose finger is currently the only clue they have to the mystery. One phone call later from Doug (Justin Bartha) and the gang hit the Bangkok streets in search for the answers they so desperately seek. So the question is, was this movie worth it? Is the same plot and different location worth $8-$10 of your hard earned money and nearly two hours of your valuable vacation time? To help you make this decision let's cover some facts about this movie. First of all the movie is raunchier than the first installment of the film, especially a particular scene where transvestites and a night club are involved. The graphic depictions of police rioting, coke snorting, and the male genitalia are constantly thrown into your face throughout the entire movie, which depending on your humor can be a good or a bad thing. This graphicness even carries on to the credits, which provides a lot of information that the movie itself does not provides, and some of the pictures can be a little extreme, even for this movie. Constantly interspersed throughout the chaos of this movie, is Stu's constant whining, Phil's constant use of the F word and Alan's random comedy lines. The first two aspects are funny to a point, but quickly get annoying and predictable. Alan's contribution is kind of a 50:50 mix of funny and annoying for me. There are points in the movie where his one liners and actions are perfectly timed which made me laugh, or at least chuckle, during the movie. Yet there were times where I felt the movie centered too much on his comedy, and his lines were stale and annoying. As for the situations they were put in, I wasn't as surprised, shocked, or entertained as I was in Vegas. Most of the scenes were incredibly predictable and didn't seem as dire or extreme as what we saw in Vegas. With the exception of the nightclub, most of the places they visited were not really that exotic or scary, which left me somewhat bored throughout the movie. In fact if it were not for the monkey or Mr. Chow, then I believe this movie would have been absolutely dead. This brings me to my next point, fans of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) will not be disappointed, as the maniacal, lack of morals, outspoken, Asian gangster is back. The stand-up comedian returns in all of his glory as his obnoxious voice fills the screen for probably a good thirty minutes of the movie. Mr. Chow makes a good portion of the plot and even when he is ""chilling"" somewhere off screen his actions are driving the plot. Yes if you thought the comedian was bad news in the first movie, then you have seen nothing compared to this film. Overall Hangover Part II is a diluted version of the first movie. The potential for the experience in Bangkok was just not reached, and it felt like this movie was somewhat rushed in the past two years. Again the acting is fine, and the comedy feels sort of the same, but it seems to me that this sequel could use a revamp. Despite some witty comedy and a very adorable and crafty monkey, this movie really did not deliver to the expectations I had for this movie. Thus my Robbie rating for this movie is about a 7.0 for this sequel. Intended audiences for this movie will include: Die Hard fans of the series, Bradley Cooper or Zach Galifianakis fans, people who like cute monkeys, and fans who like a lot of Oriental Humor. Avoiding audiences: People who are taking 8 year old to the movies, yes I saw a dad bring his son to the movie, people who are easily offended, and those who don't want to see genitalia on screen Until next time, this is rgkarim signing off.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""The Hangover: Part II"" is a fun retread of the first movie...  Had enough laughs and quirky character beats to keep it afloat...","If you can get over the fact that ""The Hangover: Part II"" is essentially a bigger-budget remake of the first film, instead of being a full-on sequel, you will like it. That's how I will start this review.Todd Phillips returns to direct returning actors Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha. Two years after the first film, Stu is getting set to get married to his fiancée Lauren, a Thai woman whose family disapproves of Stu. When Stu, Phil and Allan hold a toast for Stu, they awaken the next day, again with no memory of what happened, and must try to solve the mystery of how they ended up in Bangkok, as well as find Lauren's missing brother, whom was with them. Their only clues are a severed finger and Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong returning, even more insane this time around), whom is mysteriously with them.Other reviewers have pointed this out, but I will address it- this film is cruder, ruder and at times more mean spirited than the original. It is actually very violent at times, and the things our gang (the Wolf-pack) must go through are very disturbing. I won't lie, there were many times where instead of laughing, I simply stared in horror at what was transpiring. It was a bit too vulgar for its own good.All of the actors are very good, yet again. Galifianakis stands out as Allan, whom has sort-of become the mascot for the series- a man-child who means well, but has obvious emotional and social problems, and can be very childish when he doesn't get what he wants. However, he is pushed a bit too far towards the beginning of this film, and almost becomes unlikable before somehow managing to redeem himself. This is mainly due to Galifianakis' performance- he plays the role just dumb enough that you will feel sympathy for him. Even when he is a total cretin, you know Allan ultimately means well, and is a scared, lonely man. Helms pulls through more this time, and is more fleshed out, and you will care more about him. Cooper plays well, but I still have a problem with his character- he is too irresponsible and at times too mean, which makes him slightly unlikable, especially after seeing a touching moment between he, his wife and his child at the end of the first film- his character doesn't totally ""add up.""Phillips shows again that he has a knack for visuals. In addition to the gags, some of the scenes are very well shot, particularly a fun chase sequence, and some beautiful shots of Thailand and Bangkok. Phillips is a gifted visual artist. And despite the mean nature of the script by Craig Mazin, it is still a well-structured film, and is written reasonably well.I really, honestly enjoyed this film. Even though the set-up and pay-off are almost identical to the first film, making it feel more like a remake than a sequel, it is still highly enjoyable. (I didn't even mention the funny drug-monkey or Jeong's uproarious performances as Chow.)I'm going to give this a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It's a little too dark and violent, and re-treads the original too much, but it's still a fun ride, and is worth watching for fans of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A sequel that is very hard not to like,"The hangover boys are back, and this time, they're in Bangkok. Sounds like a great location for a follow-up. I liked the first Hangover, though i found the story far-fetched, over-the-top and way too surreal. This sequel actually plays out more believably, believe it or not, despite a more convoluted plot. I was prepared to find fault, but i just ended up liking this movie far more than i expected. The wolf packers are as funny as ever, and i especially love the droll acting by Paul Giamatti. Ken Jeong is funny as ever, although less outrageously this time, while newcomer Mason Lee comes across as highly likable. One also can't help but grin when seeing the photographs shown during the end credits.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

My favorite movie in the series.,"I absolutely loved this movie, although it goes a bit too over the top with the nudity and sexual references, it made me laugh more than the first movie. I liked how they added Mr. Chow in the movie more, cause he is probably one of my favorite characters in the movies. Although they stole a lot of the plot from the first one, it makes up for it by having funnier jokes and situations. Overall, i loved this movie, and i would recommend it to anyone who isnt offended by over the top crude humour and graphic nudity.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
HangOver II,"Todd Phillips goes for a 2nd hangover, but The Hangover Part II suffers with its lack of surprises. The flow of the story is as expected; a little setup followed by a whole lot of maniacal nonsense. There is actually a bunch that happens within the 100 minutes of screen time, although things feel quite linear The humor tends to be overly crude at times, which really isn't for young eyes. It also hampers many of the would-be laughs; however, there is so much going on that it is hard not to find at least a few chuckles throughout the picture. A bulk of the amusing antics that take place are at the expense of Ed Helms. The higher annoyance factors overshadow the comedy of Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong, although they are held somewhat in check. Bradley Cooper is more along for the ride here. The Hangover Part II has its moments. Just not enough to categorize it as a must see picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover Part II,"To be fair, it would be impossible (or at least nigh on it) to produce a Hangover sequel as good as the original. Nonetheless, Todd Phillips and his crew gave it the old college try...and whilst The Hangover Part II doesn't reach the heights of the original, there are enough funny and shockingly funny moments throughout to make it well worth a your while. Fair to say The Hangover Part II was a darker film all around.It was great to see the Wolfpack back in action: Stu, Phil and Allan haven't changed, and this time have Stu's soon-to-be brother-in-law along for the ride in Bangkok this time, which was a fun setting, with all the situations you might imagine in that Asian metropolis.Ken Jeong reprises his role as Lesley Chow, who is yet again central to what happens to the Wolf Pack, who must piece together the pieces of a night one of them can remember.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Retreading Too Early,This sequel is a retread of the first Hangover movie but inferior in almost every way. Let me start with what I loved. The jokes were funny. The albino polar bear joke had me gasping for air. Alan's shaved head gave the character an extra dysfunctional aspect that felt original to his character. Alan's interactions with his parents and getting an invitation to the wedding was another highlight.The bad aspects of this movie are the unoriginal elements and how they had to be perverse or grotesque in every way. You had a monkey instead of a baby. A face tattoo instead of a pulled tooth. An intolerable amount of nudity as well as the nature of the graphic subject matter Stu experienced. Mr Chow's storyline is an unnesscary detour and it would have been better if the power never went out during the course of the film.Basically everything new in this movie was great and all the retreading was inferior and downright insulting to a viewer like myself. It had side-splitting jokes but they aren't worth spending 100 minutes to hear them.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not like the first,"This movie was still pretty hilarious although it was a completely different story plot with the same scenario from the first one. Bradley Cooper, in my opinion, can turn any movie around just from his acting skills. Galifianakis was his usual hilarious self along with Helms and Jeong. The only disappointment that had came out of the film was pretty much the fact that they had used the same scenario from the first Hangover movie. You would think that the director would like to go with a different type of storyline, but I guess this was the one that he was sticking to. Along with it being the easiest to come up with as well.This movie was more than the average comedy film that you would see, but it's lack of good story structure was an issue.  I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't laugh at this film, because I did, it's just that it could've went in another direction.It's claimed a movie that you either hate or love, but I simply find myself in the middle of not liking it because it really went nowhere, and loving it because it was hilarious. I would tell you to give it a try before continuing to read the rest of the reviewers ratings. Try it for yourself and find out how you like it before determining to stay away from it or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Repetitive,"I didn't enjoy the fist part, but I gave it a go anyway when I saw there was a second part although it's widely known that second parts are never good. It wasn't really a bad decision, because I laughed, but I wouldn't watch a third part as it'd be very predictable. It's just a version of the fist part, in Thailand now. As I laughed more with the crazy things that happened in this part, I give it a 6 out of 10.Besides, I'll always prefer ""Give it to the Greek"", and I'd rather recommend it to anyone who likes what appears to be a new kind of films, those about wild parties and crazy night which is OK, because we can all feel identified with this films as we all had wild parties at some point.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pure Adult Fun!,"I saw 'The Hangover Part II' the day it released back in summer 2011. I had mixed emotions. I loved the 1st one a bit too much to let go off its shadow. But I re-watched 'The Hangover Part II' recently, and although its not as original or as funny as the 1st one...this sequel is still Pure Adult Fun!'The Hangover Part II' Synopsis: Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding. Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry.'The Hangover Part II' kept me hooked in its second viewing. I saw myself laughing at the situations, what if in a second viewing. The Screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin & Todd Phillips crosses the boundaries. Its abusive, rude, graphic & offensive, but thats what 'The Hangover' movies are known for. Todd Phillips's Direction is mediocre.Performance-Wise: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Zach Galifianakis are back & they are utterly amazing, once again. Justin Bartha & Ken Jeong get more scope this time & they do just fine. Paul Giamatti excels in an extended cameo.On the whole, 'The Hangover Part II' isn't 'The Hangover', but hilarious nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A product of a sick mind of a pervert,"This movie is so bad I am really annoyed by the popular vote on it. Drugs, grotesque sex, violence, total lack of responsibility and morals, all presented as normal as a field of daisies. Is this what sells a picture today ? No, well-balanced people won't buy it. Would any accountable adult let his/her kids watch a piece of filth like this ? It's sickening. As for the so called action, hastily sewed together by some uninspired script writers, it's insulting to the people and authorities of Thailand, the big way. I very much doubt this rubbish will have any success in Bangkok. Probably the most appreciated scene will be the stick beating of the ""heroes"" by a monk. It's the only realistic and gratifying part of a production that didn't bring and shouldn't bring a single smile.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
IMDb Users are now trained critics? ITS PREDICTABLE... THATS A SHOCKER!,"First off, lets start by saying that I have never written a review on IMDb for any movie. I have decided it is necessary with this film because it has been unfairly scrutinized by other IMDb users. This film is predictable! You would probably understand that if you watched any of the trailer before the movie, and if you went into this movie expecting a completely new movie you are an idiot. That being said.. it is very easy to ruin a movie with the same plot, no character development, and just a change of location. THEY DID NOT RUIN THIS FILM. This movie was great, it was funny from start to finish. They even found a way to push the limit slightly farther than the first film with even more lewd gags. It is obvious that everything from the first one is back, the monkey takes the place of the baby, Thailand for Vegas, Doug for a small Asian boy. I have read the other user reviews on this site giving this movie a one star and it makes me sick. These are the type of people that do not enjoy lewd humor, they go for the sure enjoyment of getting angry at a film to bash it on the internet. I read one persons review where they called the first film a light hearted comedy.. Light hearted? Are you kidding me? They showed a baby masturbating.. You knew what you would get from Hangover 2 and yet you still go and complain. Its like any other film that is successful.. don't change the formula.. They have been doing it in horror films for years. Could you imagine Saw 2 if Jigsaw was not back in the film creating traps to kill more people? It would have then just been a 70 year old guy with cancer running around with a gun. Where is the fun in that? Long story short... If you are going to sit in here and talk about camera angles like you are a professional director and film critic just leave, if i wanted to read that side of it I could have read roger Egbert's.

Hungover from the Hangover,"For part one -We identified with the first Hangover because most of us who saw it have had one of those crazy hangovers at some point where we woke up and thought ""oh my god, where am I, who is that next to me, what am I wearing, or what did I do last night""!! Also, Vegas is a mecca for outrageous behavior so we either identified with the location or for those who have never been to Vegas, it made people want to go and live it up for a weekend.For part two- I was really hoping that it would be as good as part one but I don't think I went in with great expectations since the sequels are never as good. I really didn't care that it mirrored part one as far as the verbiage and overall context, but I simply did not like the location. I just could not get into the dark and dirty foreign country scenario. If Alan ever gets married, I hope they wake up next to Rihanna in a dangerous part of New York or Los Angeles after kidnapping Ryan Seacrest.",,Anonymous,Comedy

"Just as good and fun, if not better and funnier than the first.","Of course I really liked ""The Hangover"" but it was not a movie without its flaws and I still had some problems with it. Surprisingly enough I have far less complaints about its sequel. Yes, I know I'm a minority on this but I actually liked ""The Hangover Part II"" better than the first movie.Thing most people seem to have problems with is that this movie is nothing more than a rehash of the first movie. But actually I have to really disagree on this. It's using the same concept, of waking up at a strange place, after a wild night, of which none of the main characters remember anything of. But clearly a lot had happened, since there suddenly is a monkey in the room, a finger in a ice bucket, one of the guys has a tattoo on his face, the other is suddenly bald, one of their friends has gone missing and Mr. Chow somehow ended up in the room as well. So it's using the same sort of concept and setup as the first movie but how would it had been a Hangover movie if it was using a totally different concept? And really, just because it's using the same concept that doesn't of course mean that all of the situations, funny moments and characters are all the same as well. On the contrary, ""The Hangover Part II"" has plenty of originality going for it and I actually think it's a better written and constructed movie than the first one.A problem I had with the first movie was that things felt somewhat forced and all happened very randomly. It was as if they were having a great main premise but they just didn't really knew how to use it. It felt to me as if they were making up stuff with its script as it went along but their was not one clear, whole, finished idea behind of from the start. This movie obviously had an idea behind it from the start and everything happens for a reason in its story. It makes the movie flow more pleasantly and naturally.One of the things I also liked better in this one were its settings. It's surprising but I actually liked the Bangkok settings better than the Las Vegas ones of the first movie. Perhaps its because it's a strange and totally different country, in which the main characters are totally strangers. They don't speak the language, don't know the customs and get into all sorts of different problems because of that.And yes, all of the problems they maneuver themselves into are some pretty hilarious and well written ones. Like I said, everything happens for a reason and is connected to each other. Something that might seem very random will eventually come back in the story and play a significant part in it. It's a movie that made me laugh from basically start till finish.One of the things that makes these movies such great and effective ones are its main characters. They are really convincing as real life, middle aged, buddies and actually also somewhat easy to relate to, despite them being in some unusual situations and also doing some often highly unusual stuff. They are the true driving force behind these movies.Also the thing that makes them work out so well is because they are being played by some great actors. This is a big difference with most other comedies, in which acting skills seem to be often secondary. You have to sort of feel for Justin Bartha though. In the first movie he spend most of the time off screen and in this movie he also isn't involved with any of the adventures and craziness, while he still actually is a member of 'the wolf-pack'. The first movie launched Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis to stardom but who will recognize Justin Bartha when he's walking down the street? This sequel won't change anything about that.So all in all, a better written, better made and even more fun sequel. Yes, I'm probably crazy but I actually liked this movie better than the first ""The Hangover"".8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"No matter how much you want to like it, this uninspired sequel gives you no reason to","Any part-time binge drinker knows that when you end up with a hangover the next day, no matter how much fun you had the night before, you're not going to be dumb enough to mix the same lethal cocktails ever again. ""The Hangover Part II"" would not be one of those hangovers you brag about the next day. Using the same ingredients with limited ""X"" factors, ""The Hangover Part II"" stirs up a familiar and predictable drink. Despite the familiar and comfy cast of characters, what once got America punch-drunk in 2009 will leave very few buzzed the second time around.One can sense a tangible fear of deviating from the formula that brought moviegoers out in droves two summers ago in Todd Phillips follow-up effort. The events that unfold in Bangkok do so with minimal procession and perfunctory malaise, just as you expect them to, building to nothing but the next clue as to what happened the night before.If only the night before were worth uncovering clues about. Visits to a monastery, tattoo parlor and a Thai strip club lay in store as the Wolfpack of Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Alan (Galifianakis) try and find out how they got drugged and lost Teddy, a 16-year-old who happens to be the brother of Stu's bride-to-be and child prodigy of his disapproving father- in-law. Despite antics from a drug-trafficking monkey, the return of Ken Jeong's crass and effeminate Mr. Chow and a barrage of inappropriate inserts from Alan, the laughs are few and far between, with some of the best already having been revealed by the trailers.Normally, comedy sequels' undoing comes from such painstaking desperation to top the antics of the original that the follow-ups come across as blunt and hollow despite the laughs. ""The Hangover Part II"" plays it the opposite, hoping that by virtue of playing it safe that the lovable characters of the original will win out. In a story following such a rigid formula, however, new elements need to come from left field or the act gets stale quickly. It will not take long into the run time for ""Part II"" to feel uninspired. Even the character interaction and subplots remain identical to the first: Alan still seeks approval from the others, Stu still freaks out at every new bit of info learned and Phil tries to play it cool. Everything about the sequel feels like retreaded material with an Eastern flair. Redressing a formula can work, but not in a comedy whose predecessor relied so heavily on the element of surprise.The lack of laughs provided for in the writing pins a lot of that responsibility on Galifianakis. Although Alan remains the best of the several characters he's played in the two years since being shot to fame by the original, he takes on the role of comic relief (along with a bit of help from Jeong). He has a 50-50 success rate, but he's kind of left out to dry because Phil and Stu simply aren't funny in this movie.Laughs aside, however, the real killer proves to be the predictability. Phillips gives you at least a 10 second window to figure out what's coming next in almost every key scene. He's almost lazy in trying to conceal the script's few good cards and it weakens the laughs. Also, considering no characters except one have motive, figuring out how they got drugged again a second time takes little to no detective work. That reveal adds no emotional turmoil to the process. Devoid of any substance or creative thinking, the film come across as what it appears on the surface: an attempt to capitalize on the financial success of the original.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Hangover Part II --> The Hangover Minus Everything That's Good About It.,"Applying the same formula that made its predecessor one of the finest comedies of its year, The Hangover Part II is the follow-up chapter to The Hangover that brings nothing new to the table, is an absolutely uninspired sequel that tries too hard to amuse its audience, and fails at everything the original managed to get right in the first place.Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of The Hangover Part II follows Phil, Stu, Alan & Doug as this time they arrive in Thailand for Stu's wedding. In order to avoid the escapades of Las Vegas during their last bachelor party, Stu decides to play it safe by opting for a pre-wedding brunch but once again, things soon head in the unexpected direction.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover Part II completely lacks the freshness, originality & quality the first film had and even the use of humour is disappointing this time. The screenplay is a letdown too for the writers have simply taken the basic plot of the first film, set it at a new location & filled it up with whatever gags they could come up with without ever trying.The technical aspects share much similarity with the first chapter yet doesn't resonate the same vibe as before. Camera-work is bit more gritty than last time, Editing fails to get rid of many moments the final print could've done without, and the soundtrack isn't impressive at all. Even the performance by its reprising cast is inferior in comparison to their input in the previous chapter while the new additions are simply dull.On an overall scale, The Hangover Part II is a lazy, lethargic & lacklustre sequel to The Hangover that never really clicks at any given moment, and is nothing more than the same old stuff being sold in a new package. Every element that worked so well in the first film, whether it's the expert use of wit or creative energy or the seamless interplay between its characters, is sorely missing here and if you have seen the original, then you can certainly skip this one unless you are determined to find out what regret feels like!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny though slightly Bankoked up.,"Essentially the overall film basically just follows the same format that the original had but this time the ever raunchy Chaos is erupting in Bangkok, Thiland with even more Crudness, Frontal-nudity and scenes that will either offend or amuse you. New additions to this crazy sequel include a Monkey who smokes and deals drugs for bananas, Lady-boys (eep), A cut off finger and Stu getting a tattoo Fused onto his skin! When you watch the film you quickly realise that this no ordinary Rehash. It's actually one that offers a lot more Adultness that even the likes of South Park or Family Guy could ever dream of.Being much bigger, The Sequel tends to veer into much darker black-hole content and comedy than the first, But still retains the Madness and hi-cap Hiluarity that helped the original make a name for itself. This sequel will either overall feel like a demented scientific clone Of The first one or The original Upgraded into into something even bigger depending on how you feel. I reckon it will probably feel like both.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

When the film got going I found its humour to be engaging and funny but thanks to the samey structure i was constantly thinking i had seen it all before.in summery i feel that while a good effort in terms of humour the film needed to stand on its own more from the first and really step away and become its own movie. not bad though by any stretch and I hope the third will be much more original",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not as bad as some say it is,"Although it lacks in quality and originality, especially in compared to the first film, The Hangover Part II for the most part is a rather enjoyable but flawed comedy that is entertaining through and through. The legendary trio from the original film returns, and as they were before, they are still great in their roles. Bradley Cooper still gives the better performance out of the 3, and Zach Galifianakis character did seem to push the limits a bit more than needed, but nothing too ruin worthy. The film can be a bit predictable at times. Although you may not know exactly what is going on, it seems to follow the same formula as before, and besides a few small moments, there isn't anything terribly different about it. Some jokes fall flat, but most of the time they land quite nicely. It's not as funny, well made, or well acted as the first, but for those looking for a good time at the movies (possibly just some fun), then The Hangover Part II is certainly not a total letdown.

If you've seen the movie, then Todd Phillips who is both a co-writer and director, just stole your 12 dollars.You essentially get the exact plot as the first Hangover. Scene by scene. The only thing that changed was the setting. Instead of Vegas you get Bangkok. All the comedy comes at the expense of stereo types. Asian's with small penis, jokes about Asian women not having breast, or my personal favorite, comparing a Thai monk to the Grand Wizard of the KKK. Let's not mention the fact of buying a black man...but not permanently, just for the night. Also the idea of American children frolicking about Bangkok, taking shots of alcohol, drinking beer, snorting cocaine all while hanging out with transvestites... that type of shock humor just doesn't qualify for comedy. The film gives you the type of laughter you get when you feel uncomfortable, you just don't know it until you leave. When it comes down to it, The Hangover: Part II makes absurd movies like Idiocracy seem completely believable.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Wolfpack is Back,"¨Well we're living here in Allentown, and he's driven our lives into the ground. When we woke up we were wasted and drunk; Phil got shot, we got beaten by a monk. I was happy and my life was good; getting married like a dentist should.¨ The trailers got it right when they said the Wolfpack was back; Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug got together again in this follow up to the highly successful 2008 comedy The Hangover. They even got Mr. Chow to return for the sequel, but what they failed to mention was that one of the main characters from the previous film was missing: Las Vegas. The second part takes place in sunny Bangkok, a long ways away from home. Instead of waking up at a five star suite hotel room, the guys wake up in a roach infested cheap motel room. The movie follows an almost identical premise and the jokes are pretty much the same, but Bangkok just isn't Vegas and that was actually missing in this film. Other than that I had no other problems with this movie: it was fun, entertaining, and all the main characters were back at it again. Same players, same scenarios, different location. With these talented actors it is pretty hard to mess up a movie like this so if you enjoyed the previous movie than odds are you will like this one. The Hangover was one of my favorite comedies of the decade, the second one doesn't quite live up to that category, but it still is entertaining. Of course the originality and freshness from the original was missing, but I didn't have any problems in seeing these guys reunite once again. Todd Phillips was also back as the director after the disappointing and unsuccessful Due Date (which also starred Zach Galifianakis), but he got right back on track where he had left out in The Hangover. He also collaborated with the screenplay along with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong (who replaced Jon Lucas and Scott Moore from the original).Its been two years since Doug (Justin Bartha) got married and now it's Stu's (Ed Helms) turn. He has fallen in love with Lauren (Jamie Chung) and is planning on getting married in Thailand where her family currently lives. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is upset that Stu is getting married abroad because he has to buy tickets for him and his wife, but he gets even more upset when he discovers that Stu isn't going to have a bachelor party. Stu invited them to IHOP the morning before they had to travel and tells them that there will be no party, so they must enjoy their breakfast and consider that his bachelor party. He wants to avoid everything that happened to them in Vegas. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) finds out Stu is getting married and is depressed because he hasn't been invited to the wedding. Doug convinces Stu to invite Alan since that trip to Vegas has been the highlight of his life and seems to have mentally never left the place. Stu reluctantly decides to invite him so the Wolfpack get together again and travel to a beautiful resort in Thailand. Lauren's younger brother, Teddy (Mason Lee), is studying in Stanford and also travels with the crew, although Alan doesn't like this one bit because he isn't part of the Wolfpack. A couple of nights before the wedding the guys decide to roast marshmallows by a campfire on the beach. They all have one beer and the next thing we know they wake up in a cheap motel room in Bangkok without remembering what happened the night before. Phil wakes up first and finds a finger in a bucket full of water that seems to belong to Teddy, Alan wakes up with his head shaved, Stu wakes up with a tattoo on his face, and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) wakes up alongside them. The movie then follows the same premise the first one did as they try to find clues to piece together what happened to them and where Teddy is.The movie is missing some of the freshness the original film had, but I still had a fun time. More of the same is not necessarily bad, but it just isn't as funny either. We kind of expect some of the things that are going to happen. Some of the highlights of the film include new secondary characters like Kingsley, who is played by Paul Giamatti and he is really funny in this film. There is also Samir (Bryan Callen), an Arab dealer searching for Mr. Chow, who has a few funny seconds on screen, but I wish his character would have been given more time. There are also some more funny cameos along the way and surprising moments, although pretty much all the suspense and mystery that the first film had is missing in this one. The Hangover II is still a very raunchy comedy like the first, but the effect the first film had on me was just missing this time. I still can't complain because I laughed throughout the film. It was fun seeing these characters back in action again and was very pleased with the film. If you liked the first film, you will probably like this one, if you didn't like the first one then there is no need for you to see the second one because the premise is the same. Just don't expect another masterpiece.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A better experience than the first ..,"Comedy is not one of my favorite movie genres, i am more of a Thriller or Drama type of guy. however, i like to watch Comdies every now and then. When i first watched the first Hangover movie, i was not impressed much and i thought that it was over hyped and over rated. I was really puzzled by the over praise the first movie got, i thought maybe it was ruined for me because i saw too many clips before i watched the movie itself, and the trailer really did give away a lot of key moments. So this time around, i avoided watching the trailer, and avoided reading or hearing anything of the new Hangover 2, and i guess it paid off, because i felt that i enjoyed this more than the first for sure.one of the things i liked about part 2 is that it takes place in Thailand, i thought that events happening in unfamiliar territory is always fun, and the director captured some very lovely scenes of the city adding a nice flavor to the film.I was also surprised with several scenes that were unexpected to me, "" again probably because i avoided the trailer "", the story was fun and of course similar to the first, but kept me interested enough. i liked the action scenes they added to the plot, made it a bit more lively.As i mentioned earlier, im not a big fan of comedy, and i thought many scenes that were suppose to be funny ended up being ridiculous and lame, but that is just me. however, there were some scenes that were actually funny and i laughed out loud at.I like Bradly Cooper, and Ed helms was funny. I however, find Zach Galifiankis a bit annoying, and he seems to play the same character in all his movies "" Due date ? "", but the Asian guy Jeong seems even more annoying, they both don't seem naturally funny to me. I loved the Monkey though !! :)to end up, i thought it was a better experience for me than the first, some funny scenes and a good enough plot. Loved the Thailand scenes, and the monkey. enjoyable, i would recommend this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It copied the Hangover... So what?,"Every other review on here outlines basically what happened and how it followed the Hangover to a letter. I can confirm that. There are times where it is the exact same or almost the exact same.....So what? When you are following the comedic formula of what could possibly be the second funniest movie of recent times (Superbad holds #1 by a slim margin in my view) it is not exactly a condemnation of the movie, at least as I see it.The first one was probably funnier by a bit and gets better marks due to the originality but if you liked the first Hangover and did not laugh out loud at least five times you should check your funny bone.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
painful,"It was terrible, I wish I could get back the last 102 mins of my life that I spent on this dreadful movie. If it wasn't for the exotic and beautiful landscape of Thailand, I would have fallen asleep. The same old formula unfortunately did not work this time around. To say that this was made for an immature, pubescent audience would be an insult to 12 year old boys. This movie is an insult to its audience, period. No wonder Asian countries make movies that portray Americans as rapists or crooks, look at how the main characters behave in Hollywood movies, made for the American male audience. I'd ask for my money back if I saw this at the cinema but thank goodness I watched it online at a European site, for free. Even then, NOT worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A good buzz! The unnecessary action sequences cause it not to be a great hangover!,"It happened again in ""The Hangover Part II"". I am referring to many of the ingenious comedic elements that made the first ""Hangover"" a real crowd pleaser- the magnetic rapport between its three main protagonists or better stated, those pack of wolves; the unpredictability of the narrative structure in the protagonists' ordeal trying to figure out the mania that occurred during their obliterated state; the scene-stealing comments from the eccentric Alan character; and of course ""those pictures"". Sure one could argue that it is more of the same from the original, but if it ain't broke don't fix it or forget it for that matter. ""The Hangover II"" takes place in Thailand a couple of years after the first Hangover mayhem occurred in Vegas. Dentist Stu (Ed Helms) is marrying his lovely young bride in Thailand; however, Stu wants to extract himself from anything close that resembles a ""bachelor party"" due to the toothless mania that happened to him in Vegas. Stu's best buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Doug (Justin Bartha) head east with their wives and kids for Stu's wedding. And even the offbeat Alan attends even though Stu is reluctant with the idea. Into the picture in this one is also Stu fiancée's teenage brother Teddy. And before you could say ""just-one-beer beach bonfire in a Thailand Resort causes Bangkok profound partying"", the madcap fiesta experience returns to the Wolfpack; and Teddy is also along for the ride. Doug does save himself from the forgettable partying by splitting from the bonfire early. I do not want to provide too many more shots on what happened in ""The Hangover II"" because it would then spoil your hangover experience. But let me just say that they don't call it ""bang kok"" for nothing. As in the original, this Hangover flick also gets some zany chow time from the flamboyant villain Mr. Chow, again masterfully played by Ken Jeong. I also loved the cameo work from the great Paul Giamatti. And yes, we do get another scene-stealing Tyson comedic punch in this one from the Champ! In fact, all the performances were as good in the sequel as in the original, but still the top thespian of the Wolfpack pack is Zach Galifianakis, who delivers another comedic brawny performance as the one & only Alan. Director Todd Phillips keeps the pace engaging as he did the first time around, but my only Phillips knock is that in a few scenes he tried to do the whole ""action-comedy"" thing in ""The Hangover Part II"" which made me want to barf, its called ""The Hangover Part II"" not ""Bad Boys II""; nevertheless, another solid directorial orchestration from Phillips. The screen writing team of Phillips and Craig Mazin & Scott Armstrong delivered a funny script outside the whole ""bang bang"" sequences. ""The Hangover Part II"" is a must-see even though you probably will not be as hung over from it as you were when you first had a taste of a cinematic ""Hangover"". **** Good",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Second Hangover...,"""The Hangover Part II"" is the sequel of ""The Hangover"" and I think that the first one was better than the second. That's happened because I think that we were prepared to see a better and more fantastic Hangover than the first and I think that, this did not happen.In ""The Hangover Part II"" Todd Phillips tried to surprise us with some things that happened in the second film but these were not enough to make this movie better than the first. Leading roles in this movie have again the same actors as Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms.Finally I have to say that in this movie it is not that I did not laugh instead I laughed very much but compared to the first movie I laughed less.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Repetitive but funny!,"It's been a few years now since I watched the first part of this movie, but I still have the memories of how much it did make me laugh. I also remember that although most of it was unthinkable in real life, it did not get to a point of idiocy that turned you against the movie. They did manage to live in that fine line where you still accept what you are watching. In the sequel, that line was slightly crossed.On top of that, you have to feel a little disappointed about finding some replays of the elements that made you laugh in the first movie. I always take points away when I see a director that copies himself. A few examples: Stu loses a tooth in the first movie, in the second one he gets a tattoo on his face. Stu gets married to whore, in the second one he has sex with a transsexual. In the first movie they had a Lion, in the second they have a monkey; the bearded guy ""masturbates"" a baby, here he masturbates an old man. And again in both of them, they get involved against some underworld guys.But make no mistake, I know I have not concentrated much on the positives of the movie so far, when the only thing that counts is how much it makes you laugh. And the truth is, I did laugh quite a few times and had a good time watching it. So bring on Hangover 3.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bangkok has them now,"Many claim that the second part of 'The Hangover' is a carbon copy of the first installment but I personally enjoyed both almost the same of course with a few lacks from the second like the element of surprise or better said the major wtf moments. The wolfpack Phil,Stu and Alan are back and this time they're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding but after a night of drinking they end up in Bangkok and just like in the first one, they are trying to find the clue and put together the bits and pieces to find out what really happened during their hangover night. Once again Bradley Cooper,Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis bring more humor and enjoyment to the movie, I mean it's fun to watch these together although we all know Mr.Cooper to play in comedies,lately I enjoy his performances which are a bit more serious (a'la Limitless). The guest appearance at the end is a pleasant surprise. I can't tell you that this movie is perfect because it has it's lacks but if you really loved the first one than you probably will love this one as well despite what critics say.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
its a sequel. GET IT?,"Hilarious.But for those who've given this less than ten and complained about it being similar to the first movie: Its a sequel...get over it. In fact the film is funnier for following the rubric of the first. Repetition if done correctly in comedy is absolute gold. Re-occurring jokes create symmetry. If you fail to see the humour in the repetition from the first than you missed the biggest joke of the film...shame on you.From another perspective what else can you do in a movie called the hangover II? really not much, its a painted corner, but a corner that was peppered with just outrageous jokes from start to finish.

"Still pretty fun and much darker than the first, but misses the heart and joy of the original. Also, it's a little racist.","I'm revisiting comedies from the 2000s and 2010s to answer one question: why do American comedies suck nowadays?The Hangover Part II is better than the original in some ways. Visually, the film looks fantastic; it really captures the heat and humidity of Thailand and the seediness of Bangkok. The movie looks sweaty and dirty, which complements the overall darker and more intense tone of the movie. When it wants to show us the lush beauty of Southeast Asia, it does that...but realistically, this movie is about a long night gone very wrong, that really isn't its intention. While it's hard to top the bright lights of the Vegas Strip, this movie comes close by bringing us down to the gutter and making Bangkok feel like a real character.Speaking of characters, Cooper, Helms, and Galifinakis are still great. In fact, I feel like their characters are even better defined in this one than the last one. They still have great chemistry, even if the plot stretches the limits of credulity when it comes to hand waving Alan's antics away. Aside from the core three, everyone is a bit weaker. Poor Justin Bartha is once again relegated to the sidelines, which kind of sucks for the guy, and while I don't expect he'd change the movie fundamentally, they could've done something different with him.Part II is also a category of comedy that we REALLY don't see anymore: the Hard R. Whereas the first sometimes comes off as wanting to be a bit edgier than it needs to be (I found this mostly with Bradley Cooper's Phil, to be honest), this one pulls absolutely no punches. There's a lot in here that will absolutely shock and offend. (This movie is well over 10 years old, so I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but the um...this film's primary ""stripper character"" is um...definitely more intense that Heather Graham)Now, for the elephant in the room. Is this movie racist? Kind of. I'm just going to come out with it, this movie rubs me (and a lot of people) the wrong way. There's a casual dismissiveness and ugliness in the way the characters treat and talk about Thailand and Asia in general. I know part of it is supposed to be a parody of the ""ugly American"", but I didn't find a lot of it particularly funny. Call me a sensitive snowflake, who cares. Given how little Americans know about the rest of the world, it just strikes me as poor taste to actively REPRODUCE stereotypes over and over again. There are so many scenes where the joke seems to be ""the white guys are ignorant of something"" and that's basically it.Take the Asian characters, for example. Chow is basically - there's no sugarcoating this - the worst aspects of Asian male stereotypes in America hodge podged together. I know Ken Jeong has defend the performance and I respect that, but a spade's a spade. That he had to defend it is kind of saying something right?Jamie Chung's Lauren is non-existent and while I know the ""wife"" character isn't supposed to have much of a role in these movies, she's essentially painted as the ""desirable submissive Asian woman"" throughtout the movie (where she has like, 4 lines). Her Dad is basically the super strict Tiger Dad stereotype, Teddy the Asian whiz kid...you get the point.Yes, there are some fun moments, but it's not as gleeful or fun loving as the first one. It's darker and more messed up. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just...not as enjoyable, for me, personally.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why All of the Bad Reviews?,"The Hangover 2 was absolutely hilarious. If you liked the first Hangover, then you will definitely like the second one as well.I watched the movie on Friday and had read reviews that said the movie was awful and that it wasn't funny so I was a bit disappointed. Still though, considering I loved the first one I had to watch the second one despite all of the negative reviews.Only half an hour into the movie I was already laughing. To people who said ""I only laughed once"" or ""I didn't laugh one time"" well they just don't have a sense of humor, or they are just trying to hate on this movie because it's successful.Another critique I read of the Hangover 2 was that it was too similar like the first one. Well, DUH!! It's the HANGOVER. Obviously the two movies are going to have similarities. I actually thought they did a great job of making it a good sequel to the first one.

Entertaining,"This movie, about Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug who jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding, is a good sequel to The Hangover (2009)!I do not think it is for everyone. It has a lot of crude humor mixed with lighter jokes, and the story leans heavily on that. For me, it is a mix of decent entertainment and nostalgia, which makes it mostly enjoyable. The situation in the movie is wild and absurd, with plenty of funny and random moments. The performances are great too, and my favorite character is one of the protagonist, Alan Garner. I love his quirky personality - it really stands out, and his opinions, statements, and reactions can be unexpectedly hilarious. The cinematography, action, and stunts are solid as well. Overall, it is a movie you do not need to pay full attention to, but it still keeps you entertained.This movie sticks to its predecessor's formula, delivering chaos and laughs.

Copy & Pate Sequel Yet Still Enjoyable,"Hangover Part II sees the return of Alan, Phil, Stu, and Doug, otherwise known as The Wolfpack, join forces yet again for another incredible and wild adventure.

But after a night of unknown events and wild moments, the gang except Doug find themselves waking up to a hotel room in Bangkok where they meet up with none other than Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) in this fun and entertaining sequel.The new characters are a great addition, the comedic chemistry with the actors in many of the scenes seem to do the trick, and it was able to give me quite a ton of laughs throughout the film. However, this movie does follow under the same line as most sequels do and that is known as ""copy and paste everything and change up the premise a bit"". Not saying that it's a bad thing, but if you've watched the first movie and probably know it by heart, then chances are that you too will notice the similarities between this movie and the first one.

Inferior follow-up,"They're all back, they're in Thailand, and they don't remember a thing. Again.

This time it's Stu (Helms) who is about to be married and his friends are in Thailand for the wedding with Alan (Galifianakis) being brought along out of pity. However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens. And while a member of the party is, again, missing, this time it's his future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) who is nowhere to be found. And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of 'green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a ""green comedy"". Whatever aesthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Child Prostitution Joke in Hangover II,"DO NOT go see HANGOVER II. It was APPALLING, DISGUSTING, and EXTREMELY SICK. About half way through the movie, there was a scene where the main characters went into a stripper bar in Bangkok, looking for the groom's 16 year old, soon to be brother in law. While working their way towards the middle to speak with the owner, they bypass tens of young looking, teenage looking girls working as strippers. They finally get to the owner, and he remembers them from the night before and is looking to sell them his gun. The men tell him ""we are looking for a boy"", and he answers ""$2000"". Thinking the owner is referring to the gun, they are shocked and answer ""what??"". The owner then says, ""$2000. What age do you want"" referring obviously to child prostitution. As I sat there in my seat, wanting to puke to death, my wife and I looked at each other and immediately got up and left the movie theater. But even more APPALLING, DISGUSTING, and DISTURBING than the child prostitution joke was the fact that from the 300 people in the movie theater, only two people from the audience decided to leave. I can't sleep right now. I am sick over the entire event. :(",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It too was loud and stupid, but it had enough laughs to keep me interested to the end of the film. Apparently the producers figured that being lewd, crude and obnoxious to an even greater degree was all that was needed for the sequel. After 45 minutes of this mess, I had not even cracked a smile. I was even willing to bet that the government of Thailand was seriously regretting ever having issued a filming permit (maybe they didn't issue a permit). In any event, this movie lacked any humor or other redeeming social value. After the tasteless scene in the Ladyboy bar, I had enough and called it quits.

A great remake,"The Wolfpack is back! And are they ever!! Comedy sequels make it tough to get back to the level of excitement you remember from the first, when it was new and uncharted. If it's great, you never look down at your watch until it's over; and then you want an hour more! You want to view it again to get all of the lines you may have missed. The first Hangover did that to me. When the second one was announced I had the anticipation of a little kid and the great fear that it would ruin everything the first one did.Hangover 2 brought the Pack, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) to the exotic Bangkok, Thailand for Stu's nuptials. Without giving away any of the story, director Todd Phillips worked off of the cast's chemistry and expanded upon it. You can tell in the movie that there are several points of improvisation. Phillips uses the full screen and back shots to entertain you, so pay attention. For a comedy, the cinematography was very well done and timely. Really, if you don't pay attention to the full screen, you will miss a lot in this movie. With the scene changes and camera angles, you can tell that this is not a low budget comedy thrown together to appease the demand for another Hangover. This movie is extremely crude and not something I am watching with my mother. Get ready for HUGE shock factor.I would say the movie is more of remake with changes than a sequel; but when you have a great comedy isn't that what you are trying to get out of the final product? This movie is never going to get an Oscar, but it should get an MTV Movie Award. By far the funniest movie of the year and very well done.

"If you like the first, you'll like this one","I thought ""Hangover"" was funny, but I wasn't in love with it like most people I know. It was just a slapstick-type of movie that wasn't very memorable for me. The second is a carbon copy. So if you liked the first one, you should like the second one. I really don't get those who low-rate it (Roeper) simply because it's like the first. The fact that the same formula was used does not in and of itself make it a ""bad"" movie, which is the biggest dig I hear about the sequel. No. A good movie is a good movie...even if it's like its predecessor.I'm giving the movie a 7 because it was HILARIOUS. Raunchy as all get-out, maybe a little too much so at some points, but still it delivers what it sets out to deliver: mouth-wide-open at how far they dare to go shock mixed with fun and humor and even a little sentimentalism. That's the takeaway from this movie. It is EXACTLY what you think, what you expect, what you are hoping for. It is a movie customized for its audience. That's all it is and that's all it promises to be and if you liked the first one, leave your over-expectation at the door and just enjoy an encore.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

pretty good,this sequel to the first movie is pretty good for anyone who enjoyed the first movie with another brilliant plot and great humour.this time its stues wedding and they're going all the way to thailand for it. they try to stop another one of these things happening but after a drink on the beach it happens all over again this time they lose teddy the brides brother and have to find him before the wedding.this movie in a way felt like a remake just with different things happening to them and replacing the old things with new things . but still this is a good movie and anyone who liked the first movie should like this one.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
yawnnnnnn,"I really think people have no minds of their own. The Hangover part 1 was tame and hardly funny. It was liked a watered-down made for TV wannabe Old School. Hangover 2 comes around and it is almost the same thing as the first movie.. basically all the funny parts are in the trailer and Galifianakis failing as the wild crazy guy. Maybe that's the problem, Galifianakis is so boring and can't deliver his lines right. I think the first movie was better even if it did suck balls. How bad does Hangover part 2 suck? Well, I'm writing this review while watching this movie. I didn't want to waste the time. I'm One hour and twenty minutes into it so I've seen most of it. Just to make sure this review is 100% dead on I'll make sure to hit the send button once this movie is over.A much better movie to check out would be Bridesmaids. It was something that the Hangover part 2 was... it was funny.This movie is an hour and a half of your life that you will not get back. Avoid it and or don't waste money renting it. I hope they do come out with a part 3 just so the same lame morons that waste money on this series can waste more money. People really need to start thinking for themselves and stop believing a movie is funny or good or not just because some film critic tells them it is.Thank goodness.. it is almost over. Bangkok should be wilder than this.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%SPOILER############################I was wondering when Mike would make an appearance in this movie.

"""It happened again.""","I get it now. I think I read that each film in this trilogy was practically the same, but I guess I forgot. I suppose it's also because you have to experience it to understand it: and reading about it doesn't have much effect. I've experienced it. This film was pretty much the same as the first one with minor differences, like the setting, the one getting married, and how certain things in the first film play out in this one. I must've thought that it's not that alike. But the first film worked, so I understand why they recycled it.I liked the little variety this time compared to the first film by using the knowledge of the previous events in a self-aware/meta sort of way, only for that to be one thing that wasn't 100% the same as before. And even though some people didn't like this one as much or disliked it, it had a box office of $586.8 million from an $80 million budget. You can't argue with those numbers: this film worked, too.As shown by my rating, which is lower than what I gave the first one, I didn't enjoy it as much. I can't accurately say whether the similarity is to blame for that, in the sense that I already saw the first film, so this one didn't have as much of an effect. But generally, I feel like it just wasn't as good as the first one.Even other aspects, like the soundtrack, and the cinematography, weren't as good. Don't get me wrong: both were still decent. More than that, to be fair. They just weren't quite up-to-par with the first film. Especially the soundtrack, to an extent: which seemed to disappear further into the film; the first few songs were good.Everything seemed to blend better in the first film, the song choices, the editing, and the cinematography: things just fell into place/were right, maybe with some luck. With this film, it's like those elements were on the right track but only there, and that sweet spot eluded. There wasn't any synergism. But maybe there wasn't any of that in the first film, and the novelty aspect was what made everything feel complementary.The performances by our three leads were good and better than in the first film. Their chemistry seemed stronger. Ed Helms ramped up his performance in this one compared to the first one, and it, surprisingly, wasn't that bad; he/his character was the weakest in the first film. Zach Galifianakis (whose performance seemed ramped up as well, or more so his character) and Bradley Cooper did a good job again, as expected. I still like Bradley's performance/his character the most, just like in the first one. I guess it's a matter of the personality his character has. It allows a charismatic nonchalant performance, and that does so much, even for the overall film.One thing that took me by surprise and realization was Yasmin Lee. I remember knowing she appeared in one of these films, and that was so long ago, so I completely forgot. I think I already knew who she was, but I'm not sure. I don't think that's how I came to know about her. Now, I can confidently say that I do know who she is. She is hot, attractive, beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, etc. You guys should check out some of her ""stuff.""So, yeah. This film was enjoyable enough, and aspects like the soundtrack, cinematography, and performances were good, although the first two seemed better in the first one. Even though my rating may imply otherwise, this film was entertaining; I still enjoyed the first one more.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Don't bother, you've seen it already.","The Hangover Part II is the inevitable sequel to a film, which proved that comedies that were unfunny, unlikeable and thoroughly boring could be both commercial and critical hits. This one proves that they can have equally unfunny, unlikeable and thoroughly boring sequels.The film picks up two years after the events of the first film, with Stu (Ed Helms) preparing to fly over to Thailand for his wedding. Along comes Phil (Bradley Cooper) and, to everyone's dismay, Alan (Zack Galifianakis). Finally, they all wake up in a sleazy hotel room in inner city Bangkok with someone missing and a wedding to get to.One of the main problems with The Hangover Part II is that it follows the exact structure of the first one, almost scene by scene, making it about as worthwhile as one of Haneke's or Van Sant's shot-for-shot remakes. There are no changes beyond the location and the species of animal that they have to deal with. Smugness pervades as we are dragged from one tired set piece to another without any improvements made to the equally tired formula of the first film. The lack of character development isn't a shock, however, as it has been clearly shown before that these are not characters; these are loud, screaming, incredibly irritating voids. Alan is still weird, Stu is still having trouble asserting himself, Phil is still a child, Mr. Chow (a grating Ken Joeng) jumps out of something and everything stops for another terrible musical number. The idea seems to be that people will be happy to pay to see the first film again if you alter some slight details.It took three writers to string all of this together, an incoherent film filled with bits and pieces held together by a structure that has proved entirely unsuccessful. It's a mystery film in which people look back at things that have already happened. We know the outcome and we can guess the reason, so why bother showing us. For example, Stu wakes up with the much-litigated Tyson tattoo. Why did he get it? Because he was drunk. Do we really need the film to get bogged down in the intricacies of how he got it?It is worth pointing out that none of this would particularly matter if the film was funny. Comedy is probably the only genre which can be gravely terrible in every way, but which can get away with it if it is funny. These films aren't funny, because the characters aren't well drawn and the situations they get into just aren't believable. They aim for outlandish but manage only to become fantasy. At least Dude, Where's My Car? was clever enough to become complete science fiction, rather than trying to convince the audience that all this could happen. Ultimately, however, the film just isn't funny because it lacks any conceivable wit, uses only tried-and-tested jokes and repeats them again and again. And then a couple more times after that.If you like The Hangover then just watch it again. If you don't, then pay for something worthwhile.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can we please end this franchise now???,"The Hangover had a real hit with the original and has really lost its way ever since. This trash is just a pale karaoke version of the original. The problem with this sequel isn't that the humor is overly crass or that it tries to be funny but fails miserably, (well, maybe that is a HUGE problem after all) it's that there's no substance or heart to go along with it. You simply don't care about these guys this time around. Can we please end this franchise now???Are a few laughs worth wasting 110 minutes of time? For me, the answer is a resounding ""No!"" There are far more promising avenues to explore with the ""Wolf Pack"" but all they give us here is a rehash of a better film. Putting aside the juvenile humor that is uneven, all that's left is a woefully underwritten motion picture that spends all it's time as a rehash before taking an ill-advised detour into mawkish sentimentality.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Best of the 3 in the series,"Never a dull moment while the Wolfpack is over in Thailand- not Vegas. The insanity has gone international this time.

It does help if you have seen the first one or you will be a tad lost So if you haven't seen the Hangover (The first one) then watch it before you see this one. All of the original cast from the first one returns for this sequel. But fair warning; they don't hold back on ANYTHING! This one pushes it to the limit, which is part of what makes it so great.

The Hangover Part II' is disappointing,"Anyone who swears by 'The Hangover' is likely to be disappointed by its sequel, which as it turns out is a carbon copy of the earlier film. With 'The Hangover Part II', director Todd Phillips has made the exact same movie all over again. Except that he's set it in Thailand, and the jokes aren't that funny anymore. So once again, a bachelor party spins out of control and the guys wake up the next morning with no memory of the previous night's misadventures, only to realize that someone is missing. From there, it's a mad rush trying to retrace their steps and to put the pieces together. Two years ago, 'The Hangover' crept into our cinemas quietly. With a cast of mostly unknowns and a director who was hardly A-list, the film arrived with no expectations whatsoever. Yet, that ribald comedy went down as 2009's biggest surprise hit thanks to the novelty of its premise and the unpredictability of its characters and their behavior. Remember how shocked you were when one of them pretends to jerk off a baby? Or when they discover a tiger in the bathroom? Or when Mike Tyson shows up? The new film doesn't work because it's missing that element of surprise. That joy of stumbling into an outrageous, unexpected joke has all but vanished in 'The Hangover Part II', whose gags feel so familiar that you wonder why you're paying to watch the same film again. Our heroes Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up not in a Caesar's Palace suite on this occasion, but a fleabag hotel in Bangkok. Instead of finding a baby or a tiger in their hotel room, they find a chain-smoking monkey. And Ed, who's the groom-to-be this time round, doesn't wake up with a tooth missing, but with a tattoo on his face. Gross gags are plenty in this sequel, as you would expect from a comedy set in the seedy streets of Bangkok. In 'The Hangover' Stu woke up to discover he'd married a stripper. In this sequel, let's just say he's done something far more shocking. Mr Chow (Ken Jeong), that effeminate criminal from the earlier film returns too, and shows us more of himself than we'd like to see. They even repeat the end credits photo montage, a clever way to fill in the blanks from the blackout night; but while it's more adult this time, it doesn't have the same comic impact as it did in 'The Hangover'. The biggest disappointment in this film is Zach Galifianakis, who reprises his role as bearded man-child Alan. After practically stealing the earlier film with his hilarious one-liners and his deadpan delivery, Galifianakis plays Alan as a not-particularly-lovable weirdo this time. The only scenes in which we see that old spark are the ones in which Alan takes an instant dislike to Stu's brother-in-law who he fears is threatening to infiltrate the Wolfpack. 'The Hangover Part II' is not without a few laughs, but the operative word here is 'few'. The best jokes in this film, incidentally all appear in the trailer. I'm going with two out of five for 'The Hangover Part II'. Prepare to be seriously underwhelmed.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If you like laughing, then see this movie.","I went into it expecting it to be bad because of all of the negative reviews out there (especially on this board), but I was laughing pretty much the entire time. This movie is definitely worth seeing. The overarching plot is almost the exact same as the first one but there are enough plot surprises in this one to keep you locked in and the movie is just plain hilarious pretty much the entire time. The setting (Thailand--or 'Thigh-land' as Alan pronounces it) was more interesting/entertaining than the first, and the lines were funnier on the whole and the movie was more over the top in general. If you can get past the fact that it was virtually the same plot, then I'd say it was more entertaining than the first.Anyone who says this isn't worth seeing is either extremely jaded and needs to reassess their life, or they just don't have a sense of humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The comedy is the only thing that makes up for it, and I love Paul Giamatti's small role. The level of shock humor is still the same as the first though; overall, it felt like this huge re-hash of the first, but in Thailand. I still enjoy this movie, but not as great as I remember it being.Overall: 5.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Been There, Done That (But Still Funny)","While 2011 had its share of misfires in theaters, none were so insulting as THE HANGOVER PART II. Not because of it's darker humor and edgier content as compared to the first movie. I'm cool with that. Not even because I thought it was a bad movie; in fact, if you view the movie as a standalone (rather than a sequel) it's still a pretty funny flick. No, the movie is insulting because it's the exact same movie as the first. Now, I was a fan of the first movie and would probably include it in my top ten favorite from 2009 but that doesn't mean a studio can regurgitate the same exact film to me in a different setting. If you've seen the first film, the plot is near identical but here's the rundown anyway: Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand and invites his fellow Wolf Pack along for the celebration. Despite actively trying to avoid a repeat of the events in Las Vegas, he awakens the morning after an innocent beer on the beach with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) in a rundown Bangkok motel room. Stu realizes his fiancé's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) hassurprise!...gone missing at some point during their night-long bender. Time is running out as the three hapless members of the Wolf Pack comb the dangerous streets of Bangkok for Teddy before the wedding is ruined. Sound familiar? I thought so. And it gets worse than that.Director Todd Phillips and the screenwriters essentially treated the original HANGOVER like a Mad Libs, erasing key words and phrases and substituting new elements in their place. The filmmakers' laziness goes well beyond rehashing the same plot in a new locale. The tiger from the first movie is replaced with a Buddhist monk, the baby is replaced with a drug-peddling monkey, and Stu's missing tooth is traded for a Mike Tyson facial tattoo. Celebrity cameos? We've got them too: Paul Giamatti as a local crime boss and Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. A familiar face from the first film even makes a bonus appearance at the end of the movie just to seal the connection (but I won't spill details in case you haven't seen it). Oh, and speaking of the end of the movie: can you guess how it ends? If you answered with ""a series of photos depicting the debauchery of the missing night just like the first movie"", you're either a mediocre psychic or possess common sense. I'm serious: beat for beat, this movie follows the same formula as the first movie. And it made ridiculous money at the box office. Warner Bros must've been laughing all the way to the bank on this one. If they hadn't been released in such close proximity, I'd have guess it was revenge for the poor reception towards their GREEN LANTERN box office bomb. As if my rant hasn't been enough proof, I'm really aggravated with how we were cheated here.But it's not a terrible movie. It's still funny. Not as funny as the last one, granted, but you can't expect the gags to carry the same weight when we've seen them before. The Bangkok setting and the audience's preconception of the city as the ultimate cesspool of transsexual prostitutes and underage sex slaves give the story the chance to move into darker territory. If you thought Stu's marriage to a stripper was rough luck in the first movie, he's get it a whole lot worse here. The entire original cast return to reprise their roles and, seeing as how they demonstrated their awesome buddy chemistry in the first movie, we have no reason to worry that they won't deliver. Galifianakis has some great moments in this movie. I loved his awkward dinner speech and there's a great moment about halfway through the movie where we see the world through his eyes (he envisions himself and his friends as kids as they tear through Bangkok in drugged out party-mode). Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow and, while his schtick wears a little thin at times, he's still good for some funny. If you haven't seen the first HANGOVER, there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie more than the rest of us. As a standalone movie, it works (as long as you're not easily offended/overly conservative). For the rest of us, it's a retread of old territory so blatant that you know you've been cheated by the end but the Wolf Pack is a fun enough group of guys that it doesn't suck so bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A mild hangover of laughs, still one for 'Hangover' fans","Although laughs are limited in this, compared to it's predecessor, this inevitable sequel is still a fun watch, thanks the chemistry of the actors, or more importantly the Brat Pack. Again they end up in one hell of a bungle, where someone else goes missing, and worse they've landed in Bangkok, the appearances changed somewhat too. I admit the chimpanzee, who like Mr Chow, becomes soul mates with fruit loop, Allen, stole the scenes. It was great to see the wonderful Nick Cassavettes as Tattoo Joe, too. This sequel still works as just scraping by on it's short amount of laughs. It does have it's moments, like in the dressing room of a strip club, the one where the women are packing the wrong equipment down below, as the pack retrace their steps. Too, check out Stu's different lyrical version of Billy's Joel's Allentown. Plus we've got Allen too, more funnier in this one. We have a surprise visit at the end too, appearing at Stu's marriage do, (remember his intolerable ex) from the first one. I did love the end, of course, with Murray Head's song ""One night in Bangkok"", but that's like a cruel taunt, in view of the hell, the pack have just been through.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Of course, they don't remember anything from last night. This is where an adventure full of hilarious events and bizarre characters begins.The cast is great, they fit their characters perfectly.

It is Chow who brings an extra dimension of fun with his bizarre escapades and makes the film incredibly entertaining.The soundtrack is perfectly integrated into the film, which is a very important aspect of any film.Like the first part, this film could not be made today, comedy is almost dead today, only a few brave comedians keep it alive.

Not great ..but OK,2nd version is not as great as 1st though but for fun you can watch it. Most of time it is quite similar to 1st one; guys hangout before marriage and suddenly woke up in Bangkok and start same story again .. one guy is missing and they search whole Bangkok and find it in same building ... So every time is quite predictable. Alan is act like dumb ass and every time he open mouth he spoke totally against the event.. There was some hype about monkey ; but I don't think there is anything good about it.. there is very few scene of monkey and there is nothing extraordinary about it.

Dreadful rehash of the original,"There's barely a laugh to be had in ""The Hangover - Part 2,"" a dreadful sequel to the original box office smash from 2009.This time the boys - and I do mean ""boys"" - are trapped in Thailand, where they've gone to celebrate Stu's nuptials and where they immediately fall into a series of misadventures after a riotous night of bachelor party celebration in Bangkok, all of which has been mysteriously erased from their collective memory.I wish I could say that, from all this, hilarity ensues. But I would be lying. As with most big-budget studio comedies these days, the tone and the performances are pitched so over-the-top that the audience winds up feeling assaulted rather than entertained long before the closing credits come rolling by. To that end, the screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's ""Community"" - have been added to the cast.By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - ""The Hangover - Part2"" is a colossal bomb.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Dark, Twisted, Sick and Brilliant","Many critics of this film complain that it's a ""copy of the original"" and isn't ""original"" enough to stand on its own. Honestly, this is a bad thing? To many sequels to good or great movies were disappointments because they tried too hard to mess with the original's winning formula. This movie isn't one of them; all the things that made the first one great haven't been tampered with and (without giving anything away) it can be safely said that the humor is A LOT darker.

Don't get me wrong, I still found the movie quite entertaining, some of the gags where outrageously funny, but all the time it seemed like I was watching the first movie again, with a few new ideas inserted, and a lot more emphasis put on the shocking-funny kind of jokes.

However one thing annoyed me, and that was Alan. He is a lot more immature and he is a lot more annoying in this movie than the first. Zach Galifianakis'recent film, Due Date was another example of how irritating his character can be and it ruined the movie for me a little.However if you loved the original you will love the sequel!

Lazy piece of work that reeks of mediocrity,"Precisely two years ago, 'The Hangover' had swept the audience off their feet with its cleverly written humor and making a sequel is a humongous challenge. But Todd Phillips and his team seem to have run out of ideas and merely copy-pasted the first film. Essentially, the cast and the conflict are retained and only the setting is changed.So, what are the changes? Vegas tuns into Bangkok; the tiger is now a drug dealing monkey; instead of the groom, the bride's teenage brother goes missing; it's an old monk instead of an abandoned baby; Stu falls for a stripper then, now err, ahem, let's leave it unsaid; Stu's girlfriend was mean back then and it's his father-in-law belittling him now; spiked drink then, drugged marshmallows now; the list is endless.Stu is all set to be married to Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Bangkok. Not wanting to face another disaster, Stu limits the celebrations to a bachelor brunch and keeps Alan away, only letting him in later, albeit reluctantly. After a 'just one drink' night by the bonfire, the suddenly wake up in a seedy hotel in Bankok's by-lanes. Like the first film, the rest of the story is about finding their friend and making it to the wedding.Those who have seen the first will find nothing new in the second and newbies may miss out on humor having roots in the original. The film does have some genuinely funny moments, like Alan's dinner speech and Stu's song on the boat, but those come between long lulls. The lack of surprise is covered up with explicit scenes and dark stuff like chopped fingers and a guy losing pulse that are unfunny.The cast is the same and their roles don't change much. Zach Galifianakis as Alan, the weirdo is still the star, but hasn't he become predictable? Remember his similar role in 'Due Date', again by the same director? Bradley Cooper continues as the more balanced Phil and Ed Helms is still a wimp who manages a show of temper towards the end. Ken Jeong has a bigger role as Mr Chow that has been played over the top.Even if the movie makers were granted a benefit of doubt that the audience expected too much, it doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to come up with something good. They could have experimented with Doug in a bigger role or getting Alan married. And Bangkok is not 'some Asian city' as they call it when it is a bustling metropolis.Per se, it doesn't really hurt to watch it since it's better than many brain-dead comedies. But in giving it a chance, you could be flirting with disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Racism or lack of creativity?,"It's a disgusting defense of the ""n"" word when the director claims that they're using it to show the ignorance of the character. Maybe it's the lack of creativity on the part of the writers to come up with anything else to show Zach's character as an idiot. Really? All these writers couldn't come up with anything else? Pathetic. What went through their minds when they wrote it, not just once, but often? And the actors are defending it's use, as well. Are they all that sheltered in Hollywood? I'm sure they're paid well to be creative and it makes me sick that kids have to hear that word in a blockbuster movie. There's no need. If you're really clever you can come up with all sorts of ways to add to that character's personality flaws. I think that director has plenty himself.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's a good comedy,"This film is about a group of friends in Bangkok, having a bachelor party that spins out of control.""The Hangover Part II"" is aptly called, because it is basically a continuation of the original. It's a plot we have seen before. Even though it is very funny, it has lost the novelty and surprise factor, so ""The Hangover Part II"" has not got the amazing hilarity of ""The Hangover"". It's a good comedy, it's just that ""The Hangover"" set the bar too high, that makes the sequel almost impossible to surpass. And I was wondering why Alan became bald, and why Teddy lost his finger. I thought these subplots got lost, but the answers are finally revealed in the end credits.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good sequel with plenty of laughs !MINOR SPOILERS!,"I had heard many negative things about the 'Hangover Part II' however nonetheless I went and saw it in cinemas 2 weeks after release. The first thing that hit me was the similarity it has with the first one. It starts off with the phone call from Phil telling their friends at the wedding that they really 'f***ed up this time.' From there it follows the same course that the first one did however this didn't affect the quality of the film too much. I believe the story and 'twist' was much smarter and thought out than the first one. However some things such as the quality of the acting, repetitivity and things that just didn't make sense, really brought down the rating from a potential 8 to a 6. Yet this is a must see for all that watched the first one and hopefully Todd Phillips can give us a different and equally funny conclusion to this Trilogy. Story - 7, Some minor loopholes but a fantastic twist in the end. Screenplay - 6, funny but very similar to the first. Cinematography - 7,gives a great perspective of Bangkok and was the high of the film. Acting - 5, Not as good as the first one and at times very unrealistic especially with characters Phil and Stu.In conclusion 'The Hangover Part II' lived up to expectations but was somewhat downgraded to a 6 due to some unrealistic acting, minor loopholes and repetitivity from the first film. I look forward the third and (hopefully) final chapter in the hangover series and I am interested in seeing where Todd Phillips will take 'three best friends' next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Monkey shines,"After reading reviews from critics I respect, I was reluctant to see this film, which I heard was an inferior copy of the original. I totally loved the original, and had limited hopes for this one. So I was pleasantly surprised. Don't take this as a recommendation.Some potentially hilarious scenes are a fizzle, such as the bit with the monk. Some scenes are more gross than funny, such as Samir's night club with the pole dancers. But there is one element that is priceless: the monkey. Especially the later scenes with the monkey. I usually don't like monkeys in movies, but this is the best performance by a monkey I have ever seen. A lot of the performance is probably CGI, but still . . .",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A lot better that I was expecting.,"THE HANGOVER PART III was not a fan of the first one... I didn't really like it and it didn't think it was very funny. This one was better.The film was yet another adventurous trip for the 3 best friends... the problem is, nobody remembers what they did yesterday... again!The same cast came back in this and they were OK. The movie starred Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha & Ken Jeong. I like Bradley Cooper... he is a good actor and he does a good job in this. Ed Helms was OK... he was supposed to be worried about his future brother in law through this film, but he didn't look too bothered at some points. Not a very realistic reaction. Zach Galifianakis is annoying. He has not made any good movies that I have seen... and he is irritating in most films I have seen. Frenemy being the worst. The star of the film is definitely Ken Jeong... I love this guy in Community and he brings that same characteristic to these movies.There are some really funny scenes in this film. The most shocking and funniest scene is where Ed finds out that he cheated on his fiancé with a ladyboy! Oh my god... I laughed so much.Iron Mike Tyson makes another appearance in this movie... blimey! That man might be one of the greatest boxers of all time, but he can't sing at all. It was awful.Watching this film has made me want to watch the first one again. I don't remember much of it... but I do remember I didn't like it much. Maybe I wasn't really in the mood for it. I will give it another go now because of this.I will give this film 6 out of 10.A good movie with some good laugh out loud moments... but also has some bad moments too.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't see it again for the very first time,"Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.comDon't see it again for the very first time...Let me ask you a couple of questions. Did you like the original ""The Hangover""? Did you ever wonder what it would be like if you took that film and put a Bangkok, Thailand green screen over it? If you answered yes to both of these questions, well stranger, boy do I have a film for you. If you realized my second question was sarcastic than goooooood for yoooooooooou (it's hard to write sarcasm).I answered yes to that first question but not so much to the second, and as I feared ""The Hangover Part ll"" is nothing more than an unimaginative carbon copy to Todd Phillip's wildly successful 2009 original. By no means is the original a masterpiece, but it was a lot of fun. That fun came from the films mystery element of being right there with the three bewildered men's night of debauchery and trying to figure where the story was going to take you next. This time around the notorious Wolf Pack's ride is raunchier and it's not that you won't laugh, and it's not that you won't cringe from time to time but all of that devious mystery is gone as beat by beat it's paint by numbers in this numbing sequel.Wanter of the quiet life, Stu (Ed Helms), is getting married to a very nice Thai girl named Lauren (don't look for more female development than that- not one of Todd Phillips strong suits). Making their trip to Thailand for the wedding is the morally challenged Phil (Bradley Cooper), the perpetual bi@%# of the group Doug (Justin Bartha) who's 15 minutes on screen is used for nothing more than to tell us the other guys have done wrong, and the reluctantly invited, socially handicapped Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After almost a shot for shot recreation of the celebration toast, things once again go very awry, as they wake up in a gritty and dirty Bangkok hotel with no recollection of how they got there. Only this time they lost Lauren's 17-year old brother Teddy played by Mason Lee (director Ang Lee's son) with only one of his severed fingers remaining in the room.Todd Phillip's and crew try to push the envelope as much as they can, which includes Stu and a Thai prostitute. Oh wait, didn't Stu have an encounter with a Vegas prostitute played by Heather Graham in the first film- SO LAZY! Phillip's might see all these recurrences as a love letter to the first film, but to me it appears as much more of a love letter to making money. These are talented actors who have an excellent rapport together. Galifinakas has the funny one-liners for the most part and Ken Jeong makes a hilarious return as Mr. Chow the Chinese gangster.Phillip is on record saying that he imagines the series ending as a trilogy, let's just hope for the finale he can change things up more than just the location.

not as good as the first,"My girlfriend and I went to watch this movie last weekend having waited 4-5 weeks since its UK release date. We loved the first one and I can honestly say the first movie is funniest film I have ever seen. Before watching numero uno, I had no idea what the film was about, except the title of the movie was a slight give away. Having no idea of the plot, characters and whom was starring in the movie think helped in the surprise element of how good 1 actually was.It was my attempt on number 2 to approach it in the same light however difficult it was from its constant trailers and marketing. However I made sure I didn't watch any trailers and when friends spoke about what they had seen before me I would put both hands over both ears and declare repetition of 'la, la, la, la la la' so no spoilers would reach me.Now having seen part 2 I was surprised the film was good (not as good) but still some fantastic laugh out moments if not as many as part 1. Ed Helms for me steals the show with his amazing energy on screen and on this occasion Mr Chow played by ken jeong makes more of a contribution to the plot which is fun if not just a tad over the top.Quick plot, Stu is getting married this time and is enforced to have a bachelor party of his own, however it is agreed that this would be of a much quieter affair. However, things don't actually go to plan. Its a fun packed joy ride of a film. i wont say anymore except, I need to be honest, you need to have seen the 1st movie to even consider watching this flick and it is purely designed for fans of the 1st.6 or 7 out of 10?? Haven't made up my mind yet?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Wild, Yet Familiar Adventure","Plot: ""The Hangover Part II"" takes audiences on another uproarious journey filled with debauchery and misadventures, as the Wolfpack reunites for yet another bachelor party gone wrong. This time, the gang travels to Bangkok for Stu's wedding, but wake up the next morning to find themselves in a similar state of confusion and chaos as they did in Las Vegas.While the plot follows a similar formula to its predecessor, the film still manages to deliver plenty of laughs and surprises along the way. The outrageous situations and absurd encounters the group finds themselves in are taken to new levels, pushing the boundaries of the original film's comedic mayhem.The chemistry between the cast members remains a highlight of the sequel. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Ken Jeong bring their A-game once again, delivering hilarious performances that play off each other seamlessly. Their comedic timing and improvisational skills are on full display, ensuring a constant stream of laughter throughout the film.Director Todd Phillips maintains the fast-paced and energetic style that made the first film a hit, keeping the audience engaged and entertained. The cinematography captures the vibrant and chaotic atmosphere of Bangkok, providing a visually stimulating backdrop for the wild antics of the Wolfpack.While ""The Hangover Part II"" may lack the surprise factor of its predecessor, it compensates with a higher dose of raunchy humor and outrageous situations. The film does not shy away from pushing boundaries and embracing the absurdity of its premise, resulting in laugh-out-loud moments that are sure to leave audiences entertained.Although the sequel may not surpass the original in terms of freshness and originality, it nonetheless delivers on its promise of delivering a wild and comedic adventure. If you're a fan of the first film and enjoy raucous humor, ""The Hangover Part II"" is an entertaining and laugh-filled ride that will satisfy your craving for more Wolfpack shenanigans.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Good,"I like all of the comedians. Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding. Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry. The writing is meant to make us all laugh and succeeds. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It's meant to be goofy.If you end up watching this, you will probably be like me in saying that it starts off great then gradually begins to suck. It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic.From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. My final rating is 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A lazy rehash of the original, without the laughter or fun","I'm a big fan of the first Hangover. It was hilariously raunchy, but this sequel is the epitome of laziness. Like most movies that are brilliant, they make sequels and somewhat tarnish the impact of the original. There is no passion, and the only purpose this movie serves is to cash in on the original's tremendous success. In many ways, it's the very same movie as the original, only it takes place in Bangkok. I didn't catch myself laughing. I did chuckle a couple times, but that's it. The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is as reliable as ever, but I don't understand the appeal of Ken Jeong. He is so obnoxious, and he's not even funny. Giving him as much screen time as they did was a huge mistake in my view.Final Thoughts: I saw this over a year ago, and I don't remember much of it for a reason. I've yet to see the third sequel, but I am not looking forward to it, if it's as lazy as this one4.7/10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
6 or 7/10?,"Somewhere between, that's where. Sure, part two copies part part one, but that was so darned good, why spoil a formula that works? At least the cultures as well as the continents have changed and like Las Vegas, Bangkok is a hedonistic tourist magnet, where, it seems, anything goes.Rivalling James Bond with some of its stunts, in boats and cars that chase and jump and stuff, part two has a souped up soundtrack and while it took a while to get going, when it did, the visual and scripted gags came thick and fast, though the drug kidnapping seemed a bit unoriginal.I preferred the baby that the hapless guys picked up in the first film to the old monk in this, but the mix up with the stripper had an added twist. Facial tattoos, chopped off fingers and a drug-dealing monkey are just some of the nasties that beset our friends as they wake up from hangover no. 2, along with an outrageously camp ""friend"" who suddenly overdoses on cocaine and whom they deposit down a rubbish chute.Paul Giamatti makes a cameo appearance as a ""businessman"" and Mike Tyson sings very badly indeed at the wedding at the end. Inbetween times, forget logic, forget plot or how any of these guys ever could possibly attract anyone to want to marry them. Just crack open a can and 'enjoy'.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
could have chop and changed scenes with first movie but still funny,"I agree with the general consensus that the plot was pretty much exactly the same as the first movie. Literally, some scenes could have been chopped and changed between movies and no one would have realised.However i would say the general humour in this movie was just as good if not better which i was very happy with. Especially with the greater role of Mr Chow who was incredibly funny.I definitely don't think this movie was as good as the first, mostly because we already knew the general plot, and part of the humour of the first movie was that we really didn't know what was going to happen.Again the acting was strong the effects were good and the city views were spectacular in theory - the streets were obviously very dirty and overcrowded but the camera work was good.Don't worry about this being a hugely disappointing sequel, i would highly recommend watching, especially if you have not yet scene the first.Good comedy big thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Forgotten,"More of a remake of the first 'Hangover' movie than a sequel to it, this second entry finds the friends with short term memory loss and a bad hangover again after yet another bachelor party. The setting is different though, and with the action taking place in Bangkok, there is something fresh to the friends having to contend with unfamiliar territory and locals who do not speak their language in a quest to piece together what they have forgotten. There are also some fun references to the first movie, like Stu instantly thinking ""the roof!"", however, with the basics of the plot so strikingly resembling the first movie (a missing friend, an animal in the room, something with Stu's face and the list goes on), it is hard to blame the characters complaining that they ""can't believe this happening again"" way too many times. And yet, while a pale imitation of its predecessor, there are certainly some funny moments to be had with lots of outlandish surprise revelations and charismatic new supporting characters like Nick Cassavetes as a blunt tattoo artist and the ever-reliable Paul Giamatti, in addition to several of Part One's more memorable characters making appearances. The film might not have much new to offer in the marriage and/or relationship message department, but for a few laughs, it is hard to go wrong with the lead actors here, recycled as the basic story may well be.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Nothing new, still pretty funny","""The Hangover Part II"" is basically the same movie as ""The Hangover Part I"", just in a different city. The plot's exactly the same, and the wacky events will certainly lead to a lot of deja-vus. However: is there really something wrong with that? I don't think anybody is ever going to watch this sequel expecting some sort of surprising variation. It's tough to care, you just want to sit back and laugh at the next stupid thing Alan is going to do. Zack Galifianakis is far from a versatile actor, but he has the one type of character he can play down to a tee. ""The Hangover Part II"" just delivers, without doing much more. If you liked the first, you'll like this one too. If not well, it's going to be a long two hours then.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
MY REVIEW: The Hangover Once Again!!,"The Hangover Part II. You know the drill, it follows the same template of cult The Hangover. This time it is Stu's wedding and they are lost in the sin city of Bangkok. Like last time Doug is missing during most of the screen time but this time he is not the missing one from the wolf pack. Instead of Alan, Stu gets the center stage and his pain and sorrow is quite inevitable. Bradley Cooper looks cool and plays the guy with a mind quite good. Alan as usual get most of the funny lines and weird emotional scenes like with criminal Chow from first movie and a smart monkey who smokes. Movie gets over the top and overly crass in its humor sometimes but I think director never promised a clean humor anyway. So if you are watching it with your wolf pack then it is a blast just like The Hangover otherwise it is just the rehash of the same formula that made The Hangover so much enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I've already seen this.,"A film that honestly seems as though it was written about 30 minutes after the original. Honestly, no thought nor effort has gone into this turd. It plays on the assumption that using the exact same jokes from the first film, and using more of what was popular, is a good idea for a film. That is never a good idea. It's simply lazy. Since DVDs, the internet and streaming have come into play, you'd expect companies to try something drastically new. I don't want to see another version of the 1st film. I can see the 1st film easily enough. The actors are all on autopilot, probably just enjoying the free vacation to Thailand.

Similar to the first film minus the laughs,"There are funny films, where there is something to make you laugh every step of the way, and then there are films where the funniest part in the whole movie is the small bit they showed in the TV ads or trailers. The latter is where i would categorize this movie.I liked the Hangover part 1, i didn't love it, but i thought it was funny and worth watching. This sequel is similar in terms of the same setup, but i thought the parts that were intended to be comedy didn't land. I had similar feelings to highly hyped comedy sequels e.g meet the fockers - the attempts at comedy just weren't funny like the first movie. It might be a decent movie to go to with your friends and force yourself to laugh every time the ""cues"" are presented though, the crowd sure was into it. But if you're a person who likes to think a bit more about the the actual comedy, plot, and script i suggest you avoid this movie.*possible spoiler*: The only part i genuinely laughed at was the scene that was already shown in the commercial: one of the guys get shot and the ""dentist"" who calls himself a doc takes a look and starts screaming.As for the acting, i thought the big three stars acted well enough, i just don't think they had a lot to work with when they got the script. Ken Jeong has a larger role in this movie. If you have seen Jeong in other appearances you will quickly realize he is very unfunny, i have even seen him get booed at live events. Though his portrayal of Mr. Chow in this movie isn't horrible, his extended screen time definitely ruins some of the movie in my opinion.I would've enjoyed re-watching the first film more because the plot is very similar and there were a number of scenes i genuinely laughed at whereas this movie hardly made me laugh. Thats why i wouldn't even recommend renting this.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sad,"I guess I understand a bit better now why our society, especially American society, is in the toilet. I live in Thailand and only ran into this movie because the cable menu indicated that some of it was filmed in Bangkok. That a film like this could be created in the first place and that on one poll it could be rated A- on a scale of A to F by an audience primarily of young adults, is really depressing. That a comic like Ed Helms, who I like, would want to make a fool of himself, let alone be associated with a project like this, is very sad. Maybe the first version was funny. I can take a certain amount of raunchy violence if the underlying story has some redeeming value. But this crap calls for a redefinition of the meaning of pornography. No, on second thought, it IS pornography.That some critics, including Roger Ebert, could find anything of merit in this film, simply confirms, as I suggested, how deep into the toilet we have plunged our heads.I'm sure the producers of this film laughed all the way to the bank.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sorry sequel.,"This dead drunk follow-up to the oft hilarious original is a shameless cash grab.

Oh, there's a cigarette smoking monkey, a transsexual encounter and Mike Tyson along to sing poorly but what it depends on most, the shock value for laughs is reheated leftovers from the original.Stu is getting married in Thailand and hopes to avoid the Vegas debacle of two years earlier. Pressured into inviting the socially inept Alan (Zach Galifinakis) along disasters await in the wings. It's bad enough the father of the bride dislikes Stu to begin with but wait til obnoxious Alan adds his two cents.With big box office assured in the title alone Hangover 2 is inferior every way. Director Todd Phillips takes few chances using the same convoluted recipe of hallucination and black out from the first but with the audience prepared for it most of the humor lands with a heavy thud.Zach Galinafikis was clearly the centerpiece and biggest contributer to the success of the first film but here he's lost the edge and freshness and his five minutes ( most get fifteen ) seem to be over.

Worth watching if your really bored,"Dude, where's Teddy?...Um, yeah....Most of the movie is basically the same premise(as Dude where's my car)..find Teddy. It wasn't entirely bad, but it was not good either. It was not a comedy so much as it was a mystery, with some action, sprinkled with a hint of comedy. It was not very original and somewhat stereotypical, and by that I mean it reinforces stereotypes/clichés, not so much in a directly derogatory or negative way, just a very boring normal way. Overall a boring movie, an unfunny movie with a few funny moments, but ultimately fails to deliver anything of substance. The hangover 2 is not as good as the first, I'll admit I didn't 'love' the first, but I did enjoy it, this one not so much, watch it if you have the chance, watch it for yourself and make your own opinion; to each their own.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Quite different from the glamour and penthouse suite of Vegas, they are in the gritty hard streets of Bangkok. Phil, Stu and Alan are on the run from gangs and drug lords in the search for Teddy (Stu's Brides little brother). With the expected hilarious antics of strip clubs, obtaining extra baggage, and plenty of beatings along the way. Will Stu, Phil and Alan be able to find Teddy, or will Bangkok take him first?

way too predictable,"The First Hangover was a success, it had a sense of unpredictable moments which made the movie. Whether it was a tiger in your bathroom or mike tyson punching alan randomly.It was a really funny movie, felled with funny moments and characters.When i heard that hangover part 2 was coming out. I was excited about it because the first movie was great.But i had my doubts and questions, How can they repeat it again would it work and it doesn't. After watching i felt disappointed as it was way too similar to the first hangover. I hardly laughed because it was to similar. Finally as much as i love the Asian guy in many films, i feel as though he shouldn't have got to much of the spotlight. Hangover two was a failure and it at some moment it reminded me of the cheep parody movies like disaster movie and vampires suck etc...I would give it a 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very close to as good as the original,"Just about everyone and their mother knows the original Hangover was amazing and one of the best comedies, possibly in all of film history (well of the past decade easily). This sequel is very strange in that it's hardly a sequel, it's more like a reworking.They seemed to have used the exact same formula of the original, including major plot points and even what musicians soundtrack which scenes (there's a Kanye song playing on both when they're going out, there's a Wolfmother song playing again near the climax, that same singer with the eerie voice has a song at the beginning during the credits, after the ""we screwed up"" phone call), but somehow they managed to basically copy themselves without it feeling cheap.I'm not sure how they achieved this, but as unoriginal as the film is, it just works. They basically took every crazy scene of the original and amplified times 100. Everything is absolutely insane, they're are definitely some things that will catch you by huge surprise. In some ways, this does indeed make this movie funnier and more action packed than the original, but what really made the Hangover so great was that the characters seemed very real, like you could see all of those things happening to you and your friends if you were at the wrong place at the wrong time, several times in a row.That feeling of realistic characters and believable disasters is hardly present in the Hangover II, because the events are so extreme and the characters choices go past the morals of an average man (take into consideration that I believe the characters in the original were close to average men lol). If you haven't seen the first one though, you could possibly think this is one of the funniest movies ever.So while it is funnier, it is less believable which takes away from some of the humor, but I still say it levels out to be about as good as the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
cash cow,I liked The Hangover part I very much but with most of the movies from Hollywood these days they use the same idea over and over again to make money. Some ideas are meant to be used once because then they will have an impact. There is no ET part two or The Sixth Sense part two or the prequel. There's only one and that's enough. There was nothing new about The Hangover II and it followed exactly the path of part I. It was all too predictable. Not exciting at all. Before word of mouth start going around a lot of people(like me) will have seen the movie because part I was good thinking(and having been let down a lot of times) that part II would be good if it was half as good as part I but it isn't. It was rushed quickly before people forget how good part I was.,4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More of the same but just as fresh,"The Hangover (Part 1) was a great film - the pacing was excellent, it was a new and refreshing idea executed brilliantly. It stands up on repeat viewings and still surprises with how funny it is.Now we have Part 2, the set up sounds the same; one of the guys is getting married, they (reluctantly) have a bachelor party end up getting wasted and wake up with no recollection of the night before and a member of the gang missing. Cue surprises as they unravel the mystery. Throughout the pre-hungover set up, I'll admit I was worried. There are many nudges and winks to the original that are genuinely funny but thankfully the writers stop making homage and the originality begins.I won't ruin any of the surprises as the mysteries set up are excellent and caught the entire theater by surprise every time. Be warned that part 2 follows the formula of the first but never feels old.Bradley Cooper largely takes a backseat as this is Ed Helms' show. Sure Zach Galafianakis has the bulk of the comedy and is on form as Alan throughout the entire film but Helms grounds the film with his descent into insanity with everything Bangkok throws at him, balancing Alan's childlike naivety and Cooper's straight(er) man perfectly.The cinematography, soundtrack, writing and direction are all fantastic the whole way through, showing the squalor and seedy side of Bangkok in a classy and energetic way.The verdict is go see this film. After watching it I honestly cannot decide whether Hangover 1 or 2 is better. surely that's the sign of a good sequel. Sure Part 1 is fresh and original but Part 2 takes the formula and ramps it up as far as it will go. Enjoy the surprises and go along for a crazy ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very disappointing!,"This was like watching an idiot co-worker tell a comedians funny jokes. Exact same script as part 1...I mean....EXACTLY! The people that made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.The first movie was hilarious, I guess the writers blew their wad on that one, because there was NOTHING original in part II. Don't waste your time going to see this one, just watch the first one.I can't imagine they will be able to sucker anyone into putting up money for a part III. If they do find a rich fool, I can't imagine anyone would pay to see it after watching this disaster.You can't really say this movie wasn't funny, because the jokes were the same as the first movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You know the drill...,"In ""The Hangover Part II"" Stu (Ed Helms) with freshly emblazoned Mike Tyson facial tattoo, has an epiphany, ""Oh my G**! We kidnapped a monk!"" ""The Hangover Part II"" is awesome. The movie is hysterical. Director and Writer Todd Phillips perhaps made the movie he intended to make with ""The Hangover"". Now instead of Las Vegas, the Wolf Pack find themselves in Bangkok, Thailand, where there are no comedic restraints. Scary thought. Phillips with writers Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong brilliantly blur lines of taste with unnerving sense of humor. I read several reviews panning ""The Hangover 2"" as a glossy clone, more than a sequel. Where the characters and story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore were novel and clever, this one is formulaic, but punctures the envelope and is wildly funny. This is an authentic sequel in that a lot of the humor derives from the original.A lot is familiar. Instead of the baby and the tiger, we have the Zen Buddhist Monk, who has taken a vow of silence, and the drug dealing monkey that smokes. Stu (Helms) again falls for the stripper, this time beautiful Kimmy (stunning Yasmin Lee). However, about 2 minutes into the scene with Stu and Kimmy, as Stu attempts to reassemble his missing day, we get the ominous hysterical punch line. Phillips's genius is leading us down the familiar path, and then propels us beyond: where no one has gone before. Ken Jeong reprises as Mr. Chow--this time as part of the Wolf Pack. Before the collective brain freeze, Allan (goofy Zach Galifianakis) received a text from Chow, ""Let's party bitches."" Jeong could never top his naked crow bar moment, but he comes close and is hilarious. Yes, Mike Tyson is back, and actually surprises.Not surprisingly, as ""The Hangover Part II"" opens frazzled Bradley Cooper as leader Phil, calls Tracy (gorgeous and intense Sasha Barrese), Doug's (Justin Bartha) wife. Phil confesses again, ""We really f***ed up this time"" The crew was at an exclusive resort in Thailand, I'm thinking Phuket, for Stu's wedding. 2 years have passed, and Stu has found the love of his life in Lauren (beautiful and smart Jamie Chung). Phil, Stu, and Allan wake up in some seedy hotel in Bangkok. Stu has the Mike Tyson tattoo on the side of his face. Allan's head is shaved. There is monkey wearing a denim jacket. Lauren's brother Teddy (easy going Mason Lee) is missing. There is a detached finger with a Stanford ring—apparently Teddy's.The last thing the dudes remember was having a beer around the campfire bachelor party at the resort beach. Of course Allan vehemently claims ignorance. Making matters worse: Lauren's father Fohn (solid unforgiving Nirut Sirchanya) hates Stu with a passion. At the wedding rehearsal dinner he compares Stu to bland Thai rice porridge. Also protégé Teddy, Stanford premed at 16 years old, is the light of his life. Stu may never recover. With straight man Doug (Bartha) back at the resort, The Wolf Pack gradually reconstruct the day and search for Teddy. All looks lost. They must contend with mysterious businessman Kingsley (manic and funny Paul Giamatti) this time around. High jinks accelerate with Russian mobsters, Buddhist monastery, and raunchy strip clubs.The upside and downside of ""The Hangover Part II"" is familiarity. Mostly upside. Granted it is predictable in the endgame. The rest is wicked chaotic genius. It is all about the fuzzy journey. Bradley Cooper is the strong lead. He is movie star handsome and the anchor in this raucous comedy. As the great comic reactor, he makes ""2"" work again. He is not asked to be funny; he is charmingly fun. Ed Helms is brilliant as the butt of the jokes, and he does this with natural grace. Zach Galifianakis returns annoyingly as dysfunctional Allan. We can never tell whether Allan is an idiot savant or just an idiot. Galifianakis is unwavering in Allan's self awareness void. However, he gives Allan a good heart, albeit misguided. Ultimately, brotherhood and friendship underlies and comes full circle in ""The Hangover 2"", much like ""The Hangover"". So despite the guys getting the crap beat out of them by a staff wielding monk; we pull for them, because they pull for each other.""The Hangover Part 2"" is a great looking movie as well. The opening shots of the mountainous islands in the seas around Thailand are breathtaking. The resort and beaches are beautiful. This is also offset by the dichotomy of Bangkok. We see the clustered streets of the clubs and vendors balances against the stunning skyline view of a luxury hotel tower. My bud Robert, visual effects supervisor, seamlessly made the monkey smoke cigarettes, among numerous other effects.""The Hangover Part II"" is the funniest movie of the year. You know the drill: Stay through the end credits. Can't figure out how Phillips makes a sequel, given that Allan is the only one not married. I'm sure they figure this out. And look forward to seeing that one as well—the upside of familiarity.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just as maddeningly hilarious as Part One...Well Done!,"Hangover Part II is just as hilarious as part one but in even more crazy city and setting - Bangkok! The cultural nuances of Bangkok, crazy streets & overcrowding add several more degrees of humor, suspense and drama to this comedy. Not surprisingly, the performances of Bradley, Ed and Zach are just as powerful as part one. Unlike many sequels, this one leaves you guessing about how each problem / mess up will solved, and doesn't get boring or predictable at any point during the movie. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in many years and definitely the funniest one so far in 2011. Well done and I still keep wondering if there will be another one. With the creative geniuses working behind the scenes and these exemplary comedy actors, there is still room for another one that could keep the audiences rolling on the floor with laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Big Swing and A BIG MISS!,"ALL of the elements were there...but the whole movie came up short on being anywhere close to being the side-splitting comedy that the original was.I sat there with my 19 year old son, waiting to laugh... wanting to laugh... It got almost uncomfortable waiting for the movie to hit us as funny. There are plenty of wild and outrageous situations, but real laughs are very few and far between. As we walked out of the theater, I said, ""It all worked the first time...what happened the second time around?"" The comic energy, that made the movie work the first time wasn't there. As my son said, the writers concentrated Too Hard on making it outrageous, and MISSED OUT ON MAKING IT FUNNY.It is not the actors' fault, they delivered what was in the script. This might not even work on DVD. It will make a lot of money in the first couple of weeks, based upon the audience anticipating it will be great, but the word of mouth will keep it from being a Blockbuster.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie so far this year!,"I saw Hangover I and was skeptical about seeing Hangover II I am not a big fan of I & II movies. However, my boy friend wanted to it for his birthday and I took him.

Worst movie to date,"I really liked the first Hangover. I was excited to see this one. Unfortunately this sequel was one of the worst movies I have seen to date. Did they even have writers? The movie relied on the gross out, shock factor and was not funny at all. I put this movie down with Sex and the city Two. It's like they had the actors already on contract, they knew that the title would sell so why not churn this garbage out with no thought, editing or skill. It makes me mad to think of how good this movie could have been. That they have missed a opportunity.If you like the first one, don't watch this one! I wish I didn't. Save your money.

I've been reading some really bad reviews about this movie on other sites saying the theater was silent with no laughs. But they are journalist not regular everyday people that enjoy a good laugh.

I thought it was even better than Part 1. Just don't get offended by the P... & F... words and you will love it. The moment the movie starts, you know what's going to happen, but this never made me not enjoy this movie. The opposite was the case, you were just waiting for the next scene to top what you remember from Part 1. And most of the time it did.

Perhaps it is not as outrageous and mind-blowing as the first part, but it sure made me laugh all the same if not more. As the film was coming to an end I was already pre evaluating it to 8. But one of the last scenes made me rise it by 1. So 9/10 from me.

Impossible to watch...,"I tried - having lived in Bangkok I thought this might be fun. The film was also made in Bangkok... but it seems not one single Thai would appear in the movie.

I'm curious - if they make a version based in Paris will they include Big Ben? It seems they do just about everything they can to mess this movie up, and we can only wait for Hangover 3 to see if they could actually manage to mess it up any more than they did.Things that were funny in the first movie are done again - but second time around you juz think 'not that again!'.It's a real tribute to American culture that this movie could ever raise more than 1 to 2 stars...

trying to be funny is often not so funny,"this is the third but not the best one. it feels like they were trying to look for funny jokes , but it looked cheap.some mistakes in the script as well.. they found chow in Mexico , and before they left his house he killed all of his roosters. what has that to do with the movie? i don't see the funny part of that . it did not tell anything to the story. just a random scene that could have been cut out of the movie.the car accident with the zoo giraffe in traffic was also a kind of weird humor. making up all weird jokes and put it all together to a movie in random order is not really funny in my opinion.and what about Phil? he was successful to break a stone wall with a sledgehammer , but he could not break a wooden door when he got locked up ? weak storyline.there were some nice moments, but all together it was nowhere close to part 1 and 2 .",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
All I want from a comedy,"I've heard many people slate this film for being too similar to ""The Hangover"". OK, many things were the same (i.e. being set just before a wedding and events turning out badly) but for me this didn't retract from the film. It was still as good as the original, possibly even better in my opinion.As a 16 year old teenager this ticked all the boxes for me. The characters were very funny, especially Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who made me laugh out loud on several occasions. He was given most of the witty lines and Zach's innocent and childish portrayal of Alan over the two films has propelled him to a cult status. The other characters also held their own; Mr. Chow(Ken Jeong)who I was glad to see again was as always a good laugh. Both Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) were very good in their separate ways as well.The plot also lived up to my expectations. As I've already said it was similar to the original, the main difference that the gang are in Bangkok, not Vegas. However, it was still entertaining and intriguing with many twists. If anything, this time round their adventure was even better and ludicrous.This is a must see for all comedy fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Maybe it had to do with the Asian take over of the world's economy or the fact that Asians are better people in general- from martial arts to Zen philosophy.

Same same,"I can remember the last time I saw a sequel to a movie, I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was the exact same scheme and practically a remake of its predecessor. Literally, nothing changes, there is hardly a mention that the three leads have been through this exact same thing. They don't even seem to worry about the teenager they lost losing a finger. Everything is the same.Director Todd Phillips seem to think ""hey, they liked the first one, let's keep it the same and make it a different location."" I really must say the first Hangover film I was a big fan of. I thought it was smart, funny, and very heartfelt in places. Rarely do we see leads that are as funny as mystified as the audience. I liked that. Sadly, Phillips doesn't want to experiment and place these characters in different surroundings with them in different events, he literally seems to have taken the first script and moved it over to Bangkok. A sign of unoriginality, uncertainty, and above all, laziness.The plot, if I should bother to explain it, is the Wolfpack going to Bangkok to celebrate Stu's wedding. The night before the wedding, the wife thinks of a brilliant idea that the guys go out for one drink, and take her sixteen year old brother with her. I find it funny the thought of what could possibly happen to these three the night before a big wedding didn't even cross this woman's head. Not to mention putting them in charge of an adolescent.No big though, they go out, have a drink by the bon-fire, next thing you know they blackout and wake up in some rundown slum of an apartment in Bangkok. The adventure re-begins. We get the same jokes, the same antics, and the same characters giving their same performances.We have Phil, the calmest of the group, Stu the wimp, and Alan the idiot. The only two that manage to squeeze laughs are Mr. Chow (Jeong) and Alan. Chow's outrageous attitude and Alan's simple minded, softee persona both bring out the best The Hangover Part II has to offer.Most of the shots of Bangkok are the scummy and grungy parts of the city and most of which turn people off to a place like that. When in fact, Thailand is very exquisite in parts. Obviously, the filmmakers wanted to capture the blacker sides of town to show what kind of neighborhood the boys were looking through. Still, I think the goal was to turn off viewers from Bangkok.Some of the events in this film are disgusting, but certainly fitting. The strip club scene is very dirty, but very funny making even the dirtiest parts of The Hangover Part II, appealing. The scene that was probably the most offensive was the photo during the end credits that parodies one of the most famous photos of the Vietnam War that was taken in the Ho Chi Minh city. Most people probably won't get it, and while you think it was uncalled for, it's something you just really need to let go and forget. It isn't worth it.With so many watered down comedy films like Fired Up and even with R rated comedies that are questionable for that, The Hangover Part II stands out as a film takes its R rating and utilizes it to the rating's full capabilities. While there are many laughs, what it all boils down to is it is just a raunchier and not as fun sequel that takes everything that made the first film so enjoyable and suspenseful and just does it again. This time, we know every twist and turn and nothing is a surprise.Starring: Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha. Directed by: Todd Phillips.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Yes its the same as The Hangover....,"OK - its the same story. I mean, really, same exact story - but with slight differences.First of all, The Hangover was probably one of the funniest, most surprising movies of the past decade. It was a total shock, from start to end - brilliantly conceived, wildly imaginative and wonderfully told - the movie is probably going to be one of the funniest comedies of all time.So how do you improve on that ? How do you beat that ? The answer is, ""You Don't !"". But the fans of the first hangover wanted more, tens of thousands wanted a sequel, so the producers had to do something - and anything that fell short of the original would like detract from the original.So, instead of writing a new story - why not take the exact same story, and just film it in a different location ? And thats what Hangover Part 2 is - the same story, with enough changes to make it somewhat different from the original - and with a few new jokes to keep the fans wanting more.And rather than quench our thirst, we're now all wanting a Hangover part 3. Brilliant marketing.I loved hangover. It was like taking the ultimate vacation.

"Cruder, same plot, less funny","Like most people I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Hangover' because its a bloody hilarious film, so when I saw part 2 advertised, I was briefly excited at the prospect of more hilarity from the wolfpack. The excitement faded when the possibility 'they're going to ruin it' dawned on me. Spoiler alert: they did; without giving anything away, the plot and story structure are practically identical to part 1, and because of this you can see the punchlines a mile away, so when they happen they arn't funny. Also, because you've seen it all before, lot of the plot is pretty guessable, thus removing the element of surprise that made the first film work. The ending is also poor and anti-climatic. It got to the point that about halfway through I was so bored I almost considered walking out, something I have never contemplated doing before (and I went to see Oceans 12). Occasional comic relief from Zach Galifianakis was the only good thing to say about it.

"Hilarious, but not as good as the first.","I went to see the midnight showing of The Hangover Part II with about 20 Friends on Wednesday night, and the majority of us agreed that it was not quite as good as the first one. Perhaps it is wrong to go in ready to compare it to the first one, but it is hard not to when the first one set such high expectations. In my opinion, The Hangover was brilliant, hilarious, and damn near flawless. It kept my attention throughout the entire movie, and there were times when I was literally choking and crying from laughing so hard. There are a few moments when this happened in Part II, however, it did not happen quite as often.After about the first 30 minutes, the comedy seemed to die down a bit. Once you are re-introduced to Alan, and after you get the feeling of ""Here we go again"" when the characters wake up in another effed up situation, the movie seems to take a more dramatic tone. Don't get me wrong, there are still several funny parts from this point on, but the comedy isn't really consistent. There were times when I wouldn't laugh for 15 minutes. Overall, it was a great movie and I plan to see it in theaters again and also buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray. However, don't go in expecting it to be leaps and bounds better than the first. Also, don't try and over analyze it or try to find similarities between the two (as many of my friends did), but enjoy it for what it is. I definitely recommend anyone who enjoys comedies to check this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Wolfpack is back! but with some repetition,"I loved this movie. Not as much as the first one, but my money went worth. The wolf pack decides to go to Thailand for Stu's wedding and well, the mess up begins. The sequel is as much crazy as the first and in fact this time the chaos is even more insane and even more raunchy.Hangover 2 begins predictably and ends predictably and there are a lot of sequences directly copy pasted from the legendary first part, which was sad somehow. Originals should be left untouched. In fact it would have been great if the director had tried to be a little more innovative with the script, but he chose to stick with the tried and successful formula of the first part. But still, the movie scores on a crazy script and of course ""the 3 best friends that anybody can have"".Hangover 2 is not there to be missed.

Save your money and watch the first again.,"Wow. I knew the premise was the same as the first film, but I didn't know that the entire thing was going to be the same. From the setup to the structure to even some of the most minor details, almost every single thing about this was just the exact same as the first. I'm having a very hard time thinking of a more lazily written film. The first one was a lot of fun the first time (decreased significantly after the first viewing, but still) and so this one wasn't a hard watch by any means, but the entire time it was just so obvious that they thought they could turn in the same thing and get the same kind of explosive results.

Funny Funny Funny,"This movie was hysterical. Some of the material crosses lines that audiences generally are not taken, so that uneasiness makes it more difficult for the comedy to really shine. That said, although not as good as the first film, for obvious reasons, the movie is very funny. What I don't understand about many of these reviews is the complaint that the movie is the same as the first. I challenge someone to find me a sequel that isn't.

There Are No Words,"I have loved film all my life and my appreciation of motion pictures as an art form has been a very important part of who I am. I have also always been liberal and open minded in my approach to that art form, seldom seeing in a film nothing of value. However, I left the theater after experiencing The Hangover, Part II, with something within myself profoundly changed. It was as if I had personally witnessed a crime against humanity, a savage act against basic human decency that was not simply depicted in the film but was the very film itself. Unlike the funny fluff of The Hangover, the empty headed nonsense that caused chuckles galore in theaters across the world, Part II is a dark and sinister expression of pure nihilism that assaults the essence of the soul. There are no words to describe how I was affected as I stumbled alone into the night at the conclusion of what was a violation of every fiber of my being. Those responsible for this motion picture not only lack even a small shred of morality, they actively conspired to record images that can never be forgotten once inflicted upon the innocent viewer. No one in their right mind would seek out the indescribable suffering endured by those who have survived The Hangover, Part II, even the most jaded masochist. Perhaps a truly sick mind, the sort that imagined this film and managed to corrupt mankind with what they produced, would find their sociopathic nature enriched by seeing it. To those who even slightly embrace the concept of their personal humanity and have no desire to have violence done to their very being, let this review be a warning. What is suggested to be a comedic follow-up to The Hangover is nothing of the kind. In reality, it is something so terrible that audience members will be haunted by what they have seen for the rest of the lives, if they still wish to continue living after their experience of The Hangover, Part II. I only wish I had read a review by one of this films hapless victims prior to subjecting myself to the repugnant power of such a vicious monstrosity.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Thoroughly entertaining - as per original,"Many sequels turn out to be disappointments, leave viewers with a feeling of regret - even anger - at the sequel being produced, and can even detract from their memories of the original classic.I'm pleased to say that The Hangover Part II is no such disappointment. The quality of the acting, the script and the gags ensures that audience is thoroughly entertained and will be generally satisfied.It takes a while for the movie to ""get going"" - it's probably around 30 minutes until the boys wake up in a strange hotel and the familiar comedic storyline begins: Find the missing person and get back in time for the wedding! The blatant similarity to the plot of the original movie has both pros and cons. It brings a certain satisfaction to the viewer. We know we loved the original movie - we are simply getting more of the same. However, it makes the movie very predictable, the audience is able to see most ""revelations"" well in advance. I left the movie satisfied but sincerely hoping that a third installment is not made, there is no need for more repetition.I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loved the original film; whilst containing nothing original, it is a genuinely funny and enjoyable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Shamelessly squeezing every last drop out of the formula,"I generally despise sequels and Hangover II is a great example of why that is. This is just a complete rewrite of the original with zero artistic integrity. And if you were going to make just one change, surely you would remove the atrocious Mr Chow? But no, Todd Phillips appears to be the only sentient being who actually thinks this character is funny. Even Mike Tyson is dragged back into this mess for no good reason other than to sing out-of-tune at a wedding (why is this funny?) There are a handful of mildly amusing moments, largely thanks to Ed Helms, but overall this is just a lazy and shameless sequel that does nothing but taint the original.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The Funniest Film Since, Well, The Hangover","Just like most people, I loved the Hangover. I remember seeing it for the first time at the cinema and it gave me some of the hardest laughs I've ever had whilst sitting through a film. The first thing that came to my mind when I first heard there was going to be a sequel was, how are they going to do it? They can't just recycle the same plot as the first film can they? Oh yes they can and it works surprisingly well.Todd Phillips co writes and directs, as he did the first film. He re unites us with all the key players including Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis. This time round the guys are in Thailand to attend Stu's wedding. However, things don't go to plan as you can imagine and we end up with a scenario that seems very familiar to what happened in Vegas two years ago.This is the funniest film since the original Hangover. I must have laughed out loud at least five times and had plenty of chuckles throughout. Phillips brings Mr Chow into the mix, who brings many of the films laughs. The humour is crude and at moments gross, but it is irresistibly funny. Phillips manages to bring fresh jokes into the film, even though he is pretty much remaking the first film. Although a third film would probably be too much, I wouldn't be surprised if we take another trip out with the wolf pack in a couple of years.After the disappointment of the latest pirates instalment, it was great to see a summer sequel live up to expectations. Fans of the first Hangover will no doubt love part 2 and so they should, it's one of the funniest films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the worst movies I've seen in years,"Full disclosure: I walked out of the movie before it was over. I just couldn't take it. I can tolerate, and sometimes laugh loudly, at black humor, gross humor, ridiculous situations. Even some things that might seem cruel if they are done in a certain way (e.g., some Monty Python skits, and films like ""Dr. Strangelove""). But this was one of the most offensive movies I've ever seen. I got upset thinking that I'd paid to see it, was perplexed at the laughs of others in the theater audience (mainly junior high and high school-age kids; this was in Brazil and age restrictions weren't enforced), and then finally decided life was too short.There are certainly many movies were someone being rude and obnoxious, even in a mean-spirited way, is supposed to be funny. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . No big deal. But this film was an unrelenting series of gags based on people being obnoxious and/or stupid. Non-stop. The character Alan, and Stu's father-in-law-to-be, are both so dumb and offensive that I really could not see anyone wanting to be with either one. Stu's character struck me as the most realistic (as in people I've met), but finally he becomes as big an idiot as everyone else (until the predictable ending—which I read about).Writer/director Todd Phillips throws in some very unoriginal gags (e.g., a trained monkey—as in the first film—plus one of the characters having sex with a Thai man he thought was a woman, which is not shown but described in graphic detail). Based on this film, I think Phillips could probably have made a decent action thriller—one that made Thailand look equally as bad as this one—but that would not have achieved his objective, which was to duplicate the success of ""Hangover I.""",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good one to watch,"Though this movie is a sequel and does not quite compare itself to the previous part, it is worth watching. I would say many times better than the sci-fi and the cartoon movies that have come up recently.Some of the incidents in the movie are quite funny to watch. Every character in the movie seem to have got into the role very well. Especially the roles of Stu, Phil and Alan came out quite good. But, expected more out of Alan's role. The idea of bringing monkey to be one of the characters to watch out for was very nice.Speaking of location, glad that it is not based on the Vegas which seems to be the usual location to get a hangover. Hangover can happen part of world.Would have loved the movie more if things were more structured. The way these people come up with the idea as to where Teddy is or say, suddenly the keys of motor-boat appearing seemed irrational.

Hangover Part 1 (excluding the comedy),"I laughed once during this movie. I tried to remember which part that it was, but I can't. This pretty much tells me that The Hangover Part 2 is a forgettable movie, from start to finish. I wanted it to end about 10 minutes after it started but couldn't leave because I was at the far end of the cinema and didn't want to walk out in front of everybody (because that's rude).Same storyline as before, only this time thing's go down in Bangkok. Weird how Todd Phillips pretty much 'copy and pasted' everything over yet the film is nothing compared to the original. Pacing was bad and the jokes were worse. Easy gags aimed at 15 year olds who go to the cinema in groups and annoy everybody by doing that social laughing thing whereby they want everybody to know they get the joke.Little Fockers & Hangover Part 2. Perfect examples of how people should leave well enough alone.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ed Helms was great .. The movie is very terrible..every time I get out of the plot twist, I enter into the plot twist. The last connection to the events in this movie was crazy..their whole trip in Thailand was crazy..the strongest thing in this series is when they see themselves and what they did while they are unconscious..the appearance of Mike Tyson in the end was awesome.. The songs, the trip and the twists were crazy.. One of the greatest I've ever seen in the world of comedy movies.. Just 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It takes a little too long for the script to kick in Bangkok style!,"Same cast. Same setup. Different location. Todd Phillips returns to the directorial chair to helm the sequel to the 2009 comedy hit 'The Hangover'. After grossing over $450m worldwide from a modest $35m budget, it was inevitable that the boys would be back for another forgettable (for them anyway) outing. While it doesn't reach the same joke per minute ratio as the original film did, it does provide enough laughs to keep the audience occupied through the one hour and forty minute running time. However if monkey related humour is not your cup of tea, then the first half of the film will no doubt drag a little for you.Stu (Ed Helms) has finally found the right woman to marry in Lauren (Jamie Chung), and they head-off to Thailand to get married. As Stu sadly still cannot truly recollect the horrors of their Las Vegas night-out, he opts for a traditional and safe, pre-Wedding brunch instead of an bachelor party. However, yet again things do not go to plan for the 'Wolfpack' as Stu, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), and Phil (Bradley Cooper) must attempt to retrace from the previous night's escapade to find Lauren's younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) who joined the boys on their night-out. As the déjà vu sets in, they move from character to character, including the resurrection of high-pitched Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), and from place to place to try and piece together the forgotten night's carnage before it is too late. A few famous faces are thrown in for good measure, but their roles do not need to be spoiled here as they are merely cannon fodder aimed at extending the plot for just a few more minutes allowing for an extra sequence to be casually included here and there.With nothing literally changing aside from the location a few minor plot points (e.g. Stu's, rather than Doug's wedding), 'The Hangover Part 2' relies solely on the strength of its script and the jokes it will throw at the audience. Phillips, Armstrong and Mazin essentially centre the humour around three key areas; the changing of the character's normal appearances, the differences and constraints between Western and Asian customs and the actual personality and action of the characters, most notably Alan. Galifianakis is at the centre of the majority of comedic moments, however it is not always what says, but unusually what he does, that creates the laugh-out-loud elements. His little mannerisms and unabashedly reactions both verbal and physical to relatively simply questions are both squirming-ly embarrassing and funny at the same. While both Stu and Phil play second fiddle to Alan's constant ability to make the wrong comment at the wrong time, but in an entirely innocent, and somewhat childish way. He keeps the film ticking over, especially during the first half of the film's narrative and during the moments in which shock value tends to creep into the script intending to both cause shock and amusement, yet it tends to create neither.'The Hangover Part 2' is the first film, but set in a different city with a couple more extreme characters and sequences thrown in for good measure. The script is heavily set on propelling shock value over verbal humour, but when the script does eventually kick in during the second half of the film, it provides plenty of hilarious moments that seem to arrive just a little too late. However, it must be noted, that as the narration has been replicated almost plot-point for plot-point it is still worth staying till the very end to view one visual joke that does work perfectly in sync with a movie. It may feel like déjà vu, but photos sometimes tell the whole story (and then some).",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Has its moments, but lacks the chemistry of the original","The anticipation surrounding the release of The Hangover Part Two has been palpable. Benefitting from the surprise blockbuster success of its predecessor and a recent legal kerfuffle, Part Two is poised as one of the year's biggest films. The midnight crowd was abuzz with excitement, they didn't just come to see the movie, they came to love the movie.This is perhaps why I felt such disconnect while watching the film. I'm someone who enjoyed the original Hangover, yet I took issue with the sometimes detestable characters and their dirty deeds. It seemed that some of the events were structured as random, easy laughs as opposed to being the result of the film's comedic momentum. I laughed, I actually laughed quite frequently. Yet, I could not quite join the chorus of celebration.Nevertheless, there I was surrounded by people laughing themselves into a stupor. Couldn't they see what was happening? They were watching the same movie that they had quoted endlessly since 2009. This is a sequel that commits the cardinal sin of all sequels; it repeats the story of the original film.This is the paragraph where I'd usually launch into some basic summary, but honestly, if you're interested enough in this movie to read this article, then you've seen the first film. If you seen the first film, congratulations! You know every basic plot point of The Hangover Part Two. Zack Galifinakis once again steals the film as the destructive man- child Alan. Like everything else in this film, Alan's boorishness is cranked up to eleven. I'd assume all this hullabaloo constitutes the filmmakers' attempts to disguise the completely derivative storyline.In all fairness, I did laugh more during ""The Hangover Part Two"" than I would at an average raunch-fest. However, the chemistry too often feels stale, as if the cast is still exhausted from making the first film. Occasionally they manages to recapture the spark that made the original so popular. Yet, when viewed in context of its predecessor this Hangover is easy to shake.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Unfunny, awkward attempt at humor.","There is probably nothing more dismal in the world of cinema than a comedy that is not funny. The director of this movie tries really hard to generate laughs but without success. This movie proves that goofiness does not necessarily produce laughs. The actors try their best to be funny but their efforts are for naught. Everything about this movie had problems: the poor script, the inane story, the cheesy acting, the transparent attempts to shock the audience, all of which producing a stultifying attempt to get the audience to laugh. Actually, the part of the movie that worked the best was the after the movie ends, with still pics intermixed with the credits. Bradley Cooper is a strong actor but in this movie he is completely miscast. Mr. Cooper simply is not a slap-stick comic. The background of Bangkok, Thailand did nothing to uplift this movie. The seediness and squalor of the city is sad and calls to question whether the Asian continent is as prosperous as reported in the news.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Change Las Vegas to Bangkok.,"I was just as excited as everyone else that the gang from The Hangover (2009), were coming together again for a sequel. The widely popular, critical & fan favorite film about three guys (Phil - Bradley Cooper, Stu - Ed Helms and Alan - Zach Galifianakis), lost in Las Vegas, trying to find their missing buddy Doug (Justin Bartha), who needs to get to his wedding before it's too late and the fact that none of these guys can remember anything that happened the night before, grossed $280 million in the US. It was a funny, entertaining and exciting film that accomplished all it needed to. Now we come to the sequel. The only difference in the plot for this one is it takes place in Bangkok and that Stu is the one who is getting married this time. I'm serious, just take the plot from the first film and insert Bangkok, Stu getting married and the fact that Stu's future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee), is now in the Doug role.Without giving too much away, they wake up the next day to find Teddy missing, returning favorite Chow (Ken Jeong), asleep on the floor and a monkey in their possession. Thus starts the mystery and the chaos. The feeling I was getting from this film was this sequel was created as an encore act or victory lap for the great work done on the first film and you can see it. This one dragged a little and is much less funnier than the first one and Alan's character has been reduced to a complete moron. I felt the Alan character, which was such a pivotal piece to the first film, was totally wasted in this one.I was amazed at how much this film one looked like the first one. Some of this film felt cheap and forced, especially with the different cameos. Wait until you see what they did with Mike Tyson this time. Ridiculous. Now, you may think I am being hard on this film, but I do have some good things to say about it. It still managed to be entertaining even though it was a carbon-copy of the first film. Ed Helms is just fantastic. The soundtrack to this film is far superior to the first film. The cinematography and the shots of Bangkok and surrounding China-scapes are beautiful. I actually heard gasps in the audience with some of the scenery shots. This film was definitely a let-down. It was watered down and slow in parts, but it was nice seeing that comradery between our three heroes and the feeling of reunion that was felt all throughout the film, but at some point you have to wonder why these guys haven't killed Alan yet.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sorry, just not funny","I honestly don't remember much of the first movie, so originality isn't a part of my judgement. Also, obviously, the movie looks good, the cinematography is good, the acting is OK, and all that. But, after all, the movie is supposed to be a comedy, and it's really not. I watched it expecting crude humour, and I dig crude humour, when it's done well, except this time it isn't. The almost exclusive kind of joke in the film is the ""gross"" kind, the kind to send a group of fifteen-year-olds into a squealing fit. And hey, I get it, 'that's really gross, ha-ha', but the funniest non-PC and gross jokes are the photos during the ending credits. And then, why did I just watch the movie? There are two or three genuinely funny moments in the entire film. I watched this with my girlfriend, and honestly, we buy comedy. Probably our neighbours can hear us laughing at some shows. But this? A few smiles, now and then, that's it. One and a half boring hours. And no, I'm not offended by anything in the movie. Just bored.So as far as recommendations go: If you like any kind of witty, revealing, dialogue driven, situational, reflective kind of comedy, go look elsewhere. If you like well-made crude humour, still look elsewhere. What you have here is a glossed-over waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awesome Sequel,"DO NOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS! This movie IS NOT a direct copy of the first movie. It IS NOT a throwaway sequel. You must understand that any filmmaker who puts out a trailer EXPLOITING a similar OR FIRST FILM is INTENDED!!Now that this point is out of the way, let me explain. This movie knows that it is a sequel. The characters know that the first movie happened. That is why they find this new situation as unbelievable as it is. It is all apart of the plot, and it is an excellent one! I have read reviews on here that comment on the overt similarities and bash this movie for it. These people are superficial and DO NOT GET THE JOKE! It is so infuriating to see a great movie like this lose its credibility over close-mindedness. A lot of the reviews I have read point out how recycled the jokes are, how the brother-in-law is a stick, how Allen comes off as Sad rather than funny, and that the whole movie is a copy-pasted mess. This is all wrong. The jokes are so ingenious and well placed, Zach's acting is PHENOMENAL, the new character additions are flawless, and the whole movie is an astounding experience that deserves repeated views!Why do people not get this movie?! This movie is worlds smarter than the first and sets the bar incredibly high for the final chapter.IF YOU LOVED THE FIRST MOVIE, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!

He played his roll better than great. I have to say I don't think the Hangover would have been as funny as it is with out Zach. All the actors in the movie played their part fantastically.

I'd say the movie is suitable for all ages and is a great movie to watch with your friends or family and have a good laugh with them. Overall, it's funny and interesting.

Not so funny the second time around,"I loved the Hangover. The first film made me literally cry with laughter, what made it so funny was the element of surprise. Around every turn something you wouldn't expect happened. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy part 2, but I the laughs were so blatantly obvious. Part 2 isn't so much second instalment so much as a remake of the first one. It is quite literally a carbon copy of the first one, The events that take in The hangover come in the exact same order. I am a firm believer in if it ain't broke don't fix it, but such similarity with the first one cannot be overlooked.Even making the film based around a wedding I think was a mistake, they could have made they're literal hangovers from a night out anywhere for any reason. And the film didn't have to involve looking for a missing person again. This film suffers from sex and the city syndrome where the first one had way more laughs and felt more coherent, the second follows a similar format and falls flat. Though the negative reviews for the Hangover haven't put off potential cinema goers as Sex and the City 2's did.The film doesn't entirely sink though. It maintains an energy through out and and still has some pretty funny gags. It's not a joyless ride by any stretch, just one that feels overly familiar. Hopefully the writers will get some spark for Part 3 and make a much funnier movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awful movies,"This movie has just nothing special to it... No highlights at all. For example take the characters: they are extremely pale type of people. Consequently you don't get warm with any of them and you simply don't care about them. In fact they are very unlikeable. Every single one of them. But this is not the one reason I don't like the movie. I also don't like Adam Sandler, but some movies of him are actually pretty good and fun. Talking about fun - in Hangover there are almost no funny scenes. You must force yourself to chuckle once in a while. Many scenes are provided by ""Captain Obvious"" and will easily be foreseen. The whole storyline is also completely nonsense, as was the first one - but not in a funny way, instead in a very boring and far-fetched way. After 10 minutes I thought ""Come on... bring it on""... and somewhere halfway through the movie it gets unbearable. If you think the first Hangover was better - it wasn't. It was all the same pale 08/15 story and content. I don't understand the hype and high ratings about the ""Hangover"" movies. They are both just blunt and pale in all matters.A word to the ending: the movie shows the guy who marries in the end as a man who evolved into something like ""Mr. Cool"" and who has learned to ""man-up"". Again - it didn't work and wasn't convincing at all. As was nothing in the whole movie. Skip ""The Hangovers"" if you can and never look back.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movies gives its audience exactly what they want and much more of it in more extreme ways than before and it still maintains its credibility in telling the story in a convincing way.

so not funny,This is not funny it is just gross and stupid. Don't wast your money. Don't see this movie. I pooh on this movie because it is pooh pooh. It is badly written. It is made by people you do not know what it means to be funny. I can't believe people think this junk is funny. I swear any body could have hit comedy. Because people are just so desperate for a laugh. I know bad words and I have been on the toilet so many times in my life I could have a hit comedy movie. The monkey is the most talented actor in this overrated piece pooh pooh. It is very sick at times and that is not a good thing. And sick is never funny sick is just sick.

The best of modern comedy,"Hangover Part 2 improves greatly on the first Hangover without the need to watch the first movie. Within the first 10 minutes every central character's role is established. While Part 2 has a similar premise to the first movie (losing a member of the party while blackout drunk) the antics and resolution couldn't be more different. With at least a joke a minute, Part 2 hits it out of the park. This movie is able to poke fun at an incredible number of topics without ever punching down which is apparently a difficult thing to accomplish nowadays. With every character having development (except the one who isn't supposed to) this movie does something most comedies can't: balancing humor and heart. The jokes aged wonderfully and the acting is top-notch. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, especially if you haven't watched the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Essentially an Unsatisfactory Remake of the First Movie,"I really enjoyed the first Hangover when it brought some fresh and frank elements into movie comedies two years ago. I was really excited to see this Part 2 as well. Somehow though, there was something missing in this strangely lifeless sequel.It is basically a remake of the first movie. This time it is Stu's wedding. Instead of Vegas, they are in Bangkok. But similarly, they get seriously drunk a couple of days before the wedding and wake up with unexplained consequences of what happened the night before. They have to figure out what happened to Teddy, Stu's prodigious teenage brother- in-law to be, before they can go back to the wedding. Can they find Teddy and make it back?If you have seen the first Hangover, you would know the answer to that question. The story structure is EXACTLY the same. However, I did not find the story too funny this time. Even the wisecracks of Alan (Zach Galfianakis) which were hilarious in the first movie, felt forced and even annoying in this one. The repeated cursing and the graphic naked scenes did not really help breathe life to the struggling comedy. By the time an off-key surprise cameo appearance comes out at the end, you don't really care. I don't think there should be a third one anymore.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Hangover Part IIThe best way to avoid the inevitable hangover that follows a night of drinking is to never stop drinking.Unfortunately, the friends in this comedy lack the resilience to live a lush life.While attending Stu's (Ed Helms) wedding in Thailand, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) coerce their apprehensive amigo into joining them and the bride's brother (Mason Lee) for a nightcap on the beach.The next morning, however, all three awake in a Bangkok hotel room with no idea of how they got there, or where Stu's soon-to-be brother-in-law is.The threesome must now empty their pockets, retrace their steps, and relive every humiliating moment from the previous night.An unfunny facsimile of the original, The Hangover Part II relies too heavily on Thailand's seedy side for laughs, leaving its leads to languish.Incidentally, the definition of Ladies' Night at mostly every Bangkok nightclub is extremely loose.

Height of Superb Comedy,"This is an ultimate hilarious movie.Every contributing person, giving its best in presenting such a wonderful movie. Alan, has been innocent and awesome as usual and damn too funny as well. Stu is still suffering from this problem of love with prostitutes during hangover. In all this has been such a superb movie. Phil is a dude and proves that dudism still prevails. Chaow as a gangster is fantastic and did full justice to his role. Alan's indifferent response towards each and every situation has been awesome.

"Carbon copy of original, but still amusing.","The Wolfpack has relocated to Bangkok. Stu (Ed Helms) has planned a quiet wedding in Thailand with bride Lauren (Sucker Punch's Jamie Chung), but naturally it turns ugly. Part II is essentially a carbon copy of the smash hit original. Writer-director Todd Phillips has lazily used a cut and paste technique, but it's still very amusing nonetheless. The written gags are fairly witty although it's the delivery from the cast, especially Zach Galifianakis, which really provides the laughs. The short, fat comedian is hilarious as the socially (and mentally?) retarded Alan; his comic timing and straight-faced humour is faultless. The supporting characters are hit-and-miss, Ken Jeong's Mr Chow again painfully unfunny.

The only review you need to read,"OK I've decided to throw in my review, since I'm reading and reading about people whining how this film has not revolutionized entertainment instead of relying on the same principles as the first part, giving it sometimes one star out of ten?? (Come on, how miserable can you be to rate a film that people laugh their bums off watching with one star).To said reviewers: Seriously, this is HANGOVER PART II. It's called that for a reason, what did you expect, for the director to try reinvent the wheel? It's like expecting Jurassic Park 2 to take place in 2011 with fake dinosaurs.OK, let's go back to our short review.For people who didn't watch the first part (Do they even exist? If so, please go and watch it first, it's awesome), this is the principle that both films are based on: characters suffer from an extreme hangover caused by mixing drugs and alcohol, they also lose memory of the last night's events and try to backtrack their steps by following small clues. Hilarity ensues. That's it, no more, no less.Regarding ""child exploitation joke"" which some female reviewer wrote a wall of text about (one joke mind you, 10 seconds screen time) as far as I know problem's not with the movie but with Thailand. Period. This is a film for mature audiences that can take it for what it is, a comedy movie and means of entertainment.Saying that, there are some hilarious moments on screen, in terms of sequels... Well it's one of the best comedy sequels I watched. Go and see this film with your friends. I guarantee you will have a great time.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Honest review by Divyam Saran,"In part two, the four friends ""the wolfpack"" travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. But things take a roll towards the previous chapter and this time Stu's future brother in law goes missing. This film is also very entertaining and I hope you will enjoy their second hangover ( I wouldn't reveal the destination). The film is equally good and well made. I find no discrepancies from the side of filmmakers, but still, you will enjoy the first part more as the same theme is being re-used here and you know that if the theme is re-used each time successively then it loses its very own essence and the perceived satisfaction decreases. But still, I give a big thumbs up to this film too.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I really wanted to get into it and laugh. The first Hangover was a great idea for a movie and they put all the weird and messed up things in there and really pushed the envelope. So they tried to go over the top of the last movie. Doing this made it seem cartoonish. And when you find out what caused them to blackout you will certainly want your money back.

It's Hangover Part 1... but darker,"If a film becomes a hit, it is very hard to follow it up with a sequel. Usually, sequels end up into a hit or miss situation and this film is an absolute miss; not only wasn't this film as funny as its predecessor, but this sequel doesn't deliver anything new and original. Many of the situations that these characters go through is presented differently but is very identical to what the characters previous experience. If you had high hopes and hoped for this film to be as exciting as the first, then you will be highly disappointed""The Hangover"" presented hilarious humor and comical situations that can get people to laugh from start to finish. The sequel, on the other hand, presented darker and exploited humor that didn't deliver the laugh out loud moments that its predecessor presented. Personally, it felt like the main jokes were re-used from the previous film and the new jokes were scrap ideas that didn't make it to the final cut of the first ""Hangover."" The most that I have done when it comes to laughing was chuckling and scoffing a few times. The humor and situations that these characters have to go through again really didn't live up to my expectations and was very weak.When it comes to the storyline, there is nothing very special about it and that it is an exact replica of the first story. Basically, the characters get hungover and go through a similar concept only in a different area. There were some fun moments in this film, but overall, the film didn't have that fun factor that you've seen in the first film; not that it was boring or anything, this film didn't deliver the thrill and excitement that was delivered in the last hungover experience. The first film had that mystery on where Doug was, for the person that gets lost in this film, you can probably figure it out easily. Everything was predictable and ended up not having that surprise, especially toward the final sequence.Everyone from the bachelor party returns again and once again they performed comically. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis returned once again as the three amigos getting hungover and going through a day of carnage of what they have done, finding their friend. However, their comedic performances were not enough to make the film funny. Since Doug wasn't the one getting lost this time, it would have been nice to see him getting hungover and go through the same situation; however, once again, he is left out of the action. Ken Jeong returns as Leslie Chow, the gangster from the first film. He had some funny moments, but at the same time, he had annoying parts. His character didn't have an exact point in the film, felt like he was added for comedy purposes. Other than that, the other cast members were good as their roles.Not only is this film a disappointment, but the film presented the same concepts and identical situations, only to be set at a different location. Unfunny humor, comedic performances, barely had any fun moments and a storyline that wasn't special. This is a sequel that should have not been made.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Okay I gotta admit,"Some of my favorite movies (mostly comedies) were made by Todd Philips, so when I didn't really like the first Hangover I avoided watching the second and third one.But wow, this dude knows how to end a movie - this is a really feel-good comedy adventure you gotta watch. Unlike most by-the-books comedies with insufferable and annoying characters, everyone here is likable in their own way, the jokes are hilarious and again, that ending left me with a smile.Gonna rewatch the first Hangover now because maybe the first time I saw it I was just too young to appreciate it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Monkey See, Hollywood Do","This film is not recommended."" When a monkey nibbles on a penis, it's funny in any language."" That's just an example of the typical one-liners found in The Hangover Part II, and no, this film is not funny in any language at all. ( Well, maybe in Yiddish. )This film hit the trifecta for me: I laughed a total of three times, and two of those were due to a talented imp of a monkey named Crystal. This mostly humorless sequel to the original hit comedy franchise follows its same tired formula ad nauseam. Scene for scene is so smugly similar to the series' first successful film that any moviegoer might easily get confused, except this one cranks up the raunch factor and sprinkles in more nudity and isn't remotely as funny as the 2009 version.The Hangover Part II is poorly directed by Todd Philips who was more effective with his original version. The film boasts lousy production values and one of the worst renditions of One Night in Bangkok that has ever been recorded. The writing discredit goes to five writers this time around and they shall remain nameless as to not further embarrass their family or friends, ( although the director is one of them and needs to be held accountable for his lack of finesse and management skills with the cast and crew in both areas of production. To say that he is a double threat gives new meaning to the term. ). This latest script is so disappointing and boring compared to the other film. The forerunner, at least, provided genuine laughs back then with its earlier unique premise and only had two different scribes for that surprising box office success.The same ole boys are back, with decidedly mixed results. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis as Phil, Stu, and Alan disrespectively, of course. This trio of misfits seems at odds from the start and their interactions now are mostly shrill and quite routine. Its faithful young audiences may have come to accept their roles and and expect their predictable interaction as they did before: Phil is the leading man or ringleader in charge of the shenanigans, Stu is the hapless victim, and Alan is the crazy wiseguy type providing comic relief. ( Justin Bartha as Doug is along for the ride and he again disappears before all hell breaks loose in Bangkok, the scene of the crime / wedding. ) I expected more from these talented actors.Again, they awaken from a stupor, not knowing what went on the previous night and slowly piece together the mystery while searching for the bride's missing brother. Ken Jeong also returns as the highly volatile Mr. Chow and he wears out his welcome very fast. Incidents occur that have more long lasting repercussions to the boys, yet no one seems to acknowledge that problem throughout the film. In fact, some of the results from their hangover are glossed over and quickly explained in the film's end credits. I guess it's too much work to incorporate those details into the formulaic plot.I couldn't wait for The Hangover Part II to be over. It's pretty sad when the pet monkey outshines the monkeyshines perpetrated by the film's human cast. Hopefully, what happens in Bangkok will stay there permanently. However, I can already smell the stench of the next installment being planned. I shall not be attending. GRADE: C-",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It was never going to be up to the standard of the original, but it was hard to think it would fall this short of the mark","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning'The Wolfpack' return, this time with Doug (Justin Bartha) engaged to a beautiful Thai girl and descending on the city for a weekend of the wild partying they'll always be remembered for from the first film. But when one of their group goes missing again, they're thrown into another series of wild escapades, involving their old friend Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) a ruthless gangster (Paul Giamatti) and Mike Tyson!For the wonderful gems it sometimes churns out, it's easy to forget that Hollywood is fundamentally a business in the area of making money. So while an occasional film like The Hangover may come alike that was a far bigger hit than anyone could have imagined and developed it's own cult following, it's almost a forgone conclusion that they will want to cash in on this and make a sequel that will be commercially quite successful and likely to have a big box office opening weekend, but artistically will be quite a failure in light of it's inspiration. And no doubt director Todd Phillips's ego was spurred on with what a runaway success his first film was and was happy to go along with it and thought he could manage the same success twice. And so we have The Hangover Part II which is basically everything The Hangover was...but isn't.The formula from the first film is repeated almost exactly, as it often is, with the location simply switched from Las Vegas to Thailand, but this in itself feels like enough to feel down on it, with the bright lights and dazzling spectacle of the world's gambling capital replaced with the more diluted, down played back drop of the far east. But most crucially the laugh quotient is significantly down, with the set ups and delivery simply failing to work the way they did the first time round.The characters are basically the same, Bradley Cooper's Phil the smooth, charming one, Zach Galifianakis's boorish buffoon getting up to his usual antics and, of course, Bartha's Doug the mild mannered, unwitting one who ends up going mad, as well as a few of the novelty characters from the first film re-introduced, but none to the effect of the first film. To try and liven things up a bit, at the end we have the baffling spectacle of Mike Tyson performing his own little live music stint.The Hangover Part II is simply a sequel that is unsurprisingly not as good as the original. Sadly, it's not by a mile and then some. *",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If you put a coat on a dog isn't it the same dog?,"Well this is one time i should've listened to the other critics, i knew going into seeing this that it was the Hangover part 2 hence the some of the similar things that occurred in the first one would re-occur in the second..I didn't realize all of them would re-occur! My god its like they took the first instalment and just put a fresh coat of paint on it and moved it to an exotic locale to get people into the seats. The first one was hilarious, so that being said will be enough to make this instalment some money although i highly doubt that anyone will bother if they decide to make a 3rd as they no longer have their element of surprise and i wouldn't be surprised if it goes straight to DVD rental. That being said, this movie has some funny moments although far and between as we see that Stu (Ed Helms) the dentist is the one getting married this time round and his fiancée's family reside in beautiful Thailand. Due to the horrors that occurred during Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, he has decided he wants his wedding nice and quiet and has decided not to invite anyone. Apon hearing that Phil (Bradley Cooper) guilts him to inviting all his buddies including Allan (Zack Galafinakis) They all arrive and everything looks swell with even Stu starting to chill out by the fire on the beach as all the buddies are together. Stu says you know what? Sorry for not wanting you guys to come this is really nice. Flash to the next morning and the boys are all waking up with huge heads and that feeling of 'not again!' Hence the title it's time for Hangover 2. My biggest problem is, and yes i know that its title is the second hangover however i expected at least some new ideas.

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: The Hangover Part II,"Hot off the heels of The Hangover, a massive summer success in 2008, The Hangover Part II reunites the wolfpack and the adventure begins all over again in another country and city.This time around the setting is Thailand and Stu (Ed Helms) is the lucky groom to be. With the wedding taking place in Thailand to help Stu get along with his new relatives, the rest of the gang- Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) head out planning for a more relaxing version of their Las Vegas debauchery. This time however there is another party goer in the form of the brides 16 year old brother Teddy (Mason Lee).Suffice to say the unthinkable happens and they wake up in the middle of Bangkok and each sporting a very impressive hangover again. Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) also returns and is given a more prominent role in this one with his extreme character providing some of the films more amusing moments.The writers and director seem to have stuck to the same winning principals of the last film almost identically which you might consider to be a good thing. Yes it is more vulgar and over the top than the last one and they have tweaked it slightly but there is no real variation whatsoever from the original. The tiger is now a monkey, the broken tooth is now a tattoo, a character goes missing etc. This results in a very disappointing movie as not only are you getting the same jokes in the same order with the same characters but you can work out exactly what is going to happen next.The original won us over due to it's outrageous and original scenarios, this just increases the outrageousness/nudity and thinks that's all that's required to create another success. Completely wrong. In fact most of the best moments come from the characters reminiscing about what they got up to in the first movie. If it wasn't for the nostalgia and likability of the characters that was build up from the first film, I would have struggled to laugh more than once or twice.Although I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first one, I was still hoping for an entertaining movie that could have at least tried to break slightly from the template of the first. Alas it fails to achieve this and the result is a distinctly average film that's just been rehashed. I'd rather have just watched the first one again to be honest.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The Hangover Part 2 is twice as mad, ""twice as funny"" and twice as uninspired.","If there is one thing I never really understood, it's comedy sequels. Why? Because it's blatantly going to rehash its predecessor recalling the exact same jokes in a nearly identical formula. This sequel is no different, and its problem is the fact it's entirely noticeable. It's another bachelor party, this time for Stu's wedding, where they all drink again which results in a killer hangover consequently removing all memories from the previous night. Someone is missing, they must retrace their steps to find that person and blah blah blah just watch the first film. It is a symmetrical premise. The plot itself is identical right down to the narrowest of margins, making it pretty difficult to review. Everything I mentioned when reviewing the first film applies here also. Rapid pacing, inventive use of the flashback structure, memorable lines of dialogue, serviceable acting (except Helms...who I still dislike in this) and the inclusion of Mike Tyson...because why the heck not. This also includes the negatives that I highlighted including the lack of comedy, minimal character development and a narrative consisting of a random string of absurd events montaged together to create a motion picture. The only essence that has changed is the location, no longer are we in crazy Las Vegas, we have ventured across the globe to Bangkok. Honestly, it only serves as an environmental plot device to include the character Leslie Chow who seemed to be a fan favourite in the previous film. That's just lazy writing and comes across as mundane. What I will say, is that there is a scene involving kathoey strippers that cracked me up. I should've saw it coming, but I didn't so I'll give some credit. Aside from that, I didn't laugh once but this is to be expected. In the end, Part 2 is exactly the same as its predecessor. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this more exotic hangover. If you didn't, don't continue with this franchise...and most importantly don't drink.

Let me start over...do you remember how the first one was Doug's wedding and they had a bachelor party in Vegas and lost Doug because they all had a hangover (get it? Hangover?)? Well, let's use the exact same sentence to describe the sequel...the second one was Stu's wedding and they had a bachelor party in Bangkok and lost Teddy because they had a hangover again. What's the third one going to be: Phil's wedding and they have a bachelor party in Amsterdam and lose Alan? Please, no. Let's see some originality.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Bangkok's Dangerous for our Vegas 'wolfpack', as the same film is churned out again - louder; nastier and abroad.","It must surely be the case that ""The Hangover 2"" is the moment people come to realise their folly in liking the first film, and thus come to review their opinions on it. Indeed, how can one realistically claim to enjoy the initial 2009 effort, about the hijinks of three American men lost and confused in the city of Las Vegas, without proclaiming the superiority of this one too? It may, of course, be the case that you claim to like both, but this is surely mere self-delusion as this second effort is patently not good - it is about as ordinary as the first one, no better or worse - a series of chaotic sequences involving connected men in an alien locale which doesn't happen to have the raw punch of the first because neither the jokes nor the scenarios are fresh.Within the first hour, one can practically hear the voices of the producers and writers which radiated out of the well-groomed office suites of a large Los Angeles building bathed in 27 degrees of sunshine - people knocking around ideas for the sequel to the wildly successful and perhaps genuinely funny in two or three places comedy ""The Hangover"". Let's not mince our words: the second film exists because of the financial success of the first, nothing else.The film is, more or less, a rehash of the initial outing: the location has changed to Thailand, offering the dynamic of a language barrier for our leads to struggle through, and another character has joined the troupe in the form of the young; Asian and gifted Teddy (Mason Lee), but the formula is not one that has been strayed from especially greatly.As was the case with the first film, I did not believe for one second that the parties involved would know one another; care for one another or have anything to do with one another in the real world: Phil (Bradley Cooper), a primary school teacher who steals his pupils' money in the first film, here attempts to swipe a prescription sheet for some narcotics which will take you to a happy place whilst at the dentist. Ha ha. Said dentist is Stuart (Ed Helms), who is the series' lateral thinker and musician. Completing the foursome is Doug (Justin Bartha), whom I spent most of the first film wondering how he would know these people, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - Doug's somewhat retarded in-law.It is Stuart's wedding in Thailand that propels the gang off and away for their latest escapade, one which will eventually see them (minus Doug, whose presence in the franchise may now very well be redundant) charge around the noisy, squalid streets of Bangkok and its surrounding suburbs looking for soon-to-be brother in law Teddy. Todd Phillips and his creative crew tweak the 'winning' formula only very slightly, this time forcing the crew into their misadventure after they each agree to have a quiet drink on the beach rather than a boisterous night out. Things do not go entirely to plan, and someone from the original gang of course is missing when the time comes to wake up in a mysterious hotel room: Stuart does not lose a tooth, but instead obtains a tattoo; there is no tiger in the suite, but instead they have acquired a monkey; the groom is fine, but his father-in-law's pride and joy has disappeared without a trace...This propels Stuart; Alan and Phil into action, but the writing is generally lazy: Thai stereotypes, such as the monastery dwelling Buddhist monk on a vow of silence and the ladyboy whore, pepper the experience, while the film has to resort to using a monkey to boost its chuckle count. Monkeys are funny, aren't they?.If the writing is lazy, the adventure itself is mostly unspectacular: whether it was the regurgitation of old jokes or something else, very little of ""The Hangover 2"" is actually that funny, but then it struck me that perhaps it isn't supposed to be.... There is a strange air to the film, almost as if the predicament this time round is something to endure rather than have fun experiencing. The gang's hammering around Las Vegas and the surrounding Nevada desert carried with it a fun, punchy feeling - it was a process they sensed they'd survive, if only they could piece together the clues.... In Bangkok, the 'wolfpack' have strayed too far from home and the film plays more like an odd action/horror hybrid as the gang bear seedy backstreets; psychotic Russian cartels and friends' severed fingers...Where Doug's fiancée was afforded the opportunity to spit fire at the crew's losing the love of her life in the 2009 effort, tremendous strain is undertaken to prevent Teddy's father from ever knowing that they placed this clean-cut young man in the way of any kind of harm. Despite not necessarily having anything 'wrong' with him, it had already been established that Stuart is disliked profusely by his future father in-law - the vanishing of Teddy under his watch risks enraging him even further, potentially scuppering the wedding entirely. But without Teddy's father ever discovering he was first lost, and then retrieved, nothing is learnt and the entire arc of his coming to accept Stuart as an in-law himself is rendered totally redundant.""The Hangover"", not to mention this sequel, are films which most people seem to really enjoy - I think most critics seemed to realise they were had the first time round when the time came to see this second film, hence the backlash which seems to have been born out of their own frustration with themselves for not getting the review right first time round. I'd like to be able to enjoy it all with everybody else, but I just find myself unable to get involved with any of it. You could do a lot worse than this and its slightly older brother, but you could probably do better.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sequel or Remake?,"So here's how it goes, three guys wake up in a hotel room with no recollection of the night before, with obvious signs of misdeeds, including a missing friend. Does any of this sound familiar to you genre fans? Well it should, because it is EXACTLY like the first Hangover movie. The same movie only in Bangkok/Thailand, and this time Stu is the one getting married, Doug's wife is pregnant and the bride-to-be's little brother is the one missing. This might sound like good news to some Hangover fans, but this fan was, once again, left unsatisfied.Whatever the reason is, I just did not like this movie. I wanted so badly to love this movie, but alas, I did not. None of the actors seemed to be on their a-game either, as Ed Helms, over does it with the squeamish, wimp routine and Bradley Cooper seems like he could careless. Zach Galifianakis, who got most of the good lines, pulls them off well enough, but the writers didn't stain any muscles trying to give him anything to work with.It's hard to say exactly what could have made this movie better. Quiet frankly I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was this lazy. The filmmakers even went as far as to recreate, almost to a tea, some of the scenes from the first one. Opening the movie with a phone call to Tracey. Running around on the roof looking for Teddy, mirroring running on the roof looking for Doug. The moment Stu realizes where the missing person is. . . blah blah blah – Oh and take a guess as to how the movie ends?Overall, The Hangover Part II, is not as memorable as the first one, there aren't as many quotable lines, and Bridesmaids was a much better film. The movie earned it's R rating, but it still managed to feel safe, lazy and tired. So in end the end, I will let this week's movie slide with a 4 for sometimes making me laugh.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not as good as the Original,"I was interested in seeing the Hangover Part II because I enjoyed the original Hangover and I read many more negative reviews. The Hangover Part II feels padded at 102 minutes. At the same time, it sticks so closely to the original's template that it could almost be deemed a remake rather than sequel.Add to that humor that never transcends the juvenile, and you have an annoying movie. Director Todd Philips and his writing team, Scot Armstrong and Craig Mazin, fill the film with penis jokes, Asian stereotypes, and pop culture references. Not much originality here, just more cruder and much less funny jokes.A movie like this needs as many solid one-liners as possible. The first part of the film goes to great pains to reintroduce the characters, still recovering from their Las Vegas misadventure in The Hangover. This much exposition seems like a waste of time for a comedy of this nature.It is also a mistake on the director's part to spend so much capital on reminding us of the first movie-when he is about to offer us up such a poor excuse for a sequel.Even when the guys finally get to Thailand for the main action, The Hangover Part II takes its pretty time picking up any steam. Their protracted search through Bangkok for a missing teenager who partied too hard with them on another lost night gets old fast.The characters themselves, which should be the film's strongest selling point, are not really happening either. Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) all feel undercooked now-less than one-dimensional. Philips often has the three screaming at one another as they trek through Bangkok. The chemistry among the three actors has gone flat, and their bickering starts to feel interminable.The new teen character, Teddy (Mason Lee), Stu's fiancée's little brother, could have been developed into a genuine addition but is basically discarded for most of the movie. The film ends on a decidedly sour note when the guys discover, as in the first movie, digital photos of the night they cannot remember.Overall, The Hangover Part II has a slapdash quality. The filmmakers probably should have taken more time to think things through. The movie even looks slapped together: the mise-en-scene is sloppy, the makeup is uneven, and there are continuity errors galore. The film takes itself too seriously and it works more as a drama with comedy/action elements than a straight up comedy.=== As a rewatch (03/06/18') The Hangover Part 2 is somewhat as remembered, it being a very similar copy to the original. From the opening scene and ending scene of part 2, is the same as we saw in part 1. What made the original great is tat it was believable and refreshing, as Part 2 is essentially the same thing, just set in a different location, with minor differences. There are some decent funny moments but nothing as funny and unpredictable as the original. Overall, it's a decent watch of entertainment but lack in the magic and suspense of the original. As a another rewatch 05/31/19' to and a day after rewatching the first Hangover to share the similarities and rehash the memories, it's clear again that this sequel isn't nearly as good and original as the first. There are enjoyable scenes since the crew are back together but overall, this isn't as funny, entertaining or thrilling.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Shameful, All-Hands-On-Deck Money Grab","Let's begin by stipulating that the original film - The Hangover - is a lovely tale of prototypical male debauchery, caked in copious volumes of bodily fluids, and told with belly-aching comedic genius. That said, this thing - its snot-nosed sibling, the tellingly-named The Hangover Part II - stokes our worst fears about Hollywood, from our vague notions of which ideologies govern studio decisions right down to our presumptions that many of our adored actors will carelessly sacrifice their bodies of work to squeeze gold from a clear-cut lemon.Despite our hopes that the sequel would be made bulletproof by its returning cast, The Hangover Part II is Really That Bad. Consumed in a living room full of its prototypical target audience members - GenX white males - not a outward chuckle or guffaw was heard until after the one-hour mark. Finishing the film then led to a few hours of quiet group anger and subsequent cool-down, as everyone bearing witness will surely want those lost hours back at end-of-life.The Hangover Part II presents the emerging reality that any attempts at a well-crafted sequel - equal in ambition to the first - are often never taken up, and instead are preemptively discarded in favor of a poorly-executed but expedient, get-it-while-its-hot shadow of its previous self.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Spends too much time away from the hapless threesomes interplay,"Todd Phillips' approach to part two of his surprise comedy smash The Hangover (2009) is that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The original made bona fide stars out of its lead trio and grossed half a billion dollars in the process, so a sequel was always going to be on the cards. The simple formula of the hapless heroes waking up from a stag night of drink, drugs and debauchery to find the groom missing and a variety of clues lying around to help them work out just what the hell happened felt fresh, and the natural charisma of its stars, particularly Zach Galifianakis, made for a hilarious experience.By sticking to the formula, Phillips has forced himself to a corner where the details have to bigger and more outlandish. Instead of Vegas, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Galifianakis) are in Thailand to celebrate Stu's upcoming wedding to Lauren (Jamie Chung). After a planned quiet night on the beach with a beer and marshmallows, they wake up in a grimy hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of the night before and inexplicably in the presence of gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeung) from the first film. When Chow seemingly overdoses on cocaine, they are left to piece things together themselves.If this was a stand-alone movie without the existence of its predecessor, then this probably would have been a winner. While its frequently goes overboard with the crass humour, its consistently amusing without succeeding in being quite so laugh-out-loud as the first movie, thanks mainly again to Galifianakis, whose man-child Alan is the funniest aspect of the film. Yet while his naivety and plain stupidity was so endearing in the original, the sequel also takes Alan to increasingly dark places. Here, he is not so much social inept but dangerously insane to the point that he becomes occasionally outright unlikeable.And this is the main issue - replacing charm and goofiness with extreme humour. Stu was missing a tooth in the first film, but this time he wakes up with a Mike Tyson tribal tattoo on his face. Rather than Tyson's tiger, we have a chain-smoking drug-mule monkey. Rather than finding Doug (Justin Bartha) vanished, they lose Lauren's prodigal younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee), to which the only clue to his participation is his severed finger. And having previously married a stripper, Stu discovers that - in the most uncomfortably unfunny scene - he has been sodomised by a ladyboy. Add to the mix a sub-plot involving gangster Kingsley (Paul Giamatti) and his search for Chow, the film spends too much time away from the hapless threesome's interplay in favour of watching their reactions to a variety of cruel situations.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Hangover Part II - 2 Stars,"We've been told before to touch not the things that are without fault. Altering that which is already awesome could be a risky act, but repeating it could be even worse, because it shows no diligence and bravery. ""The Hangover Part II"" resembles its 2009 predecessor so much that it's probably more appropriate to regard it as a remake, than as a sequel.The extent of the similarity between the two ""Hangover"" movies suggests hungry wallets for its makers. When the script is hurried, the shooting will be also. Paychecks are rewarded earlier, and audiences are left to watch a meaner, dirtier, and more offensive version of the same movie. There is a significant increase in violence, coarse language, and public display of privates. To warn viewers that are more sensitive, I would specify which organs to expect, but the setting of the film is Thailand, and if there's one thing I learned, it's that we can never be sure of what we see.The setting is in Thailand because Stu's fiancée, Lauren, is from that country, and her parents wish that the wedding is to be held there. Phil, Alan and Doug join Stu, which later leads to a beer at a beach with Lauren's little brother, Teddy. The next morning they uhm forget it. You know the drill. Our heroes wake up with a lack of memory and a series of questions, and from this point on we are tasked to listen to conversations we have all heard before.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-hangover-part-2-movie- review/",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much weaker than the original,"A general rule of thumb regarding films is that sequels tend to be much worse than the originals. Serious film directors such as Stanley Kubrick, for example, would never do sequels: it doesn't make any artistic sense to make sequels. Instead one should make other films.This film is pretty much a repeat of the first but worse in all aspects: the execution suffered and the director was only trying to repeat what was already done in the first time. Therefore this is an abysmal failure of a film: it is better to watch the first twice than watch the first and then this one. Though it is not that bad if you never saw the first, which is superior in every way.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pretty lousy repeat,"The Hangover Part II is every bit as bad as you might expect a sequel to be when it simply apes what happened in the previous film. It strives to be uncreative, throwing its dim-witted, unlikeable leads into the same situations, with nearly identical jokes and shock moments. It's not even guilty-pleasure trash.This time around, it's dentist Stu (Ed Helms) who's getting married. In Thailand, of course, where his betrothed is from. Of course it's Thailand, having them get married in Kansas would be dumb. Anyway, the Wolf Pack schleps off to the Far East, with not-sane Alan (Zach Galianifikis) in tow. Oh, and the bride's teenage brother, who happens to be studying at Stanford. Because he has a pushy dad, that's why.Things go wrong just as they did in the first one in that, after enjoying a toast on the beach, the friends wake up in some hellhole, this time in Bangkok. They then spend the rest of the film figuring out where they are, where the teenager is, and how to save the wedding - again, somewhat of a repeat of the first film.Raunchy movies can be a lot of fun, but this one offers very little in terms of wit, just blustery Americanisms (such as yelling louder at someone who might not understand English). Some fun is poked at the seedy underbelly of Bangkok itself and at culture clash in general, but it's an impotent mess. There's much racing about madly as the characters dash from scene to scene. In this case, that may have helped the movie, as one didn't have time to contemplate the implausible plot too much.Let's look at some good parts. Paul Giamatti has a quick, showy role as a crime boss and does well. Mike Tyson sings and shows some personality. That's about it. The rest might make you cringe - if you had cared enough about the characters to begin with. Oh, there was one other good thing - the weakest character from the first film, Doug (Justin Bartha) is left to communicate with the other three via cell phone, wondering where they are. Smart move, because that guy was boring (he was the ""lost one"" they had to find in the previous film).I suppose if you got really drunk and didn't care about anything more than a moving picture, you might find this endurable. Or maybe you could make a drinking game out of it - every time a monkey did something interesting, take a shot. Other than that, it's worthless.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The acting is great, the jokes are funny, the atmosphere is authentic, the only spot Hangover II misses out on is in fact the thing that made the previous one more than just a funny movie -the formula.

Sort of like watching a rerun of a really good episode,"The Hangover was a one joke premise that stretched into a slew of laughs. It's safe to say that a similar premise would work and be equally as funny. The problem with ""The Hangover II"" is that it has some good jokes, and its enjoyable to watch, but, like an all too faithful cover song, it's wayyyy too familiar and it lacks originality.My real issue with it is that the premise is too similar to the first. Guys take bride/groom brother with them, have wild night, forget everything, have to find him. The repeat premise and some of the gags are almost cringeworthy. It's almost as if it's the same script with a little cut and paste work done on the gags for good measure.But some of the jokes are funny. Most of the humor works because the guys are discovering what they did for the evening and forgot. It's when we see this stuff that we laugh. A couple of the outrageous moments involving Stu are hilarious.But then there's that stuff that drags or the stuff that's too derivative. What's the deal with Paul Giamatti - such a great actor in a small part without much to do. Or the fact that some of their hijinks involves more action than humor that it seems the film, as we near the end, is going through the motions.Perhaps the first one relied so heavily on the premise that it became a novelty film, and shouldn't have been repeated so faithfully. If there is a Hangover 3, it better have a big dose of originality. If they tried to imitate the premise again, wed end up in Friday the 13th land..and I don't think I could take another 10 of these.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but flawed,"Like most comedies there are moments which make you generally laugh out loud, this film was no exception.Zach Galifianakis' performance was once again the highlight of this film, and the one thing which ensured the laughs were never too far away. The problem I have with this film is the apparently indiscriminate use of expletives when there was absolutely no need for them. And as other people have pointed out in previous reviews, the racial stereotypes where taken a stage too far, many (but not all) of them involving the character 'Mr Chow'.In summary I would have to conclude that it was funny, but to be honest my laughter was drowned out by the cringe-worthiness the longer the film dragged on and in the end I couldn't wait for it to be over.3/10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Saddest part is it was a smash at box office which makes me question people's senses of humour if this is funny to them.In the duration of the full film I laughed once, and it wasn't even a real laugh, it was more of a cringe worthy laugh. The acting is... *thinks of a non-offensive word* ...appalling. The whole scenario of which is film is based is retarded. The script should of been burnt.I will say one thing that this movie did do well at... And that is having people use their hard earned money to watch this garbage.

Were you expecting much,"The Hangover Part 2 met all of my expectations. Sadly my expectations for this movie were low.

At times it seems like it's playing it safe by doing the exact same thing as the first movie and at other times it just goes off the reservation. I commend them for trying to take the movie to the next level, however, since the first movie was so crazy taking the sequel to the next level is just to insane for my taste.

This movie is basically a rehash of the first movie, but the first one was more fluid when it came to it's comedic elements and more entertaining. This one just seemed to be trying a bit too hard because the first one was such a success. It was like the movie was trying to make the scenarios cool but it just lacked in it's comedic value. The situation and everything just seemed way too over exaggerated and it goes in a direction where it's difficult to just go with the flow. The only big originality is that the pack is now in Bangkok but even than it doesn't give anything all that new or all that funny. If this movie came before the original I am not sure if this franchise would have been a hit. I was continuously waiting for this movie to be at least a good comedy but it just never really reached that level. It just seemed like they didn't have a clever direction or a good comedic plot but just wanted to cash in as soon as possible.

A lazy remake of the original and a poor facsimile,"The second in what is sure to become a trilogy, breaks a cardinal rule for a comedy, it forgets to be funny.The cast get to say ""I can't believe it's happening again"" and the audience feels the same way, the movie is a carbon copy of the first fun and mostly inventive film.The ""Wolf Pack"" are back but this time they are somewhere way more dangerous than Vegas, Thailand and more specifically Bangkok. As is mentioned in the tagline ""Bangkok has them now"", although most audiences will realise that Bangkok has merely replaced Las Vegas, as little else is different.Still with over $500 million at the the box office director Tod Phillips must have got something right? Meek dentist, Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married to an Asian beauty complete with stereotypical overbearing father, meek mother and idolized talented younger brother Teddy (Lee), a nod to the younger demographic.Of course his buddies are invited to the bash at an upmarket resort in Thailand, Phil (Cooper) & Doug (Bartha), although man child Alan's (Galifanakis) invite is not forthcoming. Unsurprisingly left on the sidelines due to his errant behaviour in the first film, will he be left behind this time, need we even ask that question.Everything is going swimmingly apart from the usual inappropriate behaviour by Alan, until the ""one beer"" before the big day, turns into another mammoth hangover wake up scene.Substitute missing teeth for tattoo's, tigers for a monkey, add in a severed finger, several cocaine ""bumps"" to clear the head, Mike Tyson and stir fry quickly. We are then treated to the stereotypical underside of Bangkok which will do nothing for the Thailand tourist industry. Seedy rooms, criminals in the form of Paul Giamatti and the predictably unpredictable Mr Chow (Cheong), not quite as out of place as some recent films he has appeared in, perhaps the milieu suits his weird character or acting traits better.Will the ""Wolf Pack"" be able to re-assemble the night before in time for the nuptials to occur on time with everyone happy, if you think not, then maybe you are watching the wrong film.The journey is the thing and this is where the film deviates from what audiences expect, by providing exactly what audiences expect with no variation on the original film. Less funny, same ""F & C"" bomb heavy dialogue, more raunchy situations, reversing the recent trend from mostly female nudity to a combination of both in the same body. Certainly Ed's new bride seems more understanding than one might expect a new bride to be, stag party mayhem maybe but....Galifanakis again reprises his role carried across the original ""Hangover"", ""Due Date"" and now the sequel, seemingly popping up in every movie playing a similar part. Cooper of course has gone all ""A"" List since the first film and Helms is also now gainfully employed in the American version of ""The Office"".Cooper is clearly now too good to be in this tosh and his star quality does show through despite the obvious flaws of the film, Bartha is largely sidelined again and Giamatti obviously fancied a free holiday, with almost a cameo part. Tyson apparently taking singing lessons for his big scene, if this is the result post training then clearly the boxing ring was the right career choice.Do we need another sequel, do the actors need another film to bolster their careers, of course not. With box office receipts north of half a billion dollars, this however will be a foregone conclusion.Inversely proportional monetary returns against critical or enjoyment value, we are clearly heading in the wrong direction and this trend is unlikely to be reversed in the final installment. Clearly poor reviews nor bad word of mouth will stop the ""Wolf Pack"" juggernaut, big business has them now.Curiously the closing credits on the Blu-Ray version, retains the controversial fake recreation still of a real life execution, which is odd bearing in mind the offence the shot has caused. This perhaps emphasizes the apparent contempt director Phillips has for his audience.SummaryA lazy remake of the original and a poor facsimile. Might raise the occasional titter but largely can be avoided unless the ""Wolf Pack"", the Asian version, really appeals.Disappointinghttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still Raunchy  and Still NOT Funny,"The same group of friends that were in Hangover 1 set out for Stu's (Helms) wedding in Thailand. And, as before, of course, they enjoy a last drink with Stu as a single man. And, of course, three of them Phil (Cooper), Alan (Galifianakis) and Stu wake up the next morning in Bangkok, miles away from the wedding site. And none of them, of course, can remember anything of what happened the night before and Teddy (Lee) is not with them and where is he?The formula is the same. They find a clue where to go and at each place they go to they are told of their bad behavior the night before and somehow come up with another clue toward solving the mystery. And, of course, they remember nothing. Now, all this wouldn't be so bad if the things I witnessed didn't come to pass. When you try too hard to be funny, you fail. And, they failed big time. There is no other way to say it.Touted as a comedy, I found nothing funny in here. I witnessed a lot of raunchy bathroom behavior that many call humor, a lot of overacting, frontal nudity of both male and female bodies, and raunchy sex language throughout. And, will someone please tell me what Galifianakis' claim to comedy fame is. I do not find him even remotely funny. And, as I mentioned in my H1 review, he was very good in a dramatic role in IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY. Yet, he continues to try comedy. Go figure.The only breath of fresh air was Mr. Chow (Jeong). Yes, he had the potty mouth (as most did) too, but his delivery kind of livened up the place. He's pretty good.And, to finish off the formula, you just know a camera will be found that shows pictures of all them and what they did the night before when they couldn't remember anything the next day. And, of course, many of those pictures are really crude. Of course.The Hangover 2 had to be made because they realized that Hangover 1 was not funny when they promised laughs. Well, not funny except for the taser scenes in front of children as they were LOL funny. But, I guess the joke (give me a break) is on them because this was not funny either. Will there be a H3 to make things right? Stay tuned. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, male and female frontal. Raunchy Sex Talk: Throughout. Language: Throughout",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bad Sequel,"The writers I think tried to make a sequel out of this movie, but Hangover was not the kind of movie you make a sequel of. This type of movie they should have used some of the actors from this movie and put them into a brand new movie with similar humor as Hangover. The equivalent of this would be like making a sequel to ""Superbad"" it would not work instead writers like Seth Rogen take some of the actors from that movie and place them into a new story which will attracted the audience of the first movie. That is how the Hangover cast should have been used, not in a sequel. I recommended you skip this movie.

"Even drunk, you'll hear crickets","* out of (****)Let's cut to the chase: ""The Hangover Part II"" is one of the laziest, unfunniest, and crude films I've ever seen and is the perfect candidate for the worst film of the year. The fact that such a trainwreck was greenlit makes me cringe for Hollywood. Yes, Hollywood has sunken low, but this... this is just hitting rock bottom. The most ironic part is that ""The Hangover"" was one of the best movies of its year. Funny how, fast-forward in time, the iconic sequel winds up being the complete opposite. The sad part such a film like this is making every one of its millions spent back and there'll be more sequels to come, no doubt about it. With a year full of disasters (i.e. ""Sucker Punch"", ""The Rite"", ""Arthur), we might've found a new stinker award.So what's so rancid and unforgiving about Todd Phillip's sophomore adventure with these mongoloids? First off, almost 95% of the jokes in this movie are completely recycled. I understand as a sequel, you have to include some homages here and there or your humor might be the same, but almost quote for quote, word by word? That just says a lot about your credibility right there. Second of all, this film is a drag. As the film progresses, it increasingly becomes more dull and uninteresting. And what really takes the cake is how lazy this film is. Anything that would be shocking, yet simultaneously innovative is just presented bland and insipid here. Congratulations, Todd, you're film might just snag up a few Razzies.The acting? Everyone here is under-looked because they leave Alan to be the star of the show and boy, was that the worst idea fathomable. If you don't already know, my favorite character from the first movie was Alan. Every time he was on-screen he just stole every scene and would have me quoting his lines everyday. Now, he is just a waste of a character and someone I would single-handedly like to punch square in the face. Every other actor just looks like they had the life sucked out of them. Don't even get me started on the amateur, poor direction that the director had his grubby little hands on.You know what I think was the downfall of this movie? The hype got to everyone's head. Here's an idea for a sequel: Either make it right or simply, just don't make it at all. Aside from a few jokes, which are TV sitcom worthy at best, this would've gotten a one, easily. ""The Hangover: Part II"" is not only one of the most disappointing films of the year... it's also the worst.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen.,"'Hangover Part II', is an American offering, which probably cost a small fortune to make and also did amazingly well at the box office. I had no excuse for watching it, as every single review panned it mercilessly; and well should they have done. I had previously seen Hangover 1, which although fairly banal, did contain some good, original humour and was well acted by the main protagonists.As those who have read about Hangover II or, like me, have had the misfortune to watch it will know, the sequel simply uses all the gags from the first movie. It transplants them to some kind of crazy, make- believe Asian state, occasionally referred to as Thailand, (although the local people are referred to as 'Asiatics' not Thai), but which bears no resemblance to any country that I have ever had the misfortune to live in.Not that this would matter if the film was entertaining; but it isn't. It is total, unadulterated crap without a single redeeming feature.Quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More like The Hangover I Part II,"Have you ever seen The Hangover? I will be really surprised if anyone is thinking no! If you have seen the first just take the entire story, remove it from Las Vegas, take it across the world, and drop it in Bangkok. Then start the story again and replace any pivotal moments from the first with a new animal, incapable human or disfigurement.The second one is based around Stu's wedding. He is about to marry a gorgeous Thai woman (not a Thai bride and way too pretty for him), and is making Phil and Doug come with him to the wedding, especially since his father-in-law to be hates him. Initially Alan is uninvited but after much persuasion from Doug and Phil, Stu allows it. Once we are in Thailand each character begins to show their typical characterisations: Phil is the party animal, Stu is Mr. Sensible and Alan is stupid as can be.Stu is adamant no bachelor party will take place but agrees to one quiet beer on the beach with Phil, Alan, Doug and his fiancée's little genius brother Teddy. Zoom forward twelve hours later and the original 'wolf pack' wake up in a shady hotel in Bangkok. From there we are back in the Las Vegas hotel room with Stu waking up with a tattoo (not missing a tooth) and a monkey in the bathroom (not a lion) and one of the group missing, Teddy (not Doug cause he's boring and stayed at the resort). From here we see the group trying to remember what happened the night before and trace back their tracks through the stuff in their pockets and find themselves at a police station, a hospital, a tattooist and a monastery. Does this all sound familiar? Well if it does when you think of the first one and piece together how they found Doug, you may know where Teddy is from the beginning. Honestly this film just takes the entire thread of the first film and changes a few details along the way. It takes away all element of surprise.There are still some good laughs in this film. Many will be disappointed but many will still be laughing. The jokes in this one are a lot cruder and darker. It also shows well the dirty shady areas of a place like Bangkok compared to Las Vegas. The jokes though mainly come from Alan (Galifanakas) and mainly at the expense of Stu (Helms). Once again like the first one I found Phil (Cooper) nowhere near as funny as the others and seems to be the one that less funny stuff happens to. Alan's stupidity is really the driving force of the comedy and there are a few very funny bits including the whole scene of have 'a demon' in Stu. Probably the funniest part of it all. The problem with the Alan character though is that they seem to have made him even more stupid and over the top. They've done to Alan what the American Pie franchise done to Stifler. He just got more silly and it became worse rather than better.The Hangover II is an easy watch, and you will probably be laughing at the anticipation of it as opposed to the comedy of it. We also get Chow (Ken Jeong), back from the first one. He appears much more in this one and at times is completely over the top and it can be a little cringe worthy. Even more cringe worthy though would be the cameo from Mike Tyson. Something that was completely unneeded. He can't act or sing for that matter. There is also a fatter Paul Giamatti. His talents are wasted here and he may watch this and see how bad he looks.I have to say I am a little disappointed with this sequel but I was expecting that. If the writers had of taken it in a different direction it could have really worked, but by producing a carbon copy of the original they have ruined it. In parts it is funny and it is an easy watch so it won't be the worst film you have ever seen but it is not a patch on the original. You may as well give it a watch as it is a bit of fun but let's just hope, with The Hangover Part III in the pipeline, that they at least take us in a different direction and not just show Alan getting married in Amsterdam, with a snake instead of a monkey, Stu having had a nose job and Alan's Dad going missing.

Pure garbage from beginning to end,"Hangover Part II is a sequel, yet follows the exact same plot structure as the original. This time, dentist Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand and invites the old gang to his wedding including Doug (Justin Bartha), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After a night drinking at the beach with the Wolfpack gang and Stu's fiancée's brother Teddy (Mason Lee). The Wolfpack (excluding Doug) wake up in a hotel in Bangkok with no recollection to what happened the night before. They have to retrace their steps and find Teddy before the day of the wedding.I hated my experience this film even more than I initially expected. Not to say that I loved the original Hangover, but at least I could understand the suggestive on-the-nose humour and what it was going for. The main caveat of the Hangover films is that you're supposed to like the main trio, but I don't like any of them - especially the character of Alan, who is just pretentious and annoying beyond belief. This time around, the comedy surrounds more raunchy sex stunts and rampant partying which doesn't interest or amuse me in the slightest here. I especially hate the homophobic stuff on display because it's wicked and just plain vile. There is a subplot about mobsters which use a chain-smoking monkey to do drug deals which goes completely nowhere and only sets up an action setpiece and the obnoxiously flamboyant caricature of Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) returns for the sequel, but only becomes a major character later on.Perhaps the whole Hangover trilogy might have more of a cultural impact in the U. S., and I as a British movie-goer found none of the gags in Part II funny and was quite frankly bored with it once I knew that it was going to be a complete rehash of the original. In all truthfulness, this and other Hangover films heavily panders to the American Pie demographic which is a culture of just drink, drugs and sex and nothing else. It's not smart, it's completely mindless, stubborn, sexist, and immature without doing anything else and I'm glad that these films aren't being made any more.In summary I can't recommend this film to anyone at all unless you don't value your time on Earth. Go watch the original Hangover if you will, but there's much better buddy comedy films than this on the market.I'd much rather watch Superbad 3 times over than Hangover Part II again and that's saying something. It is in my catalogue of worst films I've ever watched.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lacking the feel of a bachelor party,"The first Hangover set the standard. It was a legendary night of craziness that resonates with men who have participated in insane bachelor parties, or sets the tone for those who will. It captured the mentality, the feel, the utter spontaneity of a ""last night out with your bachelor friend."" It correctly understood that the bachelor party brings together people who meet for the first time - a combination of high school friends, college friends, brothers and cousins - who collaborate on a common quest to celebrate the end of single life for a special person.That's what made the first Hangover special. For the most part, the sequel lacked that feel. There was less celebration and much more panic. And it really missed the opportunity to bring in an additional character to truly mix things up. The brother of the bride was hardly involved, but when he was, he was too meek, too geeky, and generally a pain to watch.At times this movie felt too serious for a bachelor party celebration, and at others too repetitive. It was essentially the same recipe as the first, except it was set in Bangkok and with a couple of minor changes. Unlike the first installment, which provided a steady stream of comedy, this one sputters throughout, although it does have several laugh out loud moments.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Self plagiarism (and poorly done),"This movie is the worst of the trilogy. It repeats almost everything bit by bit from the original without blushing, taking away any chance of being surprised by it. A copy that only changes little non fundamental details puts the nail in the coffin with a terrible script filled of bad jokes. Like almost every sequel, tries to intensify what it worked in the original, so all the malice and dark humor morphs into just unlikeable and boring situations and ""jokes"" (there are exceptions).The directions, score, acting. None of that is bad per se. It's actually on the same level than before, but all of those aspects get bog down with the original scene (copy paste).This is literally a self plagiarism from Phillips, but instead of improving the worst parts and make the good ones even better, everything is just worse. Unfunny jokes and just incredible situations. What was a laugh about something bad that happened to a ""bro"", now it is just a total lack of care for each other. What was a character being brutally honest is now just an insult. What was an over the top antagonists turns into a fish too big for our characters (Giamatti doesn't help). Anyways.

The characters do the same phil acts like a jackass stu is a wimp with a wild side and alan is his crazy self. the cast has good chemistry and with more of a role for mr chow makes for some laughs. u will enjoy this movie if u are a fan of the first but if your not u will think its stupid hopefully they can inprove with hangover 3 but we will wait and see wanted to give this movie a higher rating than a 6 but couldn't because of its similarities to the first but u should still see this as its better than most comedies out there.,5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
But did you die???,"Ok, so this was an easy money grab for the studio. I mean just try to milk this plot and with even more craziness. Obviously this didn't live up nor surpasses its predecessor. However, there are a few bright spots here and there. The movie isn't a total failure, but the gag kinda seems outdated already as you can't really surprise an audience already.I think Helms and Cooper have a pass as they do their best. However, Galifinakis is unbearable at times. I don't understand sometimes his character at all. He is trying to play an awkward role too hard. In the first movie it did blend in subtly in the majority of parts, but you were gonna bank on the studio giving him more screen time in the second movie completely making him really annoying.Now, I did say the movie had some bright spots and of course that was Chow. He lifts the movie up when he is on screen and gives the other characters things to play off. It definitely made it more enjoyable.Since the movie is a copy and paste from the first one, there aren't different conclusions as the first one, just that the experience makes them bond and allow Helms character to stand up for himself.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Same movie, same old jokes, Different setting","The Hangover 2 gives you the same feeling you get when you drink too much the night before and wake up with a piercing headache. The Wolf Pack is back, this time they are heading to Thailand for their friend Stu's wedding. Stu wants a peacefully relaxing wedding with his friends with no signs of a bachelor party. When the Wolf Pack arrives in Thailand they decided to have one beer by a bonfire on the beach with Stu's future brother in-law Teddy then head to bed. Morning comes and the Wolf Pack awake in a seedy hotel room in Bangkok. Not remembering what happened the night before, the boys try to remember what happened the night before. As they try to recollect what happened, they realize Teddy is missing and they need to find out what happened and where Teddy is before the wedding in two days. My problem with The Hangover 2 is not the similar storyline, just a different city, but the way the movie tries to force you to laugh. Having an almost exact same storyline with some forced laughter is going to bore the audience. I felt bored through the entire movie waiting when the big laughs will happen. These big laughs have to happen soon. Then as the movie progressed, will there be any big laughs? I felt cheated in this movie. There are no real new jokes. Instead of a baby, they have a monkey this time. Their missing friend was where they first began like last time. They got beat up by Chow again like the first one. The same jokes, the same situations continue. The Wolf Pack even thought they found their missing friend like in the first and low and behold the friend was the wrong person. Then the movie tried to push laughter on the audience with the trans-gender scenes and jokes. The jokes grossed you out more then made you laugh, the ploy backfired. They fired a lot at the audience but ultimately failed. No one in the audience in my theater was laughing and the movie was sold out. There were no major problems with any of the direction, cinematography, or acting. This is a comedy; the movie is not graded on those merits as much as a movie like Lord of The Rings or The Godfather mold is. Though Zach Galifianakis has fallen into the same category as Adam Sandler, Michael Cera, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell, and Rob Schneider, he is type cast as the same person in every role and every movie, though Will Ferrell and Rob Schneider were never good or funny for that matter. The Hangover 2 will leave you searching for that aspirin after a heavy night of drinking. Watching this film in the movies is not worth full price or matinée. I say skip a blind buy and wait for the movie to available in the Redbox for a dollar if you really need to see this. The Hangover 2 is 5/10 or C for average at best",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The first remake made by the same guys in the same language.,"I've seen remakes of foreign films that were 'Americanised' to cater to a broader market, some of them even used the same director and occasionally some members of the cast from the original film.The Hangover 2 is the first time I have seen an American movie taken to Asia to be remade in a new locale, albeit with the same cast and director.For anyone who has seen the original I'll fast forward through the backdrop – it's the same. Phil is still slightly cavalier, Alan is still socially inept (I resent the fact that this is highlighted repeatedly through his love of Billy Joel – I like Billy Joel went to his concert a few years back and everything) and Ed is still worried about what 'others' will think.A wedding is looming, the trio of buddies get together for a pre-wedding drink (this time not a bachelor party as such), Alan is again a grudge invite as the 'relo of a friend'.It is Stu that is being married, and the fact that he is marrying a Thai hottie (Jamie Chung) justifies the Bangkok location, which lends itself well to debauchery and all round seediness, (something only exacerbated when helium voiced Mr Chow inexplicably arrives on the scene).After a seemingly innocent 'one beer' the night before the wedding, the trio wake up in unfamiliar surroundings with no recollection of the previous night. They find themselves changed.Alan (Zach Galipoliticalfinance), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) must spend the short time left until the looming wedding to locate a missing individual.This time round it is the brother of the bride who has gone, a 16 year old genius named Teddywho also happens to be the favourite of his fatherwho by the way thinks precious little of Stuwho is extremely worried that the fact that this (now) 9 fingered boy being lost on his watch might count as a minus with the new in-lawsSo in these familiarly unfamiliar circumstances there seems to be little option aside from empty the pockets, check the phones and let's go round again. Along the way the trio run into a stolen monk, Russian gangsters, ladyboys, a tattooist and a monkey drug mule, and at every turn they leave a trail of damage somewhat akin to a touring AFL footy team on an offseason trip.The situation becomes so 'samey' that they might well be working from the same script, anyone who cadged a laugh in the first film returns, the afore-mentioned Mr Chow (Ken Leung), Mike Tyson and many of the events and hijinks are merely tweaked variations from the first film.My wife rightfully pointed out the fact that somehow a 16 year old Thai boy being lost in Thailand isn't really that big a dilemma. I mean you would hope that the Thai language and customs might not be such a stretch for himI also wonder how the same three guys end up in the same spot after being absolutely black-out drunk on two separate occasions in two entirely separate continents. I recall when I was younger I had difficulty locating my shoes when awakening from a period of alcohol induced time travel, let alone my mates.Other flaws include the fact that Alan is leant upon for laughs at every occasion simply because he reacts illogically at every turn, yes it was funny a couple times, but the thirty-fifth time he says something dumb it loses it sheen somewhat. On a related note; Zach G, if you keep on recycling the same character again and again your 15 minutes will soon expire.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Despite all this I kinda enjoyed The Hangover 2 despite myself, probably because it was in reality a watered down version of itself, but if they try to pull this sh*t again I will have to draw the line.P.S. To whoever put the soundtrack together: Even one Kanye West song is too many, two Kanye West songs are way out of line, and you only compound the misery by callously including a Black Eyed Peas song to heighten my misery. I'mo be, I'mo be, I'mo be out of patience very soon with this blatantly commercial pseudo hip-hop with no redeeming qualities.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More Repulsive than Funny,"There is nothing funny about accidentally having sex with a male prostitute, repetitively showing full frontal male nudity or having someone lose a finger ""having fun"". The handful of jokes that I actually laughed at could have been made into a five minute comedy skit and I do not think I laughed once after the 30 minute mark. It was as if this was written by entirely different writers for an entirely different audience.I don't even have a problem with using the same formula as the original and just substituting things like a tattoo for a tooth and a monkey for a tiger but immediately after that it goes completely downhill and never recovers. So much opportunity was wasted in this and instead of making this a typical ""guy"" film it just became more and more disturbing to the point where I actually found it repulsive. The ending shots are the exact opposite of the first one and hard to watch.I am only giving this an extra star for the handful of funny jokes in the beginning and a couple of decent music montages but I can never recommend this to anyone I know.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A boring rerun which should be avoided by all except Die Hards,"I have to admit that I was not at all excited to see this movie. As much as I enjoyed the original, I felt very ""full"" at the end. By that I mean, I had just about grown sick of Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms and the genre of tenuous comedy they were going for. Then hearing feedback that it was much of the same didn't make me excited. The result after viewing the film is much as I predicted; This was a movie that lived off of the fame the first movie offered. It's like a classic car, it was fixed up to run like the original. However, the result is underwhelming. I was actually bored for most of the movie, and it actually made me question what I enjoyed about the first. Overall, unless you were one of those people who quoted the original endlessly, or are really pumped to see this sequel, avoid it.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A let-down of a sequel,"""The Hangover Part II"" qualifies to the hall of fame of sequel films that should never have been done. Basically a carbon copy of its predecessor (one of the greatest comedies of its decade), ""The Hangover Part II"" shows that a change of setting doesn't cover up rehashes and recycled material. While the first part wasn't exactly a character study, ""Part II"" is blatantly lazy in its writing. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips also made the questionable decision to let the highlight Zach Galifianakis as Alan, be somewhat toned down in this film, which surely isn't beneficial for this formulaic comedy. It would be a lie to deny, that ""The Hangover Part II"" generates laughs, but its for its raw raunchiness only and no longer for any surprises.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The first one was way better,"""The Hangover Part II"" is the perfect example of a movie that was specifically made to cash in on the success of its predecessor. Without any new ideas and following a very similar story, it seems that the producers wanted to play it safe and offer the audience more of the same stuff that made ""The Hangover"" the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time. What they don't understand is that the first one was successful because it was so original and creative.I don't think that the film's only problem is the fact that it follows basically the same plot as the first one (other movies have done that and they still managed to be very good – ""Evil Dead II"" comes to mind, a film that is even better than the original). The simple fact is that even if this film had a totally different story it still wouldn't have been as good as ""The Hangover"" because it is just not as funny as the first film. One thing that made ""The Hangover"" a good comedy was the relationship between the three main characters. They still manage to be funny here and there are moments that will definitely make you laugh, but those moments are rather rare in a film that relies more on gross-out moments instead of trying to be particularly intelligent. The people who wrote this film simply weren't trying enough because otherwise they would have done a better job.The acting is quite good, Zach Galifianakis being the one that stands out. His character (Alan) is very funny and his performance alone saves this film and makes it watchable. On the other hand, I found Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow to be really annoying (he was annoying in the first film as well) and the film would have probably been better had it not been for him.With the success of this film, the cast and crew will probably return for a third one. They probably won't make the same mistake and they will try to bring something different this time around. ""The Hangover Part II"" is a lazy film that borrows too much from its predecessor and doesn't quite manage to live up to its expectations.My rating: 5,5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Average sequel,"Concept, structure, characters, unfolding: The Hangover II recycles almost every element that composed the first opus, Todd Phillips and his two co-writers mustn't have had a lot of work. There is therefore no more surprise factor, and that is what makes, for the most part, this sequel less good.The movie manages however to stand out with its trashier aspect, and still offers good scenes and laughs (the end credits are always excellent) and that is what this dispensable follow-up will be remembered for.Let's hope the third part, which seems even less good, will put an end to this saga that shouldn't have gone past the first movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Recycled Comedy with Few Surprises,"The film still relies on hilarious and unexpected situations that will appeal to fans of the first installment. Scenes like the encounter with Buddhist monks, a chain-smoking monkey, and the nightclubs of Bangkok are among the memorable moments. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis remains strong and engaging. Together, these three actors create moments of laughter and chaos. The film makes excellent use of Bangkok's locations, capturing the vibrant and colorful atmosphere of the city. However, none of these features-which might be considered strengths in any other film-address the movie's biggest flaw.The most significant weakness of the film is that, just like in the first part, everything feels repetitive, with no real creativity. You're essentially dealing with the same recycled plot, only with the locations changed. In the second installment, the director's hand is also too visible, making it easy for the audience to unravel the plot twists and solve the mysteries from the very beginning. This lack of suspense undermines the film's engagement. Additionally, the director's heavy emphasis on sexual elements, at times, comes off as offensive and even racist.Todd Phillips, in general, isn't a great director, and the few good films he's made seem to have been mere coincidences.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The wolf pack returns for mayhem in the far east.,"The wolf pack heads to the far east Bangkok, Thailand for more mayhem in this comedy block buster sequel directed by Todd Phillips. This Bangkok party runs 2hours and stars Bradley Copper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bertha.The second bachelor party starts out on beach having a toast to stu EdHelms) for his wedding. The guys wake up the following morning in a seedy motel (let's just say it's not anything you will find on Travelocity) with everyone's favorite gangster mr. chow past out under a blanket.Stu's face tattooed, Alan's (Zach Galifianakis) shaved head and stu's future brother in law is missing somewhere in the city of Bangkok. Before chow can tell them what happened he blacks out from doing a blast of cocaine. They think he is dead so they decide to hide him in an ice machine so they don't get blamed for his murder, while they hit the streets to figure out what happen to them this time.They eventually find out that their night of drunken mayhem was caused by alan. He didn't want Teddy stu's future brother in law hanging out with the wolf pack.He drugged a bag of marshmallows they had on the beach with his adh medicine and some muscle relaxers for teddy to eat but it back fired they ended up eating all them. The guys started a riot in town, burned down some stores, and kidnapped a monk after climbing a wall of a monastery, getting shot at by some of chow's business associates along the way. While sorting out some clues they come across the strip club they were at. The found the stripper they meet, she tells them of their night and how sweet stu was when they went for private dance. Let's just say stu got more than he bargained for. When they leave the club they have a run in with one of chow's associates and phil (Bradley Copper) takes a bullet.The boys end up in a clinic to get phil patched up and it only costs 3 dollars and took a few minutes. If this happens here we would have to pay few hundred dollars spend a few hours in the Er if we are lucky. I want to know how Doug manages to stay out of all the trouble the guys seem to get into together.The one thing that stood out for me was the beautiful scenery of Thailand. However, based on what I saw of Bangkok, I don't think I'll be putting Bangkok on my list of places to visit any time soon.All in all it was good film great cast funny / safe script. I give the wolf pack trip to the Bangkok Thailand 3 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy
There is no -273 rate,"Instead of putting into jail EVERYONE involved, in any way, with the first crime, civilization had to suffer, not only one but two (for the time being) sequels.

Formulamatic Sequel,"My wife has been cackling aloud for the past two weeks since she saw The Hangover on cable. She has been jonesing to go see the sequel. That was this evening. Ugh.The plot seemed so slow. Sure, there was a good line or two, but the story was just so played out, far-fetched, and tired. Unlike the original, this seemed uninspired. There should not be a third in this series.It's been a bit since we have been to the theater. At $10.50 a pop, wait for the rental in a couple months because you just may want to turn it off.Having said all that, Stu's singing of Allentown was genius.",,Anonymous,Comedy
I have seen funny and this is not it,"Phil: ""Everybody order a round of drinks it's on me, oh wait I forgot WE ARE IN A Freakin IHOP."" This has to be the only memorable line of the movie. Besides this line the film is a waste of 1 hour and 45 minutes. This movie is a disappointment to fans of the first movie and fails to give the audience more laughs along the way. This movie reminds me of Paranormal Activity 2 because both movies had successful originals and choose to change nothing about for the sequels, but to add more money to the production. Hangover part 2 does not improve on the stand out comedy that the first one had, but it takes away the feeling of what fans were looking for. After seeing previews of this film I knew it would not be as good as number 1, but not this poorly done. 20 minutes into the movie and you start to notice that this is Hangover 1, but in a new setting with less laughs. This movie is a carbon copy of the original and the director throws some distracting elements into the film to help make its running time. Pointless characters pop ups along the way that bring nothing fresh to the story and a plot that seem to drag along during the beginning, middle and end bring this movie down. This movie seem like it was trying too hard to try to improve on the original and fails badly at it. Todd Phillips should have just left people with the first film instead of destroying the series by making this waste of a movie. The comedy is dry, the story is not fresh, and the acting of the additional cast sours this film. There are a few spare moment laughs that get to you now and then, but nothing memorable. It's sad to say Bridesmaids delivered more comedy than this and that should tell the director a lot. If they really believe that these movies should be made into a trilogy than they must not know that making three movies with the same plot is not a trilogy. It's called wasting money on pointless sequels when the first is just fine. So far the summer has only had two great hits out the may slot and this is not one of them.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Awful ending,"This movie was ruined for me by the inclusion of a notorious convicted rapist as the ""celebrity"" at the end. As far as I am concerned it is an insult to women everywhere. If it hadn't been for that appalling ending the movie would have been OK. It wasn't as good as Hangover I but it was fairly amusing (except with a lot less heart). What kind of director thinks that it would be funny to include such a disgusting creature as the highlight at the end of his film? I won't be watching anything directed by Todd Phillips again. I can't believe that women rated this higher than men. What is wrong with people? It was a very sour note at the end of what was supposed to be a comedy. They should be ashamed of themselves.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Feels like a missed opportunity, kinda blah...","This is not a bad film or experience but simply a watered down version of the first effort. I guess there really was no other option for the producers. They figured if it's not broke, don't fix it. Too bad they didn't even tinker with it just a bit. This sequel is exactly like a pale karaoke version of the original. I found nothing to be tremendously funny but a few scenes were amusing. Like the first, maybe the best laughs are to be had during the closing credits and photos of the missing day.Sequels to a movie most enjoy more often than not, feel like missed opportunities. This effort is no exception. The tone, pace, and balance were off, unlike in the first film. The result is far less fun than it should be given we already know and like the characters. Among guy comedy flicks, this one ranks very average, not unmentionably terrible but not particularly memorable either. Kind of disappointing to say the least.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The paradox of a sequel,"Following up on a outrageous success is a daunting task for any director and its a dilemma quite simply called ""sequel"". Most of the watchers in this case belong to the category of ""C'mon, its the hangover...its funny, what more do you expect?"" Many who would care to critique would say its not as good as the first, and a few would love it even more and watch it again. Its a fork on the road for most directors when it comes to sequels unless you are the maker of Godfather 2 and there is a reason for that. A sequel could be continuation of a web already weaved by the story or it could be using the same framework to tell a new story. The later is more difficult if you care about success and applause.Hangover 2 belongs to the second category of sequels and Todd Philips has done a good job of staying true to the spirit and theme. He could easily have used his imagination to build new characters or offer new situations which you bet would have been like buying a lottery ticket. The movie is smart and sticks to a model of success created by the first hangover. For most people who complain its the same as first, they would have thrown more stones had it been a new story and a wash. At the end of the day what makes hangover worth watching is the characters we loved in one.The characters use the ramp up from one and they are likable as well as funny. Zack as Alan proves its not a one hit wonder while Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are spot on! Mr Chow could have used some sharper editing but overall the movie sticks to a tight story without aberration. Mike Tyson could have taken a pass along with some other scenes which make you wonder the sky has been reached if that is the limit. The song by Ed Helms in the boat....yes an original again is a nice touch which reminds of hangover one and how funny these characters are.Thailand is not as good as Vegas and as with any sequel, it is a paradox of choice which is worthy of a watch!",,Anonymous,Comedy
What,What just happened it suppose to end there and this sequel wasn't good at all,,Anonymous,Comedy
"A review of The Hangover Part 1...oh, wait, it's Part 2 actually","If you haven't seen the Hangover (Part 1) then Part 2 follows the same characters as they, again, wake up after a heavy night with no memory of what happened and plenty of new problems to deal with as a result of it. If you HAVE seen the Hangover (Part 1) then you've basically seen the second one too.A lot of review of Part 2 use phrases like, 'The Hangover Part 2 uses the same jokes, just cranked up to 11.' I sort of agree. Part 2 isn't a bad film; it's quite funny actually, its main problem is just that it doesn't offer anything new.The writers (if you can call them that) have basically taken the script to Part 1, photocopied it, changed the locations and (very) slightly adjusted the jokes and sold it to the studios as a sequel. If fact, it's probably not best described as a 'sequel,' a 'remake' might be a better label. I wonder if the writers did it on purpose, i.e. keep the situations identical in a hope that lightning would strike twice. For me, as every new crazy moment passed, I just couldn't believe how similar it was. It became almost weird just how copied it was. In the end it kind of detracted from the story as all I had to do was think back to what happened next in Part 1 to know what was coming in Part 2.That said, Part 2 is okay if you liked the first and basically want more of the same silliness. It's just a shame the makers didn't wait a little longer and come up with something just a little bit fresher.The monkey is cool though. Just don't let him near your water bottle.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Exactly what I wanted from it.,"First off, I totally see where some of the negative criticism of this movie has come from. I mean, the plot definitely is predictable and borrows a lot from the first movie. In many ways this film seems like a huge add-on from the first Hangover.That being said, I can't begin to explain how much I enjoyed this movie! I went to see The Hangover: Part II for one reason and one reason only: to laugh. And I laughed my guts out the entire time. The story was still interesting enough for me keep my attention even though I probably could have predicted it had I wanted to, but the movie was so hilarious. Definitely crazier and more shocking than the first! If you are a fan of the first Hangover movie then it would be impossible for you not to at least find this movie very, very, very funny. I couldn't be happier with it and can't wait for the next one.Critics and moviegoers who went to see The Hangover: Part II expecting a gripping storyline or deep plot have looked at this movie completely wrong. As said before, watch it expecting to laugh and you will. A lot. I promise. 10 out of 10 stars for a comedy!",,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover Part Meh,"This movie was a pale rehash of the exact same story from the first movie. Yes, it takes place in Thailand. Yes, there are new shenanigans. No, it's not original or clever or humorous. One bright note I did get to see this movie free of charge, but there was a high price for seeing this film, it was 102 min I will never get back again. I think I got gipped. I am at a loss for words on how bland this movie was. The only character I thought was entertaining was the monkey (Crystal). I think it was Penn Jillette who said it best ""there is nothing funnier than a smoking monkey."" Unfortunately, this comedy gold is wasted on an extravagant waste of time. Don't get me wrong: I truly enjoyed watching the characters get the tar beat out of them but I don't think it was for the reasons that the filmmakers intended. If you liked the original, just re-watch it. Do not waste your time on this half-assed retread. I am obviously going to give this movie a red light, for failing to do anything more with the characters or the storyline.",,Anonymous,Comedy
