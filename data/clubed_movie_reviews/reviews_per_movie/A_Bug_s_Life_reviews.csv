Wow.,"There is great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. Check this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Bug's Life is A Little Insight Into How People At Pixar Work, Imagine, Create & Entertain Us.","After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.The story of A Bug's Life follows a misfit ant who thinks differently yet only ends up causing more trouble for his colony so when his latest escapade wastes away all the food ants had gathered to offer to the greedy grasshoppers, he decides to make up for it by finding & recruiting tough warrior bugs to save the entire colony from its oppressors.Directed by John Lasseter, A Bug's Life marks Pixar's second consecutive home-run & just like their previous feature, brims with so much creativity & passion that the narrative it puts on the silver screen remains finely balanced in storytelling department and is then taken to the next level by further refinement & advancement in their state-of-the-art animation.There are wide range of bugs to be found in this fable and the animators have done a fab job in envisioning, designing & rendering all of them. While none of its characters manage to be memorable, it's the sum of the parts that makes it click. The themes it deals with are nicely addressed, humour is effectively used, score is lightweight but fitting & it never loses its sense of fun.On an overall scale, A Bug's Life is definitely one of Pixar's most underrated films that may not have anything as memorable as the studio's best works but it nonetheless scores high marks in all filmmaking aspects to make up for an enjoyable & entertaining ride that viewers of all ages can benefit from plus delivers its message of 'strength in unity' with remarkable simplicity & effectiveness.In many ways, I find it to be a reflection of Pixar's very own modus operandi for it offers an interesting insight into the way these talented minds come together under one roof for the sole purpose of envisioning, creating & stringently refining stories that are fun & entertaining but also not devoid of heart, soul & emotions, with an added incentive to be able to do that without compromising with the art or quality of its medium.",,Anonymous,Animation
Still holds up after 2 decades,"I watched this movie in 2020 immediately after watching Pixar's detail animation masterpiece The Good Dinosaur (2015). I was expecting Pixar's 2nd film that is nearly 2 decades older to really stand out as a dated movie, but to my surprise A Bug's Life isn't a victim of the years. Of course it's behind when you really focus on the details, but the visuals are presented so well that it keeps the viewer focused on the most intricate items on the screen, allowing the brain to ignore rendering quality and be swept up by the story.The story begins fairly childish, especially by comparison to most of Disney and Pixar's other films. If you can put up with the intro, it quickly grows into a charming story with several clever ideas and jokes. And the villains are truly menacing, which had me filled with tension hoping the ants' plans work out. Unfortunately tension and humor were the only emotions this movie could bring out in me, but I have to give them credit for the rare feat of making me feel true apprehension from the kid's movie genre where heroes usually feel boringly invincible.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Bug's Life: Not Just Art, But Heart","(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was ""dazed and exhausted"" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being ""wowed"" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  ""Heck"" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not ""dumbing down"" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love this over Antz,"Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and ""A Bug's Life"", their follow up to the hugely successful ""Toy Story"" ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make ""Toy Story"" an animated classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
brilliantly imaginative,"I thought this film was really brilliant and imaginative. Most films these days seem to lack imagination and so it is really something special when a movie possesses this quality. I did think the story was a little lame, but this was more than compensated for by the creativity of the artists who made it.   I thought it was a million times better than Antz which seems pedestrian and lacking in imagination in comparison.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
ALL TIME FAVE ANIMATION MOVIE.,"It was one of the first animations I remember watching as a kid and for that reason it'll always be in my heart. Without a doubt pixars most criminally underrated movie most people tend to forget that this masterpiece even exists. A classic in every way.I thought the animation was spectacular. It follows the game changer that was Toy Story. Its a clever and entertaining story with a great cgi animation for that time. With some good messages and moments, its a must watch movie to all family!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flaming Death!A Bug's Life,"When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of ""those guy actors,"" it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn't too much bad that I can think of saying about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is good eatin'!,"""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.The story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has ""heart"" (emotion), and every character has a nice ""arc"" (a growth or change).  By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz.  There are tons of laughs and cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"".  All of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""10"" I gave it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A step down from ""Toy Story""","Not a bad movie by any means, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the degree to which Pixar's second feature falls short of the very high standard it set with its first, ""Toy Story."" Visually, ""A Bug's Life"" is almost as impressive and should be applauded for a completely different setting -- writers/directors Lasseter and Stanton certainly can't be accused of simply repeating themselves.Unfortunately, the characterizations here aren't nearly as rich and entertaining and the casting not as inspired. Phyllis Diller could almost make a good substitute for the function Don Rickles served in ""Toy Story,"" but she's not given enough to do and never really gets to cut loose. Kevin Spacey is always a good villain and adds some spice to the proceedings as Hopper, but the notion of making grasshoppers into a biker gang -- which should have worked well -- is half-heartedly executed. The rest of the cast, particularly Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aren't especially interesting or memorable. After a slow start, the film definitely picks up with the introduction of the circus, performers of which provide most of the comic relief, but the only standout is Heimlich the caterpillar who can't wait to get his wings.Overall, the story is a bit too convoluted to convey the simple, powerful messages about conformity and perseverance the film wants to deliver as cleanly as it might with a tighter story structure. This is probably a film children will still enjoy, but unlike ""Toy Story,"" there isn't as much here for people who've passed through puberty.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic animation; mediocre story,"I thought this was the most sophisticated animation I have ever seen, 2-D or 3-D.  The bird attack and the rain storm scenes were unbelievable.  The bloopers were a riot!But again Hollywood pumps out a high-gloss, low-impact movie.  For all its beauty, it was a pretty ho-hum story.  They could have really played up the Seven Samurai angle by offering a more in-depth, poignant view of the life of these oppressed ants.  Perhaps tugged on the heart-strings a little more. I found myself almost rooting for the grasshoppers against these simple, whining ants.  A little more character development could have made this the greatest animated feature of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest film in a long time,"This is a FUNNY film. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""Antz"" and ""Price of Egypt"".The characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.Call me crazy, but I have seen the film three times, and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.See it, and don't be put off because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! The bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Still a very good movie, but one of my least favorite to watch","Pixar's 2nd feature, Bug's Life, finds them expanding their animation palette, expanding the boundaries of storytelling, and getting a little muddled in the process. This IS a very good movie, one that for the most part delights and enthralls, but something is lacking here. After reflecting on it a moment, I think the main element is forcing things in an unnatural way with not completely fleshed out characters. Pixar films have a way of taking great stories, telling them very effectively, and letting them unfold at a natural pace. And that's the problem (albeit a minor one) with Bug's Life. There are the multitude of jokes, but this time some work and some don't. Some of the characters, especially the circus crew, are not fleshed out well at all. Instead, they seem as superficial as cardboard caricatures who when they react to certain situation, leave us with no insights or surprises. And Flick himself is not the most engaging lead (maybe it was the high pitch of Foley's voice?). Couple that with jokes that aren't quite as funny and you get a movie where a lot of love was poured into the animation (which is fabulous) and good intent was poured into a potentially great story but where I felt something lacking. That being said, it still is Pixar, and it still dazzles! There is one scene at the locust hangout that might be a little too brutal for small kids, but it is for the most part age appropriate for all ages. A good, but not great Pixar film. They would correct this with a succession of absolutely brilliant films which would last from their next all the way through Up! Not bad from a single studio, eh?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bug's Life is really funny!,"Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really cute film,"This is perhaps one of the weaker of Pixar's efforts but even a weak effort by Pixar is better than ninety percent of the stories out there. A Bug's Life is a great example of what to do right in creating a story. They surround the main character, Flik, (voice provided by Dave Foley) with colorful characters much like in classic comedies. What a shame that Joe Ranft, the voice of Heimlich died. Such a lovable character. Then Pixar makes sure there's a good story to go with it. This story is about a colony of ants who are tormented by some bully grasshoppers who take what the ants work so hard for. Even though the story is animated, Pixar makes the world a metaphor for the real world. Another fine effort for the Pixar gang.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic,"This was my favourite movie as a kid, or at least one of them. You can't go wrong with this film. It's different and clever, pure Pixar genius. Yeah the animation might be a bit dated but it's still brilliant. It's like old movies, the quality of the camera/film might not be so good but the film itself is brilliant. No child can't grow up without watching this at least once. Hopper used to terrify me! All in all, FANTASTIC film that's funny and enjoyable for everyone, no matter their age. Pixar, as usual are fantastic. They're one of my favourite film companies because I've seen all their animated movies, bar Cars 2, and each film is amazing and really enjoyable.

What's bugging bugs...,"You know the fable from Aesopus (or La Fontaine) with ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"", the ant works the whole summer gathering food for winter while the grasshopper idly sings and enjoys the sun and when winter comes, he realizes, a bit too late, that Karma is a bitch, and so is the ant. Loosely (very loosely) translated into Disney language, the grasshopper becomes the villain who forces the ant to offer him food for winter in exchange of ""protection"" from termites or bigger ants. But the story must sustain the movie format, let's make it a colony of ants versus a gang of greedy grasshoppers, and then work on a script à la ""Three Amigos"" and you get ""A Bug's Life"", Pixar's second film.So, if ""Toy Story"" was to 3D what ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was to traditional animation, well I guess that makes ""A Bug's Life"" a little bit like ""Pinocchio"", at least as far as chronology and technological improvement go, this comparison is valid, but while ""A Bug's Life"" didn't hold up as well as ""Toy Story"" 18 years, for the film's defense, it has nothing to do with quality. Indeed, this is a marvel of animation and entertainment and the technological accomplishment it represents says a lot about the progresses made in three years.Drawing toys is one thing and I said about ""Toy Story"" that it had the merit to put the setting in a very cozy and familiar environment instead of the usual forests and castles. In ""A Bug's Life"", we go back to the forests, but on a smaller, smaller scale and the level of detail is so phenomenal, each frame must have required a lot of hours of works and remember there are 24 frames per second, and many frames contains dozens of character, because, hey, they're insects, small creatures.""A Bug's Life"" is the result of thousands and thousands of hard working and the animators deserve all the credit for not having surrendered to the 'easy way', during the mass scenes, I closely looked at the ants in the background, you never have the feeling of a block or repetitive shots, and from what the trivia said, they used a computer program that would animate several group of ants randomly placed in each part of the screen, and it contributes to convey a realistic mass effect. And that's how we imagine ants.Of course, the film is not just about ants but is a tribute to that underworld (literally) that inspires a constant fascination and revulsion. I hate insects but for some reason, I'm fascinated by documentaries about them as if the best way to finally look at the forms, the shapes, the colors, the interactions with other insects or the outside world or fights is to make sure they're not here. Not that ""A Bug's Life"" has a documentary-like value like the great ""Microcosmos"" but even on a documentary, I would have had a hard time enjoying the sight of cockroaches or grasshoppers. In ""A Bug's Life"", insects are cool to watch, and from their standpoints, rain doesn't play a salvation role anymore and cute birds are like scary monsters, time have changed since ""Bambi"".But if ""A Bug's Life"" had everything to please the eyes, and to entertain, so why don't we celebrate it like ""Toy Story""'? I guess it was released too soon without having the privilege of a sequel younger audiences could appreciate, it's hard to carry a reputation when you're made just between ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"". And it's all justice that ""Antz"" suffers from the same fate, the two films, from rival studios were released the same year, and it's obvious there was some leak, but let's accept as a happy ending that they didn't go to court (although it did terminate some friendships) and that both did well at the box-office but I think I would paraphrase the Emperor Joseph's quote by saying ""there were too many characters"" and I'm not saying that was the problem within the story, but about its appeal.Take the ants, they are a colony where each one has a role to play, some carry the food, some guide them etc. they can't think of individuals, except for the queen, her heiress, princess Atta (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) and her sister Dot (young Hayden Pannetiere) but apart from this podium, all ants are just ants, the one who emerges from the mass is Flik, the outcast inventor who always fail (one of his last inventions will cause the destruction of the offering for the grasshoppers, forcing them to prepare food again hence depriving themselves from winter food). Flik is an individual yet the story can't allow us to root for one individual, they're insects and they all work as group, even the mercenaries he's supposed to hire, in reality circus workers covering different personalities, there is not one to stand above.The film is a triumph in characterization and high-scale animation, but take all the movies that succeeded after ""Shrek"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters & Co"", there was a core of significant characters, Shrek and Fiona, Woody and Buzz, the more you identify with one, the more positively you respond to the spectacle. In ""A Bug's Life"", we do empathize with the ants as a whole, but it's hard to feel any stronger toward them. You admire the artistic design, the set of colors, the little jokes here and there, but the only real lesson is that there is strength in unity, but this is a message you can respond to in a war or a sport movie and even then you have the main protagonist.Animation is a world of magic and dream, to be enjoyed in a more individual way, where you can hook your heart on one person. ""A Bug's Life"" should have been called ""Bugs' Lives"", it's great animation but not necessarily a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Best Animation Movie,The first Animation movie I watched when I was child. Still watching.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great on from Disney/Pixar!,"There was such a magic on the screen in 1995 when the people at Pixar came up with the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story. Their second feature film, A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than irresistible. Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998 (Antz), A Bug's Life is the sweetly told story of Flik (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (""We need bigger bugs!""). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict.As with Toy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an UN-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pill bugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.More gentle and kid-friendly than Antz, A Bug Life's still has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However, the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most creative touch: ""outtakes"" over the end credits à la many live-action comedy films. These dozen or so scenes (both ""editions"" of outtakes are contained here) are brilliant and deserve a special place in film history right along with 1998's other most talked-about sequence: the opening Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan.The video also contains Pixar's delightful Oscar-winning short, Geri's Game. Box art varies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Goodish fun, though a bit one-note","A colony of ants is under the thumb of the grasshoppers, who extort food from the ants. One ant, Flik, decides to do something about this. He sets out to the city to find some warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Hew returns with an assortment of characters he believes will be enough to battle the ant's oppressors, only to find that they're a troupe of circus performers.Okayish. Starts interestingly and originally enough: the mixing of the traits of the various bugs with human qualities was initially quite funny and clever. However, this wears off pretty quickly as this becomes the writer-directors' go-to form of humour.Similarly, the plot is initially quite interesting but soon degenerates into pretty basic action-comedy stuff.It all feels so predictable and basic after a while.This said, it is reasonably fun and does have some good comedic moments. Kids will love it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
an animated delight,"This animated feature about ants, grasshoppers, and various other bugs is an inspirational testament of never giving up despite the odds stacked against you.The story begins as Flick, voiced by Dave Foley, the ant who always invents things one right after the other. After the grasshoppers come to invade the food supply, Flick comes up with the idea of getting warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Not only will this idea give Flick respect it will allow him to get redemption as he has messed his prior invention up. This epic journey starts as Flick goes in search of the warrior bugs; he finds them in Circus bugs. Consumed for Princess Atta, voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfuss, and her approval, Flick hides the fact that these ""warriors"" are in fact circus bugs.I was smiling throughout this film because it was the one of the best animated features I've seen. Furthermore ""A Bug's Life"" far eclipses ""ANTZ"" because this film has a point, storyline, and direction.The ending is no surprise as far as the typical ending goes, but this is definitely a delight worth seeing on the big screen. I recommend this movie because it allows the mind to sit down and relax and without tension watch the movie in peace.",,Anonymous,Animation
Less Than Expected from Pixar,"I'm reviewing this about 5-6 years after I actually saw it with the kiddos), so I can't comment much on the plot; though I will say that it features in the rides for very young children at Disneyland and other parks. It also seems to be a favorite among schools and after-schools (perhaps because of the vaguely educational content), and indeed the 6-star rating is based on the ""mehh"" response of my kids (7-year old boy and 9-year old girl), who have both seen it in that context and are underwhelmed with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film rides that finicky edge between appealing to kids and adults alike, a task notoriously difficult to accomplish.

Very Good Piece of Animation!,"A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable family film,"A Bug's Life is a fun family film with an interesting origin. Being Pixar's second film, there was a great amount of pressure on it. Obviously I think we can all agree that Toy Story easily surpasses this film, but for what it is, it is a strong sophomore film that was necessary to kick off Pixar's 2000s golden age.
This film is based off the famous ""Seven Samauri"" japanese film, and takes the concept of a village under attack into an interesting point of view. We get to see why the grasshoppers act the way they act, while still siding with the heros.
Of course when compared to other Pixar films, this one can feel quite mediocre, yet not every Pixar film needs to be a home run.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will Always Hold Up As An Animation Classic,"Overall, A Bug's Life is an animation classic without question. Along with Toy Story, it was one of Pixar's earliest films, and still till this day it is a fantastic watch with brilliant humour and loveable characters. It was one of the first animations I remember watching as a kid and for that reason it'll always be in my heart. A classic in every way, nothing to dislike or hate on, a brilliant film. Go on, treat yourself againQuote - ""First rule of leadership: Everything is your fault"" - HopperRating - 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Interesting movie but not was good as Antz,"Nice movie. Great animation. Well up to Disney quality. It reminded me of Toy Story - superb effects but lacking a little in the storyline department. This movie suffered badly in relation to Antz which is a better movie with a stronger storyline. The movies are very similar but Woody Allen and Sharon Stone are much better than their counterparts in Bug's Life. Of course, this doesn't matter if you're 10 years old - my kids loved Bug's Life. Probably more so than Antz. So my advice to anyone under 14 is go see Bug's Life; the rest of us should watch Antz. Two good movies - but only one is a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not perfect, but quite enjoyable","Although consistently entertaining, A Bug's Life fails to deliver on all accounts, by feeling more formulaic overall than its own interesting concepts sprinkled throughout. The film can be very humorous at times, but can also vary on the border of being overly-goofy and in result, some jokes do fall quite flat. The animation, although not as great as its work shortly before, is quite good and full of vibrant color, which makes it very easy on the eyes. The music in the film is really good, with Randy Newman providing a stellar soundtrack, as he always does. The voice work is fairly impressive, with the circus bugs taking the lead in terms of voice work and in character development. The circus bugs are often the best part of the film, and their humor seems rather genuine and their story very engaging, unlike some tropes used earlier with the ants themselves. However, the ant Dot in the film can prove to be quite an adorable change of pace throughout, and stole the show in every scene she was in. In the end, A Bug's Life is far from Pixar's greatest work, but is a mildly enjoyable time. It has a wonderful cast of supporting characters, and is full of vibrant colors, and a score that is very easy to listen to.

One of Pixar's Most Underrated Outings,"A lone ant tries to prove he is worth something to his colony that is oppressed by a gang of grasshoppers.I loved this movie as a kid, though I find it is far more complex and nuanced as an adult. The animation has finally aged, but the movie is still and enjoyable watch. I think my only issues is that it tries to jam in too many major themes and plot points into a short period. Flick trying to prove his worth. The colony needing to accept new ideas. Overcoming oppression. And the whole need for the circus bugs to be seen as warrior bugs. There is a lot going on here.Kids will still enjoy this movie, although there are a few scarier scenes for them. Adults will probably like this film more, but may find it is too packed to be able to fully embrace. Nevertheless, this is perhaps one of Pixar's most underrated outings.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Most Endearing Bug Stories,"The strongest point of every Pixar movie I've seen is that they all have heart. While the excellent colourful animation has been consistent in quality, it's the soulful stories and memorable characters that we love and return to with each viewing. 'A Bug's Life' has always been on my to-watch list and I finally bought the DVD yesterday. It's already become a favourite after first viewing. The animation is beautifully detailed and the motion is brilliant. Not only are the characters wonderfully illustrated but also the background is given plenty of detail. Moreover these characters are so adorable as they are superbly brought to life that you'll fall in love with them. The voice cast that includes talents like Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dave Foley and Richard Kind do a great job. Clearly, Pixar does not depend on stars (unlike Dreamworks) and they rather focus on the material by creating it with heart. 'A Bug's Life' is another winner from Pixar that I'll very likely be revisiting again and again.",,Anonymous,Animation
A BUGS LIFE (DIDIER BECU),"Little by little the Pixarstudios are taking over the kingdom of cartoonworld and even if it might be a bit ""too real"" they are making fascinating movies. ""A bug's life"" tells the story of a colony of ants that are terrorized by grasshoppers who demand from them that they give them every year food so they can sit on their lazy asses. Everything goes well till some ant Flik (known for being the Baron Von Munchausen in his colony) is responsible for having the collected food dissapear, he is sent to town to find some fighting bugs who can make an end to the domination of the grasshoppers. It's lovely and somewhat entertainment for the whole family (apart from the very cruel end, so be aware kids) and another hit for Pixar, just one thought though : it was a bit too similar with Chicken Run, but a lovely 90 minutes guaranteed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
You are in for a treat.,"Is this perhaps the most underrated Pixar film to date? It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an ""adaptation"" (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of ""warrior"" bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! 
Oh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pleasant, visually stunning","_A Bug's Life_ is the cheerier, prettier and ultimately more successful of this year's two animated insect films, but it suffers a bit from a dull yet frenetic story that takes no time to let its characters breathe and a script only moderately witty.  As others have noted, the closing credits are by far the best part.  Too bad the rest of the film is not as sharp and clever. Still, the Disney animated standard of ""never less than good"" is upheld.  I sure would like to see ""great"" again, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
After twenty years A Bug's Life's charm and heart remains intact!,"While it does lack the social messages when compared to DreamWorks Animation's Antz, there's lots of things to like in this film after twenty years.The animation may have aged poorly, but it still has some nice backgrounds. The characters are still charming especially Flik and the villain Hopper voiced spectacularly by Kevin Spacey remains interesting. The music score from Randy Newman is still good, the story is entertaining and even touching and the pacing never drags.So overall, while I prefer the Toy Story trilogy, A Bug's Life still has enough charm and heart to make it stand out.

Proof that Toy Story wasn't a fluke,"It's under-appreciated, but ""A Bug's Life"" has the ingredients for a worthwhile PIXAR movie; conflict, characters, inventive world-building. If you really want to tear holes, you could argue that the story's been done elsewhere (The Seven Samurai, Three Amigos, Galaxy Quest) but there's creativity here and it still feels like something new.And then there's the cast, all well-suited to their roles (with Spacey nailing the terrifying villain; what can't that guy play?) and the side players lend plenty of color. Does Denis Leary seem like a PIXAR fit? Nope, and it turns out he's a highlight.Seems pretty hard to dislike this movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Delightful Animated Adventure,"A Bug's Life, the second feature film from Pixar Animation Studios, is a delightful and visually stunning animated adventure that captivates both children and adults alike. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, this film takes audiences on a journey into the miniature world of bugs, where a misfit ant named Flik sets out to save his colony from a gang of menacing grasshoppers.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its imaginative world-building and attention to detail. From the bustling ant colony to the vast wilderness beyond, every frame is filled with vibrant colors and intricate textures that bring the insect kingdom to life in breathtaking detail. The animation is top-notch, with fluid movements and expressive character designs that make it easy to connect with the film's diverse cast of insect characters.At its heart, A Bug's Life is a classic underdog story with themes of friendship, courage, and standing up for what's right. Flik, voiced by Dave Foley, is a lovable protagonist whose determination and ingenuity inspire both his fellow ants and the audience.But what truly sets A Bug's Life apart is its humour and charm. The film is filled with clever sight gags, witty dialogue and memorable one-liners that will have viewers of all ages laughing out loud. Whether it's a group of clumsy circus bugs attempting to put on a show or a hilarious misunderstanding between Flik and a group of intimidating warrior bugs, there's never a dull moment in this insect-sized adventure.In addition to its entertainment value, A Bug's Life also delivers a powerful message about the importance of unity and teamwork. As Flik and his friends learn to work together to overcome obstacles and defeat their enemies, they demonstrate the power of collaboration and solidarity in the face of adversity.Overall, A Bug's Life is a timeless animated gem that continues to delight audiences with its imaginative storytelling, stunning animation and heartfelt themes.

"Great  Fun, But Not Pixar's Best.","Considering how early into the CGI revolution this movie was made, it's amazing how good this movie really is.

"One of the weaker Pixar movies, but still enjoyable.","Pixar really started at the top with the spectacular mega hit Toy Story which still holds up as a great story with great characters. That isn't exactly the same with their second feature A Bug's Life.The story is not that unique to begin with. Heck, Pixar had a ton to live up to after the surprise of Toy Story, so it is forgivable. Flik is our neurotic main character who longs after being special, but is rejected by his colony which must provide food to feed the tyrannical grasshoppers, lead by Hopper, to avoid them attacking the colony.Given the fact that Dreamworks' Antz came out shortly before A Bug's Life they are quite similar. I guess you know the controversy surrounding those two movies.I think they both a good in their own ways, and what makes A Bug's Life good is the colours and the circus bugs as the comedic addition to the plot. They are the highlight of the entire movie and can make both kids and adults laugh.In my opinion Hopper as a villain is also doing a great job. When his colony of grasshoppers arrived at the ants' near the climax used to scare me as a kid. Their tall and menacing figures slowly emerging from the fog is bone-chilling.All in all, A Bug's Life is a good children's movie and adults may also find one or two things enjoyable, too.

Not Disney's Best Effort,"I have to be honest, out of all the Disney films on my shelf, this has to be the least impressive. Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad a film but it does seem like when Disney made this, they realised soon after that they were going to have to step up in their next efforts.The animation in the film is shoddy in parts, a vast difference from its predecessor, Toy Story which is almost note perfect. There are some quite clear mistakes which suggests to me that the makers were in a hurry to churn it out as a money making project.It has to be said that the cast of characters out with the ant community are superb, very funny and very clever, but they don't appear in the film until a good while in. Up until this point, the characters are dull, bland and they all look the same. There's no creativity. Yes they are all ants but some defining features would have been nice.That being said, it is still a good film to sit and watch with the family, it's harmless, there's little to no real violence and it's not easy for films to pass that off. I had a few good laughs but not quite enough in my opinion. I like the film but it's not up to Disney's usual high standards.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An engaging film for all ages,"You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.Disney continues to firmly hold the title of ""Greatest Animation in the World"", with ""A Bug?s Life"" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out-takes"" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features ""Gerry?s Game"" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? ""Antz"", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, ""Antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""TV"" star voices, where ""A Bug?s Life"" is just the opposite, loaded with ""TV"" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you.

Kurosawa would be proud?,"It's Seven Samurai... except with ants. Kinda sorta.Okay, allow me to explain. A Bug's Life, the second ever Pixar film, tells about a distant and isolated ant colony who have been harassed by a swarm of grasshoppers for time immemorial. Every summer they arrive, every summer they eat their food, every summer they promise to come back. Until one day, through an unfortunate accident, there is no food for the grasshoppers to eat, and they threaten to flatten to colony unless they can gather enough food for them. Unfortunately, there's not enough time left to do so. So an unlucky ant, named Flik, volunteers to go look for help. He finds warrior bugs. Or at least he thinks he does.That's a kid-friendly version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Or a kid-friendly version of The Magnificent Seven, if you're more familiar with the westernized version.Of course it's not quite as cut and dry as that, but you can definitely see the inspiration behind the whole thing. And it works. It's a classic story for a reason and this is a mighty fine retelling of that. The characters are likable, the action is enjoyable, the film looks colourful and there are good morals to be learned.Then again, the computer effects have not aged particularly well. The grasshoppers still look menacing and scary, but the ants look plasticky, the backgrounds belong in a low-budget video game and overall it has this feel of where the bar was lowest to it. It also suffers from the problem of having a character or two too many. Seven Samurai could get away with it. That movie is over three hours long. A Bug's Life is barely over an hour and a half.Still, I have fond memories of this film and it was still an enjoyable hour and a half even as an adult.

A real charmer.,"1998 was the battle of the bugs between Dreamworks' ""Antz"" to Disney's ""A Bug's Life"". While Antz was an animated movie of a Woody Allen (the voice of Z in Antz) film making references to psychology, Judiasm, sexes and other trademarks, A Bug's Life was just plain good old' entertainment where there were jokes for both the kids and adults to understand and not have to worry about a moral or being bored.If Antz dealt with the underground of ants and their life styles, then A Bug's Life has all the insects we keep as either pets or a collection of squished items on the floor.This film is about a little ant name Flik (voice by Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall) an inventor/screw-up where he messes up during the most important event of the season. The season of summer for ants is probably one of the most dreaded season since all the ants have to gather food for the menacing grasshoppers where the vicious leader of the gang, Hopper (voice by Kevin Spacey), thinks of the ants as inferior slaves where at any time they could have their head squish. Flik does something to lose all the food where everybody depends on him to be the hero to find somebody to step up to the grasshoppers. So the little ant goes into town to find any insects where in a sort of ""Three Amigos"" scenario he finds a group of bugs and ask to help him and the ant colony where he doesn't know that they're a bunch of circus flunkies.""A Bug's Life"" is a barrel of laughs where not only will people find this better than ""Antz"" but find something within all the characters.As for the cast line up prior to Dave Foley and Kevin Spacey, there's also Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Brad Garrett, Richard Kind, David Hyde Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, Phylis Diller, Denis Leary and more to make you want to come back for more.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another wonderful family adventure from Pixar!,"Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson's early Bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good. A Bug's Life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still ACT just like real bugs. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story (which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of A Bug's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story's, but then again, almost nothing is. The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun.The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. And incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the ""Great Leap Forward""The fun and excitement begins when Flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers. Great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan.The movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc. Comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role. This is great family fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good film for all the insect lovers,"I don't remember my first reaction to the film, much less all the hype that came out while the movie was in theaters. But I've watched this one a few times and I must say it gets better with each viewing. A good cast, good visuals, and lots of interesting characters. I haven't seen anything this detailed since Toy Story. It's also inspired by that fable featuring the grasshopper and the ant. I remember that story vaguely but could not find it again. Regardless of the source, if you're an insect lover, this is mandatory viewing. It may not be entirely accurate, but no movie is entirely accurate. Sometimes you just have to suspend some disbelief while watching movies. So get on it!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A small, small world by Pixar","Even though we sometimes forget about this movie, A Bug's Life is a big story with small characters. This cute little movie by Pixar tells the story of Flik, an ant who lives in a colony of ants called Ant Island. From our view, it's just a field of grass and a tree in the center. But to the ants, it's their home. They are constantly struggling for survival, collecting food for the winter. Sometimes a gang of bullying grasshoppers, led by this big ruthless bully named Hopper, tries to steal the food, but the ant colony outnumber them and as always, the ants usually eat the foods they have for themselves. One summer, the Ant Queen and her daughter, Ant Princess Atta are tired of being constantly bullied by the grasshoppers. They send Flik off on a grand quest to search for the greatest warriors of all of bugdom. On his grand adventure, Flik hires an out of business circus troupe: the clowns, Slim, the stick bug who has been used a prop as a clown, Heimlich, a VERY hungry caterpillar with a thick German accent, Francis, a male ladybug with a very short temper who hates being constantly mistaken for a female, the lion taming act Dim, a gentle rhino beetle and Rosie, his caring lion taming black spider, the magicians Manto the Magnificent, a praying mantis and his lovely assistant, Gypsy Moth, and the pill bug acrobats from Hungary, Tuck and Roll. They are given the job as warriors, but things don't go according to plan, but Flik must rally the circus bugs and his fellow ants, including his best friend Princess Dot, young sister of Atta, to fight the grasshoppers and have food for winter. This movie is very adorable, with heroic music, cute characters (the good and the bad), and a fun story. It even includes a bunch of funny outtakes in the end credits, one of which includes Sheriff Woody from Toy Story, Pixar's first adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't let it bug you.,"I've always liked 'A Bugs Life (1998)', seemingly more than most. At the very least, I've always disagreed with the notion that it's an obvious weak link in Pixar's early winning streak. Yes, it's probably the least successful of the studio's certified classics, but it still comfortably makes it into that category. Brought to life with mostly fantastic animation that signifies a massive technological leap from 'Toy Story (1995)', the film convincingly gives us a stylised close-up into the lives of the creatures that live beneath our very feet. It doesn't have the strong beating heart typically associated with its studio, at least in the sense that it won't get your tear ducts working (and it isn't really trying to), but it's earnest and heartfelt, with themes about workers reclaiming power over their oppressors by realising that they're the more important part of the cycle they've been forced into. It's also funny, with plenty of visual gags and effective vocal performances (from an especially eclectic cast). The core of the story is sort of a riff on 'Seven Samurai (1954)', with the protagonist seeking out warriors to protect his village from an outside threat. Hopper and his cronies (cleverly coded as a biker gang) demand that the ants collect food for them, not because they need it but because they need to keep the ants under their thumb. The villains are actually rather intimidating, especially the big bad, and there are a couple of rather suspenseful scenes when the ants are under threat which add genuine stakes to the story. The customary comeuppance received by the antagonist is especially - and surprisingly - brutal, and there are also some moments in which characters are beat up quite violently. The darker moments allow the central arc - for both the protagonist and the ants as a whole - to feel all the more satisfying. Ultimately, this is a really entertaining animated affair that looks good, sounds good (the score is great), and moves at a decent pace. It's not the best of Pixar's pictures, but it's still a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Does Ants,"A misfit ant (Dave Foley), looking for ""warriors"" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.At the time this came out, it was probably a big hit. And they certainly got a wide selection of interesting voices. But now (2015) it no longer really has that charm. The message of non-conformity is still good and not letting yourself get pushed around, but the animation is just so standard for Pixar that the wow factor no longer applies.I think I heard a rumor there is a ""Bug's Life 2"" on the horizon. If there is, I will no doubt watch it. And perhaps like ""Toy Story"", the sequel will be even better. But it might take a little work.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still watchable today,"First of all, I watched A Bug's life for the first time a few days ago. My first encounter with the material was an audiobook which featured original sound from the film. With this in mind, I was really amazed how the movie is still a cool experience today.The story is set about a colony of ants who have to collect food for the evil grasshoppers who come back each year. One clumsy ant messes it up and has to find away to protect his colony from the oppressors.The story is nice, although it follows a classic Pixar movie pattern (e.g. One clumsy guy messes everything up but raises to be the hero after overcumming many obstacles). Just don't expect something groundbreaking, as the delivery of this story is very charming and carries really valuable messages, for example that even the small ones can make a difference.On a technical level, you definetly see that this movie is from 1998. But: With this in mind, it is still really enjoyable to watch and it makes you really appreciate the effort the animators made. The lighting in many scenes looks fantastic and really sells the story. The voice cast does it's part in making every character unique and likeable for what he/she/it is.All in all, I was really satisfied by the movie. I think it is a good movie for family nights, as the kids and the adults can find enjoyment in it. The only downside is that this movie does not something that much different from todays point of view. This is ok and it depends on your preference whether you expect something like this from a movie or not. As I said, it is still really ejoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar's hidden gem,"When looking back at the Pixar movies, one almost seems to forget A Bug's Life. Perhaps it's the fact that another similar movie from DreamWorks called Antz came out that same year and the two are often mistaken for one another. Or maybe it's the fact that Pixar has made even bigger and slightly better movies since. Either way, this was the last movie from Pixar's first few I had left to watch, and once again great animated fun was delivered.I'm happy to say that the Pixar mark was very much hit with this movie and my expectations were met. So this movie tells the story of an ant called Flik, who has to recruit ""warrior"" insects to fight off the Grasshoppers that demand double the amount of food the ants can supply. The movie really starts to get funny when the circus bugs that Flik gets as warriors (or so he thinks) come into play. Their interactions, as well as their quirks make for some very good comedic scenes. As for the main plot, the empowerment of the little ants over the mighty grasshoppers is endearing enough to pull you in. Overall, this movie is a sort of a hidden gem of Pixar, as it is overshadowed by movies that even I admit to liking more. Nonetheless, A Bug's Life is on par with those entertainment wise.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Expected much more, but at least it was better than Antz","I suppose from a visual effects point of view Pixar did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life in this story. However, the actually story could have been a lot better, a bit of a let down compared to previous Disney Films. The main characters were cute, and will certainly appeal to the younger viewers. There were some good one liners, but I kept expecting something more to happen- but it never did. Probably the best thing about this film were the outtakes during the credits, some of them were really amusing. However, as a Disney film goes, this is far from one of their best efforts.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

When, the bird comes to eat the bugs, that scene was superb and good. Even, the last scene was awesome and cool. Even, Flik's inventions was good.

"Not a great Pixar movie, but a good one","A Bug's Life will forever be the black sheep along all the classic Pixar movies, which is a shame, because it's a pretty good movie, and well-above average by kids movie standards... but it's a little shy of great.It's interesting that it's the only Pixar movie made before 2007 that doesn't have a sequel or prequel, but I guess that's because it's never had quite the same level of popularity as the others.Still, it's a fun, kid friendly take on the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven premise, and there's plenty of good bug-related pins. Also notable is how the animation has improved here since Toy Story- there are aspects here that look really realistic (that dandelion looks almost photorealistic), and they do a lot more with lighting, water effects, and crowd scenes.I guess the story doesn't have quite the impact of their best films, and the protagonist is a bit boring. While the supporting characters are all fun, there's probably a few too many of them, too, and they're not as memorable as the toys from Toy Story.Still, it's a solid watch, and while not as distinctive or groundbreaking as the best Pixar had to offer, it's still a worthy film in their output, and definitely far from their worst, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An underrated masterpiece, what a beautiful movie!","Bug's Life is by far one of my favorite Pixar movies, and I really think it hasn't been given the credit it deserves; I understand that it was not well received at the box office level but at the story and storytelling level it is impeccable; the characters seem very pretty and well-founded to me. The animation is not that outstanding but it is still well done and the soundtrack is a delight to my ears. In conclusion, A Bug's Life seems to me to be one of Pixar's most beloved movies but although it is less popular than a Finding Nemo and even a Toy Story, this movie is a gem of animation and easily one of my favorite movies of all my lifetime.

A semi-wonderful life,"'A Bug's Life' lacks the mordancy that made the humour of 'Toy Story' so appealing to adults; but there's still much to enjoy in this animated film. The cutesy heroes are pretty bland, but the evil grasshoppers are wonderfully brought to life, the asynchronous movement of their multiple limbs a joy to behold.  The real thing that's lacking here, certainly compared to 'Wallace and Grommit' (but 'Toy Story' also), is a sense of pacing: as if the film-makers lack the courage to let you simply marvel at their vivid creations, the film is action-packed but fairly monotonous in mood; and again unlike 'Toy Story', the viewer's perception of the characters is not shifted during the course of the film.  These may sound like very 'adult' considerations; but the best animations can appeal to the child in us all.  'A Bug's Life' is superficial even for a children's tale; but fun nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Charming Tale of Overcoming All Odds as a Bug,"After gracing the world with their first feature Toy Story, Pixar brought audiences into a world of colorful insects with A Bug's Life. Released in the holiday season of 1998, it received a warm response from critics and made a bigger splash at the box office than its competitor Antz. While it was a welcome surprise from what was thought to be a fluke studio, it is often regarded as one of the weaker films in Pixar's long illustrious history. In looking back at the studio's second ever film 25 years later, it's time to see if it has aged well enough to stand the test of time or if it was more of a stepping ground for better films to come.The film focuses on a misfit ant named Flik, who looks for ""tough warriors"" to save his ant colony from a gang of tyrannical grasshoppers. Upon discovering an inept troupe of Circus Bugs, Flik and the group will need to do what they can to protect the home. From that premise alone, the story is fairly predictable as an underdog tale where the klutzy protagonist has to redeem himself, complete with the plot beats and cliches that come with it. However, the execution is what makes the film enjoyable to sit through as the film presents the world from the perspective of all different kinds of bugs. The working colony of the ants being overrun by the notorious grasshoppers presents a strong commentary on absolute power corruption. In addition to some surprisingly intense stakes at hand, the film also knows when to balance its more dramatic side with some much needed humor for levity. As far as these types of stories go, where the film might not do much new with it, it nonetheless knows how to take full advantage of the possibilities that lie behind the life of creatures smaller than us.In terms of the characters, they actually do most of the heavy lifting story wise than the actual narrative. While Flik is fairly generic as the screwup outcast, Princess Atta is a genuinely nervous royal heir who wants to do what's best for her colony without knowing all her responsibilities at hand. Perhaps the most entertaining cast have to be the circus bugs, as they each stick out individually from one another and even share some inner depth and top notch performances. Outside of the greedy P. T. Flea, bitter Francis, and sophisticated Slim, hearing Pixar veteran Joe Ranft as the sensitive caterpillar Heimlich remains as hilarious as it is heartwarming. As for the grasshoppers, they are genuinely threatening thanks to their menacing leader Hopper, who could send shivers down anyone's spine from how he will stop at nothing to get his way. Most of the other characters like the Queen and Atta's younger sister Dot are merely plot fodder to get things rolling. Thanks to their well thought out personalities, the characters are mostly what make the mouse work altogether.By literally taking the audience into a world outside our own, the creative team at Pixar made strong use of as many luscious landscapes and environments in just a small series of valleys. The backgrounds are so grandiose that even the most ordinary aspects of nature feel larger than life, complete with established threats like birds, rain, gusts, terrain, and insects that seem bigger than the ants. Some notable standouts include the city that the circus group originates from being composed of cans and ornaments. In addition, the film offers a wide variety of bugs in terms of design, motion and compositing, even if most of the ants look the same from one another. Considering that this was a huge technical breakthrough for the time, the large amount of crowds in so many shots is nothing short of admirable. Much of the scenery is elevated from Randy Newman's upbeat score, which pays as much attention to the subtle details in action as the filmmakers do. Rarely has any other film presented as a portrayal of insects in their own worlds as ambitiously as this one.After 25 years since its release, A Bug's Life is a charming and wholesome picture from Pixar's lineup. While the studio has made stronger films in both storytelling and technological innovation since then, the engaging storyline, strong blend of humor and pathos, quality animation and memorable characters make it worth the watch. Whether or not you prefer this or Antz, it is still worth checking out on its own as both a historical landmark for the studio's legacy and a fun filled time all on its own. It's so funny how this small seed was part of many other seeds that helped grow Pixar into becoming an industry giant.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ant-iseptic,"I've always viewed ""A Bugs Life"" as the Pixar film that got away, the one that nobody loves like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Cars"", but a slight rejig of the alphabetical order on Disney Plus pushed it up to being the next film on my list to watch. I remain underwhelmed.Flick (Dave Foley) is an ant, whose colony pays protection food to a group of violent grasshoppers at the start of the summer. When he accidentally destroys the offering, he leaves the village to look for a group of tough bugs to come and protect the colony from the grasshoppers and their monstrous leader Hopper (Kevin Spacey). Triumphantly returning with who he believes are just the creatures for the job, he's distraught when they reveal to him that they are, in fact, a circus troupe.So I really didn't enjoy ""A Bugs Life"". I don't want to take away anything from the monumental effort that goes into making any form of animated film, but the film does look pretty dated now. The tree and plant effects are pretty convincing still but the characters, particularly facially have a dull plastic-ness to them. There's a ""dead behind the eyes"" look to them that fortunately Pixar managed to overcome pretty quickly going forward from here.That's not the only problem though. The storyline is pedestrian and familiar given it's a reworking of ""Seven Samurai"" or perhaps more closely ""Three Amigos"", and the script lacking in genuine moments of humour. There's a dissonance between the world that the Ants inhabit - essentially, just an empty hole in the ground, and the trash reconfigured to reflect the human world that the rest of the insects have, with bars, restaurants and circuses.I don't want to go overboard with my criticism, there's no one area so spectacularly awful as to undermine the film, it's just that the experience of the film is consistently underwhelming.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's adaptation of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels' Communist Manifesto.,"""A Bug's Life"" is a Disney adaptation of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels' Communist Manifesto.Basically it's about how the proletarian worker ants unite to fight the oppressive bourgeois grasshoppers who control the means of production. In doing so the ants learn the valuable lesson of unionism and equality as they seek to alleviate power from the autocratic grasshoppers.Once the totalitarian regime is destroyed-no thanks to tricks or chicanery, but rather due to the imposition of democratic principles-then we learn that all the ants live happily ever after.

"Grasshoppers, attack!","""A Bug's Life"" is easily in my top 5 worst Pixar films. Besides aging badly, it was released between the first two ""Toy Story"" films. The first one was simple but excellent, and the second was even better; it was natural for the ants movie to go to the ""forgotten land"".The main responsible is Flik (voiced by Dave Foley), who is Pixar's least charismatic protagonist, and he's only superior than Arlo (""The Good Dinosaur"") because at least he has personality, unlike the apatosaurus. But relax, almost nobody in the anthill is interesting at all, the only one who's almost sympathetic is Dot, Princess Atta's little sister.On the other hand, we have the grasshoppers, led by Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey), one of the best Pixar villains: imposing, intelligent, and with logical motivations. He elevates A LOT the story of the film (which is, honestly, one of the weakest from Pixar), like May Day in ""A View to a Kill"".The circus bugs are sporadically funny, but I think everybody agrees that Pixar' forte is not comedy. And the third act, which was supposed to be strong, as the generic main message of the film is consolidated, was, at least for me, a ""turning eye"" moment.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It's not a lot, but it's our life.","The Three Amigos with insects.I want to start with the positives. I have a lot of respect for any piece of media aimed in part at children that acknowledges that some tension, creepiness and scares are not only okay, no, in fact very welcome. Regardless of your age, everyone can get something out of having their fears filtered through the safety of watching something, where you are at no actual risk. The animation has aged very well. There's a lot of emotion in the faces, especially eyes, aided by the great performances both by the actual voice actors and the celebrities who were used to live action. There are some very positive values being conveyed here. While standing up to bullies can be scary, it is ultimately worth it. Beware of conformism - question those who demand you get back in line. Do not judge on Appearances. Under capitalism, individualism is the cause of and solution to all of life's problems.Those who grow up with a variety of ethnicities are much more tolerant of them than those who do not. Bigotry is not something you're born with, it is taught. I just wish that when this film encouraged hatred of some that are deemed off putting, even scary, they had stopped at the grasshoppers, with their biker gang sounding flying underlining the type of behavior that they choose - I greatly appreciate that it is actually pointed out that they do not have to do what they're doing, it's because Hopper, their leader, likes the power. The rest follow him without question, he rules through fear. Or at least that the subversion came at the start not too little too late. But no. They felt the need to make a callous joke about homelessness, promote anti-immigrant sentiment(the twins who are never granted the dignity of being understood by anyone around them. When it could easily have pointed out that, hey - maybe *we* should try to learn *their* language), turn the obese caterpillar into a stereotype of overweight people(who according to this basically never thinks or cares about anything other than food. This is the kind of thing that has led to life-ruining eating disorders in real life), and perhaps worst of all, have a lot of transphobia.Francis is a ladybug, who's gender identity, male, is disrespected as a matter of course. Visually, he doesn't pass. People mistake him for a woman. This is shown as being triggering for him. They even felt the need to cast Dennis Leary, whose voice stands in stark contrast to his appearance. And instead of using this as a teachable moment, we get the PG version of the mainstream vile hatred toward LGBTQIA individuals that was common at the time, and went further in the first Ace Ventura, the third Naked Gun and Dude Where's My Car.I recommend this for analysis in how to better promote empathy. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is a good film in which to escape into the tiny world of insects.A Bug's Life can be enjoyed by the family, and it is certainly more enjoyable than Antz, which was released around the same time. The only problem with A Bug's Life is the pacing of the story. In some scenes, too much happens and leads to confusion. Other scenes are slow and drawn out. It's not the best animation out there, but it's still a good film and worth watching on a rainy day.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
wonderful animated feature,"Smart, imaginative animated feature about a colony of ants who live in oppression from a band of tyrannical grasshoppers. One ant in particular named Flik, viewed as an outcast for all of his clumsy and rambunctious pitfalls, is sent on a journey to the big city to recruit ""warrior bugs"" who are tough enough to make a definitive stand. Complications ensue when he inadvertently enlists a gang of burned-out circus bugs. Another one of those delightful animated features that elevates a simple premise into something truly special with first-rate vocal talent, terrific visual effects, and an innovative script overflowing with clever and creative ideas. Fun for children as well as adults. ***",,Anonymous,Animation

An Early Demo Model For DVD,"This was one of the first of the new animated films that came out when DVD was just beginning to catch on, and this really helped sell the new format by giving us a very sharp picture, bold colors and a fantastic 5.1surround sound, all a vast improvement over the VHS. In this instance, the sound was most impressive aspect.The story is pretty good with interesting characters, mainly the circus performers. As in most of these modern-day animations, there are so many astounding sights and sounds it would take many viewings to catch them all.The only negative in the movie is the typical Disney plug for the gay agenda. Here's it's the ladybug being really ""a man in touch with his feminine side."" Other than that, the film is family-friendly and far better than another animated film that came out at the same time: the profane and crude ""Antz.""This isn't a laugh-out-loud film but there are many amusing and clever lines which makes it fun for adults, not just the kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"While aimed mostly at kids, it's a pretty sweet little film","This isn't a great film, but it does stand above the crowd of the many computer generated films. The quality of the film from start to finish is excellent and as far as insect films go, it's a lot better than ANTZ because it's much more family friendly and endearing. ANTZ was often rather dark in tone and also featured some very inappropriate voices for a kids' film. Whose bright idea was it to have Woody Allen do the main voice in a film where you would be creeped out if you actually saw him in the audience?! Would you let your kids sit next to him during the show? I would hope not, unless your kids are teens and looking to replace Soon-Yi.My overall impression of A BUG'S LIFE is that it is squarely marketed to kids and the studio threw in a few bits and pieces here and there for the parents. As a result, if your kids want to watch it with you, you won't be bored. However, if you don't have kids, I really doubt if there's enough here to merit your watching it--though it still is a lovely and well-made film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A poorly written homage to Kirasawa,"I was disappointed by the writing for this film.  Sure, the graphics are great, but that alone is not sufficient to create a quality film.  I went in expecting something fresh and original like Toy Story, and all I got was a retelling of the Seven Samarai/Magnificent Seven that missed the essence of that plot line.  The point of ""Seven"" plot is the self-sacrifice of the seven.  If the the writers' focus is going to be the single hero, why bother with a plot that gives away the entire story in the first five minutes.The most telling thing about this film is that everyone who sees it agrees that the out-takes at the end are the best thing in the picture. Sad.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
More than a kid's story,"A Bug's Life is more than a kid's story much in the same way as is Antz. It's an allegory of class struggle for certain, but it is focused on the fact that the long-range agenda of global Elite depend on the faithful, mindless labor of the 99.9999999% of the world population which are not among the Elite. There is a school of thought predicated on the model of the beehive which says that all non-elitists are the drones, the worker bees and the Elite-- characterized by their voracious appetites for increasing power and wealth, are the hive keepers. A Bug's Life points out that the model only works when the drones and the ants and the lower classes work without a thought above their own existence. The story drives home the point that if education and thought are added to the colony then individualism and ensuing a revolution of government is the result. The Ants utilize technology (the bird they built), surprise and a united front to take their stand. The Divine, as demonstrated by the living bird's devouring Hopper, blesses their actions. A Bug's Life may indeed be for children; The Lost Children of Democracy; the oppressed orphans of God; the hypnotized colony child-like drones without whom the Elite could not survive. This movie is a subtle wake up call to a sleeping Baby Huey.",,Anonymous,Animation
The life of an ant is not the same as the life of Antz,"The worst problem with this movie is the comparison to the other bug movie of the year, ""Antz.""It is a softer, more attractive, and in a way, funnier movie than Antz, yet...  Something was definitely missing.  The characters lacked heart, the voices were thin, it lacked the heart that I expect from a film.Dave Foley was an appropriate enough voice, but could not compare to Woody Allen (whom I am NOT a big fan of.)   The princess's voice was still too weak and thin to be an Ant.  Someone with a more powerful voice (like Rosey) would have made (O'Donnell of course) a better voice there, just to make a more ant like voice (yes, I talk to ants all of the time :)Artistically, the film was woo hoo.  Cannot be stated any better.  Even if the ants only had four legs.  The crowd scenes were beautiful and had to be seen.Enough chatter, go see the flik, er flick...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is so underrated.,"At first, when it came out, ""A Bug's Life was my least favorite Pixar film. I disliked the story, and a few scenes were especially weird, but then I saw it again last year on DVD for the first time and I really loved it! I had no idea that Phyllis Diller did the voice of the queen ant. (P.D. makes a guest appearance on Full House in the first season.) I had never heard of Dave Foley, and I wasn't too familiar with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, since I never watch Seinfield. (too much profanity) I did recognize P.T. Flea's vi=ace, because I'm a huge fan of both Toy Story movies.***Spoilers*** Anyway, Flik, voice by Foley, is a accident-prone ant sent by his colony to hire warrior bugs, and he (thinks) finds them, but they turn out to be circus clowns. I must have missed the comedy before, but last year I listened to just the music at some parts, and it became one of my favorite movies. (Listen to just the music on the DVD)Kevin Spacey did the voice of Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang. He did a great speech at the grasshopper's hideout, and I really liked it when he did that funny scene with Molt at the anthill. A Bug's Life is given my full approval, and I recommend it for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"OK, but clearly for kids","Finally saw this movie on DVD. I enjoyed Antz more, primarily because it had more of an adult sensibility (the importance of being an individual vs. A Bug's Life's cliched ""help the colony""). Also, I thought the animation in Antz was better. It was more ""wow"" because it seemed realistic. ABL was cartoony (the ants were blue!). I figure this was due to Disney's influence.

A Bug's Life,"I suppose we could have guessed from Randy Newman's wild west type opening theme that we were in for something... just not, maybe, an insect version of the ""Magnificent Seven""! The ants slave away day in day out to pick a harvest that they leave as an offering for the marauding grasshoppers. Thing is, the enthusiastic (and annoying) ""Flik"" likes to try his hand at inventing things and after creating his own type of combine harvester finds himself left above ground and managing to tip the assembled food down a hole in the ground. Needless to say the hungry bugs aren't happy - they vow to return after the next harvest and woe betide the ants if there's not a feast awaiting them. The Queen and her daughter ""Princess Atta"" know they've no hope, so when ""Flik"" offers to ride far and wide to assemble a gang to defend them all, they cheerfully see him off as a liability they can do without. Can he get together a group of formidable defenders for his seemingly doomed colony and redeem himself? It's quite a well paced story this, with loads of different, vibrantly coloured, critters, but there's no getting away from the fact that ""Flik"" is just a pain in the neck - and after a while of the fairly constant barrage of verbiage - there is a great deal of dialogue here - I found my attention wandering a bit. The last ten minutes are quite fun, and I did quite like the denouement - but the rest of this was just a wee bit too repetitive for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ah Grasshopper,"To be honest I didn`t think I was going to like this animated movie much but I was fairly wrong in my presumption . My enjoyment is down entirely to the animation involved . You see I`m not very keen on bugs at the best of times and last night I drowned a couple of spiders I saw scuttling around my bath tub and I also squashed a woodslate beetle I found in my kitchen , but thanks to the superb animation I was convinced the characters in this movie weren`t pesky little bugs - They were as human as you and II do have a slight problem with A BUG`S LIFE and that`s down to a lack of plot in the screenplay , in fact watching this movie is like watching a James Bond film where there`s lot of set pieces ( Like hiding from a bird who realises it`s dinner time ) but little incident involving a wider picture . The main plot involves the ants trying to free themselves from the aggression of a colony of grasshoppers , but guess what ? , this doesn`t take place until about two thirds of the way into the picture , a shame since this stops A BUG`S LIFE being a very good family film but it`s still a good family movieSix out of ten",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The ""Seven Samurai"" for children","Many of the American people would say...What??? to my opening comment.

We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The great difference is the way that the story takes. Our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, HEROES.

A great cartoon Flick!,"Not liking Toy Story very much, I was pleasantly surprised by this very funny film.  Whilst being essentially a kid's cartoon, there are, as usual, some adult jokes in there as well.  All the voices are fantastic, giving life to the animated characters (and even more so in the 'bloopers'). Kevin Spacey was my favourite voice, but they were all excellent.Some real belly laughs here.  I found Antz a little un-funny in parts. The animation wasn't as good as ABL either. It wasn't a very good kid's film. Particularly, the termite battle.  Any kid under four would've screamed in the cinema.

"Cute, though predictable film","This film depicts ants locked in a mortal struggle with their oppressors, the grasshoppers.The animation was superb, and probably the strongest part of the film. How often can you say that every frame in a movie is spectacular?The acting was adequate. However, in many of the roles, it seemed as though better actors may have been available. Though I think Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are great actors, almost anyone could have been cast in their roles and done a solid job. Some performances were brilliant, such as Phyllis Diller as the queen and David Hyde Pierce as Slim, but for the most part, the acting was forgettable.As for the plot, it was mostly predictable. There were a couple of interesting twists, such as the construction of a fake bird, but the story was extremely formulaic.Still, the movie was worth seeing.

A movie with a lot to stick up to.....and a lot to it's credit!,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI'm going to have to add a hint of laziness to my review here.This is the starting point of another review when I have to say that before you even begin to watch A Bug's Life,you know it has a lot of competition to stand up to.Firstly,there's Antz,the other insect related feature that was released nationwide at cinemas not 2 months before it.Secondly,there's Disney/Pixar's other 'same-style-of-animation'movie Toy Story ,which drew in hefty review's about a couple of years back.Somehow,the Disney bug movie manages to fall short on both these other animation features.Maybe my frame of mind would be different if I was a 2 year old movie critic,but you don't get many of them.However,I do think A Bug's Life could have made it easier on itself:what's the one key thing that both Antz and Toy Story,both intended as children's films in the first place,have in common?:kid's under the above age,according to the standards set by Hollywood movie clerks,don't like a movie of their's to run much over 80 minutes,or so.With Antz running in at 79 minutes,and Toy Story coming in at 77,ABL has to run on for an astounding 93 minutes!And,yes,the story get's very,very ponderous.About 30 minutes into the movie,I gave up thinking there might be an intelligent,intricate plot line to follow ,because I'm sure this was intended as a simple,undemanding kid's film (I borrowed it off my 3 year old cousin!),until I came to the obvious realisation that people of about that age are'nt going to notice lazy plot gaps,and are most likely just going to be entertained by all the dazzling lights,and characters.This is one of the movie's good points:the characters,and,of course,their appearance on screen.The swarthy stick insect,the German slug,and the meditating green horn are fun character's.I think it's highly unlikely the producer's ripped off the Antz idea of observational ,social humour ,since both the films were produced at pretty much the same time,unless ,of course,they had an insider working for them in the conference room of the other film.But,it would'nt have worked anyway,because,frankly,a large chunk of it simply dos'nt work here.The 2 main character's,Flick and Hopper,emerge as one-dimensional,stereotype ideas from other films before it,and the only redeeming feature in this area of the film is,as ever,the hilarious outtakes.A Bug's Life holds the attention,but it could probably do so much more if you were'nt so old.****",,Anonymous,Animation
"""An epic of miniature proportions"" ... that's the problem","So far as appearances are concerned, ""A Bug's Life"" is superb.  The art direction stylises the world of rural insects subtly but surely; and, although I can't help thinking it was a mistake to include any evidence of HUMAN civilisation, that was beautifully done, too. And I applaud the courageous decision to avoid pointless sophistication when designing the insects themselves: they have exactly the robotic design one would expect of creatures with exoskeletons, they move with a minimum of squash and stretch, yet they are not at all lacking in humanity.  Any aspect of the visuals I have forgotten to mention probably deserves praise, too. (With the possible exception of the ladybug design.)That aside, this is a ninety-six minute film that wants to be three hours in length. Compression has wrenched it out of shape.  It's a mess; and the computer-generated equivalent of fine camera-work and competent performances can't save it.  With a film that tries to do so many contradictory things with its allotted time it's difficult to know where to begin.Take Flik, the social misfit who makes good. Many of the crimes for which the colony rejects him are, in fact, serious ones: he DOES lie to them, he DOES wreak real havoc, he IS dangerous. This shouldn't stop him from being a sympathetic hero, of course. But it ought to give us pause. If his failings are real, which they are, and integral to the plot, which they are, they ought to have more than a few seconds of screen time devoted to them. Ideally, they ought to be resolved.Or take the civilisation-versus-barbarians theme, which the film's climax retrospectively underlines, but which is hardly even mentioned beforehand. Or take the relationship between Flik and the princess, which is never defined, which changes from scene to scene, but which, we are led to believe, is a central part of the story. What IS the story, anyway? It's hard to see for all the sub-plots. Or for all the characters. I don't object to crowding the world with so many characters and then paying attention to each of them in turn, but it takes a lot more than 96 minutes to do this kind of thing properly.Despite trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them well, ""A Bug's Life"" has some thrilling moments.  It's because of them that I'm reluctant to dismiss the film as a turkey -- well, let's be fair, a chicken -- in peacock's feathers. It's not that the film is positively BAD: it's just that it fails (visuals aside) to be positively good, as it's so obviously trying to be.One last note: I know people liked the ""bloopers"" at the end, but having seen ""Toy Story 2"", I think they were a mistake.  The gag suited the Toy Story world better. Toys are MEANT to be part of games of make-believe: they are ""acting"" almost all the time, so treating them as actors in the end credits doesn't jar. It sure jars in ""A Bug's Life"", though.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Bug's Life)Animation quality. B. The latter is more vibrant, dynamic, and realistic. It also sketches many different places other than anthills.Story. B.

'Antz' is more dramatic at the end , and the existence of Colonel Cutter who comes to realization at the end and stands by the hero adds more excitement to the movie.Overall, both movies are creative and compelling.

"Not one of Pixar's stronger efforts, but it's still Pixar","Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first ever feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation.Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants. These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to. One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sorry, ""Antz"" is the real deal","It was a surprise when ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" (both computer-animated movies about formicids) got released a month apart in 1998. Most people called ""A Bug's Life"" the better movie, probably because they found it weird that the former had Woody Allen voicing the main character.

During ""quiet"" scenes, the background grass and twigs move almost imperceptably in the breeze, just like they would in real life.The story is simple but unique - bully grasshoppers, led by ""Hopper"" (Kevin Spacey), expect the ants to harvest food for them each year. But this year, ""Flick"" messes up, and then volunteers to go ""outside the colony"" to find ferocious insects that will agree to protect the ants. Ultimately they realize their greatest strength is in numbers.Even with the best animation ever, the simple story would not hold your interest long were it not for the witty dialog. ""See this rock, pretend it is a seed..."" or ""Don't panic, we are professionals, we'll just go around the leaf"" or ""(Flick to Hopper) Yep, that's just another fake bird."" The circus performers and their antics could be a whole movie by themselves.Among animated films this is definitely a ""10"", among all movies I've seen, I rate it a very strong ""8"" and destined to become a ""classic.""

an Animation Classic.,"In my heart a lot of us are like Flik. We might not be popular in school or at work but we have good intentions to help people improve their lives more than us being a hero. We are not too selfish and most of the time think more of others than ourselves. Being humble, share compassion, care and kindness. To appreciate one another without malice or expecting something in return. To learn and teach people to unite as one. I know many Animated films had themes like this but A Bug's Life have great real life lessons put all together in one.For a full review please check https://geekzarise.com/bugs-life-animation-classic/ Thank you. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pixar's Worst, But One of Animation's Finest in Recent Years...","""Toy Story"" was rooted in the fundamentals of childhood memories. All of us as children just KNEW our toys were alive. That they could talk. In turn, we played with them as if they were real. But soon it hit us that they were just pieces of plastic with limbs, and tossed them out. That's what ""Toy Story"" did--it reinvented not only animation, but imagination; it was not only a children's film, but an adult's film, as well. It brought back fond memories of all of our childhood fantasies.But what ""A Bug's Life"" does is simply toss together a few characters and have them bounce jokes off each other. This film, by itself, is excellent, but when compared to something smart, intelligent and witty, such as, say, Pixar's ""Toy Story,"" it looks like pure commercialism; Pixar's only downfall.A small ant named Flick (voiced by Dave Foley) is a real mess; a klutz, so to speak. He and his colony of ants, presided over by a new Queen Ant, are harvesting food for the naughty Evil Grasshoppers who come every year to gather food from the ant's hard work. But because of Flick the harvest is lost, and when the grasshoppers show up they are mad. Hopper, the lead grasshopper (Kevin Spacey) is pretty ""flicked"" off, and demands more hard work and labor. Everyone is mad at Flick...until he hires circus talents to fight off the grasshoppers, and tells the ants they are fierce warriors. Restoring their confidence to fight, the ants set up a series of attacks for when the grasshoppers arrive, until they find out the truth behind Flick's lie(s).""A Bug's Life,"" like ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" is a fairly simple idea. But, unlike the other Pixar films, it is missing a vital element: identification with the audience. In ""Toy Story"" we identified with the story; we were all kids once and had toys. The story just worked because it played with that.In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the idea of monsters was played upon. All children at one time or another were scared of monsters under the bed, and by presenting us the monster's side of the story, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" could be enjoyed by both children and adults.And then there's ""A Bug's Life."" No identification here. How many of us have been bugs before? Exactly. Maybe on a more emotional level we can identify with Flick the Ant, but on a visible basis, we simply cannot. There really is no fun in the storyline.The story/film is above-average in terms of regular animated motion pictures, but in terms of Pixar films, it is simply a film best to be forgotten in Pixar's otherwise strong resume. Let's all hope that ""Finding Nemo,"" Pixar's upcoming summer film, is better than the ads lead to believe, because if I have it correct, I predict another ""A Bug's Life"" for Pixar next year.3.5/5 stars -",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another hit from Pixar,"There are so many different stories that could be written about the world of bugs and this is an enjoyable one but I hope the creators of this film don't give up on making animated features about insects. The stories that could be used are endless! This story is about an ant colony that has to harvest food for the marauding grasshoppers that fly in every season. One of the ants is Flik (Dave Foley) who has big ideas but is accident prone and when the grasshoppers are about to fly in Flik makes a blunder that destroys the food that was picked for them. The grasshoppers are headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and he threatens the ant colony by telling them that when they return next time there had better be double the amount of food. The colony's Queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are furious with Flik but he tells them about his plan to combat the grasshoppers. His idea is to leave the colony and venture out to find warrior bugs that he will bring back to fight off Hopper and the rest. They agree so Flik walks off to another area where bugs congregate and eventually he comes across a group of insects that want to help. The insects are ex-circus performers and are unaware that Flik wants them to fight grasshoppers. They think that they are brought in to perform for the colony.This film was directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton who both created ""Toy Story"" and together they are helping to keep Disney's legend alive and prosperous. They have a good memory for the Disney classics of old and there are many observances (Both clear and obscure) of those films. The computer animation at Pixar seems to be getting better and better and a clear sense of this is the incredibly detailed scenes during the rainstorm. These scenes are a marvel to look at and its hard to figure how they could make these images so rich with intimate details. The story is rather amusing and I was reminded of ""The Three Amigos"" and ""High Plains Drifter"" as I watched this. This film came out the same year as ""Antz"" and I guess the comparisons are inevitable but I think that film has a more adult tone to its story. This film is more in line with its targeted audience of much younger viewers but I did enjoy both films for different reasons. Roddy McDowall is the voice of Mr. Soil and this turned out to be the last film that he ever worked on. This is another very entertaining animated film from the great Pixar Studios and probably the main reason for their success is that even though these stories are aimed at a young crowd both adults and children can enjoy them. They're is enough entertainment for any age group.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Winner Is...,"In this edition of same movie same year we have ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life."" The edge goes to ""A Bug's Life"" by a long shot. This movie was funnier, a better story, less grim, and more kid friendly. Both movies focused on a singular ant who wasn't the best ant, but had bigger hopes for himself and the colony. They both had eyes on the princess ant. One of the biggest differences is the voice. ""Antz"" main character was voiced by Woody Allen (huge mistake) and ""A Bug's Life"" used Dave Foley as the voice of Flik.In ""A Bug's Life"" the ants were pretty much the slaves of the grasshoppers. Every season they had to collect an offering for the grasshoppers to keep them pacified. This season Flik upended the offering plate and the food was all lost. Instead of collecting a new pile of food, the ants decided to fight back. For their fight they recruited a ladybug, a black widow, a dung beetle, a walking stick, two rollie polies, a praying mantis, a butterfly, and a caterpillar.

A Great Visual Film Which Works Because of a Smart Screenplay,"""A Bug's Life"" was the second computer-animated film about insects in 1998. The first was the disappointing ""Antz"" which opened in the late-summer and then this film which opened near the end of the year during the Thanksgiving weekend.  Both films have great visual effects, but this film is so much purer and smarter than its predecessor.  A young ant named Flick must try to find warrior insects to battle an evil band of grasshoppers.  He finds some bugs who he thinks are warriors, but are actually circus insects.  To say the least there is confusion and what develops is a great film that is fun for the kiddies, but also entertaining enough for the most hardened adults.

The Little Things - A Bug's Life Warrants Appreciation,"While A Bug's Life is not the greatest Pixar movie, it's ahead of its time animation certainly warrants appreciation. Outside of the technical aspects, A Bug's Life also set the precedent for Pixar movies to discuss more complex themes that exist in our society, something that Toy Story is not so focused on. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Joe Ranft's story about an ant going from zero to hero is really a facade for a deeper story or handbook about the virtues needed to empower the people and masses and bring about the changes necessary to solve problems of inequality.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Animation is Occasionally Superb but the Story is Stupid,"This is another in a long line of Hollywood efforts where the gimmick is everything and the substance is sadly lacking. A schmaltzy cartoon, it is too frequently annoying and occasionally aggravating, yet there are moments where it rises to near-perfection. We can do without the ants, for there is nothing special about them, reflecting Hollywood's view of people as mindless, fear-driven conformists. The lead character is supposed to be imaginative and different, but he's written as a screw-up whose silly, mind-numbing antics are just plain foolish. Only a kid wouldn't be bored by him, while in contrast, it takes an intelligent, focused adult to truly appreciate the subtlety of the grasshoppers. The animation, personalities, and dialog are so effective and convincing that it is nothing less than phenomenal. Too bad so much of the script is contrived, predictable, and unoriginal, taking the wonderful parts down with it into a chasm of mediocrity. Those responsible for spoiling what otherwise might have been a first-rate animated classic ought to be horsewhipped.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Graphic excellence mounted on wafer thin plot.,"The best children's stories in the literature have souls.  By this, we mean they have significance and nourish the growing mind with inspiration, motivation, or teach something.  The stories need not be seminal but should at least bring some value to the reader or audience. This is the case, for example, in Pinocchio, where a puppet loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy and by its goodness became one. In A Bug's Life, we find nothing even approximating a meaningful story.  It is tragic because the producing studio, Pixar, has developed the finest graphic animation in the world today in character renderings.That the studio limits itself to children's audiences is their choice and certainly, although more limited than a crossover or a family market the child market still yields enough box office to keep the doors open. Why they have chosen to produce superficial stories, however, so flat and wafer thin they will not have legs for the future, is a mystery.We hope that at some point this remarkably talented group of animators will somehow mature into a shop with a strong story group that can manage to locate a good source of literature to mount with their beautiful artistry.  Indeed, no American animation producer has had strong story resources or even analytical recognition since the death of Walt Disney in 1966.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

A bunch of circus bugs is needed to make the ants realize this. No one really gets scared by the movie, the well animated bugs look all cute, including the ""bad guys"".

One of the Best Animated Films I Have Seen This Decade,"""A Bug's Life"" was much better than I expected.  This film made by Disney and Pixar pictures has elements that are good for the whole family.  I think this film is the best animated film since Pixar's last film, Toy Story. Mainly because both films have a lot in common.  Both films look into groups that we usually don't think (or want to think) about and how they have to overcome the odds against their enemies.  Both films have great animation, comedy and entertainment.  This film is not as good as Toy Story just because Toy Story was the first of the computer age animation.  Yet, this film is still extraordinary and is one of the best films of 1998 (by the way, watch the credits for the first bloopers with bugs).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Chaotic Start That Finds Its Footing Late,"Pixar's A Bug's Life is a visually impressive film that showcases the studio's early mastery of computer animation. However, as charming as its visuals are, the movie struggles to balance its story, especially in the first half.The beginning of the film feels chaotic, with an overload of scenes and unnecessary acts that leave little room to connect with the story or its characters. The conflict, while clear in its basic structure, lacks depth and fails to provide enough motivation to make it truly compelling. Throughout the first half, I found myself asking ""why?""-questions that, unfortunately, remain unanswered by the end of the movie.Fortunately, the second half redeems the experience. It becomes more stable and enjoyable, offering meaningful moments and well-crafted sequences that resonate better with the audience. By this point, the humor and emotional beats are more balanced, showcasing the creativity that Pixar is known for. Still, this improvement comes a bit too late to elevate the movie significantly.One standout highlight is the inclusion of bloopers during the credits. This clever and hilarious idea is a testament to Pixar's playful spirit and creativity, leaving a lasting positive impression. It's such a fun and unique touch that it bumped my rating from a 5 to a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Follow-up To Toy Story. A Lovely Charming Little Adventure.,"Way back in 1998 we got a lovely new computer animated movie called, A BUG'S LIFE & it was such a fun movie & nice follow-up to the groundbreaking instant CLASSIC known as TOY STORY (1995).John Lasseter & co of Disney-Pixar studios worked hard to create another loveable computer animated comedy adventure for the whole family to enjoy & i think they absolutely pulled it off.Back in the 90's full on Computer animated movies were still in their infancy, unlike today in 2024 where evey animated movie is made of CGI. Back in 1998 A Bug's Life was another great adventure with little creatures again, this time bugs instead of Toys, & on an adventure full of crazy characters & a stacked cast doing great voice work. Also the animation is beautifully colourful & the storyline is simple, so sit back & enjoy this little feel-good, friendly adventure.I always preferred A Bugs Life over ANTZ, both of which came out the same summer of 1998. I did like Antz but i liked A Bug's Life more, i saw both at the Cinema.A Bug's Life is about a little blue ant named Flik, who gets into deep trouble with his silly inventions, but his heart is in the right place, he just messes up often. One time his ant colony are gathering food for their bullying, nasty superiors: The Grasshoppers, an evil bunch that use ants as slaves for their greed. Their leader is Hopper voiced brilliantly by a sarcastic & nasty Kevin Spacey. Flik causes his colony to lose all the food they've gathered for ages & that puts him & his fellow ants in a dangerous situation with the Grasshoppers, Flik sets out on a mission to make it right.Little ant Flik stands up to the Grasshoppers gang but then has to back up his idea of fighting back, so goes on a quest to gather a bunch of ""warrior Bug's"" but he hires a bunch of flea circus show Bug's that pretend to be tough warrior Bug's & all sorts goes wrong. This is a funny little movie with lots of lively, fun & colourful characters & a moral heart about the oppressed rising up to make a stand.A Bug's Life features a star-studded voice cast with the likes of David Hyde Pierce, Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, John Ratzenberger, Brad Garrett, Julia-Louis Dreyfuss & Roddy Mcdowell, just to name a few.You will recognise a few voices from Toy Story.A Bug's Life is definitely still one of the best from Disney-pixar animated studios & as it is, it stands as a one-off single movie, it never got a sequel or a franchise, but that just makes it all the more special in my opinion. A Feel-Good fun flick.I loved the toys they did for A Bug's Life in McDonald's, great memories & lots of Nostalgia for this wonderful, good-hearted adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A great beginning to Pixar's lineup, and a great start to the careers of Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere.","A Bug's Life is an underrated Pixar classic that easily gets forgotten among the likes of Toy Story, Monsters Incorporated, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, all of which had sequels or prequels in the 2010s. It is still very good as far as standalone films with no sequel go, like Megamind or Turbo. I always admired A Bug's Life because it had a great universal message - if you stop doubting yourself, you can discover your true potential and do what no one else thought was possible for you. It works on so many levels because it is a lesson most characters of A Bug's Life have to learn - Flik, Dot, Atta, the circus troupe, and even Molt. All the casting choices are great. I liked having Dave Foley as Flik, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Atta, and Richard Kind as Molt, and I am glad they did not have more expensive or famous names whom voice acting was not for, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Aniston and Jack Black. The best part is, Dave Foley auditioned for Slim, one of the supporting roles, but in the final cut, he got promoted to the lead role, Flik! A Bug's Life was the time of my life because it came out the year I was born, and it was also a big time for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere since it was their first film role. A Bug's Life had a lot of talented TV comedy stars in it, with the only big movie names being Kevin Spacey (Hopper) and Denis Leary (Francis).Animated films are hardly any child's star-making role because you can not see them on screen, but Hayden Panettiere did such a great voice performance as Dot, it is a safe bet that this Pixar film was a good stepping stone to whatever her star-making role after A Bug's Life was. Ashley Tisdale also auditioned for Dot, but since she was 4 years older, she got another part as Lead Blueberry Scout, which was a much littler part than Dot, but still a good role to have, so this may have helped her too. I am happy for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere to have a decent acting career after A Bug's Life because they never got too famous for animation like Jodie Foster did (after The Addams Family and The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan), and they had a lot of variety in their acting because of this. If you were a kid from Ashley Tisdale, Hayden Panettiere & Jansen Panettiere's generation, chances are you remember A Bug's Life and you are 4 years older than me. I was born 21 days before Jansen's 4th birthday.Dot was always my first most favorite A Bug's Life character because she always respected and believed in Flik when no one else did, and Dot was also an interesting child protagonist with an arc of her own. I believe Dot should qualify as a primary character of A Bug's Life as much as Atta or Flik are, especially since she got to narrate the Disney Storyteller audiobook adaptation, and she made an excellent narrator there. All of the circus bugs have interesting or endearing personalities, and my third most favorite character is Slim. David Hyde Pierce really stole the show with his deadpan delivery. However, my second most favorite character is another scene-stealer that I really want to talk about: Molt! To emphasize the Kind in Richard Kind, Molt is the only kind grasshopper of A Bug's Life, and I love how he was written as a character. He was made to be a comic relief for the uncomfortable scenes with Hopper, and he is Hopper's brother because we know Hopper would never keep around someone so witless and annoying otherwise. Molt worked as a character in the story beyond that because while he is not the sharpest tool in the shed, he never annoyed us the audience (only Hopper and other evil grasshoppers), he was not too stupid to live, he does not usually ruin things for the other bad guys, and I genuinely felt scared for Molt whenever Hopper approached him menacingly because I know Molt was always on the wrong side of this ant v. grasshopper conflict, so I am glad A Bug's Life's writers really thought his role through. :)If you like hearing Ashley Tisdale or Hayden Panettiere as children on their rise to stardom in the late 1990s, if you like inspirational messages about discovering your potential, if you like movies about bugs, or if you like revisiting early computer animation, A Bug's Life is the film for you! I highly recommend A Bug's Life over An All Dogs Christmas Carol, The Object of My Affection, Monsters University (just kidding), Antz, or Madame Blueberry. I never hated Antz, but compared to A Bug's Life, I found Antz to be darker at worst and forgettable at best. Though I am also impressed that A Bug's Life got a G rating in the late 1990s, since there was a drawing of Heimlich getting gored and two scenes of bugs getting ""drunk"" on blood or grain, and several other alcoholic references. At least A Bug's Life did not have any curse words like Antz, which was rated PG and it was much scarier.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable,"I am not a big fan of computer animation.  Mind you movies like Jurassic Park really need computer animation.

If possible the only underrated Pixar film,"If I had my way there would have been a A Bug's Life series as a opposed to a Toy Story one because this is the more striking and complex work. Inspired in equal parts by Aesop's Fable and The Seven Samurai this tale of ant colony trying to free themselves from oppressive grasshoppers can hold a lot more meanings in it than the first Toy Story. I *honestly* think it is the best dramatization of Marxism 101 I have seen in American cinema-a deep irony given that Disney, Pixar have always been run by the ultimate capitalists. While a class reading is most obvious basically any social oppression can be read in the film. It handles these issue almost entirely subtextually and the *plot* reveals the *theme* without being preachy. Re-watching this today again reminds me how much the story stayed with me because of its themes of fairness and equity.Now this isn't to say the film is a mainly a political polemic. It is not. The surface entertainment is just great. The blend of insect inspired sight gags and the goofiness of the circus performers add up to a very funny film. The voice case embody the characters entirely. The little stories-Flick's romance, or the Queen's retirement or the circus performers various foibles-are blended into the main plot just so; the film is a charmer the entire time.The animation is just gorgeous; unlike Toy Story *all* of it still holds up.

The best Pixar had to offer.,"This is hands down my favorite movie of the studio. I loved it then, and after rewatching it after all these years. I still love it now. The magic of Disney movies then was intact, and you could get into the stories without unnecessary politics interfering with the script. There were subliminal messages still, but they did it with subtleties and wit. The « actors » portrayed the cartoon characters with ease, and gave them life through their voice. A Bug's Life is a run of a mill story, but that's what makes it so good and relatable to some extent. Randy Newman's end credits song give it this pleasant late 90s comedy feel, and the blooper reel added more quirky ness, to an already colorful movie, back when sarcasm wasn't the norm. It's a genuinely entertaining « cartoon », and one that still holds up today, with its gorgeous graphics (once again, back when they didn't overdo things) and timeless themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The alternative to Antz,"What we have here was a nice little film that took more of the reality and harshness of the Antz film and mix it with more vibrant color, humor children can understand, and a tale about bullies ala Seven Samurai. The last thing I said was in ode to the fact that an ant hires a small band of outsiders to help with a raiding band of tough insects hellbent upon ruling over the poor poor ants ( even though there's millions of them). But this is all lost on children. all that would get through is the bullying and the colorfullness. Thats it. 5.5/10 is generous at best. Im not saying it was abad movie...but I liked Antz better lol. CIAO!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the greatest movies ever...,"I must honestly say for even being in my mid-teens that this is one of the only child/family movies I always like to watch. It can make me laugh each time I see it. Not to mention I discover something new each time you watch it. I have a stereo that has many features and with the help of closed-captions, I can hear and understand everything they say that I couldn't understand before. To me for a long time from now I will always go back to this movie to relive what it was like to see it for the first time.

Another Fresh Take on Familiar Territory From Pixar,"A fairly run-of-the-mill story, peppered with enough unusual perspective and little bits of pure Pixar genius to somehow become something much more. Although the quality of animation hasn't aged particularly well, an ambitious scale and knack for breathtaking compositions provide ample compensation. Great voice acting from an all-star cast, a few good jokes for every age range, villains that manage to be threatening but not terrifying and a plot that's simple enough to draw anybody in, but deep enough to snag them for the duration. It doesn't hold up against ""Monsters, Inc."" or ""The Incredibles,"" but it certainly makes for good company.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
No pest worth seeing more !!!,A must see by all - if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one.  Easily one of the best animation/cartoons released in a long-time.

Computer animation at its best,"I loved this movie.  Aside from the charming plot and characters, the computer animation deserves a whole other set of accolades.  I loved Toy Story and this movie has taken the incredible animation from that one and made it smoother, more seamless, and more beautiful.  It just amazes me how amazing the look of this movie was.  It was truly a technological feat.  I think that Disney has a real hit with this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney by numbers,"This was a massive disappointment. I saw ""Toy Story"" long after it came out, when the whole computer animation hype was long since old hat, but still loved it at once. I really enjoyed ""The Incredibles"" and thought ""Ratatouille"", ""WALL-E"", ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"" took animated film to a whole new level. But it turns out ""A Bug's Life"" is... a whole heap of steaming clichs.Almost from the very beginning it felt as if they were sticking in just about every Hollywood/Disney trope aimed at the under-tens, many of them painfully inappropriate to the setting. Sorry, but ants don't have cute little child ants who set up a 'clubhouse' and save the world when the adults are busy giving up; ants have squishy larvae. Grasshoppers don't have mothers or little brothers. Worker ants don't have romantic moments with 'princesses', because worker ants are FEMALE. (And seriously, if you were going to design an ant-powered flying machine, why would you power it with child ants, instead of the strongest team in the colony? On the other hand, if it was originally designed for adult ants, how would the little ones even be able to get the wings to move?)And then of course we've got the whole 'misunderstood loner whose brilliant ideas always go embarrassingly wrong' scenario, which I also found so clichd and obvious as to be almost painful. And 'the power of family/friendship can overcome everything' and 'you just need to believe in yourself'... it's practically a checkbox list of standard tropes, and while the same messages appear in many, many good films (there's a reason why they're standard), here I rapidly ended up with the feeling that it was Disney product being done by numbers. Watching ""A Bug's Life"" versus ""Toy Story"" is like watching ""Flushed Away"" versus ""Chicken Run""; the magic isn't there and it's gone corporate.It was also very noticeable that for all the gnashing mouthparts and serrated limbs, the worst anyone gets threatened with in the script is getting 'stomped' or 'squished', which doesn't really match up to the visuals and again is rather obviously by-the-book for small children. The hero's Grand Plan is discarded (for no very clear reason -- why would the discovery of his deception about the circus prevent the planned 'scare-crow' tactic from working?) and then heroically launched again at the last minute and then after a prolonged show fails anyway. In another context that might have come across as stunning originality, but by that point it just struck me as being an excuse for this film to have its cake and eat it; for him to be a Great Inventor, but also demonstrate that true strength comes from love and the power of unity and standing up to your fears, blah blah blah.As a result the finale is incredibly prolonged -- like much of the rest of the film. The 'botched circus' scene at the beginning in particular felt as if it lasted far too long, partly I think because it was presumably supposed to be funny, and that's not my type of humour at all. (But then, thinking about it, that goes for quite a lot of the would-be-funny parts of this film.)I'm afraid I found ""A Bug's Life"" actively annoying from quite early on, and I'm not quite sure in all justice why. It felt cynically manipulative and shallow, as if you could see all the cogs turning and buttons being pushed, and being stuffed with bad biology didn't help. (Heinrich the fat caterpillar pupates and turns into... a fat caterpillar with wings?) I felt zero chemistry where the characters were concerned. Yes, it's a U-rated children's film that was never aimed at the likes of me in the first place, but a good children's film ought to work for adults too.After all, I've seen plenty of pictures that commit the 'sins' mentioned above, and loved them. ""Chicken Run"", for instance, features hens with teeth acting in a highly anthropomorphic way, and it even has an artificial flapping bird... but that production struck me as simply brilliant. And compared to a lot of children's films, ""A Bug's Life"" does more or less show its villain being killed and eaten, whereas a lot of classic Hollywood movies go to lengths to indicate that if the villain dies, that's absolutely not the hero's responsibility in any way.I think perhaps what irked me about it was that there didn't seem to be any greater depth -- any references that adults could be expected to get over and above the target audience. The humour remains on the level of ""Francis is a male 'lady'bird... haw, haw haw"", the romance is school-gate stuff, and the attempts at emotional manipulation aren't exactly sophisticated. It was like being subjected to a lecturer who persists in talking to a mixed audience as if they were all six-year-olds.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Second of Pixar's Efforts.,"A Bug's Life, I think was the second feature film that Pixar made. It is good, but I feel it's probably one of their lesser efforts. The story is about a group of ants, who every year have to serve their grasshopper overlords a supply of food. When an inept bug named Flik (Dave Foley) inadvertently destroys the entire supply. The head grasshopper Hopper (Kevin Spacey) promises to come back and destroy them so Flik is sent to go find ""warriors"". He finds them but they turn out to be circus performers. The acting is good for the most part and the story is good. So it is a good movie I just don't feel as though it's one of Pixar's best. But all in all, everything is good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I felt the same way during the opening scene of Bug's Life when we're treated to a animated meadow, with blowing grass and waving trees, that is virtually indistinguishable from reality.On top of that, the movie has a fantastic level of action, almost frantic at times. I'm anxious to see it again to pick up points I may have missed. And make sure you stay for the credits. They may be the best part of the whole thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I think this movie could be VERY frightening to younger children, and I was surprised that Disney seems to promote this as a film for all ages - under 7 should probably not see this movie. My two children said they liked the movie, but they stopped talking about it immediately, and haven't asked once to buy the toys!

Very Good.,"A Bug's Life is said to be Pixar's weakest movie along with Cars. But well, everything Pixar does is amazing and A Bug's Life is a very good animation film.Maybe the greatness of Toy Story influenced in the hype for the movie with the consequence of being a let down for some people.I think A Bug's Life has a very powerful character development which makes the main characters so lovable.

Art meets the Cartoon Again,"A few times in the history of animated movies you could say that one was a brilliant work of art. Fantasia comes to mind as best fitting that description. With A Bug's Life, the computer animation often felt like a living painting. Sometimes it was stunning. Along with the beauty, this is a fun family film.Pixar continues to capture a child's eye with this story. Things go from magical to silly very quickly. They have an excellent comic flair. This is best shown with the grasshopper bad guys. There are touching moments but always with a light touch.A Bug's Life will always be compared to Antz because they came out the same year and seem to have similar stories. But look deeper and they are very different films. Antz is Woody Allen's show surrounded by mediocre, muddy looking animation. A Bug's Life looks better. Antz's dialogue is really at an adult level. While A Bug's life continues the long Disney family tradition but updated in the Pixar way.I especially liked the circus act, Kevin Spacey as Hopper, the living scenery and the out takes at the end which are very clever. If animation appeals to you at all, see A Bug's Life.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An animated remake of The Magnificent Seven (and by proxy Seven Samurai).,"I would have never thought anyone other than Miyazaki could (or would) make an animated remake of a Kurosawa movie aimed at children, but that's exactly what PIXAR and John Lasseter have done.Does it work?  Yes and no.Yes, because the child-friendly changes to the plot are interesting and rather Aesopian, since it is also an extended version of the ant and the grasshopper fable.  There are great references to the Magnificent Seven, and the pageant the little ants (especially the picture of one of them dying ""because our teacher said it would be more dramatic"") is hilarious.No, because the seven-plus-two warrior bugs that Flick gets are stock characters, and only the ladybug has any resemblance to any previous incarnation (he is basically the Mifune character--he is ridiculed by others not for being a peasant instead of a samurai but because he is a male ladybug, and also he is the one who befriends the children).  There is not a stoic character like Yul Brenner or Takashi Shimura to lead the pack, which I find a bit of an oversight (the praying mantis is hardly stoic in my opinion).The animation is truly astounding, with beautiful scenery and ""camera"" shots.  This is Pixar's most Miyazaki-esque film, which is why I like it so much (look for homages to Laputa and Kiki).  In spite of this, I have to rank A Bug's Life below the Toy Story movies because of the ludicrous slapstick beginning that sets the plot in motion--the same sort of annoying joke that Disney deemed necessary to push the plot forward in Mulan (Mushu shooting off a rocket for no apparent reason) and Tarzan (the elephant stampede) when they were stuck for a logical reason.  Would it have been too much to ask for Flick to actually have been a hero?  What if, as bandits often do, they go down the anthole anyway just to harass them and make them work harder for them--then just have the movie go just as it is--the grasshoppers pick on Princess Dot, Flick tells them to leave her alone, and then Hopper orders double the order for next time and everybody starts worrying about that.  Flick could be banished for that reason--sort of like what happens in Princess Mononoke when Ashitaka saves the girls but gets cursed and so has to leave and never return.One other complaint--Dot believing she can and should be able to fly before her body is ready is an outright dangerous concept for Pixar to condone, despite society's current mentality towards girl-power and the ""youth are always right"" generation.  Knowing what your limits are is as much a part of strength as anything else.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nice,"""Vida de Inseto"" is just Pixar's second animated feature and already showed the care that filmmakers have with the quality of their films! Colorful, vibrant and full of fun characters for children, ""Vida de Inseto"" also has great advice for parents! When someone tells you that ""Insect Life"" is a film that talks about ants trying to get rid of locusts, answer: YOU ARE WRONG! ""Vida De Inseto"" talks about leadership in several aspects: leadership within an organization or company, leadership within the family, and mainly, leadership within a country; and the subject is approached in different ways, exemplifying various types of leaders: the selfish leader, the experienced, the arrogant, the apprentice, the leader who is not a leader but leads, etc ... Everything is well written and developed, perfectly fit into one child's drawing. Another important message conveyed beautifully is that the united people are stronger than any oppressive leadership, it is a 1998 film that is more current than ever. Brazil needs to re-assist and reflect on ""Vida De Inseto""! From a technical point of view, the film has aged well. The change that the past 22 years have made with 3D animation technology is clear, but the animation was old and remained beautiful, not old and ugly. Vida De Inseto is a great and very funny film, with a remarkable adventure, full of tension and adrenaline, which is packed with great messages and advice for young people and adults in 2020.Film seen on the 1st to the 2nd of December 2020.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bug Life vs Antz,"Bug Life is good although its Disney hash because it follows the same formula of movies past and present. Antz was the solider film of the two.Bug's Life is about bugs going on an adventure. It has the cool bug, the dumb bug, the ugly looking villain bug because they are evil and the other cliché Disney personalities. It also ends in the cliche final battle where the main character wins...Again. YAY!!Great animation. It was the 2nd batter after the juggernaut Toy Story, so you would imagine during production that there was a lot of stress to compete with Toy Story. In the end Toy Story has 4 and an upcoming 5th while Bug's Life has been forgotten.Overall, a good movie complete with the traditional Disney formula.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A worthy experience,"Despite being overshadowed, A Bug's Life is good. It isn't Pixar's best, but this film provides plenty. First, the plot is relatively fresh. Yes, it's basically Seven Samurai, but that narrative structure isn't overdone. Plus, there are enough twists to differentiate itself. Flick's misunderstood creative protagonist is cliche, but his unconventional plans have natural set-ups and pay-offs. The story also has social commentary about workers and limiting beliefs. Meanwhile, though voice acting is confined, Hopper is intimidating, Flick is relatable, and the circus bugs are uniquely humorous. Overall, the writing isn't Pixar's most distinctive, but it still has significance.Furthermore, A Bug's Life is raised by Pixar's technical floor. The special effects defined the era and revolutionized animation. Randy Newman's music is reliably pleasant, setting an upbeat mood. The production design is familiarly endearing, establishing Pixar's cartoonish humanization of exotic environments. Additionally, there's a comical match cut edit and an exaggerated zoom to highlight Flick's shock. The sounds of bugs flying, birds chirping, and rain falling are intentionally overdramatic. Also, the tone is lighthearted with moments of precise tension, maintaining excitement. Never dull and always enjoyable, A Bug's Life is a worthy experience with notable substance.Writing: 7/10

A large step down from Toy Story.,"I remember the DVD for this being held in a high cupboard to be given to me as a reward for good behaviour as a kid. Yes, I sympathised with bugs at the time. I did grow tall enough to reach the closet, though it was years and years later, with awkward phases of me getting used to the change. Which is, I think, relevant to A Bug's Life. That odd area of time where you're still adjusting to what you now have. After Toy Story revolutionised the animation industry, they had to make a second film with this new technology. A Bug's Life is the only misstep-not to say it's a bad film, I'm just comparing it to their other ones-until Cars that Pixar had in my opinion.The film is incredibly ambitious with the amount of ants they render, and it does unfortunately come off looking worse than Toy Story. The locations weren't nearly as interesting as well. The bug city was neat, but a bright spot in an otherwise dull looking film. I do wish we saw more of the colony's structure. When I think of ants, I think of them scurrying around an immense underground labyrinth. Here, we mostly see surface-level stuff.The script is also not as impressive. I don't think it's unfair to say that it's a watered down (quite literally) version of Seven Samurai. And the runtime doesn't allow for most of the side characters to be anything more than one-note. Though they are quite unique, and the voice acting is overall fantastic. Spacey, as much as it pains me to say it, is very menacing.The western score is pretty memorable, I couldn't believe that I remembered sections of some songs fifteen years after I last watched it.So overall, A Bug's Life is decent, but doesn't shine like the rest of Pixar's early repertoire.

""A Bug's Life"" can't compete with it."" Well, this is the way I feel about ""A Bug's Life"". I feel it would be very hard for ""ANTZ"" to be better. I guess I haven't seen ANTZ yet because the character design looks very boring and the main character ""Z"" looks just like a typical Woody Allen character which, in my opinion, gets a little old. I won't comment any more on the movie since I haven't seen it, but do go see ""A Bug's Life.""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""A Bug's Life"" Review: Fun, Heartwarming Adventure for the Whole Family","""A Bug's Life"" is a classic animated movie from the late 90s that tells the story of a misfit ant named Flik who dreams of a better life for his colony. The movie is set in an imaginary world of ants and other insects, where Flik's quest to find better ways of life for his colony leads him to hire a group of ""warrior bugs"" to help protect his colony from the dangerous grasshoppers.One of the strengths of this movie is its unique and imaginative world-building. The animation is eye-catching and the attention to detail is impressive, making it a feast for the eyes. The characters are lovable and relatable, with great voice acting by the likes of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.The story is well-written, with plenty of humor and heartwarming moments. The themes of friendship, bravery, and determination are well-balanced with the comedic elements, making it a great family movie. It's a story that will make you laugh, tear up, and cheer.In conclusion, ""A Bug's Life"" is a great movie that deserves to be a part of any family's movie collection. Whether you're a fan of animated movies or just looking for a fun and heartwarming adventure, ""A Bug's Life"" is sure to please.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Funny LightHearted Movie,A bug's life is a major step for Pixar and Disney. A Bug's Life was a cute movie about a little ant named Flick who just couldn't make it as an ant and was also trying to prove himself worthy to the queen and princess.The Cast of voices in this movie was amazing and Our own Canadian Dave Foley did wonders for the roll of Flick.I would have to say the this movie will do wonders.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ant and the Grasshopper,"We all grew up with the story of ant and grasshopper - how hard work pays in the long run and sluggishness only causes plight. 'A Bug's Life' adds to that same plot with some additional virtues for the kids - teamwork, camaraderie, perseverance and of course good humour - and with the inevitable twists and turns If you love animated movies, and like happy-go-lucky characters, then 'A Bug's Life' won't disappoint you.For me, I couldn't find any novelty. May be, because I watched it so late after watching so many great animated flicks. So this remains just an average watch for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Light Years,"The feature ""A Bug's Life"" shows the light years Lasseter's art had jumped in only ten regular years since ""Luxo Jr."".  No longer are the qualities of the faces affected by symmetrical shapes.  In ""Tin Toy"", Tinny was cute, but his face was a perfect sphere.  The baby was supposed to be cute, but because his face could not be perfectly round and still seem realistic, his face was ruined by unintended harsh angles that were supposed to give the baby a more ""human"" look.  In ""A Bug's Life"", we now have cute ants whose faces are not perfectly spherical, yet are not ruined.  The lines and bends in their faces and bodies are smooth and flexible.  The sharp features that made the baby so sinister looking are reserved for the evil grasshoppers. The scene where Hopper is about to crush Flick's head is frightening not only because of what is happening, but because of the intense looks of anger/pleasure on Hopper's face, and the extreme fear on Flick's face.It's not only the characters that make ""A Bugs Life"" a triumph.  We see how far we've come since ""Luxo Jr."" when it was too risky to move the camera.  Now the camera swoops and swirl through the air.  The high-speed chase in the rain is particularly stunning.  The rain adds added atmosphere, as well as a way to indicate just how fast they are flying.  As the camera bobs up and down as it rushes through space, we can hardly believe that this is not real.  I think it works better than a live action chase, because there is not that awkward mix between special effects and reality.  Because ""A Bugs Life"" is all special effects, it is it's own reality",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"More of a kid-flick than ""Antz""","""A Bug's Life"" is clearly oriented more toward children than is ""Antz."" The story is more kid-accessible, and the characters as well as the overall style have a much higher ""cute"" factor.  (For example, consider the fundamental decision to make the ants in ""A Bug's Life"" light blue and lavender, while comparable characters in ""Antz"" are more mundane shades of brown.)  The central and supporting characters are a varied assortment of different insects, which makes for easy identification and increased toy sales.  The voice casting is a delight: Phyllis Diller is an absolute hoot as the ant queen; Kevin Spacey embodies sheer villainy as the head grasshopper meanie; David Hyde-Pierce gives dry voice to a worldly, jaded walking-stick.  Gary Rydstrom's sound design is remarkably rich and detailed, putting the viewer right in the middle of each meadow, underground anthill, and grasshopper swarm.  The story makes some of the same points concerning individuality and cooperation as does ""Antz,"" and they are no less meaningful (although perhaps a bit less original) for having been heard before.  If possible, Pixar's animation is even better than PDI's outstanding work in ""Antz.""  Exterior shots are unbelievably detailed, with single leaves visible being blown by wind in the trees and individual clusters of clover leaves weaving and bending as the bugs hop across them. ""A Bug's Life"" is a riotous, rollicking roller-coaster ride of a flick.  I saw it in a theater full of families with kids, and a good time was had by all.  The hilarious ""outtakes"" over which the end credits roll are an especially imaginative touch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Too Serious yet Too Childish,"A strange and unsatisfying mix of silliness and graveness, ""A Bug's Life"" harbours the major innovations of 3D animation and for the most part is gorgeous to behold. The bugs in their blue and the grasshoppers with their brown and green look really beautiful set against the reasonably well rendered landscapes.What doesn't work so well are the characters. They are very basic and their dialogue lacks the sophistication and interest to keep one caring about them.

Delightful,"I worried about the people who have animosity for this movie. I think it's a great movie for kids and has an excellent message. It shows that thinking outside the box can be of great benefit to society as a whole.  It shows how team work can solve problems. Aside from that it was funny and great to look at.  Is it an accurate depiction of insect life...no.  I didn't care that the ants weren't anatomically correct.  The male mosquito ordering a bloody Mary was interesting as well, since males don't drink blood or so my degree in science from the discovery channel would have me believe.

Definitely not for kid's,So let's discuss this average animation the storyline is okay but I could never get into the movie it just seemed to lack the same enjoyment as Antz and as Ant Bully this in fact was rather dull and most importantly it definitely was not the kids movie The encouragement of bullying the disgusting ending when the grasshopper is fed to the birds and then in the aftermath you see the bugs waving his limbs it's disgusting definitely not recommend for Kids under 14 overall I would say the movies severely overrated it's got a cult following and people defend it and say it's the greatest animation of all time okay whatever you want to say that's your opinion it's not though it's actually an average animation at best but people are blind to the childhood memories and tend to delude themselves as I said it definitely not up there with the Antz or Ant Bully or other classic Animals and Bug animations.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation

From some slapstick for the kids (Flick crashes into the river bed rocks)... to inside ""bug humor"" (the grasshopper with a sign ""Kid pulled my wing's off"") for those who understand more about the bug world. It's got jokes throughout the entire movie... even up to Heimlich sprouting little wings and saying ""From up here you all look little ants."" haha Not only are the visuals strikingly real in many places, but to take things down to the world of bugs creates a fascinating perspective on things.

"Entymology aside, Pixar has really worked the bugs out.","For everyone who's ever said ""The ants are supposed to have six legs"", my reply is ""It's a cartoon, people "".

Besides - any kid who's using cartoons to write a science paper already has serious problems.Now that we've gotten *that* out of the way - Pixar has done it again.  Like Toy Story, the creatures are well done, considering they had a more complex set of characters to build.....I say more complex, because this time almost all the cast share the same body type, so the differences were more subtle, and therefore more difficult to render.The story is a simple one.......Over-enthusiastic bungler with a heart of gold accidently starts a war.

"Let's rate ""Bug's life"" great again.","After 23 years I've finally watched ""A Bug's life"". When it went out I was just 5 years old. When I decided to watch it for the first time, I watched it in Russian because I'm from Belarus. And I wasn't much impressed. And I thought that ""A Bug's life"" was something ""between"" really cool movies ""Toy's stories"". And I didn't like Heimlich at all. Of course, I found much in common that happens in my country and I appreciated it. But there were no really cool characters that could advertise and merchandise this movie like in ""Finding Nemo"", for example. So ""A Bug's life"" left somewhere between ""Toy stories""
But than I've watched in English all things changed absolutely. It blew my mind and transformed my vision on it upside down! I think this movie is underestimated and unfairly locates in the shadow of other movies. How they created ""circus bugs"" is absolutely amazing! It's fantastic! My head spins around watching it. How it is entertaining, smart and intelligent! I'm astonished! Why I didn't notice it first time watching!? Because now Heimlich is Joe Ranft! And all original cast is amazing. I can't say that Russian casts in Pixar movies are bad. For example, in ""Incredibles"" I like russian voices more, but in ""Bug's life"" difference is huge. Tempo, rhythm, dramatic collisions, arcs of characters, characters, music, editing - are absolutely brilliant. And sequence with circus bugs before they came to the ant's island - is masterpiece. I'm watching it again and again. And all second act is the best second act in all Pixar's movies, I think.As for me the problem of current animation is overexpression of their characters. I suppose that's because of problems in stories when animators try to compensate lack of meanings or dramatic collisions by some ""funny attitudes"" or ""weird behave"". I know that caricaturizing is the origin of animation but the essence in reasons why something is funny, cool, weird, expressive and so on. And that's why Bug's life is masterpiece. No over expressiveness and all is told by action. That's the best example when limitations makes movies better. All dramatic collisions and characters are strong, intelligent and are justified. Second act, as I said, is the best second act I have ever seen! I had no feeling that it was too long and wasn't thinking: ""Oh boy, how long life would beat Hero before he changed his purpose and understood what he really needs?"". Because story is multidimensional but meanwhile it is told extremely succinctly. All characters Flik, Atta, Ants, circus Bug's went through their dramatic changing that is simple, understandable and as I said earlier - intelligent.And above all - this story is about relationships (the core of any good story). And in 2021 I must say that ""A Bug's life"" is unfairly underrated in the culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just enough heart to make the stereotypes justifiable,"This now Pixar classic, only their second full-length film - after Toy Story in 1995, brings us safely down to earth as we take up the role as fly on the wall in an ant colony bullied by a swarm of locusts. If that didn't bug you enough, the opening minutes surely will, because it seems the Pixar guys were overeager to show off as much vivid animation they could as soon as possible, and the result is a myriad of characters, situations and dialogue in the first part of the film that confused me enough to convince me that the age-group this film is aimed at surely must struggle. With that said (and done), the film slowly settles into a more manageable pace, and we can start caring for some of these little buggers - particularly Flik, our protagonist, and an adorable little princess named Dot. The next hour or so is filled with a cheerful combination of hogwash and seriousness, as a host of different species and types eventually unite against the terrorizing locusts.

The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it.  The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(I especially liked Hopper's line ""If I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!""), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(Denis Leary doing an animated movie; what a concept).

Disney's visual feast scratches the surface!,"Let's remember this analogy for a moment and see if this makes sense: TOY STORY (1995) is to three-dimensional polygons as SNOW WHITE (1937) is to two-dimensional hand-drawn art. We have here two little movies that set all-new standards in cartoon animation. Now, I'm finally glad that Disney and Pixar waited three years by not leaking out their secrets kept behind locked doors, and A BUG'S LIFE is ultimately worth the impatience. This is the best looking 3-D showcase I've seen so far, even surpassing ANTZ, and has applied the same technical formula that TOY STORY gave to us. Of course, there are going to be more and better 3-D movies coming our way, but we're already tasting the future right now.It will be interesting to point out the comparisons between A BUG'S LIFE and ANTZ, both that has tiny little ants that appear large when seen off a projection television. ANTZ was a tried-and-true effort by newcomer Dream Works SKG; it just wasn't satisfying enough to hold its appeal to everyone, not even the children. It was also a little too slow in its animation, and was keen enough to make a Hollywoodian image for itself. Or even ""Woodian"", as in Woody Allen. It needed a lot more bite than it could chew, but that's ANTZ.Here, in A BUG'S LIFE, ""family"" entertainment is a whole definition not just for its intelligent sense of humor, but in the way Pixar established a whole new environment for animators to take better advantage of handling three-dimensional objects and landscapes. You want a lifelike cartoon to become a surrealistic universe that's far beyond our imagination. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo would be wandering around reflections of the sun and getting lost in the dark shadows. It's amazing how fast and slick this movie goes on its motions of ants running and birds flying even with colors that appear and shine as a glossy liquid. Whatever more there is to the tantalizing visual quality, it's something we all are going to look forward to the next few years, and it could threaten to dethrone the traditional cartoon as we know it. Tempting but frightening words, aren't they?The visuals aren't the only best things about it, but you can't knock down Disney for its timeless heritage of magical fun-filled wizardry. Let's face it, the movie looks so good enough to burst a chuckle or two. Or, if you handle it, say 99! Just as appealing to grown-ups as it is to children, the comedy relief bodes extremely well for an animated movie running on ultra-high speed microchips. It makes a new statement for the term ""ladybug"", which is sure to fool many! This is the finest example of creativity and delightfulness in a ""family"" picture sitting next to the original BABE. Sure, we can handle the modernization of its jokes any time!There is just one quibble though: the celebrities give this the all-too familiar voice of Hollywood. I wish there were more talented voice acts to liven up this brilliant looking movie a la creme rather than hiring overpaid TV stars and film actors. Oh well, at least they contributed to the characters with all their diligence.For those sitting in the front row near the boxing ring watching the fight and have kept track of the action, you'll see why A BUG'S LIFE wins over ANTZ by a stunning knockout in the first round, and so does Disney. I hate to question about Dream Works' further potential, but the studio sure has a long, long way to go before managing itself as a triumphant pioneer in ""family"" entertainment. It may not become the next ""Disney"" than we'd least anticipate.And for a while, you'd believe I'd give this one the undisputed title as ""The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made""! Not exactly! But what a fine ""family"" movie this is! (Are you at all convinced that a bold summary like that would be the perfect fashion statement for presenting user comments?

I mean...,"This movie is a bit overrated. To be honest, I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said about this movie. Of course Hopper steals the show, but you probably already knew that. The animation is fine but I kinda prefer the animation in Toy Story, A Bug's Life looks a bit rougher. I couldn't really like the circus bugs, they were just forgettable to me, apart from Heimlich. Flik, the protagonist, is fine, albeit a forgettable protagonist to be honest. All I have to say is this movie is fine, a film that has nothing special but it's watchable and a movie that you can stick on in the background whilst you do something a lot better. Is it better than Toy Story? Absolutely not. Is it the worst Pixar movie? Absolutely not. It's a mediocre movie and I will probably never watch it again.Pixar ranking so far:
1. Toy Story
2. A Bug's Life.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a lesson to teach. And the animation is otherworldly. You just have to see this Dreamworks classic. Pixar ain't got nothing on this baby. Oh yeah, the dang ladybug is funny too, who was that? Harry Dean Stanton? Whatever happened to classic bugs movies like A Bigs Life? They could've tried harder with Kung Chung Panda 2 to make it better, and about bugs. Hey this movie was made using a computer and I think that's pretty radical. These guys are truly wizards, taking the ones and zeroes and making Woody Allen into ant ant.

Nice Pixar/Disney early collaboration,"""A Bug's Life"" (1998) is a nice computer generated animated diversion into the world of bugs and their infighting.It has some funny bits and top notch animation from the Disney/Pixar team, but is not as engaging as the earlier Disney/Pizar Combination (aka ""A Toy Story"" (1995))There is nice voice work and is more kids oriented than the similar ""Antz"" (1998) from the same year, but still ""A Bug's Life"" is the better of the two films.Disney and Pixar show that they have the template for family film fun as they continue to get top notch voice work.Disney/Pixar stalwarts like John Ratzenberger (and director cameo voice) are here, but also unique work by classic actors like Roddy McDowall, Madeline Kahn, and Phyllis Dillar.Kevin Spacey also does a nice bad bug.All in all nice voice work, a good story, and top notch animation with a wink to past films mean great fun for young and old.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
it makes you think twice before squishing an ant!,"what an adorable movie this is! Why i haven't seen a movie that was this much fun in ages! Pixar animation studios have created a masterpiece, which i think is better than Toy Story. This movie teaches that grass hoppers are really bad guys, i'd squish them anyday now.A bug's life is actually Flik's life, who is a very clumsy ant who can't stand that he and his fellow ants are being oppressed by a gang of grass hoppers led by Hopper. The grass hoppers come by once year to eat the food which the ants have picked through the year. One day, Flik accidentally drops all the food collected for Hopper. He is now the enemy of the ant hill, because now the ants have to pick twice the resource of food for the grass hoppers. Then, flik comes up with a great idea: to get help from other, bigger ants to help them stand up for themselves. The queen thinks it's a ridiculous idea, but she sends him anyway so he can't screw anything up. Unexpectedly, flik succeeds in his mission and comes back with a bunch of who seem strong enough. But, when these guys appear to be just a group of circus clowns, the chaos begins...I won't give away the ending, simply because it's too good to be revealed.

A super bugs story.,"Disney and Pixar studios team up once again and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a misfit ant named Flik, who accidentally drops the food offerings his colony gathers for the fierce gang of grasshoppers, leaving his fellow ants to gather twice as much food for the fierce bugs. To help his colony rid their land of the hopping menace, Flik tries to seeks out warrior bugs that would help out but, instead, he unknowingly returns to the colony with a circus crew.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic as it cleverly shows a bug's world from their point of view. The story is full of adventure, from Flik running into the flea circus to the ants trying to defend themselves from the grasshoppers. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate the bug humor and, of course, it's typical for a Disney animated movie that the filmmakers would make the ladybug character a guy in the story.There are some slow plot points in the first half of the movie, especially during Flik's solo scenes, but the plot picks up steam during the second half, especially when the circus and ants conjure up the plan to defeat the grasshoppers. It is also notable that the film concentrates on redemption, endurance and never-say-die attitude of the ant colony, proving that even the ""little guys"" are ferocious and determined.Just like the Toy Story movies, this animated film will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

You won't believe it's animation,"When viewing a movie like this, it is hard to appreciate the work that must have gone into making it.

As for the actual movie, it combines a good story, a good lesson, and great animation for an all-around great package. The casting of the voices was brilliant. You can recognize who the celebrities behind the voices are at first, but it takes very little time before their voices are permanently the possessions of their characters. The greatest thing I liked from A Bug's Life, along with all animations, is the attention to detail.

Flic feels like if he goes out and gets some warriors to help the colony gather food, maybe things will go by faster, but he ends up meeting a flea circus of different bugs. He tells them that they are going to a place where they could perform and being appreciated for it and he lies to the colony that they are true warriors, but everything untangles in Flic's lies and the grasshoppers are getting very impatient.A Bug's Life is a great story and excellent animation, I just loved the humor that was used because it was great for kids and adults.

Underrated but very cute.,"While not as absolutely perfect as the ""Toy Story"" movies (indeed, that's a very tough act to follow), ""A Bug's Life"" is very enjoyable movie.  It's one of the very few animated movies that works well for adults and kids, the script is incredibly well written, and the artwork is bright and adorable.I want to make one last comment on that last aspect.  This summer, a lot of noise was made about how Disney's inventively titled (I hope you can all hear the sarcasm dripping off of that statement) non-Pixar-involving (and man, did that make a difference) computer animation -err- ""movie"" (""Dinosaur"", if you haven't guessed yet) had backgrounds that were real live-action footage.  Only the characters were animated.  Well, watching ""Bug's Life"" again, I have to ask, what was the point?  The backgrounds in ""Bug's"" are stunningly beautiful, and the characters interact with them convincingly.  The characters (if you can call them that) in ""Dinosaur"" were less convincing than the animated creatures in a Ray Harryhausen movie. Much less.

The time of your life,Pixar has had a lot of great movies and I loved all of them they have great stories and wonderful funny characters. I have been a huge fan of Toy Story I loved the plot of the film of being about two toys being separated from their owner and ending up at an evil nasty toy abuser who turns toys into horribly nasty looking things. After Toy Story was a huge hit at the box office pixar deiced to make of film about bugs which the idea came around in 1995 around the same time when toy story came out. But Dream works copy their idea and making a film about ants which is also a bug's life is also about. And people are saying that these two films are the same movie but their not while Antz is dark and the CGI is very lack. But A bug's life is also dark but Funny and enjoyable. Hooper is a great villain he has to be best pixar villain and one of the best Disney villains of all times. But Flik is the one who steals the show as He is kind funny and very smart which I can related to him a lot.

Really great entertainment !!!,"All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake ""hand-made-old-Disneys-like"" drawings (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).A bug's life (1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say ""Hey, this thing is computer generated !"". No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's (aka Tilt in France) adventures.A big thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :).

It has terrific animation, colorful characters and pure storyline, what more could you ask for in a film.Pixar, ever since they made TOY STORY, has gone of in a winning streak. A BUG'S LIFE still keeps their victory running. Thanks, mainly, to director John Lasseter who keeps a Disney tradition when making these movies. In A BUG'S LIFE, The animation and quality is strictly Pixar, but the story, about the cooperation and determination against odds against them, are the stuff Disney films are famous for.The film was released alongside another ant film entitled ANTZ, which sounds like they have similar plot lines. But their plots aren't that identical. While ANTZ appeals more to a mature choice of audience due to its mature characters, despite the child movie plot. Ask for A BUG'S LIFE, which tells the story of a colony of ants, bullied by a swarm of grasshoppers, who has nothing to do but lay around, is a less complicated plot. Thus, A BUG'S LIFE is the movie to show the kids more often, while ANTZ will be the adults'.I'm not just rating A BUG'S LIFE high because it's a terrific animated film. But also because it takes us, once again, to a different world, one where we set are imaginations free, free from the bounds of reality.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A return to childhood imagination,"I have no clue exactly what it is about this cute movie, but watching it has to be one of the most fun things to do that I can think of.  Throughout the whole movie I have this stupid grin on my face (I must look like some kind of mental patient).  The ants are perfectly animated (no, perhaps not realistic though) and their feelings and emotion seem to come through as though they were human characters.  The humor is great for all ages.  Quite a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertainment at its best!,"I thought this movie would be the same as the ""Toy Story"", but to my surprise it was wonderfully different! The characters are portrayed very naturally, the plot is ""fresh"" and the humour is witty (though sometimes a bit too mature for smaller children). There were no dull moments in the movie. It is very entertaining.Only when I saw the movie three or four times I realized the immense amount of detail and ""background"" animation was done. It is not only a movie - it is a work of art. Virtually every frame of this movie you can make into a poster! I wish I could have been part of the production team of this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
a great movie for bugs and people everywhere,"Everything that was great about Toy Story, Pixar's first feature (and the first-ever all-computer animated movie), is even greater in A Bug's Life. Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some ""tough bugs"" to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family. This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above ""it all"" to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound. Above all, this movie is visually stunning. STUNNING. It is amazing to watch. 9 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much better than Antz!!!,"Ahh... The Disney/Pixar magic is back. I waited three years for A Bug's Life, and it did not disappoint. Unlike it's direct competition, Antz, A Bug's Life is a light hearted, fun filled adventure directed at kids, but good enough for adults. Flik (voice of Dave Foley) is an ant. And like all ants in his colony, he picks grains and fruits all year long. And once a year, the bad grasshoppers, lead by Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) come to the colony and take all the grain. The ants just accept this as their way of life. But one day Flik decides to do something different. He figures if the ants can recruit bigger and badder insects, they can scare the grasshoppers away, and keep all the food for themselves. So he heads to the ""big city"" to find some really tough bugs. Unfortunately for him, he finds some circus bugs who he thinks are tough. But he brings them back to the colony, and through the magic of luck, they manage to scare the grasshoppers away.Obviously everyone and their mother is going to compare A Bug's Life to that other bug movie that came out a couple months before. The biggest difference is that the other movie was aimed more at the adult crowd, while this movie is aimed towards kids. The characters are cuter, funnier, and more fun. With characters like Flik, and Dot, and Tuck & Roll (my favorites), A Bug's Life makes it fun to go to the movies. I didn't have any fun when I saw Antz. With Woody Allen's neurotic attitude, and all those dead bugs, I felt like I was watching an animated war film. With A Bug's Life, I felt like I was watching a light-hearted comedy with spectacular animation. I honestly felt that at times I was really watching bugs in my backyard. It felt so real it was amazing. And another thing I've come to realize, even in animation, it's important to have a story that people want to see. Now I realize Antz made a lot of money, but I'm not sure why. With A Bug's Life I felt like a kid again. I cheered for the good bugs, and booed the bad bugs. The circus bugs were cutely drawn, and the voices matched the bugs perfectly. Woody Allen as an ant just didn't fly for me. But David Hyde-Pierce as a stick bug was perfect. Basically what I'm saying is, if you want to see what real animation is about, a good story, fun characters, good voices, and most of all a good time, rent A Bug's Life. Besides, you get two pluses. One, they showed Pixar's 1997 Academy Award winning animation short, Geri's Game before the movie, and they had these hilarious ""outtakes"" during the closing credits. Quite possibly the funniest thing I've seen. So have a good time...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Much, much better than the irrelevant ""Antz.""  *** out of *****","""A Bug's Life"" is a colorful tale that suffers from the same syndrome as ""Antz"" does at first, but with its amusing and childish characters, along with a firm, clear plot, it manages to somehow dig itself out of a rather troublesome hole and entertain the audience to satisfaction.My first urge to talk to you about in my review of ""A Bug's Life"" is obviously to compare this film with its successful competitor, ""Antz."" Both movies are about the lives of ants. Only one actually works. ""Antz,"" that I gave **1/2 to, was dark, both in color and in plot. The visuals weren't satisfying and the characters weren't fun. They were sick, unhappy, average ants, and personally, you going have to do better than that to please me.""A Bug's Life"" is full of color, happiness and childish fun. The main character wasn't based on a person like Woody Allen, he is a creative inventor, who devises all kinds of interesting gadgets and gismos. He is also a klutz on the side, which is what the amusing story evolves from.The visual effects, led by director John Lasseter,  are lush, rich images. The bugs are extremely well detailed. A rain looks like the colony is being water-bombed. The soundtrack is catchy and tuneful. The colors are mind-blowingly realistic.At the end of the movie, the bugs act as if they are the one who made this movie. They show us mistakes that they made during the film, like Jackie Chan films. We experience dialog mistakes, clumsiness of the characters and many more clever and funny sequences. I believe that people are calling this ""Bug Bloopers."" A Bug's Life"" would never be as good as ""Toy Story"" in its wildest dreams, but I sill think it is worth your time.",,Anonymous,Animation
"RUN to see this, because you'll want to see it again","I, for one, thought this movie was better than Toy Story. It's just so inventive, jokes are coming so fast and furious, and it has so many visial and musical winks to the audience that you can't take it all in in one screening. This movie has so much inspiration and heart that it makes Antz appear really crass.The animation is also very beautiful, with an appreciation for nature that Antz didn't have at all. There are so many inspired characterizations one really leaves the theater wowed, which I can't say for almost any other film recently. This is what great children's movies should be like. I would give this Best Picture over that lame Private Ryan any day. Really carefully and wonderfully done... you want to find the filmmakers and just THANK them.

Gorgeous and a lot of fun..great Randy Newman score!,"A great deal of fun for any age, though I wouldn't bring kids under 7 or so just due to the sheer INTENSITY of it all.  Gorgeous landscape and character work looks great in the Cinemascope format!  Randy Newman's score is a treat.  Franticly paced!  Funny bits throughout and ...a plus...no really crappy songs to slow down the action.My only minor quibble with this otherwise impressive film is that it was TOO DAMNED LOUD!  I'm a man in my thirties who still goes to rock and roll shows, but the effects in this film were a bit assaultive.  Too many really loud helicopter effects (for the winged insects)  ...it all adds to the FRANTIC pace of the film, but I thought was a little much.But in general....way to go Pixar!!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but Pixar can do better","Although it's well done and infinitely better compared to the highly overrated ""Antz"", I couldn't help feeling dissapointed by this film, especially when compared to other Pixar offerings. Perhaps it's the fact that the jokes are forced compared to Toy Story, or maybe the fact that ants don't look as convincing as toys do. Dave Foley sounds a little too starry-eyed, which is a little out of character for his usual, pessimistic self seen in ""Newsradio"" and his various ""Kids In The Hall"" characters. He was clearly uncomfortable doing a film like this. Anyway, better than Antz, but not as good as the two ""Toy Story"" films.",,Anonymous,Animation
Animation brilliance,"Disney still manages to amaze us with its innovate ways of turning the simplest of stories into something that everyone flocks to see.

Not only for kids!!!,"I don`t think Disney have been very successful with the movies in the later years, but with A Bugs Life (with help from Pixar) they really done a great job.

It`s just cool how they made the movie, and the story was great, even I knew how it would end. The best part was all the ""mistakes"" from the movie in the credits!

An epic...of miniature proportions!,"A Bug's Life is the story of Flik, an ant, and his colony of ants. The colony has to each year gather food for the grasshoppers, mainly Hopper and his gang. Flik seems to mess up everything unknowingly, in a way that is endearing. And somehow his ""inventions"" don't seem to work and the more he tries the more he fails. When Flik upsets the pile of food that the ants have been collecting for Hopper all summer, he realises that he's really done it this time. Hopper arrives, scares them to high heavens, and messes with their minds - he gives them ""one last chance"". The ants, terrified, start collecting food again, this time double the load. As well as double food for Hopper, they need to start collecting for themselves. But it's late summer and there isn't much left to pick, feeling guilty, and coming up with a huge plan, Flik offers to travel to city, round up some tough warrior bugs, return, and fight off Hopper and his crew. The Ant Queen, Princess Atta (for whom Flik has a massive crush) and the other ants all agree to this - but only because they want Flik out of their way! Flik is determined to make a difference and give something back to his colony, but can he do it? Can he redeem himself and save his colony from Hopper? And if he does, how?I thought A Bug's Life addressed bullying, and is the only animated film from Pixar to have done so. Even many Disney films have not addressed bullying so openly and easily. A Bug's Life, though subtle, addresses an issue.The animation is STUNNING. I am a great fan of animated movies, especially by Pixar, and I think this is one of their best. Finding Nemo, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc. to name a few, A Bug's Life still remains as a classic Pixar animation, despite being one of their oldest movies. I thought the animation of the ants was done well, but better than that, was the landscape, and background. Each leaf was perfect, each stem defined and textured.What I like most about A Bug's Life is that it makes you feel as if you know the ants, as they live a similar life to you. They talk, they eat, they shop, they buy drinks and have pubs, this made the movie so enjoyable and I finished watching it with a new-found respect for the bug world!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Of course, great Disney entertainment.....","But... I would have to say,  ""Antz"" was the winner in the battle of these animated insect classics. And the only difference would be that ""A Bug's Life"" had a children's appeal, while ""Antz"" was the adult favorite.  Even the animation for ""ABL"" was a bit softer and more colorful, and it's characters were simple and less complex than the neurotic intellects of a darker themed ""Antz"".The most original surprise is at the end, where sheer imagine created hilarious out-takes of flubbed lines and equipment failure...some of the best laughs of the whole movie, make sure to stick around!All in all....children will love this movie and rush to their local fast food chain to collect these lovable characters that are destined to show up in a Disney/Pixar sequel.",,Anonymous,Animation

Delightful animated film has plenty to offer,"A Bug's Life considers a number of the same themes (individuality vs. utilitarianism, for example) that are found in Antz, but the Disney/Pixar film stays more firmly rooted in the breezy, family-friendly zone than the Dreamworks competition.  I agree with the critic who suggested that spinning The Seven Samurai into a children's story featuring insects was a stroke of genius.  And few would disagree that the samurai, here made over into a circus of misfit bugs, provide the most colorful moments in the movie.  The non-English speaking duo of Tuck and Roll, voiced by Michael McShane, were perfectly realized by their animators, who captured a hilarious vacancy on their faces as they listened but didn't comprehend what was being said to them.  These two stole every scene in which they appeared, and came back for a couple of triumphant moments in the phenomenal ""bloopers"" that roll during the credits.",,Anonymous,Animation
It's Adorable!!,"I saw Antz in the theatre, and bought the video (sight unseen) to A Bug's Life. My point being I'm so glad it's not the other way around and that I have ABL on tape to watch over and over and over again. It's precious! Like others have stated, it's visually stunning. Plus the story's so cute and very funny -- I laughed out loud at many parts. I'll never get tired of watching when Hopper explains the circle of life to Princess Atta, Molt interrupts with ""and the birds eat the grasshoppers!!"" The voices are wonderful, perfect for each character. How can you not adore Denis Leary as the boy ladybug Francis, Kevin Spacey as Hopper, David Foley as Flik... well, all of them! Yes, I am an adult, and want to say how refreshing it is to sit and watch such an enjoyable film without having to worry about the graphic violence, cursing, and all that other stuff that comes with mature movies. I'd like to add, I'm a Toy Story fanatic too. :)",,Anonymous,Animation
You wouldn't expect this from a Disney picture.,"I saw ""Antz"" in 1998 at cinema and I thought it was a wonderful computer animated movie. Since I am a Woody Allen fan, I have found it a very good idea to give Woody's character to the 'hero' ant. I wanted to check ""A Bug's Life"" at cinema, but I thought it couldn't be better than ""Antz"" and it was advertised as a real children film, so I didn't want to be disappointed. Now I know I was wrong. There are several good surprises in this wonderful film. Firstly, there are no stupid songs in it, which are just slow the story down (don't forget this is a Disney production, until ""Atlantis"" it was compulsory to put songs in Disney animations). Secondly the sophisticated irony and the humor. Of course its less sarcastic than ""Antz"" because it was made for children but adults can enjoy it very much, too. The animation is fantastic, I'm sure the other comment writers have written dozens of lines about it, so I don't want to go into details, but I have to say that nothing can replace real drawings. I know this is a computer animated movie and I might seem conservative, but that's the only thing I miss from this picture. Maybe that's why I prefer ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" & ""James and the Giant Peach"". It's sure this is my second favourite animated film after ""The Iron Giant"" and from technical point of view it surpasses ""Antz"". The only thing I would like to draw the attention to is during the end titles where you can see the collection of the ""faulted scenes"". It's one of the best gag of the animation history. The best is at the end.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Complete WASTE of time!!!!,"Don't go watch this film unless you are trying to find a pretty bad movie. It's not good. It's boring, it's not entertaining, and it's not interesting. If you ARE entering the 'I just found a bad movie' contest, this one is a good idea.",,Anonymous,Animation
For kids only--adults should rerent Toy Story,"This cross between Lion King and The Three Amigos is pretty standard Disney fare. The ant colony suffers from exploitation by grasshoppers. The inventor-ant, the usual misfit/outsider, is sent to find macho bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Of course, it is expected that he will never return. What he finds instead is a group of circus bugs. Per the usual Disney formula, all the outsiders bring their unusual talents to win the day.The animation was done by Pixar (of Toy Story fame). But this film doesn't make your eyes pop the way Toy Story Did. Partially the repetitiveness of the landscapes (lots of blades of grass) and the sameness of many of the characters (most of the ants and grasshoppers look the same) limit the potential for wild effects. Even the visit to the bug ""city"" does not have the intended effect. Instead of a lost country ant in a Manhattan-like urban landscape, we have an ant standing in front of a billboard.Despite these shortcomings (in my mind) this will certainly please the kids. All the elements are there (but it's not a musical, thank God) and the story moves along at a good pace. The dangers are not overly scary, the circus bits are very funny, and there is some very creative use of the bug's eye perspective. For example, Flik (our hero) invents a telescope by putting a drop of water into a rolled up grass blade. Still, adults may want to get this on video and move to another room.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Visual Masterpiece,"A Bug's Life stands among one one the top three films of 1998, and also among one of the 50 greatest films that I have seen. I enjoyed every second of this visual masterpiece and I am not even a kid. The voice casts could not have been better, with such actors like Julia-Louise Dreyfuss, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary, and one of my favorite acting talents, Kevin Spacey. Not only has Pixar outdone themselves by creating a more visually exciting film than Toy Story, but they have also added a bunch of hilarious outtakes during the credits.The film's plot is a simple one. A colony of ants are forced to provide food for a group of viscious grasshoppers year after year, until one brave ant decides to do something about it, by leaving the island in search of stronger bugs to help them fight off the grasshoppers. But, instead he finds a small group of failed circus bugs.Fast paced wholly computer animated film is almost too much of a good thing, with a brilliant screenplay, excellent character development, superior cinematography, and a great musical score by Randy Newman, who also did Toy Story. This film is perfect for the whole family, and it's absolutely not to be missed. A true 5-star motion picture",,Anonymous,Animation
It's a buggy bug world out there...,"A BUG'S LIFE / Starring David Foley, Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey / Directed by John Lasseter / Written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft / Rated G / *** 1/2A Bug's Life, for me, never reaches the height of humor, wit and emotion as the Pixar perfects like Toy Story 1-2, Monsters, Inc. or even their latest masterpiece Finding Nemo. I'd say it's the weakest of the Pixar films. However, with it still being a Pixar production, it is probably one of the better children's flicks made in 1998. It's still better than the somewhat forgettable Antz and is even maybe a bit more 'adult' than the others (besides the Toy Story movies). Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, A Bug's Life is one heck of a wild ride into the world of computer animation.Flik (David Foley) is a lone ant living with his colony on Ant Island who's not really friends with anyone. He seems to always mess things up. You see, in the buggy bug world of this movie, ants collect food over the seasons to feed to the greedy and bullying grasshoppers, lead by the menacing Hopper (Kevin Spacey). When Flik messes up, Hopper commands the ants to give him and his gang twice as much food as before or they'll be tearing up Ant Island. Commanded by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Flik journeys across the world of insects and finally comes along with a gang of circus bugs. However, will these circus bugs be any help the army of grasshoppers?The film is probably more visually-impressive than Pixar's previous Toy Story was never reaches the brilliant animation of Finding Nemo. The facial animation particularly is amazing compared to first Toy movie. It didn't seem so much like computer animation than a fully-realized world. Even the backdrops and set animation was a joy to look at. Bug's Life has a little more freedom than Toy Story in terms of animation simply because of it's setting. This movie unravels a world, much like the other Pixar films, where anything is possible. It just has a lot more to do, being in the open earth instead of being stuck in a kid's bedroom.The film's main problem is that it just isn't as imaginative as Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. or even the splashy fish tale Finding Nemo. There is a joyful little scene where Flik searches a bug city of gigantic proportions (for us, minature proportions) for warrior bugs to lend a hand against the grasshoppers. This scene is probably the best that appears. Bugs of every shape and size (even a towering spider) move and act like in a normal city, buildings being replaced by cracker boxes and empty pop bottles. Even a tin can acts as a bug bar. This, however, is the only scene bursting with imagination, on the other hand Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 2 have millions of sequences full of wit. Much of the movie features ants and the group of circus bugs. Finding Nemo has countless new things to look at in every scene.However, it still is Pixar, it still is a marvel of pacing and is still a marvel of beauty. When Pixar creates a movie, the movie is sure to be an instant classic, and A Bug's Life is no exception. Much like Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, Pixar cranks out masterpieces like first-class restaurants dish out food. It comes so quick and the meal is so nourishing and delicious that you're just craving more. Hopefully this studio has another twenty or thirty films in need of releasing. Sooner or later Pixar will notice that Disney are only the training wheels and when they're ready, they'll be hammering them to the ground. Nowadays, Disney's films are a bit more forgetable yet Pixar's are bursting with classical magic, much like Disney in their golden years. Let's just hope they stay forever.",,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacular yet Sophomoric Second Attempt,"Wow... this film was a big disappointment. Yes, Pixar is the vanguard of companies producing computer-generated feature films; A Bug's Life is one of the most visually stimulating, unreal yet real animated films I have ever seen.  Kevin Spacey's Hopper crackled with  intensity and I was sure he was actually taking up space on the screen. The bird was far more terrifying than any other villain - it was simply a mindless killer, a mechanical crusher of dreams. (Watch the 'bloopers' at the end for a nod to Jaws)I would have, however, preferred to have watched A Bug's Life without sound.  Every character was a clichè and I think the plot was lifted from an old episode of Three's Company.  Why bother with that sort of limp, trite trash when I can flip on the Idiot box and watch 24 hours of the same?As in ANTZ, the main characters lack any charisma.... Sure, in an attempt to keep the story somewhat plausible the ants are all identical, but as in Toy Story, the most entertaining characters were those marginally associated or appearing late in the story : the boozing, rat-racing bugs of the city and the neurotic circus rejects.At least there was no Sharon Stone in this one.Finally, I'd like to add a question. Who are these wild, slave bugs/animals we see in every disney feature since 1930?  The insane, rabid grasshopper- is there no explanation for why he is a drooling, snarling beast among fun loving layabouts?  And P.T. Flea's Centipedes?  Are they at least paid? It's an outrage!

Disappointing follow-up to Toy Story,"With all the hype surrounding A Bug's Life and the phenomenal success of Toy Story, I had pretty high expectations for A Bug's Life.It is inevitable that A Bug's Life is going to be compared to Antz, the animated Woody Allen vehicle which came out a couple of months before. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed Antz more. Animation aside, the stories are amazingly similar: underdog ant triupmphs and saves the day! While the  story line of Antz was engaging, A Bug's Life seemed just a little too predictable. Both stories are thinly veiled morality tales but A Bug's Life is practically transparent. The characters aren't as well developed and the plot is rather weak.Unlike Toy Story which was driven by the excellent plot, and featured the most amazing computer animation ever to hit the big screen, A Bug's Life seemed to be driven by the animation. And as everybody knows whose seen a sci-fi flick that has an over-reliance on special effects, the effects just can't carry the movie. The same can be said of animation. While the animation in A Bug's Life is excellent-despite the over-use of pastel colors to depict the ants-the story lags behind. Not only that, it doesn't have the same cross-over appeal as Toy Story. That is, it seems to appeal more to children than adults, in contrast to Toy Story which appealed just as much to all ages.I went to see the film with the same friend that I'd seen Antz with. Going into the film she was ready to buy stock in Pixar. She also guessed that she'd probably want to see the film more than once. When we walked out, she decided that once was enough after all, and that left over change was going to be invested somewhere else besides Pixar. Sorry Steve. Apple's looking like a better investment at this point!",,Anonymous,Animation

Make sure and sit through the credits, there are some great ""out takes"", for the adults this will be one of the funniest parts.",,Anonymous,Animation
Xtreme cool,"Even though A Bugs Life got a half star less than Antz I like it better because it is funnier in my opinion (comedy movies are my favorite). At the beginning of the movie Flik (main character) caused the grain to fall in a creek and the ants did not have enough food for the grasshoppers. Their leader Hopper gave the ants until ""the last leaf fell"" to get ""double the order of food"". I enjoy to watch Fliks adventure to find ""warrior"" bugs to fight the grasshoppers and save the ants. Unfortunately Flik came back to ""Ant Island"" and with circus bugs. They were a combination of insects like a Lady Bug (Francis) a Black Widow Spider (Rosie), and others. Flik found out about this misunderstanding and the circus bugs were about to leave but when they saved Dot (Queen Ants little daughter) they decided to stay. About half way through the movie Flik and Princess Atta fall in love (that was cool). Flik comes up with another plan to build a bird (Hopper is afraid of birds) and scare Hopper and the rest of the grasshoppers away. Soon after the bird was complete all the other ants find out the truth about the ""circus bugs"" (because of P.T. Fleas big mouth) and Princess Atta orders Flik to leave and never return. Flik was sad but he and the circus bugs came back to the Ant Island when Dot told flik that Hopper was going to kill the Queen Ant (the grasshoppers came back to Ant Island and the ants did not have enough food). When Flik came back and put the built bird plan to action it scared off all of the grasshoppers except Hopper who found out that the bird was fake. He went after Flik in a rage. When Princess Atta took Flik away from Hopper they ended up right by a birds nest. That was the final showdown between Flik and Hopper. Lets just say that Hopper got fed to three baby birds. In the end the circus bugs returned to the circus, Flik and Princess Atta are together, and everybody live happily ever after. I enjoy to laugh and watch the all the adventure in A Bugs Life and I never get bored of it!",,Anonymous,Animation
A true gem!,"I am not a big Disney fan, especially with the last few movies it has given us. So needless to say I was not expecting much when I sat down to see A Bug's Life. Boy was I surprised! I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at an animated movie! The voice talents in the movie were amazing, Dennis Leary was great as Francis the ladybug, and the character of Heimlich the caterpillar, was hysterical! This movie truly is a movie for all ages. The animation is amazing and the story is creative. And you don't have to be 5 to enjoy the jokes. Definitely one of Disney's finest!",,Anonymous,Animation
The best thing I've seen all Year....,"I took my teen daughter to this, knowing how we had enjoyed Toy Story in 1995, expecting to be disappointed in a sophomore effort. This is better than story, not only because of the advance animation but the inside jokes and the adult humor, i.e humor that only adults will get. If you leave before the credits you will miss some of the best stuff, especially when Flik is ready to fly on the dandelion. All the voice actors were marvelous, especially David Hyde Pierce and Phyllis Diller(too funny), Dave Foley and Kevin Spacey, with special kudos to Richard Kind....

Cute Bugs????,"I admit I hesistated in seeing a film about bugs, since I loathe (and dispensed)many of them, but let Disney animators put a pair of huge eyes, a wide smile and brightly color species of the bug kingdom and you get a plethora of cute-looking, talking Circus bugs, and a blue ant colony with just 4 appendages.  Oh well, it's Hollywood, it doesn't have to make sense. When I finally saw it, I bought the DVD.  As with many Disney films, the sidekicks are often more interesting than the main character, and I truly enjoyed watching the luckless Circus bugs meander throughout the movie (the gibberish speaking Tuck & Roll, really were funny).   If you've seen enough Disney movies, than you know most of the plot structure is formulaic, and the villains often meet their demise in the rain.  This one is no exception. What you do get is that little bonus at the end of the film, that's clever in every respect.",,Anonymous,Animation

Lively Winner,"Yes, as you've probably heard A Bug's Life is heaps more entertaining than its rival Antz.A Bug's Life is themed in a similar way to Antz with a misfit ant saving the colony from threat but Antz is a self conscious Manhattan political whinge whereas A Bug's Life is bright and just funny, in the full Disney tradition. A Bug's Life is a great film to take the children to, or perhaps to even attend by yourself, without having to leave half way through to take the tyke to the toilet or to get the little bugger more popcorn.A Bug's Life was made by the same mob who brought us the amazing Toy Story; amazing from a technical point of view anyway. I'm no expert on animation but it appears that matt, painted backgrounds were often used in A Bug's Life, whereas all of the backgrounds were digitally produced in Toy Story, which must have been hellishly expensive.Antz also has a glossier, more exquisite look to it than A Bug's Life, but we all know that some of the funniest stuff on film has been pretty roughly produced. Remember those great old Chaplin or Keaton films. Technology can't compensate for poor actors or a lousy script. And slapstick will win out more often than more sophisticated humour.Our hero ant in A Bug's Life is a crazy inventor who heads off to bug city to get some help to fight off some stand over grasshoppers. In the tradition of The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven he brings back warriors to help the  folks back home out but he's unfortunately  picked a no hope band of travelling entertainer bugs, thinking that they are the bee's knees at fighting. And yes that is Phyllis Diller's voicing the Queen.Of course the good blokes and sheilas win out, the colony is saved from the grasshoppers and it's a lot of fun along the way. A Bug's Life is inventive, lively and often downright funny. It's a top notch Disney cartoon comedy.",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Pixar Animation Studio has produced another classic film for kids and grown-ups alike!,"If there is even a sliver of kid in you at all, you are going to love ""A Bugs Life"". It is every bit an equal to ANTZ but is a little more geared to children. Even so, I'm 58 and loved every minute of it. Special credit goes to Kevin Spacy who IS Hopper, the head grasshopper out to blackmail a colony of gentle ants. Dave Foley as Flik, Julia Louis Dreyfus as princess Atta, Phyllis Diller as Queen,and Edie McClurg as Dr. Flora. All the characters were absolutely enchanting created with state of the art animation that will amaze you. Take your children for sure. If you don't have children, take yourself as soon as possible. Oh, and stay for the credits at the end. You will experience a surprise and maybe a first. You will also enjoy Randy Newman's theme song after the end of the movie.What more could a movie-goer want??",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not great","Of course, comparison between this film and the superior (my opinion) Antz is inevitable, but I think other than the fact that they're computer animated and have to do with ants, they have very little in common. They're completely different stories, if Antz is Metropolis, this film is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven if you prefer).  Not to say this film is a Seven Samurai remake, other than the concept of a besiged village hiring warriors, it really doesn't have anything in common with Kurosawa's film.I really did like the fact that Antz was PG, and had an ""edge"" to it, I'm really glad that people are starting to see that animation need not be just for kids, in Europe and Japan, this is not a new idea.  A Bug's Life is much more of a kid's film by comparison, but that didn't keep me from liking it. I do have some complaints though, I didn't find Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) to be a very strong lead character, I thought Woody Allen's Z was a much better lead.  Another thing I didn't like was the character designs, much too ""cute"".  Why are the ants blue?  I have never seen a blue ant, or a four-legged one (actually, these are more two-armed, two-legged).  The world of Antz had a real sense of danger to it, that I think was only hinted at in this film.Technically, the film is flawless, I think the quality of the animation is one area where Antz and this film may tie.  The animation in this film is very good, some of the characters almost look more like very smooth claymation than CGI.  I think computer animation really does it's job when you don't think about it coming from a computer, and I had moments of that feeling watching this film.  As to be expected from a digital-to-digital transfer, the DVD looks beautiful.  The two sets of ""outtakes"" during the end credits are pretty clever, if you watch the film for the first time on DVD, watch the movie before you watch they outtakes, they're funnier that way.  The short ""Geri's Game"" that precedes the film is a real gem, too (I enjoyed Geri's cameo appearance in Toy Story II).This film is definately worth seeing if you're a fan of computer animation, but don't expect Antz, I really wish the two films had been released further apart.  Also, if you like insect movies, also check out the French documentary Microcosmos.",,Anonymous,Animation

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie I actually wanted to clap for and this fit the bill.  We have all talked about seeing it again to catch the new ""bloopers"" at the end.

"French ""Bug"" Film as a source for ""A Bug's Life?""","Years ago, my brother showed me a video of insects at work, made by a French cinematographer, that seemed very much to be the source of study for much of the Pixar animation in A Bug's Life. The video was accompanied by a lovely, appropriate classical soundtrack. I was amazed at the skill involved and the way it related to the animated story developed by Pixar.Is this film on the market? Does anyone know the title or who shot the footage? It was really beautiful, and was a perfect accompaniment for the excellent A Bug's Life. I am bug-phobic, but it made me wish I had studied entomology !",,Anonymous,Animation
Several big pluses but a few minuses,"In the battle of the Bugz, I preferred this Pixar/Disney version to the weightier, more adult Antz.  Antz seemed to be reaching too far to be sardonic, whereas A Bug's Life is lighter and the conflict within less pretentious.A Bug's Life succeeds at almost everything it does.  The animation is gorgeous, and the characterizations are wonderful. Aside from the German caterpillar, who thankfully isn't overplayed, the circus performers are a hilarious group, totally dysfunctional but memorable.  And John Ratzenberger as PT Flea has a voice that begs to be used in animated films. David Foley's Flik is a bit bland, and it's not easy to become involved in his fate.  He's earnest, but the wackiness of the character never really comes across.  Some of the comic pieces, especially the pageant for the warriors done by the ant second graders and the circus performance of 'flaming death' absolutely slew me.  The depiction of the bug city to which Flik journeys to find the warrior bugs is worth the price of admission on its own.  The film is full of wonderful throwaway lines and scenes that kept me interested and entertained.If the film has a weakness, it is that the grasshoppers just don't seem that threatening.  Deep down I continued to wonder why the ants just didn't do away with them.  They work their butts off to pick food for the grasshoppers when it is apparent that they should simply fight them off.  I also agreed with the grasshoppers who didn't want to go back to Ant Island from Mexico: it didn't seem necessary.  I think more needed to have been made of this conflict, and that the grasshoppers should have been played less for laughs. Kevin Spacey as Hopper just never comes across as sufficiently evil.I gave it 8 out of 10, which is a bit generous for this film, but I liked it in spite of its flaws.  Lovely animation, and you can even forget the anatomic mistake of four-legged ants.",,Anonymous,Animation
An all-star cast of voices contributes to this wonderful animated film!,"This is one film that everyone in the family or in the dorm can agree on seeing.  If the cast of voices (Julia Louis- Dreyfuss, Kevin Spacey, Phyllis Diller, David Hyde-Pierce, John Ratzenberger, and more) doesn't attract you, the amazing computer animation surely will.Not only are the animation and voices great, but the writing is too.Ironically, my favorite part of the film comes after the end credits with the hilarious computer-generated out takes.  So don't hit rewind as soon as THE END pops up!  You'll miss a real treat!In conclusion, this film does exactly what Flik hopes to do, makes a difference, that is, in cinematic comedy.",,Anonymous,Animation
Ho-hum,"I was invited to see this movie with my half-sister and her son.  I decided to go but I wasn't that crazy about the movie at first.  Not to say I was prejudiced from the start.  I love kids movies if they are done right and have a little depth to them.  I also like special effects movies if there is a worthwhile plot.Still, I was pretty underwhelmed by this movie.  I did not like the characters very much.  I love Dave Foley in Newsradio and the casting of him as an ant was pretty straight on.  Still there weren't any interesting facets to his character.  The smallest princess ant was very annoying. There is also something about the way their faces move.  I keep hearing that this film was such a landmark in computer animation.  That may be true but the characters still looked like lifeless puppets.  That could have been forgiven if the plot was worthwhile.  It lagged all the way.  The whole idea of a circus of bugs wasn't that interesting.  It was just an excuse to bring in some of the more exotic type insects.I do admit that the movie looked good, but it was all overly pastel and Disney styled.  Leave the movie before the ""outtakes"" start.  Outtakes are very tricky.  Sometimes they can be funny.  Most of the time they are the sort of ""you had to be there"" type funny.  I have never managed to laugh when seeing an outtake of someone forgetting their lines.  ""Oh, funny, you forgot your lines, ha ha""  What's worse, A Bug's Life adds fake outtakes at the end.  What a lame idea!In closing, your kids will love this movie.  It's got pretty colors and occasionally breathtaking scenes, but this is all just wallpaper.  It lacks energy and imagination.  You will be yawning by the second or third time your kid asks to see it.",,Anonymous,Animation

"A tremendous movie about heart, bravery, and courage","This animated feature about ants, grasshoppers, and various other bugs is a testament of never giving up despite the odds. The story begins as Flick, voiced by Dave Foley, the ant who always invents things one right after the other. After the grasshoppers come to invade the food supply, Flick comes up with the idea of getting warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Not only will this idea give Flick respect it will allow him to get redemption as he has messed his prior invention up. This epic journey starts as Flick goes in search of the warrior bugs; he finds them in Circus bugs. Consumed for Princess Atta, voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfuss, and her approval, Flick hides the fact that these ""warriors"" are in fact circus bugs. I was smiling throughout this film because it was the one of the best animated features I've seen; in addition, this film far eclipses ANTZ because unlike ANTZ this film has a point, storyline, and direction. I recommend this movie because it allows the mind to sit down and relax and without tension watch the movie in peace. The ending is no surprise as far as the typical ending goes, but this is definitely a delight worth seeing on the big screen.",,Anonymous,Animation

Mmmm.,"Ok, the movie is not bad. It´s not great, however.From the various user-comments it seems everybody was knocked out by the closing sequences, or ""out-takes"". I found these scenes funny, tongue-in-cheek and rather ground-breaking. (The idea that some of the figures could have been made of cardboard is absolutely nuts!) But why wasn´t this freshness actually IN the movie? This puzzles me, as I think it is probably the result of working for Disney. Feels if the animators were a bit frustrated with the standard result.Disney´s products tend to take themselves too seriously. This element was needed to set this film apart from just a ""normal"" Disney production.Lasseter´s previous, pre-Disney stuff had this element.

Given a temporary reprieve by the grasshoppers, the ants agree to Flik's plan to find ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppersFlik actually believes the plan, while the other ants see it as effectively exiling Flik.And right there when Flick starts a travel we start on a journey of animation for fun not just for kids but it's also a fun for many adults! I read some negative reviews here on IMDb on grounds that this animation is not entertaining for adults.Well I disagree.Maybe it's based on a cliché: The good beats the bad. Maybe it's a retelling of Aesop's fable of The Ant and the Grasshopper.But still the animations have a great artistic value.And I really liked it.

"Well, It Sort of Grew On Me..","The first time I saw A Bugs Life was at the cinema and I came out thinking the film was absolutely terrible. But, I have to say, since then I have seen some pretty impressive reviews so I thought I would give it another go. I have to admit, it sort of grew on me, I really liked the idea and the CGI's and Cinematography where excellent. But, sometimes this film is a little bit slow, typical and quite boring.A little while ago I would of given A Bugs Life 1 out of 10, so consider this rating quite generous.Rating: 6",,Anonymous,Animation
Good for everybody.,"A Bug's Life does not have a good plot as Toy Story 1 or 2. Kids and adults will like the animation of the movie, and the simple story about a horde of grasshoppers of freeloading on the ants. The ants need help defend their colony and Flik hires flea circus performers to help. The first Pixar to feature hilarious outtakes at the end of the film.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Watchable children's animation, weak story but colorful visuals","I disliked this film on first viewing but repeat viewings have made me change my mind. It's not without it's share of flaws but is still quite watchable. The film caters to a younger audience than 'Antz'. There are bright colors and the animation is spectacular at times. The story is lifted from 'Seven Samurai', something which was a turn-off for me on first viewing. However, it does have some subtle humor and the closing credits alone are almost worth the price of admission. The film is slow to start and the pace slightly uneven. The last hour is a lot of fun as the pace picks up. Watchable.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,Animation
The Seven Samurai -- a very small or very big remake,Of course the animation and the dialog are everything that you expect out of Pixar.  And this time they took no chances with the plot.  It's kind of fun trying to decide which of the actor bugs are which character out of The Magnificent Seven.,,Anonymous,Animation
A great takeoff on The Magnificent Seven,"I have seen this little Pixar gem several times, and it always seemed as if I'd seen it before.  Then it struck me:  this is a very clever and entertaining redux of The Magnificant Seven.The script is clever, the animation is pure Pixar, the action flows well, and the ""out takes"" are terrific.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, magical and yet another hit for Disney...","I also was fortunate enough to see an advance screening of this film last Friday morning in Philadelphia.  It captures all the necessary magic to making this another big surprise for Disney in the tradition of Aladdin, The Lion King and Toy Story.  It is a whole lot of fun to watch.  Stay for the credits!  You won't regret it!",,Anonymous,Animation
Technology does not replace story...,"I studied film and animation in the post secondary level. I have been working as an animator and designer for the last few years. With my experience, I will honestly say the film had some good animation. Computer generated or not. But, animation does not replace story.Story and animation is what PIXAR does best. Not here. Here we see another sugar coated Disney flick with no strong characters, no tension, and no timing.It's insanely simple plot puts those Teletubbies to shame. There was about 10 too many main characters in the film and the design style was based around plastic molds for merchandising more than bugs for storytelling.I am a big fan of PIXAR. Since I saw Luxo Jr. open ""Basic Instinct"" about 6 years ago, I have been pulling for them. When they landed the deal with Disney, I was ecstatic for both. Now Pixar had the distribution Disney could offer and Disney has the stories and characters Pixar can offer.Never happened. Here we are 2 films into a 5 film contract with Disney and it is the worst animated film I have seen in years.For God's Sakes Disney, Please, Please, spend a little more time on the script!Fat sidekicks, villains that are evil for the sake of it and  semi-liberated Barbie doll princesses are not good story crutches, let alone devises.1 buck (and that's only because they spared us with no songs) out of 8p.s., the only time PIXAR's talents showed up in this film was during the credits. Inspired, intelligent and funny. Too bad they sold out the first hour and a half of the film.",,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute must for all ages,"What a rare treat! This is probably the only film I have ever seen that I honestly cannot criticise! I realise this sounds like a foolish, naive splutter from a fanatic of cute Disney, but let me tell you I am not!! I've only recently been introduced to the world of Disney animation, and I must admit I can't believe I've missed out all these years. But Disney will only ever be the best at doing one thing - being Disney. In that sense it is unique, but in such a manufactured world as Disney, there will always be flaws. Or so I thought...A BUG'S LIFE is an absolute marvel. You will soon cease to be amazed by the fantastic animation, simply because you will completely believe it as reality - it's that good. The many  characters are marvellously introduced and developed, with good performances from every actor - thank you Kevin Spacey - is there anything you can't do?????? The score is perfect, the set pieces are ingenious, and the script is one of the funniest I have heard for a long time.Anyway, I have finally run out of superlatives, so there is nothing more to say but ""Go see it!"". This is a true modern masterpiece which will appeal to the whole world - thank you Disney!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
What a great film!,"Although this is classified as a ""kids"" movie, I also found it very funny and well thought out. The animation is of the highest order and is used to help tell the story instead of just for show. Overall, a very visual, funny and well animated family film. I recommend that everyone see it!",,Anonymous,Animation
