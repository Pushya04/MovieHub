Another Oscar worthy turn from DiCaprio,"Leonardo DiCaprio has become one of the premiere American actors. With a set of natural instincts that lends a non-showy, believable quality to all of his performances, versatility, and movie star size charisma that fills up the screen and emotionally hooks the viewer into his character and story, it is hard to think of another male American actor (with the exception of Johnny Depp) who is consistently giving an audience its money worth; these two gentleman have taken the reins from Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, as those two Oscar-winning future legends of the silver screen gracefully age into more mature roles.In Blood Diamond, it is Mr. DiCaprio's performance that raises this film above it's standard Hollywood fare of a script (although it is a solid script) into something memorable. His performance here as an opportunistic diamond smuggler equals that of the one he gave earlier in the fall as ""Billy Costigan"" in The Departed, although the two characters couldn't be more different from each other. It may be his best performance yet, and in terms of sheer charisma and memorability it certainly rivals his mega-star making performance as ""Jack Dawson"" in Titanic.I liked Blood Diamond a great deal, but do not think it is a great film. A good movie? Yes. Very mainstream and formulaic, but it is raised up quite a bit by DiCaprio's character and his terrific realization of it. If I had read this script beforehand, I never would have thought of Leo for this role- possibly George Clooney or some other star known for ""roguish charm,"" but not Leo. But now, having seen it, I can't imagine anybody else as ""Danny Archer;"" it is a fully realized, winning performance.Mr. Hounsou was wonderful as well, and I liked the chemistry between the two men in their scenes together. He was able to make the audience feel the gamut of emotions his character experiences during the course of the movie- pride and hope, fear, outrage, resignation, mistrust, desperation, and determination, and beautifully rises above the somewhat limiting way his role was written.I thought Ms. Connelly did as good a job as possible in her role as ""the idealistic journalist who wants to make a difference."" Her part was just a larger version of Joaquin Phoenix's in Hotel Rwanda. As always, I find she brings a certain dignity and intelligence to her performances and does not allow her incredible beauty to overshadow her acting. I thought she and Leo worked wonderfully together, as well, and along with Mr. Hounsou they make an engaging trio you can't help rooting for.In comparing it to other recent films about Africa, I didn't think this was quite as good as as Hotel Rwanda, but better than The Interpreter, The Constant Gardener, and The Last King of Scotland. I felt an emotional engagement with the characters I didn't experience in the latter three films. I found the script allowed my care for the characters to grow as the story progressed, and was not overly manipulative. At times it veered too much into standard action movie territory, with much violence and many ""close calls"" but would then be brought back into the realm of compelling human drama by a wonderfully acted, intimate scene.After reading some early negative comments, I was pleasantly surprised at my response to it. Compelling characters and the skillful use of a truly gripping global issue as the plot line make this a satisfying viewing experience- one that I would happily see again.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Hollywood movies tells an African story full of death and violence and presents it with impressive truth.,"Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Ripped From the Headlines, the Nearly True Story of Diamonds","In Sierra Leone, there exists diamonds worth a fair amount of money. But they are harvested by slaves and sold to fund genocide. This is the story of one of those slaves, a diamond smuggler (with connections to Belgium, England, And Liberia) and a journalist. Together, they will fight to win a story, a diamond and a family. But sacrifices will be made.We have an amazing cast, so let me just get them out of the way -- Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer, Djimon Hounsou as native African Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen. DiCaprio rarely makes bad films, and my unending praise for Connelly is seen in a variety of reviews I've written... this film will be no exception to her glowing track record.This film has action, suspense and a good story to tell. Like ""The Insider"" (or whatever the tobacco movie is called), this exposes how diamonds come to be on the market. I'd like to say things have improved since the time period shown here (1990s) but I don't know if I believe that. I appreciate the honest portrayal here, not shying away from the violence or the horrible conditions the children go through. Humor is absent, and even romance (which would be so easy to add in) is never at the front of the story.I don't know how to sell this film other than that: if you care about world events, or care about the fate of innocent people ,you'll care about this movie. Even if you don't want this to be that heavy and just take it as entertainment (which it is on some levels), I think you'll still enjoy it (Jennifer Connelly!). Wish I could say more, but it's a cut and dry case: great movie, worth seeing, check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"An action, political adventure at its best!","""Blood Diamond"" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...'The film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fieldsAccording to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil warDanny Archercrazy for diamonds like everybody elsebelieves this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent He is a smuggler, a former mercenary and weapons trader from Zimbabwe who bribes all, and supplies arms to both sides He gets Solomon Vandycaptured by government troopsout of jail only because he overhears that the fisherman might have found a clear massive stone about the size of a bird's eggVandyforced apart from his family and sent off to work as a slave in the minefieldshas hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle His son Dia is taking away by a brainwashing militia called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) turning him with lies, drugs, and liquor, into a cold-blooded murdererDanny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond The majority of the story is their journey across the war torn countryLeonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade On his trek to find the stone, Archer's eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self-profitDjimon Hounsou eventually realizes that Danny's connections and money are his only hope He plays a helpless character totally passionate as the resolving and fiercely determined father desperate to learn the fate of his familyConnelly is an idealist who wishes to display corruption She thinks that with Archer's help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover-up behind the diamond tradeIt is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond He's a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealerNominated for five Oscars, ""Blood Diamond"" is an action, political adventure at its best!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Diamonds, Nerve And Indifference","The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"" Don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
God left this place a long time ago.,"I have not been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I do like Djimon Hounsou and have seen several of his films. Watching this film, I have to say that both deserve every single award they received and should have probably gotten every award they were nominated for. I only hesitate to state this unequivocally because I have not seen The Last King of Scotland yet.This story needed to be told and I cannot imagine anyone telling it better that DiCaprio and Hounsou in the extremely capable hands of Edward Zwick, working with an outstanding script by Charles Leavitt.The story was tender, exciting, awesome, and, at times, just plain disgusting. The fact that there are countries that brainwash children and turn them against their parents and make killers out of them is inexcusable. The fact that these people are operating today is a blot of shame on all so-called civilized nations, including my own.This is our homeland. All humans came from this soil. What we allow to happen there in the name of beauty is disgusting.I cannot imagine anyone not owning this movie so as to watch it many times and remind ourselves that if we are not part of the solution to this problem, we share some of the blame for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Undeniably Powerful And Breathtaking Film,"An undeniably powerful and breathtaking film from talented director Edward Zwick. 'Blood Diamond' is a beautifully shot war thriller set against the backdrop of the Sierra Leone civil war, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in their Oscar-nominated roles. By far one of the best war dramas of modern times, 'Blood Diamond' is a powerful testament in the film industry boasting intense and well-executed action scenes and heart-wrenching drama. Zwick's vision truly outpaces his narrative in this compulsive and thought-provoking tale. An exciting and compelling tale, that stand as a great acting showcase for the two leads.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Overlong although touching and clever film with action,violence and drama","1990 ,Sierra Leona,this is the story of Danny Archer(Leonardo DiCaprio),an ex-mercenary and nowadays diamonds smuggler and a fisherman named Salomon(Dijimon Honsou),besides a reporter named Maggie(Jennifer Connelly).Meantime Danny is prisoned for smuggling ,he learns that the fisherman was forced to quest of diamonds and he hid a giant hot rock.He was kidnapped and removed his family and then their fates become jointed when the two men embark on a dangerous mission throughout enemy lines.They confront perils and risks with imposing tension,action,violence to save his family and retrieve the rough stone,but they find themselves on a collision course with another groups to encounter the marvellous jewell: The revolutionaries forces and the cruel colonel(Arnold Vosloo) who also want to claim.The film displays a political denounce about the countries' indifference to preventing the civil war and horrible genocide and ambition of businessmen on diamonds smuggling.The movie gets an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations and international community(exception by the Ambassador played by Stephen Collins) and the abandon of foreign policy.Thus, a personage says that origin conflict is for apartheid policy realized by Belgian and the King Leopold(like in Hotel Rwanda).The film has lots of action,fast pace,emotional drama,romance and touching scenes.Exceptional performances by its entire cast with special mention by nominated to Oscar,Dijimon Honsou(Amistad,Gladiator).Atmospheric,colorful cinematography by Eduardo Serra(The earring pearl girl).Sensible,perceptible and sometimes spectacular musical score by James Newton Howard.The motion picture is well directed by Edward Zwick(Glory,The last Samuray).The picture combines action,intrigue,violence,historical backdrop,based on real events.The movie contains exciting and violent scenes like is the breathtaking battle when the military revolutionaries going into the capital Freetown with blood and fire ,including rampage,ravage and indiscriminate massacre.The film will like to Leonardo DiCaprio fans containing numerous scenes have you on the edge of your seat.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
T.I.A.---------- This Is Africa,"One of the best films of the new century so far, Blood Diamond is both great action entertainment and a searing indictment of the exploitation of the African continent even years after the imperial European powers left their colonial possessions to fend for themselves. Africa, a continent wealthy in mineral resources with its peoples reduced to poverty at the mercy of tribal rivalries now armed with the automatic weapons of the former imperialists.By the title you guess that what people are after are diamonds which is a trade to be sure that has its international regulations. It also has people willing to skirt and ignore those regulations in pursuit of the almighty profit. The brokers be they in London, New York, or Amsterdam pay plenty of money under the table for the gems which then finance various 'revolutionary' groups who have this game going with the governments. They don't really want to take power as Leonardo DiCaprio explains to journalist Jennifer Connelly because then they'd have to govern the country. Better just to keep the revolution going, get bought off until the rulers get rich enough and just go into exile and the revolutionaries are stuck with it. No Nelson Mandelas among this crowd. And the poor as typified by fisherman Djimon Hounsou suffer.Chance and happenstance throw Hounsou in jail with Leonardo DiCaprio, a mercenary. Hounsou found and buried a large diamond the size of a bird's egg. DiCaprio learns of it when they're in jail together and the two make an alliance of convenience when there is a rebel attack and they're freed from prison. The bulk of the story concerns the two of them trying to retrieve that diamond to get out of Africa and on to a more settled life in Europe and/or America.DiCaprio and Hounsou were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. In different categories to be sure so they would not kill each other off in the voting. Sad to say neither of them won and that is a pity because I think they both deserved it.Hounsou is best known as the slave leader Cinque who overtook the crew of the Amistad in that film and he also got an Oscar nomination for that film. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, for me this is the best film he's been in so far in his career. His character is absolutely flawless.DiCaprio is from Rhodesia and lest one thing that whites did not suffer in the changing sub Saharan Africa of the last half of the last century when he tells his story to Jennifer Connelly, you will graphically realize why DiCaprio is the hard case he is. After about five or six generations of settlers there, DiCaprio felt Africa was his home as well. You will empathize with that point of view after that scene.Blood Diamond got Oscar nominations for Sound and for Film Editing. Sadly it did not win anything that year. And it is beyond belief it was not considered for Best Picture.There's enough action to satisfy those fans, but the real essence of Blood Diamond is the story it tells both of an exploited Africa and of the alliance/friendship of DiCaprio and Hounsou. Don't miss this one at all.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Constant Gardener dumbed down to jungle adventure level,"There is quiet intensity and explosive intensity. I was going to say that 'Blood Diamond' makes no pretense about subscribing to the latter, but the fact is that it does. On the one hand, it treats heavy, salient issues like diamond trade and the trafficking of child-soldiers in Africa, even including a few lines of warning in the credits, but on the other hand it is structured and executed like a generic adventure treasure hunt. It cannot decide what it wants to be, and regrettably botches through both paths.Set against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990's Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond follows Rhodesian mercenary (oooh, scary!) Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio), Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) on a quest to find a rare pink diamond that Solomon first found when he was forced to work in the diamond fields. It intertwines bouts of blood-soaked encounters with child-soldiers, one of which is Solomon's own son that has been taken from him, and with emotional blackmail it cues us in to feel for the miserable conditions in Africa and the venality with which things are run.The problem is that every slightly serious sceneevery momentis interrupted by some loud explosion, gun violence or shouting and sometimes all three. This is irritating in the film and it suggests two things: the script is unbearably lazy and sees action galore as a plot device and way to avoid writing the end of 'difficult' scenes with conversation or character development or 'Blood Diamond' tells us that we should not take it seriously and just treat it as any run-of-the-mill action-adventure. The problem with this is that it lacks the charm and sparkle in the eye of 'Indiana Jones', and Dicaprio is much too moody and unlikeable as a protagonist.I have not yet seen many of the Oscar nominated actors' performances, but Leonardo Dicaprio's interpretation of the hard-boiled mercenary is the least deserving so far. It baffles me that such an action-oriented adventure with such a testosterone-fuelled lead could snag nominations with the drama-favouring academy, and I suspect this is solely because of its hazy political core. In comparison, Dicaprio is like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale but without the serious, emotional scenes. Apparently his South African accent is fairly in-tune, according to South Africans, but it seems uneven, exaggerated and varying in pronunciation to me.None of the other performances are noteworthy either. Djimon Hounsou, shouting does not a good performance make. Jennifer Connelly warms up slightly in her role, shifting from her usual emotionally numb and somber state to being a little smilier, but here she is at the mercy of an underwritten character and there are not many ways in which she can go. The supporting cast for 'Blood Diamond' may be rather one-dimensional caricatures of evil corporate white men and black hard-edged guerilla leaders with berets, but they serve their respective functions rather aptly, especially Michael Sheen's brief appearance. The only issue I have here is that African people speak broken English to each other. Even if they're from the same family.In the end, 'Blood Diamond' snags the 6 out of 10 from me. The cinematography is gorgeous with a screen that is awash with dramatic colours and shots, the action is fast-paced and exciting and the atmosphere is admirably gritty and visceral in the deep jungles of Africa. It features a ridiculous, two-faced mix between heavy-handed politics á la Constant Gardener and adrenaline-pumping action á la... any action film. It should in all theory be possible to join these two sides, and 'Blood Diamond' possesses all the necessary ingredients to do so, but no blender in which to stir it.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another fine piece by director Edward Zwick,"A few years back I had the pleasure of visiting Antwerp, Belgium, a place many deem ""the diamond capital of the world."" Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much ""bling"". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.The film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.Director/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in ""Glory"" a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film.Check out Blood Diamond, your ""bling"" may never look the same again.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Faithful to the Sierra Leone civil war, but just a small part of it, like Hotel Rwanda","I rate this a ten because I had the privilege of going to Sierra Leone after the war and participate in one of the war crimes trials there at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, created by the Sierra Leone government with the United Nations.In a bit more than two and a half hours, the writers and directors have to tell the story of the civil war, keep it concise yet true, and tell it through the eyes of a few participants. Because the story line is so true, and the acting, writing, directing, locations, people, and photography are all superior, I must admit prejudice toward such a high rating. My local reviewer gave it a B+.My exposure to the civil war and only some of the events of this movie were based on reading books, hundreds of witness statements, online material about the war, including the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Report, and listening to over 100 witnesses testify, and my trial was not even those of the RUF and AFRC, the really bad actors of the war, as the movie shows, pulling no punches. The accounts of atrocities are shockingly real. Tens of thousands had hands amputated, people were indiscriminately murdered, women raped or forced to marry, villages were burned, and children were kidnapped and forced to fight the war for both of the rebel factions (RUF and AFRC). Making a child a soldier is a war crime, and this movie artfully shows you why, without saying a word about it.Sherman said, about our own Civil War, that ""War is hell."" But, African civil war is far different and atrocious because it inevitably leads to atrocities.This fine work, with Hotel Rwanda, stands out as a film seriously attempting to explain the atrocities that Africans somehow can do to themselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Brothers,"What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth. Terminator 2 and The Matrix are such movies, and so is Blood Diamond. It is full of characterizations we've seen before, but it's the interaction that raises this film above the masses. Each character has an agenda that forces him or her to distrust everyone else. The paths that some relationships take to develop trust are believable, while others are equally believable in remaining eternally antagonistic. And through it all is the realization that while some characters may change their methodology and morals, none ever change their dreams. Each character fights for the goal to the bitter end. Such is human nature, and such is the conflict of Blood Diamond, the conflict of Africa. In the end, we are left to wonder if peace can ever be attained in such a world. And somehow we are left believing that maybe it can.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A must watch,"This film tells the story of two young men who are involved in the diamond trade, one willingly and the other one reluctantly.""Blood Diamond""is a tough film to watch. There are many scenes portraying monstrous atrocities that are so disturbing. I can hardly believe that in some countries the political situation it's do unstable that people just drive around with machine guns, killing innocent citizens whenever they want to. The country and the economy cannot develop under those circumstances. It's horrifyingly sad to see such things happening, and it's even more sad to see such crimes against humanity is fuelled by people's demand for diamonds. Diamonds have such a noble image that no one could even imagine how dark the origin of the gem is.The film is well made, the script is engaging and the pacing is tight.

Wow were they DEAD WRONG! The movie delivers everything it should have and more. I like going into a movie and being entertained and learning something at the same time, especially at the ridiculous costs of tickets now days. I must say the movie was graphic at times but I think it needed to be in order to get the point across so if you have trouble watching terrible things happen to people including children then I wouldn't recommend this movie. Overall I hope this movie gets some nods when it comes around to Oscar time, Leo deserves a nod for sure whether it be from this movie or from The Departed.

Well, because I am not much of a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio's work, and thus never saw any reason for taking the time to sit down and watch this movie, not before yesterday when I happened to come across it showing on TV.I must admit that I have been missing out on something great here. This movie was actually quite good, and Leonardo is out of his usual boyish roles and do put on a great performance; and he even had the accent down quite well.Oddly enough that I never got around to seeing the movie, because I do like Jennifer Connelly, but I never knew that she had a role in the movie.The story in ""Blood Diamond"" is quite interesting, and it is captivating from the very beginning, and the story doesn't let you go before the movie comes to an end - an ending that was quite predictable, mind you. But what makes the story stand out so strongly is the realism and brutality of the storyline about the illegal diamond trade and mining.The cinematography and camera-work throughout the movie was superb, adding a sense of you being right there in it all to the movie. And that helped pump up the adrenaline throughout the action sequences, but also added to the majestic beauty of the African scenery.The acting performances were quite good, and especially hats off to Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou who carried the movie so graciously.I was more than genuinely surprised by this movie, and it is really a movie that is well worth watching.

Overly Preachy & Clichéd,"I was enjoying this very much when Jennifer Connelly entered the story and it began to go downhill after that, big-time. Hey, I always found her pretty fascinating and easy on the eyes, but she seems to play annoying, bitchy characters that I can't stand.Connelly's role isn't as obnoxious and unlikeable as she was her role in ""House Of Sand And Fog,"" but she's still moody, preachy, profane, sarcastic and too full of herself as she plays a journalist in the mode of some woman who thinks she's some great crusader. According to her, no one in the United States should ever buy a diamond ring for the fiancée/wife because they are akin to murderers if they do. This point is hammered several times and (1) is ludicrous; (2) unrealistic; (3) condescending to any audience of any intelligence.That's the trouble with the picture, as a whole: too preachy.We don't need points hammered home the way they are here, thinking us - the audience - is that stupid to get the messages the first or second time. The main characters are all movie cliché types - the greedy smuggler, Watergate-type journalist, brave African warrior, rich and uncaring white men running the operations, etc etc.In addition, Leonardo DiCaprio's accent is just not believable, perhaps because is something we aren't used to hearing from him. It may not be his fault, because he's a good actor, but it didn't click. The accent didn't sound right, and it became distracting. Conelley, as mentioned, is just super annoying, only there for her looks. Dimon Hounsou as ""Soloman Vandy"" overacted. Raising one's voice here and there and screaming doesn't make one a good actor.The cinematography was wonderful. This is nice-looking film which includes spectacular African scenery.

This movie will make you check a jewelery store and wonder if someone was killed over a diamond you've had your eyes on,"I just saw Blood Diamond and I didn't know what to expect, because when I saw the trailer, it just didn't look that exciting to me. I wasn't even sure what this was about, but after the Oscar nods it got and a fantastic review from my friend, I figured that I should check it out. I have to say that this film just broke my heart, it was so good, but so depressing. I never realized how brutal it was to go through these diamond mines, and men turning against their own brothers so quickly, it was so incredibly horrifying to watch and just utterly heart wrenching. But it was so well done and presented, the actors were just incredible and touched my heart, their stories were so uncomfortable and aching to witness, but just so inspirational.In Africa there is a huge civil war going on, the RUFF's are fighting to keep their diamonds and not hand them over to the government, even if it means destroying villages of their own kind and making men into slaves and turning young boys into brutal killing soldiers. Danny Archer has come to get a priceless diamond that a slave, Solomon, has hidden, Danny promises to help get Solomon's family back if Solomon gets the diamond and gives it to him. Solomon's heart breaks even further when he discovers that his son has been taken hostage to become a soldier and has been brainwashed to turn against his own father, but Danny's mind is only set on that diamond and will do whatever he can to get it.I loved Danny's character, Leonardo did such a fantastic job, Danny's heart was so cold in the beginning, but he did such a noble thing for Solomon and his son, but I won't give away what he did, this is a movie you have to see. It's a movie that will keep you thinking after it's finished, I can tell you one thing, I will never look at diamonds the same way again, this movie got under my skin, I think it will for you too.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not made to entertain,"Users keep using the word ""entertain"" in discussing this film, and I don't understand it simply because this movie was not meant to ""entertain."" Unlike many movies these days, it is meant to inform. Another claim I've read: ""If you can get past the violence, it is a great film."" Well here's a thought: you're not supposed to ""get past"" the violence. It is presented in such a way that makes us grateful for every second of our stupid American lives. If you want to be entertained, see Casino Royale. If you want to change the way you think about your own life, then see Blood Diamond. It will make you feel grateful for the life you live, and make your heart start pumping for the right reason. Blood Diamond will make you want to get involved in any organization that supports peacekeeping for conflicts like Sierra Leone.",,Anonymous,Drama
Wow. What a film,"So I remember watching this film years and years ago and enjoying it, but with a new found love and knowledge for films I am rewatching a lot of stuff and this popped up. And wow, it's just really good isn't it!!To start, from a film makers point of view, the story itself it great, you constantly want to know more and you're on the edge of your seat all the time. The characters layers, depth and arcs are honestly one of the best I've seen. There's so much more to all the main characters and it's rare you see that.The illustration of diamond smuggling and the civil war in Sierra Leone was great to see as it gave the whole situation attention and became noticed by a lot of people, myself included, that didn't really know anything about it. The element of truth in the movie hits really hard and it just adds so much more realism and emotion, which makes it a really compelling watch.Honestly if you haven't seen this film I massively recommend. Fantastic story, fantastic acting and fantastic everything else. It's really worth giving it a go!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
I'm really happy I met you.,"The year is 1999. Sierra Leone is in a state
of chaos with a war going on between the government military and the R. U. F. (revolutionary united front), a rebellious militia who spend their days terrorizing the people of their country, killing them and stealing their children to turn into soldiers for their cause. The R. U. F. Soldiers continuously say they are fighting to make their country better, but they are really just anarchists that are fighting to gain wealth/power.Soloman Vandy is a fisherman in a local
village who lives a quiet life with his wife, two daughters, and son. Soloman's son, Dia, loves soccer and reading. He goes to school everyday to learn in hopes of one day becoming a doctor. One day the RUF
attack the village, and capture Soloman
while his family escape. A few days later another troop of R. U. F. Soldiers find Soloman's family and take his boy Dia
from his mother and sisters.Danny Archer was born and raised in Zimbabwe. His family was killed when he
was a boy, and Danny found himself recruited as a child soldier. After growing up Danny spent time as a mercenary before getting into smugling guns.Maddy Bowen is a journalist who just can't help but want to live in a constant state of crisis.All three people find themselves brought together through a series of events happening within the war in Sierra Leone.This is not a happy movie to view, but it's really good!! The performances of Hounsou, DiCaprio, Connelly, and Harewood are exceptional 👌. I wonder if Hounsou studied acting before he became a model, cause I've always been impressed with him before, but he really deserved the recognition he got for this role (wonder who beat him out for those awards). Harewood was wonderfully evil in his performance. WoW! (I've only known him as Jon Jonz) DiCaprio and Connelly are incredible as always. I give this pic a 7.5 rating all the way!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Seriously under appreciated film,I seriously feel this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best role ever. He really should have won an Oscar for this particular movie roll overall. Been a fan forever and I like almost everything he does. But again I feel that this is his best and was under appreciated by most. He's not the only one that was robbed in this particular movie. But the most obvious. He does end up winning an oscar but not for a role that I find particularly strong. Please don't misunderstand he was great in this role also. But better in so many others. He has so many in his arsenal of great acting. With at least 10 movies scoring over a 7.5 on I mdb.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
flawed but compelling social drama,"""Blood Diamond"" may well result in the biggest boon yet for the cubic zirconium business. This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.""Blood"" diamonds, also known as ""conflict"" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars. Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent. Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on. Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines. Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film. One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West. The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless. Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers. The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie clichés - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the movie makers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand. Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.Those negatives aside, ""Blood Diamond"" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial movie-making, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization. Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed. In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Sadly, it is the reality in Africa that turned into an excellent movie","I had the opportunity because of my profession to visit most of the African countries while traveling for more than 15years.Africa is the most beautiful continent on earth but there are still many conflicts going on, even today.I met dozens of child soldiers, not in the company of warlords but in special centra where they learn to be social and a child again. The longer they have a ""soldier"" the harder it is to make them feel ""normal"" again. Some of the children are lost forever. For most children it takes years to be integrated in society again.That is something what is not highlighted in the movie but everything else is, even in 2021, still the situation a many countries.That and the fact that the script and actors are magnificent, deserves a 9,5 score.Non of the films I have seen about Africa tell the real story. Making an acceptable, entertaining movie for everyone about the horror and abuse in Africa is a masterpiece. Engaging the right actors and the truth makes this movie one of my favorites. On top of it, since 2006, nothing has changed therefore the movie is as accurate today as it was in 2006.I really love Africa fore it's beauty and wildlife and I stopped helping out the wounded,
physically and mentally injured people a year ago but I will still be 80% of the time in Africa (Having a Belgian nationality). My hart and home however will always be in Africa. Luckily there are plenty of peaceful areas to have adventures or live as close to nature to fill a couple of
Lifetimes.Therefore you must see this movie to be aware of the reality in too many countries. Documentaries or movies about the beauty and wildlife you can find plenty. Visiting it is a must but 99,9% of the visitors are not aware of the horror. I do not recommend it to see it ""life"" and therefore also this movie is a ""must see""",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Just the right mix of Hollywood and reality!,"This movie is a masterpiece. It has both style and substance.The story is great, with a lot of socio-political commentary and realistic aspects that add quite a bit of substance to it. The characters are all great. Archer, Solomon, Maddy, Coetzee, Captain Poison etc are all really well made and well realized characters. I also loved the acting, they're all really well acted... and as someone who's not a big Di Caprio fan, I have to say, his performance here is excellent.What I especially love about this movie is that unlike a lot of movies that tackle these kind of themes Blood Diamond also has great action, which makes it quite unique.A lot of these movies that tackle socio-political themes tend to avoid having gratifying action and focus more on the drama and story, and I'm not a big fan of that trend. That's why I love Blood Diamond because it's quite different since it has a lot of action, and it's satisfying and gratifying action. You might think that would conflict with the socio-political drama side of the story but it doesn't. It has a lot of fun and stylish action scenes that will make action junkies happy, with a lot of violence, explosions, satisfying blood effects, a good body count and punchy gun sounds. It's basically Rambo at times and it's great. The action scenes are quite relevant to the plot too, it's not just action for the sake action.The cinematography is also phenomenal here. The location choices, camera angles, visual direction etc are all great.Another thing I love about this movie is the pacing and the way it is structured. It's extremely fast paced and has a lot of content in just 2hrs and 20mins. They could have easily stretched the movie out to over 5 hours if they wanted to. All the scenes contribute a lot to the progression of the plot and they are only around 5 - 10 minutes each in length, then they move on to the next one. This movie wastes no time and has a breakneck pace. This, for me, makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever.",,Anonymous,Drama
"I didn't buy a diamond, after researching the facts.","I watched this film the day before me and my fiancé were going to go an choose an engagement ring! I am so glad I did, whilst watching it, was increasingly concerned about the subject matter, and logged on to get some facts.Essentially, no one can guarantee that a diamond is 'conflict free' even now, with the Kimberly process in place. Diamonds can be smuggled to the countries that are signed up to the process. Figures range from 0.2% to 5% of diamonds sold are blood diamonds, so I didn't want to take any chances, whatever the percentage, (and how can anyone really know?) My fiancé bought me a simple, beautiful Burmese sapphire ring without diamonds instead (note. it is preferable not to buy sapphires from Bhutan).I can see that the diamond trade are worried about this film and are back-tracking like crazy - trying to be top of internet searches so that we will support the diamond trade, but until it is 100% tight, I will not be buying diamonds.The film asks that you insist the diamonds you buy are conflict free, and but there are no guarantee's. When buying the Sapphire, we insisted that the shop supported the Kimberly process in any case, even though we were not buying them - as it is a step todays limiting 'conflict' diamonds.I am glad this intelligent, dramatic film has raised the profile of the trade in blood diamonds, so that the 70 year marketing campaign by the diamond trade, trying to get us to buy that 'special' diamond engagement ring is shown for what it is.Not every girl does want a diamond (or blood) on her hand.Thanks for reading.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well done Hollywood,"I lived in Sierra Leone for 2 years before the nightmare of this civil war. So for me the strength of the film is in it's recreation of the country. I could feel, see and smell it.Djimon Hounsou gives a magnificently compelling performance as the father determined to get his family back. That story is the heart and soul of the film. Particularly his son's journey to child soldier and later back to his family.Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly give sterling support. Despite a shaky accent there was emotional resonance in the former's soldier of fortune finding his way back to a degree of humanity.The action is superbly mounted too. But Hollywood has given us a film about Africa that attempts to tell us a truth beyond entertainment.If you haven't seen this film then do so.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointingly Average,"War dramas such as 'Blood Diamond' can be some of the most emotive pieces in cinema. The barbaric acts that the people have to endure, the bloodshed and the violence all hit home due to its factual nature, brought to vivid and disturbing life on theatre screens. However 'Blood Diamond' fails to rise into the ranks of 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'Schindler's List'.Walking out of the cinema I felt no emotion, I just felt as if the movie had come to an end and that was two hours of my life that I had enjoyed, but hadn't in any way had an affect on me. For subject material as disturbing and shocking as Sierra Leone one would most likely be surprised at this comment. The flaw lies in many of the crucial ingredients of film making. The way the story was portrayed is the first flaw on the list. Whilst I felt the director was trying to show what everyday life was like in the region at the time the various shocking elements that were designed to instigate the viewer to drop their mouth in shock were presented badly and almost guiltily I felt that Id seen it before. The characters simply didn't bring it to life, a task hampered by many moments that just felt far too convenient. Picture the three main characters walking over a hill and looking down upon a refugee camp that reaches out to the horizon. Over a million residents, Connolly comments. The three walk up to the fence, arriving in search of Solomon's family. Solomon examines the array of people and lo and behold there is his family. That really is one in a million.On the subject of characters the next logical step would be to look at the acting. All round it was solid but I felt the source material just held back the actors from really delivering anything powerful. At one moment DiCaprio monumentally jumps out of character suggesting he'll cut a man's face off if he ever goes against him. The next moment they're happily walking across the hills. Continuity in this film was at times jarring, jumping from day to night scenes leaving the viewer wondering what happened in between.As for structure the film meanders along nicely, intermingled with the occasional action scene that whilst nice to watch will never really get your heart rate pumping. And by the time the films minutes are nearly up we reach the emotional climax that really fails to reach its Everest, we simply don't care enough about the character. The only background delivered was of a childhood, which although surprisingly shocking for a clichéd 'parents were killed scenario' meant nothing on the basis of a script that fell emotionally flat.'Blood Diamond' did many things adequately but never rose to the heights of a picture that really should have stirred the audience emotions given its notable subject material.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Jack of all trades, master of none.","Blood Diamond is the latest in a string of recent Hollywood financed films which have taken on political and social turbulence in Africa and is, in my opinion, the weakest. The script was deeply conflicted about whether the film's main role was as an action film or a political film, and ended up failing as either. The political message, though interesting, was sloppily handled, leading the audience to be angered not by the American and Europeans who control the Diamond business, but by the campy and stereotypical African villains. I felt little pity for the civilian populations, who were made entirely one dimensional and were almost entirely cursory to the main storyline. The exception to this was Honsou, a revelation and easily the highlight of the film. He was compelling to watch, and will hopefully be seen again. DiCaprio wasn't so inspiring. Aside from the fact that he's just too baby-faced to play the tough guys he's been cast as recently, here he was simply dull to watch. Angry, disillusioned and completely lacking in any depth. His chemistry with Connelly was nonexistent. The cinematography was nice enough, but all the action scenes felt overblown and badly handled, and what was really surprising was the complete lack of any feeling of place. There was a village, an urban center, and some fields , and as far as I could tell they were all withing a few miles of each other. All in all, the usual disappointing Hollywood stuff, this time with an important but terribly executed message, made slightly better by one sterling performance. My advice would be to watch the infinitely better and truly touching The Constant Gardener.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The cinematography is beautiful and the message for the movie is loud and clear. Edward Zwick once again has made a fantastic movie. The main thing is this movie hopefully will open everyone's eyes to the violence and abuse that blood diamonds cause.

A message film trying to reach a wider audience through the conventional Hollywood formula.,"It's rare to find films like these in Hollywood nowadays.But they are still plagued by the Hollywood formula.So is the case with Blood diamond.A thoughtful and stunning action drama with a message to send out that gets bogged down by the Hollywood fatigue.Blood Diamond could've been a great film,but that was never gonna happen.The film for the most part was solid.It kicks off well and holds on until its second half becomes your typical Hollywood drama with a Hollywood ending.But nevertheless,it gets its message across in a really effective way.And that's only because of director Edward Zwicks sincere effort.Probably his best film since the LAST SAMURAI.He carefully balances the film's message and action and big budget adventure and still capture the shocking accounts of brute in Sierra Leone.Where kids are given guns to roam free and kill whoever they wish to,where laws are broken and country is torn apart by civil war.Danny Archer(Di Caprio) is a diamond smuggler who owes his boss and gets around to places quickly.He doesn't have a permanent home or location and he's really hard to trust or predict.But as he gets arrested for illegal smuggling he comes across another prisoner who is arrested for the wrong cause.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is caught by the rebels while trying to help his family escape.He is forced to dig diamonds from the ground until Vandy finds the blood diamond,which he hides and keeps safe.As he is captured by the government he is pursued by Archer,who will help him find his family and get back his son from the rebels; only if he gets him his blood diamond.Along the way Archer meets an optimistic journalists (Jennifer Connelly) who is more interested in getting the information of how illegal diamond smuggling works than getting her share of the price.And only Archer can give her that information.The three embark on a deadly adventure through the torn Sierra Leone,where gunfire and killings are a routine and can come out of anywhere.But there are secrets Archer is hiding and he is desperate to have that diamond in his possession before others capture them.Sounds like your typical,old-fashioned action-adventure.But think again,this ones got a message and it's executed with unconventional sense until we reach its final third half.It's done with excitement and enough action to lure the average moviegoer into the theatres.Because that's the only way to get the message and horrifying events to its audiences to realize what their diamonds cost.But it also feels clichéd and old-fashioned in parts.The screenplay should've been way better and there was potential in it.But the writer opts for the usual Hollywood flairs.That is not to say that the script doesn't have strengths.It does have some really well written parts with strong lead characters.And it tells a very honest story.But it could've worked a little more.It's the Director that keeps everything afloat and Zwick is best at these kinds of films.He is not afraid to show us what Sierra Leone was really like a few years back.How it tore itself apart due to the civil war.And how the world didn't gave a damn about it even if they said they do.The world is just there for the benefit.The governments promise help and they just never provide any.Either they are limited or they don't get what they want.It's the political side of it that destroys and promotes the kinds of things that went on in Sierra Leone and that is true even now in other parts of the world,like IRAQ.What would an average moviegoer say about films like these?He'll think about it a lot and try to think of a way to help,but the next day he'll forget about it and pretend he never even saw anything like this.And that's what has been happening.We make films like these to open everyone's eyes and once they've had their eyes wide open they close them and move about their business.So,what's the point of making these kinds of films.The main strength of this film is that it is a message movie packed into a commercial film.So that it could reach a wider audience.And for that it's recommended.Another reason is the characters and the events they go through,which are executed skillfully by a veteran like Ed Zwick.Di Caprio has been making some really great films the past few years.Post-Beach,he's been making some really memorable and striking pictures and working with the best in Hollywood.And each time his performances get better and better.As Danny Archer,Di Caprio infests unpredictability in an otherwise predictable anti-hero.He makes us hard to predict Danny's moves.You are not sure whether you should trust him or not,even till the final few moments of his time in the film.But he makes Danny more human and sympathetic.And he nails it once again with his biting performance.It's unlike any character he's ever played and he's a totally different kind of Di Caprio here.But,I still loved his portrayal of Howard Hughes more than this.And every time he is beaten by a greater performance at the year end awards.Ironically,they were African-Americans,who beat him twice.And they both deserved it.Maybe,next time Di Caprio might finally win.And Djimon Honsou's fierce performance as a father in search of his son is so believable that you know he will do anything to get back his family.Jennifer Connelly doesn't have much to do.Well,her character won't allow her to ,except making the usual speeches and bashing.But Connelly looks stunning.The film is packed with brilliant editing,exceptionally well staged,exciting action set pieces and good cinematography,with able score.It's a well made film only hampered by its weak screenplay.It's filled with a stunning production values and entertains fully.But it certainly could've been a great film and it had the potentials to be.It's only strong performances and able direction that propels and prevents this film from becoming your usual Hollywood action-adventure.It is worth checking out and will seriously hit you with its message about the cost of those bloody diamonds.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Relationships Rushed/Inauthentic,"I think the acting was solid, but it was poorly written. There wasn't enough background on who the characters are for you to feel invested in them and the relationships were rushed and inauthentic.

Could have been good if they build the storyline instead of overly long shoot out scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative,"Separated from his family by rebels, fisherman Solomon is forced to work in the bloody diamond mines, locating diamonds that the rebels use to fund their war against the government. Danny Archer is a former mercenary who now smuggles diamonds out of the conflict zone into neighbouring Liberia so that they can be documented as legal. Maddy Bowen is a journalist, in the area to make a difference by exposing such illegal activity and the suffering it produces. When Solomon finds and hides a large diamond, Danny and Maddy both get involved in his life and on a journey into the horror of the illegal diamond trade.I wasn't sure how to approach this film because it is so clearly a ""message"" film on a topical issue and Hollywood doesn't always have the best track record on this. However on the other hand it has been voted very highly on IMDb (one of the best 250 films ever made apparently) and generally well received by critics. Watching it you can see the duality at work within the production because on one hand it is trying to make sure we understand just how much suffering and death is associated with and supported by this trade but then it also needs to deliver a film to entertain the masses in order to get this message through. The meshing of these two aims is not always very successful but generally the approach works to a point. At some points it is quite shocking to see the casual treatment of life, the creation of child soldiers etc but then at other times it is more of an action movie, with Danny dodging bullets while women and children are hit. The story requires a plot and this doesn't really explore the reality of the trade so much as use it as a backdrop for a simple story where good prevails. Again I know this is a necessary part of getting the message to a mass audience, but it is hard to see where ""good"" is in this story.So really I found myself wanting a much harder ride from the film  I genuinely wanted to feel angry and shocked by it but the approach maybe minimised that for me. This aside, the film is actually pretty good and it works well as a dramatic narrative within the setting of the diamond trade.Zwick can do ""epic"" and indeed this is just what he does. OK, perhaps he is also responsible for some of the reality and horror being sucked out of it in the meantime, but you cannot really have an issue with his direction when it comes to the sweep of the film and specifically some of the bigger action shots. His cast are roundly good as well. DiCaprio does well with the accent, even if it takes a second or two to get used to. I liked that he never seemed to be undergoing a significant ""realisation"" as the film went on  he was better than that and he knew his character. Hounsou is better and does dominate the film thanks mainly to the ""better"" material handed to him; he is convincing and drew me into his character. Connelly doesn't do anything wrong but is only so-so, again due to her character's place in the script. Support from Sheen, Vosloo, and others is roundly solid.Overall then a strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative.",,Anonymous,Drama
The Price of a Diamond Ring,"In 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.""Blood Diamond"" is a fantastic movie, with a dramatic story full of action, excellent direction of Edward Zwick and stunning performances of Djimon Hounsou, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kagiso Kuypers and Jennifer Connelly. It exposes the sad reality about the economical interests of the powerful nations in the poor Africa and how the news do not disclose this shameful situation to the world, ""dedicating one minute in CNN between meteorology and sports"" as ironically said by the character of Jennifer Connelly. It is also amazing how a movie like ""The Departed"" wins the Oscar of Best Film, when ""Blood Diamond"" is better and better. Unfortunately Edward Zwick is not so well related with Hollywood industry as Martin Scorsese My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Diamante de Sangue"" (""Blood Diamond"")",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"What an experience, worth the wait.","I found very early in my movie watching history that it's extremely difficult task to choose the ones which are worth to watch.Blood Diamond has been waiting in that list for me watch since almost over 10 years now, I had it downloaded in my earlier PC, and I never saw it. I was postponing it on to morrow, I always knew it would be an experience, but never had the courage to exhaust one such film from my watchlist.Today, I saw it, and, honestly, it's so worth the wait. As a kid, I might have under appreciated the importance of such cinema.What happens in Africa, what has happened in the world for centuries has always fascinated me, the structure of power and the misuse of it in so many ways. At the same point, there is always the niceness of people, no one is bad just for the sake of it, but the tragedy of the circumstances is spectacular and this kind of a film does a lot more than a hundred articles could, as has been already observed.Regardless, Leonardo will be always remembered as the actor of this time period, along with SRK to me, I can't love anyone more as an actor, except of course Jennifer Connelly for more than one reasons. I'd see this again sometime and have suggested numerous times already to others, will keep doing that with more intensity now, this story needs to be told, not for the sake of just Africa but humanity.I'm feeling quite nice right now, nicest even in the ongoing year, so happy for this to be made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is Africa?,"An Edward Zwick film always reeks of quality. Think of his ""Courage Under Fire,"" the first big film to address the Gulf War, or the Tom Cruise starer ""The Last Samurai."" Both were very good films, but didn't quite reach the epic status they seemed to be aiming for. Zwick commonly has compelling stories with big stars and a big budget...but his films are always missing that special something--the visceral jolt or that artistic flair that separate the good movies from the great movies. ""Blood Diamond"" tries very hard to be a pulse-pounding and heart wrenching political thriller in the vein of last year's ""The Constant Gardner,"" but in its earnest and noble attempt to bring to life the plight of Africans involved in the mining and smuggling of diamonds, it falls short.The writers deserve credit for trying to highlight so many compelling tangents of this hot-button story that touches on price gouging, corporate ""funding"" of civil war, enslavement of native Africans in their own land, and the brutal indoctrination of child armies by radical rebel forces. Zwick, always competent staging a tense battle scene and realistic violence, unfortunately directs everything else in a pedestrian manner that hinders the inherent compelling nature of the plot. An uninspired music score and two false endings don't help.The superb cast helps keep things slightly off kilter and interesting for the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio as the suddenly conscious-stricken diamond smuggler has become one of those uber-stars who is always better than expected in spite of himself. He sports and unidentifiable accent (is it supposed to be a Zimbabwe accent, or someone from Zimbabwe doing a bad impression of a South African accent?) that isn't as nearly distracting as it was in the previews for the film. Following his masterful turn in ""The Departed"", Leo has somehow managed to wipe away his pretty-boy image and become a very reliable man's-man actor-intense and brooding and ready for action. It's also nice to see the stunning Jennifer Connelly in a role other than that of a tortured middle class woman with dark secrets. She's underused here as the wily reporter looking to make a difference with her ""big story,"" but her always slightly subversive line readings are effortlessly enticing, and she's become one of those rare actresses who looks even sexier as she ages. To round out the ensemble, there's Djimon Hounsou, always riveting in his typecast role of a passionate and angry African willing to do anything for his family.""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately one of those movies that is greater to talk about than actually sit through. It has some fine performances and a compelling story that gives much food for thought, but isn't as well executed as it should be. Like all Zwick films, it has a brain and a keen eye, but its heart seems strangely insincere.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Djimon Hounsou brings humanity,"Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) and journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) are working in the chaos of Sierra Leone. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a poor fisherman. His village is attacked, and his family is scattered. His son is pressed into fighting for the rebels. He is put into forced labor mining for diamonds. When he finds a rare pink diamond, he figures it's his way out.There is more than white people coming to fix black people problems. Most of it is due to Djimon Hounsou's powerful performance. Leonardo DiCaprio does a weird African accent, but I'm willing to overlook it. This movie has a grand scale. The refugee camp is big. The battles are surprisingly big. The subject matter is big. So it's very interesting that the best part of the movie is Solomon Vandy. The only drawback is that the story is too big. It's unbelievably big. Since this isn't 007, I like the story to be more realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Opening the window,"I think this is worth watching because something new happened here. Not related to film-making, storytelling or any of those cinematic issues, but because of light and capturing Africa, something the manuals call photography.Cinematography:.I'm trying to get to as much of the work of Eduardo Serra as i can. I do believe we are in the presence of one of the most competent and surprising cinematographer's of current times. And here he exceeded my expectations, for a film vastly filmed in Africa: the continent always represented a challenge for artists, above all for the matters of light, color and landscape, unique there. In cinema concerns, ""Out of Africa"" was a bold approach, but in the end very ""washed out"" and empty of emotion. Riefenstahl, herself a master in film debated herself with this fascination in part of her photographer work. None of these or other work was able to become, to my point of view, interesting enough, comparing to what Africa can offer. Recently, ""the constant gardener"" raised the challenge and got closer, but it went too much over top (the cinematographer was south American, he mixed the two continents, i supposed). In the end it sounds pretty much fake. Every cinema photography is by definition fake, but it should strike you as genuine.Serra is Portuguese. Portugal was all over Africa and South America at certain points of history and in the first case until very recently. Maybe that would give a Portuguese cinematographer the balance and distance he needs. Recently, in an interview, Serra was asked, regarding ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", how could he have got that light, so natural, so genuine. He simply answered: ""i opened the window."" That's what he made here. He understood the light in Africa, and put all the artificial means he had to bring that light, as untouched as possible, to cinema. So, the merit of this film is, in this sense, to have opened the window to Africa. It's not perfect, but it's the best we have, to this point. Until something better comes out, this is Africa.My evaluation: 4/5 - just photography (and Conelly, great presence, fills her scenes and in addition is beautiful), for all the rest this is a common, even vulgar experience in mass cinema, not worth more than 2 in my scale. If you want something more clever, by someone who cares about film-making, camera-work and storytelling issues, watch ""the constant gardener"".P.S. This one is inserted in the recent tendency for commercial movies to look at humanitarian issues, using entertainment as a channel for ""serious things"". I think that's worth of applause only to the point when this becomes another capitalism global product. this ""bono voxization"" of humanitarian issues may kill the hole principle of the thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolutely Terrible,"This site rarely let's me down with it's rating system and with an 8 I was expecting this to be a halfway decent movie but I was wrong wrong wrong. This movie is a huge piece of crap. The characters' forced self-righteous dialog seemed to want to bring respect to the sierra Leone conflicts but that seemed to be in direct conflict with the fact that there are back to back Hollywood style action scenes practically every 5 minutes.

The female news reporter was the biggest piece of crap character I've ever seen written, the hypocrisy in her self-righteous rants in correlation with this movie were too much to handle and thus I could only make it halfway through this garbage before turning it off.

An undervalued gem,"2006 was a good year for Leonardo DiCaprio.The well regarded actor smashed box office's and was a lead instigator behind Martin Scorsese's Best Picture winning The Departed, while also delivering one of his most memorable turns in his Oscar nominated role as black market dealing Danny Archer in Edward Zwick's impressive thriller Blood Diamond.A film that at its core acts as a call to arms against the use of illegal diamonds and the way in which they are sourced from the African continent, Zwick's expertly crafted and well-paced epic may have its fair share of plot conveniences and slightly mawkish moments but judged as a whole and when featuring a fantastic double act between DiCaprio and an equally memorable Djimon Hounsou supporting turn as native African Solomon Vandy, Blood Diamond is deserving of its well-regarded reputation that was slightly undervalued by critics upon initial release.A seasoned pro at epics with morals, heart and spectacle thanks to efforts such as Glory, Legends of the Fall and The Last Samurai, Zwick is the perfect choice to bring the sweeping tale of Blood Diamond to life as we follow Archer and Vandy, as well as Jennifer Connolly's more cookie-cutter hard edge journalist Maddy Bowen and Blood Diamond is filled to the brim with heart in your mouth moments, emotional character beats and lessons to be learned as a dangerous quest for a multi-million dollar diamond takes place around a bloodthirsty Sierra Leona uprising.In this cross country spanning adventure, Zwick never loses sight of the heart and soul of the film that exists between the mismatched pair of Archer and Vandy, a man self-centred on personal fortune and gain and a man dedicated to being reunited with his family and his beloved teenage son who has been captured by a heartless rebel group and in this pairing Zwick manages to elevate his well-shot, scored and edited film to another level.While many out there would tend to focus on DiCaprio's fairly intensive South African accent ""bro"", there's little point in trying to deny the impressive work of the renowned actor who plays against type as a more divisive anti-hero that isn't instantly warm and relatable and his layered performance is a strong example of why DiCaprio was the inform actor of the 2000's, while the often underrated Hounsou is both powerful and intense as Vandy, in a turn that sits proudly alongside his career defining turns in Amistad, Gladiator and In America.Another underrated aspect of Zwick's emotionally charged spectacle is the fact that this Hollywood film refuses to pull any punches from its weighty subject matter, as it delves into the modern horrors affecting the African landscape and whether its examining child soldiers, illegal diamond trades and slave labour or the political unrest of the nation, Blood Diamond is more than a simple thriller, as its tale incorporates a wide ranging set of elements in its quest to paint an overall picture of a confusing time and place.Final Say -A heartfelt and thrilling event film, Blood Diamond is a top-notch Hollywood epic and a film deserving of its increasingly well-regarded stature in the years that have passed since its undervalued release.4 ½ cameramen out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Why does it take so long to recognize atrocities?,"We have another film recognizing the atrocities committed in the African continent during the dark ages of violence and war which has followed the collapse of colonial rule. The massacres, ethnic cleansing and general upheaval, not to mention the general breakdown of law and order which have taken place in Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the Congo Republic, Rhodesia and Dafur, just to name a few, are only now becoming exposed via the medium of film. This film is a must see along with Hotel Rwanda and The Last King of Scotland.The savage conflict in Sierra Leone, once part of Britain's West African colonial empire, with its forcible recruitment of child soldiers and killing and maiming of tens of thousands by lawless gangs of self appointed rebels and freedom fighters was reported at the time, but largely ignored by the rest of the world until several years had passed and it was safe to make a film about it. As they said in the film, TIA - this is Africa! Wrong - this is the chaos that follows when a superpower's imposed rule ends leaving behind a power vacuum.The most interesting parallel in the film was that of the child soldier Dia, and Danny Archer, himself a child soldier, albeit a white one. Danny's parents had been murdered in the struggle in Zimbabwe, after white colonial rule had ended with a unilateral declaration of independence. Danny joined the army in South Africa and served in Angola, where he became a trained killer under the guidance of Colonel Coetze, just as Dia comes under the guidance of Colonel Poison. Neither Coetze nor Poison care about their young proteges, except for tuning them into emotionless killing machines. Coetze is now involved in diamond smuggling, and Danny is one of his field contacts.Danny courts Solomon, who discovered and concealed a valuable diamond, because he wants to find and make money from the diamond. Solomon's search for his son is an distraction that he does not have time for. He meets the reporter, Maddy, and his reaction is that of a droplet of water in a hot frying pan, but eventually his eyes are opened and he comes to see how they are all being used by the diamond cartel, who do not even sell the diamonds which have destroyed so many lives, but lock them away in a vault to manipulate the price. The film also makes the point that we all contribute to the violence and slave labor when we buy the product.The ending of the film offers hope for Solomon and Dia, but none for Danny who has not known anything but war and probably could never settle down to a quiet life.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spectacular yet devastating,"Very few movies have as much depth as Blood Diamond on countless levels. The truth behind Africa's war-torn countries and poverty is shown and the mindsets and greed of the people who fund both sides of the conflict is laid bare for all to see (TIA). On top of that, the ideologies of various people caught in the middle of the war is shown and how the West played a huge role in the wars. Finally, how humanity and morality prevail is probably the best part. Besides this, the cinematography, the plot, soundtrack and absolutely outstanding acting by DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou rally made this an emotional and eye opening rollercoaster ride from start to finish.

What War can do to Humans (Actual Vote should be 7 1/2),"Very few movies made me feel the true essence of violence and war, and BLOOD DIAMONDS is one of these.Edward Zwick doesn't hide anything of what could seriously happen in a land like this, or any other land touched by the nonsense of War. I was impressed by how the movie truly shows you how there can be no good or bad humans ... just humans.With their faults and responsibilities, but also wanting to get away from that Hell on Earth by any means necessary.I loved how the dialogues, so simple and almost predictable, manage to be so powerful thanks to the excellent delivery of the actors.Leo DiCaprio serves really well as Danny Archer, maybe not at his best, but surely in the right mood, especially in action sequences. But who truly shines is Djimon Honsou, the real protagonist of the story and the most charismatic character thanks to his backstory and the intensity with which he show the true pain that make hims go on to reach his goals, even if he perfectly knows that possibilities are rare and the ones around him don't truly intend to help him.The violence is disturbing in the best way, not shying away to show how truly Evil it can bring, especially if by the hands of misguided children, forced to become ruthless killers (and yes, it show it fully on the screen!!)It could have been a true gem, if not for some weaknesses, like some forced story moments, some parts in which things become a bit too sentimental, and Jennifer Connelly's character, not bad per se, but who could have been handled better (especially her remarks and attitude, way too smartass in certain points, and of course the forced romance with Leo)All in all, a very interesting title I definitely recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Edward Zwick once again delivers with this action packed, yet thought provoking film. In so many ways it's beautiful, tragic, and eye opening. We get to see Africa through several sets of eyes and realize there is so much potential, but greed seems to be the ever constant barrier to actual prosperity.Leonardo DiCaprio evolves into his character Danny Archer. The cut throat Rhodesian soldier of fortune reveals that he does have a heart, and glimpses are shown throughout. Djimon Hounsou is also just incredible as the desperate father who is willing to do anything to save his son and find his family.Blood Diamond delivers its message with a haymaker punch through a big budget Hollywood movie. I have to believe the world and general populace is not okay with the purchase of conflict diamonds, and I'm glad measures have been put in place to limit this from happening. It makes it easier to prevent this when people are aware, and like it or not movies are pretty good at that.I hope that the ""This is Africa"" phrase can eventually be associated to positivity rather than how it's used in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A good find if a little rough around the edges,"If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film ""Blood Diamond"" - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme. Well, yes, it got me into thinking at times that it could have been better but during the parts that work, it got me engaged nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Unfortunately, Maggie exists not just as a love interest but the voice of conscience. That she has to call attention to savagery and exploitation trivializes the politics of the film. More to the point may have been a narrative portraying more of the abject poverty in Sierra Leone and Guinea, as well as the plight of the refugees, orphans, and boy soldiers -- all of which could be understood through the lens of a journalist (not a love interest).

There are a few times I just didn't believe the characters would be doing what the script was calling for them to do. If those moments had been removed ... or if Zwick had shown those moments from the POV of the characters so we could understand WHY they were doing what they were doing, it would be a better film. I gave it an 8 ... but really it's a 7.5.The other thing is that this film is ABOUT something. It's about an important political issue that has often been overlooked.

A Flood Of Blood For A Piece Of Diamond,"'Blood Diamond' is a very Hollywood film but at the same time it stays very true to the facts. Zwick does not overload the viewer with its 'Hollywoodness'. There are bombs exploding and lots of shooting and killing but it's not overdone like in other flicks. The enigmatic African landscape is stunningly captured (even though it wasn't specifically filmed in Sierra Leone) and the score is both mesmerizing and haunting. The cinematography is superb as it gives the film a slick feel and also gives the landscape a role of its own.Though the story is somewhat predictable it does not effect the film in a negative way. Zwick refrains from using clichés like putting a sex scene (which would have only deviated from the main plot line) or a conventional happy ending. The slick execution makes 'Blood Diamond' entertaining, gripping and moving. It moves at a steady pace. Rosenblum's editing is good and Leavitt's screenplay is solid and engaging. The characters are well written and the insanity of the blood thirsty rebels is well depicted in a few scenes and the sequence where they brainwash the children turning them into immediate murderers, is chilling. While many seem to disagree, I thought the problem of conflict diamond is effectively presented in this movie.I never thought Leonardo Dicaprio would ever reach the heights he did with his acting in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' (which I considered his best work). He's been good in many films (like 'Catch Me If You Can') and bad in some (like 'Titanic', 'The Man In The Iron Mask' but I can say that his performance in both 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Blood Diamond' are his career best (though I have yet to see 'The Aviator'). In my opinion, they surpass the overrated 'The Departed'. I've always liked Djimon Hounsou's acting (especially in films like 'Amistad' and 'In America') and here he does not disappoint one bit. The actor skillfully underplays his part and is only explosive when required. The scenes between him and Dicaprio are a treat to watch. Then there's the radiant Jennifer Connelly, another actor who's performances never let down. She has a comparatively smaller role but makes the best of it. All three actors form an interesting and entertaining trio. The supporting cast do well.While the 'Hollywoodness' gives it an entertaining quality, I think it takes away some of the rawness and that slightly hinders the film from being more hard-hitting (like 'Hotel Rwanda'). But it is pretty much an either - or situation and I still think the issues are presented well enough to balance the effectiveness of the real problem and entertainment.Overall, Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an excellent gripping drama thriller that showcases the talents of actors Hounsou and Dicaprio, writer Leavitt, music director Newton Howard and director of photography Serra.",,Anonymous,Drama
Hollywood's crocodile tears,"They say the best way to make people care about an issue is not reporting it in the news, but, sadly, by making a movie about it, with big name stars. However, I found this film a bit too slick and entertaining for its apparent noble intentions. In the end, I couldn't figure if the purpose was to make a film about conflict diamonds in war torn African countries and the plight of the people caught in the middle, in order to raise awareness about the issue, or an entertaining action flick that happens to use the subject of conflict diamonds to seem original and pretend it has a higher standard.The plot was good and the acting was too (mostly Di Caprio's, who was excellent as the white African rogue mercenary, accent and all, and he sure managed the physical presence necessary for his role - first time I perceived him as a man and not a boy), but the film felt very formulaic and preachy - some of Jennifer Connely's morally superior lines, however true, were mere stereotypes and delivered with such self-righteousness that they sounded downright arrogant.The characters seemed developed by using ""by the book"" methods that almost destroyed the viewer's chance to bond with them and give a damn about them and their circumstances, had it not been for some really good acting moments. The film was riddled with obvious CGI imagery, mostly in the scenes of violent attacks, which took away from the sense of true drama - the film went for quantity instead of quality, IMO, by cheapening the dramatic artistry into mere dramatic kitsch and ruining the emotional charge of the scene. I think it would have been more effective to resort to less grandiose images of violence, brutal death and destruction, and opt for a smaller scale depiction, by using real acting instead of CGI.I'd say the intention was good, maybe the director and the screenwriters had a better film in mind, but somewhere, possibly in the producers' offices, someone screwed up what could have been an important film and a good cinematic feature, by turning it into a half-baked schizoid mix between a complex socio-political statement and the typical money-making Hollywood feature.

TIA ... This is Africa,"Greetings again from the darkness. Edward Zwick has spent the past 8 years concentrating mostly on producing with the exception of the ultra-Hollywood ""The Last Samurai"". Zwick has a strong resume that includes ""Legends of the Fall"", ""Glory"" and ""About Last Night"". With ""Blood Diamond"" we get a very intense and interesting story that falls short of being great due to the Hollywood slickness applied.Leonardo DiCaprio follows up his Oscar-worthy performance in ""The Departed"" with a wonderful portrayal of a diamond smuggler in South Africa. For his character, Archer, the film is his last shot at salvation and it results in self-discovery and soul redemption thanks to his ""partnership"" with Djimon Hounsou (so great in ""In America"" and ""Gladiator"") and his connection to an American journalist played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. Connelly is the main misstep in the film because we just can't buy her as the ""in the thick of the action"" type. Her character supposedly jumps from one world crisis to the next, but she comes across much more as the day spa treatment girl. Hounsou, on the other hand, is so real it frightened me at times. No one plays the angry man on a mission better than he.Much talk will be made of DiCaprio's accent, but it is pretty solid most of the time and only fades out in a few scenes. His accent should not make or break the film for anyone, as it is a terrific story with amazing scenery and a great deal of intensity throughout the two and a half hour running time.

Rarely do we a see a motion picture show such horrible schemes going on in the world.It's the story of a fisherman (Soloman Vandy) with high hopes for his son, when his village is burned down and ruined by the RUF. He's is separated from his family and is sent to work in Diamond hunting camps. Where he finds a huge gem, hides it barely escaping with his life and the story ensues from their on end. Taking place during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The movie accurately portrays the corruptness of the malevolent smuggling scheme used for smuggling conflict diamonds and the even more disturbing, use of child soldiers. Young children are kidnapped and go by the doctrine of men who convince them of evil and that their family are weakness's utilising them as weapons. If you've seen 'Kony 2012' you get the idea. It's used to great effect on one of the story lines in which Soloman's son in kidnapped and transformed into a child soldier. Displaying the morale of the bond between father and son no matter what.The second underlying story is of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) an ex solider turned business man who is a definitive example of damaged characters. He is keen on nothing more than leaving Africa due to the horrible things he's seen in this 'uncivilised' place. He has to battle with his inner demons and desire to find whats right. He bonds brilliant with Soloman in the movie even though at first he had the intentions to exploit the situation which he is in. He falls in love with Maddy (Jennifer Conolly) whose character has the different convictions and believes in hope. Something that's been taken from him young of age.The third underlying story is of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Conolly) a journalist who's on the struggle to do good. To make change in the world. She's an amazing representation of finding love and hope in small things and how an individual can change the world, as you see her struggle to change the world and get the information on conflict diamonds.These three riveting story lines are flawlessly sewed together to present a masterpiece taken place during rough times, yet utilising the beauty of Africa in the cinematography to give you an entertaining movie with great dialogue, satisfying villain, soul shattering soundtrack and many morals (including how you look at jewellery and ""good things happen everyday"" -Maddy Bowen).Please watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond,"I first saw this film in theaters with my brother and mother. I personally had no idea what the movie was going to be about, I am just a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan so I decided to check it out. I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because, it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels, the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie, people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son, while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one, aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13, I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Movie,"I watch movies from the 30s set in Africa and cringe. There's a racist/colonialist attitude in nearly every one that overwhelms whatever other merits the thing might have. It embarrasses and troubles me to no end because I wonder about what it means to be complicit.My grandson will look at this movie here and think much the same, I believe. By then its very likely that the internet will have evolved into something where single voices can matter more, and he will wonder where I was in this. I'll tell him now.This is a sad thing. Its basic form is as a manufactured product made by financiers with the intent of increasing their wealth. That's fine, common, normal, healthy even. But what it uses is the grief of a continent. Never mind that it was created by that very act. What's repellent is that it pretends to ""educate,"" to champion action to mitigate their plight.But the story is from the 30s. The person who matters, who makes change is a white man. There is a blackie who ends up being celebrated, but by then we know that all he has is commitment to his family. Its an admirable trait by itself, but everything else this man has is given to him by a white man. Sure, the white man is redeemed at the end is a sort of way, but even that is compromised.You may think I am over-reacting, that surely ANY publicity of the plight is a plus, and there IS a pitch to boycott conflict diamonds. I simply ask you to look at old movies like this, and ask yourself: did you enjoy this? Did you buy the story, which means that you bought the characters and their roles? Did you buy into this world, pay money, enjoy and accept it? Will you be able to look your grandchildren in the eye?We'll never escape this situation until we escape the world we create to live in.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Drama
Could have been a lot better if it was more focused,"Leading up to its theatrical release, Blood Diamond had a lot of controversy over its depiction of the conflict diamond industry. It arrived, and was met with apprehension by critics, and did not exactly light the box office on fire. It went on to a few awards, and eventually, five Academy Award nominations. So was there actually a good movie here, or was it just overly average?Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) lives a tranquil life with his wife and three children in a village outside of Sierra Leone. One day, a group calling themselves the RUF, the Revolutionary United Front, comes blazing into the village, devastating it, and capturing Vandy. He is put to work mining diamonds, and happens to come across an extremely rare diamond everyone wants their hands on  a blood diamond. He buries it, and ends up getting arrested with much of the RUF and other prisoners. It is in prison, while having an argument with one of the leaders, that diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes a shine to him.This description only skims the top of the immensely subplot laden film. While the essential plot is for Vandy and Archer to go and get the diamond, there is also bits with a female journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) trying to cover the conflict diamond story, the search for Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) who has been captured by the RUF, and the whole big scheme of the international diamond sellers who are both battling complaints about accepting conflict diamonds, while they are waiting for Archer to deliver on giving them this blood diamond.It gets to be a little too much in some cases, racing around in circles and introducing characters at a moment's notice. A lot of them barely get any screen time, but they are introduced anyway and are thrown into the mix of the storyline. But even saying that, the film is downright boring in some cases. I had to turn it off because it just stopped going anywhere after awhile. It sets itself up pretty nice, but then falls into a lull that lasts for almost the entire second act. It takes long enough to get there, and even longer to reach the third. It just feels awkward, and begs of needing much stronger editing. At a sluggish 143-minute runtime, it could have done with it and could have ended up being so much more focused than it is. It is interesting, but could have been a lot shorter.Another issue is how preachy the movie gets. We understand that there is deep trouble concerning the mining for these diamonds. We do not need characters to bash us over the heads with their prolific and exhausting dialogue. In some cases, it comes naturally off the character's tongues and feels like it needs to be there in the conversations. It feels right, and only adds to the film's goal of authenticity. But in the majority, the dialogue feels like it was tacked on just to get a rise out of the audience. A call to action, sort to speak. What is worse is these moments are glaringly obvious, and make the film out to be more amateurish than it actually is. This is a big budget Hollywood production, not a film student's sociology film. Adding unnatural dialogue just for the sake of it, only stinks of trouble.The actual action and film-making techniques employed in the film are not all that bad though. The cinematography is excellent (if slightly feeling a bit too much like a take on the visually superior Children of Men), and the art direction is wonderful. The pieces of Africa that they capture are just so majestic, that even the most brutal of violence still looks great on camera. A huge gunfight sequence on the streets of Sierra Leone is well orchestrated, and is filmed gorgeously. Another helicopter raid sequence is almost right on the same par. The action is raw and gritty. It feels authentic, and also feels horrific in its brutality. The very blood reddish colours used throughout the film are a testament to this, both during scenes of massive violence and in scenes of tranquil beauty. Even the grounds walked on are red.Acting wise, everyone is a bit mixed. Hounsou is clearly the best of the bunch here, but only really begins showing the needed genuine emotion near the end of the film. He has a bit during the middle, but throughout the rest, he just has nothing. He is vastly talented, and he plays his role with an absolute desire for perfection, but he is just not totally right in every case. DiCaprio fares much worse. His accent, while being truthful to South Africa (or so I am told), is one of the most annoying things I have ever had to listen to. It works sparingly, and when his voice is not breaking into his actual American accent, just does not feel right for this film. His acting is good as always, but not up to the same calibre as Hounsou, or even himself in The Departed. He really needs to work on his inner ""scumbag"" role. He is supposed to be selfish here, but he really just looks undecided in how he should act.The rest of the supporting cast is okay in their small roles (especially Kuypers). Connelly is good in her role as the journalist, and is very strong for a character I never expected to be anything more than slight eye candy. She has done much better work in the past though.Better focus on the story, and more genuine emotion would have helped this film a lot. It is too long as it is, and gets really preachy in some cases. It is an interesting, albeit flawed, film to watch, but it does the job. It just could have been a whole lot better.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A very moving film about a serious global issue,"I've been reading up on the diamond industry, and in particular the problem of blood diamonds, for 6 or 7 years now. So of course I was interested in checking out this film. First, I have to join the chorus of praise about Djimon Hounsou -- he is phenomenal. I think DiCaprio and Connelly are strong in this film, too, but the role of Solomon Vandy is so much more compelling and dramatic, and requires so much more from an actor, that Hounsou just just leaves them in his wake. The battle scenes (more like massacre scenes, actually) are frightening, overwhelming, and seemingly relentless. The movie does a great job of impressing upon the audience the sheer terror of just trying to survive in war-torn Sierra Leone. I do have three criticisms of this film. I found DiCaprio's last scene too drawn out; I think it would have been more impactful with less...just less. I also sensed some holes in continuity from time to time -- wait, how did we get from there to here again? Did I miss something? And the biggest disappointment of the film for me was the message shown at the film's conclusion: that diamond buyers should ""insist on conflict-free"" stones. To me, that is a completely pansy-assed conclusion that flies in the face of everything this movie is about. The message should be simply Do not buy any diamonds, period. Do you honestly think that the massive amount of money behind the diamond industry cannot find ways to lie about the origin of stones? Come on, don't be naive.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""That diamond is my ticket out of this God-forsaken continent.""","'Blood Diamond' is probably most accurately described, first and foremost, as an action movie, with its other well-meaning cinematic intentions not being quite so well-realised. However, as a whole, the film is highly entertaining, and held aloft by two outstanding central performances. During the Sierra Leone Civil War of the 1990s and early 2000s, billions of dollars in diamonds were mined and sold around the world, the profits used to finance further conflict. These diamonds are widely known as ""blood diamonds,"" from which the title of this film was derived. Over the course of the war, tens of thousands lost their lives, and countless more fled the country as refugees.Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' opens in 1999, revealing a poverty-stricken country that has been torn apart by the bitter struggle between government forces and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a loving father who was captured during the rebel insurgence and forced to mine for diamonds to fund RUF's activities. Meanwhile, his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been captured by the rebels and conscripted to become a child soldier, involving a brutal process of brainwashing that transforms children into bloodthirsty killers. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a ""Rhodesian"" weapons smuggler, devoid of morals and thinking only of his next pay-cheque. After Solomon unearths an extremely valuable pink-tinged diamond, Danny exploits him for the information of its whereabouts, though he isn't the only one who wants to get his hands on it.As I mentioned earlier, both Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give excellent performances, and each was deservedly nominated for an Oscar at the 2007 Academy Awards. DiCaprio, notorious for always looking young and immature on screen, finally casts aside this troublesome stereotype as the selfish and grizzled firearms trafficker, accompanied by an unusual African accent that, nonetheless, never falters. Hounsou plays his role of devoted father with a lot of passion, his most impressive scene taking place at the UN refugee camp, when his relief at being reunited with his family turns to unadulterated rage when he hears that his beloved son has been stolen from him. Conversely, Jennifer Connelly is merely adequate as American journalist Maddy Bowen, who has arrived in Sierra Leone to investigate the illegal diamond trade.Oddly, the actress is seemingly trying to appear seductive in just about every one of her scenes, though perhaps this was a deliberate decision to highlight how she uses her ""charm"" to obtain information.'Blood Diamond' contains some excellent action sequences, but Eduardo Serra's camera darts about so frantically that it's often difficult to decipher what is happening on screen. I felt that the extended ending was unnecessary (it should have ended on the mountainside), and the epilogue seemed like an attempt to make the film appear more significant than it actually was: after all, 'Blood Diamond' was a interesting character study and an excellent action/adventure film, but it says little of any substance about the diamond trade, beyond that it is bad. In any case, the theme of large international corporations getting rich at the expense of poverty-stricken Africans was handled slightly better in 'The Constant Gardener (2005),' whilst the issue of children being taught to become killers was more effective in 'Cidade de Deus / City of God (2002).' Interestingly, both of these were directed by Fernando Meirelles.Though perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good, Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an entertaining two hours, and has its own fair share of positive attributes. At the very least, it brought the horrific Sierra Leone Civil War to my attention; I'd honestly never heard of it before. That alone is enough for me to consider this film a success.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good Film / Flawed History,"Blood Diamond is an enjoyable action movie. It's set against the backdrop of of Sierra Leone's civil war of the 1990s and is a story of child soldiers, anarchy and savagery. The film incorporates a mixture of fact and made-up history. However the film serves a useful role in showing the country's descent into hell. Over a ten-year period 500,000 people  about one tenth of the population  were murdered, maimed or raped. The film sticks closely to Hollywood storytelling conventions so is tries to manufacture a feel-good ending and turns a diamond / gun smuggler (DiCaprio) into a hero.The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone sell diamonds to buy guns. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy a fisherman whose life is changed when the RUF arrive and start killing and hacking off the limbs of his fellow villagers. Vandy is kidnapped and made to work in the rebel operated mines. He finds and hides a huge rock before being rescued by government troops. He is held in a prison and meets Danny Archer (DiCaprio) who wants to sell the diamond while Vandy just wants to find his wife and kids. The film is about their attempts to find the diamond and save Vandy's family.Danny starts the movie as a tough and cynical Rhodesian mercenary and diamond smuggler. DiCaprio is a big star so his character becomes more sympathetic as the film wears on. He ends the movie as a soft hearted guy prepared to risk his life for others. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is the female interest. She starts the movie as a hard-bitten war reporter looking for a story. She latches onto Danny and seems to fall for him. Leonardo's accent isn't quite right, he sounds like an Afrikaaner rather than a Rhodesian / Zimbabwean.All Hollywood movies have to have bad guys and the film blames a fictitious British diamond company and a group of ruthless South African mercenaries. This is inaccurate. In the real world the RUF forced thousands of civilians into work gangs harvesting the stones, which they handed to Charles Taylor, neighboring Liberia's infamous warlord, in return for guns. The film states that Sierra Leone is now at peace and implied it was because of lobbying from the guy from 7th Heaven (playing an invented character called Ambassador Walker). The implication is that the U.S. helped protect Africa from greedy and cynical Brits.The reality is that Global Witness, a small British charity first publicized the ill-effects of conflict diamonds. Tony Blair's father taught at Fourah Bay university in Freetown. When the British based firm, De Beers stopped buying conflict diamonds there is evidence that many were merely diverted to Tel Aviv and Mumbai. In May 2000 Blair sent 2,000 British troops and a naval task force to Sierra Leone. The move saved Freetown from yet more bloodshed and led to the defeat of the RUF.If you ignore the film's fallacious history lesson it works as a slick and exciting action movie. We still await a film that can properly explain the root causes of continent's problems. Sierra Leone is a poor country and it's people need money so people in the West should continue to buy diamonds.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Performances,"Whoever still says that Leonardo Di Caprio can't act, must be out of her/his/their mind! Or they're jealous or whatever, but even if I'm not a Leo Fan, I've got to give him credit. He plays his role really great (with dialect and all). Of course you also got J. Connely and D. Hounsou. And some bit players of course. Everyone is great in the movie and if I'm not mistaken the main actor from Tsotsi has a cameo. Although it's a brief appearance it's memorable! (imdb data bank doesn't confirm this, so I can't be sure, but I could swear it was him) :o) The storytelling of the movie is great too. The adventure, the up and downs, everything fits. What's a little disappointing and was the reason why I didn't give this movie 10/10, is that there was something missing to make that movie really great. Can't explain it, but maybe it was a little bit the fact that the movie tried to be to political. The ending was another point for me, where it could've been better. But those are minor things and overall it's a really great movie.It's good to see Ed Zwick back (he didn't disappear, but didn't make great/memorable movies either, The Siege anyone?) after Glory, nearly 20 years ago!

"Some Indiana Jones, some Heart of Darkness","""To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe."" Joseph Conrad, Heart of DarknessIn West Africa's Sierra Leone, 1999, anarchy ruled, best symbolized by civil war and diamond lust. Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond touches all the incendiary bases: towns pillaged for young boys to be recruited for rebel armies, big diamond firms manipulating the market to keep the price of diamonds high, foreign concerns such as the US walking narrowly between outrage at civil rights violations and interest in the country's vast resources such as oil, rubber, and, of course, minerals.As in this year's other cautionary slice of African history, The Last King of Scotland (about Idi Amin), Blood Diamond's Africa is ripe for maniacal dictators and white exploiters, be they international or South African. Zwick captures the ironic beauty through visually stunning landscapes juxtaposed with close up shots of poverty and mayhem, not all related to diamonds, but all certainly connected to natural riches incapable of being protected by an impoverished, illiterate citizenry.Leonardo DiCaprio's David Archer, from Zimbabwe (Rhodesia as he still calls it), deals in diamonds, a savvy young entrepreneur dedicated to gaining a 100 carat ""pink"" diamond discovered by native laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Vandy needs to barter the discovery for the return of his enslaved family and a chunk of money. Archer's adventure dominates the film to the detriment of closer looks at devastating issues such as child soldiers, of which there are an estimated 200,000. Vandy's son is one of those, so Archer becomes involved by virtue of the diamond and his own emerging altruistic inclinations.Archer's budding love for Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen reminds me of Rick and Ilsa from Casablancalove requiring sacrifices during war, issues bigger than the two of them, blah, blah. So Blood Diamond turns on love after all, both for a land and a people. If Zwick had stayed longer with the big issues such as politics and corporate corruption, his film would have achieved an Out-of-Africa mystique. He does, however, elicit a memorable performance from DiCaprio and wakes us to the politics of diamonds. After all, romantic Americans demand 2/3 of the African diamonds, rarely asking if they are buying ""conflict-free"" gems.The sometimes Indiana Jones-like Blood Diamond gives little hope there is such a commodity.",,Anonymous,Drama

Decent Action Fare,"The problem with Blood Diamond isn't so much what it is, but what it purports to be: an important social statement. A third in Danny Archer - the Rhodesian former mercenary and now diamond smuggler well portrayed by DiCaprio - causticly reads aloud from the trite account reporter Jennifer Connelly types of shared harrowing experiences. A sentence or two into the exploitive, over-dramatized narrative she closes her laptop and agrees 'it's crap, and it won't change a thing.' It's an ironic moment.The genocide of Sierra Leone is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Here it's mostly a backdrop for the Adventures of DiCaprio and Connelly. Will Archer retrieve the pink diamond from rebel territory and pay his debts? Will Connelly make a difference? Will love blossom between DiCaprio and Connelly? Will they escape and live happily ever after? What has any of this to do with the slaughter of innocents? Companion Djimon Hounsou's frantic quest to re-unite his family and rescue his kidnapped child from service in the rebel militia takes second place and the death of Sierra Leone a distant third. Both serve mostly as means for putting DiCaprio into new tense situations. Think shootouts, car chases and exposing international diamond smuggling scandals.Without its pretensions Blood Diamond stands as a pretty good action/romance. Connelly is unconvincing as the far too beautiful and earnest battle-hardened field reporter but Hounsou's fisherman/father drawn into DiCaprio's quest for riches is well acted, if let down by the screenwriter's incessant need to force his character into insanely stupid and self-destructive acts for the sake of creating yet more 'tense situations'. It's well shot with memorable action sequences. When the film shifts long enough from its center to focus on the world of RUF child-soldiers or explore the relationship between DiCaprio's old white Africa and Hounsou's by-standing innocence, things get interesting. In the right hands it would make for an excellent movie with an important message.With its false pretensions though the film ironically ranks as just another in a long line of exploitations, this time making money directly from African tragedy rather than creating one for the sake of rubber, oil or diamonds. For best effect watch it as a socially conscious 'Die Hard'.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Decent enough movie, but could have used better editing","Blood Diamond is my kind of movie. It has action, and stunts, and explosions, but they are really used to propel the storyline, not in and of itself. It also has an overriding ethical theme to it, in this case the tragedy that is war-torn Africa.It's a very compelling storyline. A simple fisherman from Sierra Leone tries to raise his family and educate his children. Yet the rebels have a different plan: they attack the village, slaughter many, drive the rest away, and capture the fisherman, making him a slave in a diamond mine. He discovers a large pink diamond, tries to smuggle it away, and the story begins.The story of modern-day Africa is not a simple one, and this plot is not a simple plot. They touch on the constant state of rebellion of some of these nations; they touch on the practice of turning boys into soldiers and killers; they touch on cross-tribal slaughter; and yes, they touch on the notion of blood diamonds.The acting is pretty good. Not fantastic, but decent. Leo DiCaprio does a fine job as Danny Archer, a mercenary diamond smuggler. This isn't an Oscar-worthy turn, sometimes his accent is cloying, and his final scene is a bit overdone, but his performance isn't too distracting and, in general, is pretty good. He's just a bit better in The Departed IMO.I liked Djimon Hounsou as the fisherman, Solomon Vendy. But he, too, overreaches at times. I think he suffers from writing or direction at times, you can tell he's being directed by a white American, his ""African-ness"" doesn't really shine through. In other words, he's just a bit too unbelievable as a Sierra Leone peasant, but, like Leo, he does a good enough job with it.I wasn't totally thrilled with Jennifer Connelly in the role of reporter Maddy Brown. I'm not sure if it was her, or her character, that I had a problem with. It seems they just threw her in there because the film needed a conscience, and she solves some inconvenient plot holes, but overall, I don't think this particular character adds much to the film.That brings me to the overall flaw with this film, and the reason I give it an 8 instead of a 10. What the film really needed was editing and tightening. The addition of the Brown character, plus the expansion of the diamond cartel into an army of mercenaries, distract the viewer from the real meat and bones of the film. The best parts of this film are the unworkable relationship between Archer and Solomon; Solomon's quest for his family's safety (including his search for his soldier son); the overall chaos and brutality of a nation at war; and the sliminess of the blood diamond trade. Anything else (the reporter, some Dicaprio-Connelly sexual tension, the mercenaries), really distracted from those important elements and really should have been chopped, not on the cutting room floor, but in the script revision process.Filmmakers need to learn how to cut to the heart of the movie and tell that story, and leave the chaff by the wayside.8 out of 10, points taken off for some poor editing choices.Barky",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Is all warfare a response to market forces that demand certain products and will prompt certain groups to take extraordinary measures to ensure that the needs of the market place are met?

Dramatizing the Stone...,"Set in 1999, Edward Zwyck's ""Blood Diamond"", starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, is a powerful depiction of the Sierra Leonese Civil War and the extreme barbarity that wasn't without reminding of a certain genocide that occurred not too far in time and space.It is also a heart-warming friendship story between two men who couldn't have been more diametrically opposed: Danny Archer a Rhodesian diamond smuggler and Solomon Vandy, a humble fisherman. The two men would unite their forces to find a missing son and a diamond, the value of each being worth throwing themselves into the lion's mouth.During their investigation, they'll be assisted by an American journalist named Maddy Bowen who -beyond her genuine desire to help- can also foresee the discovery of the connection between these incessant wars and the diamond industry. Why so many diamonds exported from the neighboring Liberia and nothing from Sierra Leone? Obviously there are White Big Bad with hands reddened by the blood of innocents Africans but some (Michael McSheen) just wash their hands on that matter.Meanwhile, Solomon's son is enrolled by the Revolutionary Army and undergoes a brainwashing treatment destined to turn him into a killing machine.Enumerating all plots and subplots, I realize that there's no point in the cinematic compass that ""Blood Diamond"" doesn't aim at. The film contains some brutal imagery, women and children are killed, arms chopped, and villagers selected to work on the mines. A more conventional treatment of war violence shows panic-stricken people running on the streets, bombs exploding, massive executions and shootouts.And arc-wise, there's the whole journey of a cynical young man who'll realize that there's more than a stone that is at stakes.A war-thriller with an exotic setting and a family story with a political commentary; in fact the only thing the film spares us from is a Mexican stand-off and an explicit romance between Leo and Jennifer Connelly (who's distractingly beautiful as usual) but both were close calls.What can I say? The film is expertly done and the story neatly manufactured, it's effective, too effective. That's the problem. I could believe everything in the story but not the story. It's one thing to believe that Danny Archer is handy with a gun and can go the distance with a man of Solomon's size and natural strength, but a lot is asked when providence puts them together at the right place and the right man and with the one-eyed evil Captain (David Harewood) giving the information David needed. But let's accept that.I noticed that anytime a distraction is needed, something explodes... a plane drops a bomb and chaos ensues. When Solomon finds the stone, when Danny tries to persuade him to come, when they're confronted again by the captain. This isn't a plot with holes likes a Swiss cheese but with conveniences programmed with the exactitude of a Swiss watch. And even the climactic confrontation relies on perfect timing, and the right number of people to be outfought by the two... not without a scratch but still.Danger is always present, but the film has established the setting as a place where children and women can be blindly killed... so there's no way we wouldn't believe that none of the protagonists would die until the mission is accomplished, not after they escaped so many life-threatening situations.Now, maybe that wasn't even the point, and the thrills consist of that trio overcoming each obstacle, sometimes with the use of a machine-gun, sometimes with the use of bluff and charm (guess who handles that), and many times with luck. There's no surprise, the defiance between Solomon and Danny is predictable, even more so the sexual tension between Danny and Maddy, relieved by a night chit-chat where we learn that there's more than the usual pretty boy meets pretty girl and that Danny isn't the ""toughest of all the toughies"" he seems to be, drinking beer and smoking more cigarettes than the number of people dropping like mosquitoes in the film. He's got past wounds... naturally.During that part, I realized why I avoided ""Blood Diamond"" for so long. I wasn't the biggest fan of that 2000s sequence where directors decided Leo had grown up and had to become a legitimate tough guy while he's never as good as when he plays vulnerable. And let me assure you that it's for these scenes that he got the Oscar nomination, although less deserved than Hounsou's one. But check the film's awards page: no nomination for the screenplay. You can make a good script that tries to emulate ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Syriana"" but even then, the film's weakness is the writing.It starts with the opening line ""you want to be a doctor or a fisherman like your father"" doesn't the son know his father's job? Wouldn't we know he's his father? When the captain decides not to cut his hand, do we need to hear the reason? When Danny meets the Afrikaner mercenary Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) who praises his fighting, isn't that supposed to prevent us from questioning how come he's so handy with military weapons? Imagine how good it would've been if these few bits of amateurish dialogues here and there were cut, taking the film back to a solid 120-minute runtime.""Blood Diamond"" is well-shot and well-acted but it doesn't know what it is : an action-packed war thriller, the journey of a father and a son separated by the war, a social commentary about the moral responsibility of the Western world whose economical policy leads to the stalemates and escalation of violence, or an adventure film with an agent with special skills.And in that narrative confusion you have the diamond as a bargaining ship for a noble mission or a sensational investigation or maybe a lousy McGuffin, I still have to figure that out. (and be glad I didn't even talk about Africa's image and the 'white savior' cliché!)",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Is All This Really Happening?,"Lately, every film I see is so full of violence and suffering. Here the catch is diamonds and their impact on the world. Leonardo de Caprio is a mercenary, working the two sides against the middle. During this film, his character reclaims his soul. The strong suit of the film is the portrayal of the Africans who are victimized by the unfeeling diamond cartel and their own military infrastructure. It shows the process by which boys are kidnapped and then made into mindless soldiers fighting for a cause they don't even understand. I wish there had been a better sub-current of humanity and a little more human connection. I ask if this is the way it is or is it the way it is on the worst of days? What is truly astonishing is how the principle characters manage for so long to not get hit by fire. At times it's a bit much. Still, it sends a clear message that most of us ought to be aware of.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"a message picture, sure, but a good one, with strong leads","Surely Edward Zwick is no stranger to tackling big hot-button topics (the most prominent for me is the Siege where terrorism and martial law in the US) and merging them with ""old-fashioned"" studio values. Old fashioned meaning that we can expect something of a happy ending, if not for everyone involved then for the more important characters in the lot. Here we're given much more bloody, graphic violence though, with plenty a curse to be found as well, plus some disturbing subject matter, like with children being taught to shoot at younger and younger ages in countries abroad. But it's a reality too that Zwick and his team are capturing with Blood Diamond, a dramatic thriller about the corrupt system that was (or maybe still is) in effect in Africa where diamonds get shipped across country lines, then get transferred to the rest of the world, but not without the share of multiple casualties, to confusing lengths (appropriately so). It carries it's message in tow throughout, particularly at the end hammering it in like a hangover. But aside from this, and a couple of rushed bits in the script and storytelling, it's a solid picture with some terrific performances.Although I'd still go with Leonardo DiCaprio's turn in the Departed as his best role of the year (though it goes without saying that it might be my favorite from him so far as an actor anyway), his work in Blood Diamond is not to be scoffed at in the slightest. He's a man through and through here, which may be undermining his work in his 20s, but here at the least he seems poised completely to be a rugged action hero, or a tough one to be sure, who can kick ass and get the job done while also having a touching arc to his tormented, cynical character Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. When he finds out about a very big diamond hidden by Solomon, played by Djimon Hunsou, in assuredly- if I had to guess in shallow terms- an Oscar contending performance for his overall compelling nature. Solomon also lost his family during a raid by rebels who wiped out most of his village. He finally finds most of his family in a refugee camp thanks to Danny and Maddy (Jennifer Connolly, good if not stellar, though not with as much to do), a tough and one-sidedly moral journalist. But his son is not there, and has been indoctrinated into the ranks of the young rebels with guns, whom now he has to strike a deal with Danny- diamond for son, son for diamond, a fair trade it might seem, as Danny just wants to get out of the maelstrom of wretched violence and death that comes with his job.All of this then is done in a slick, professional style by Zwick and his crew, and that isn't at all problematic (if at times feeling rushed with the script, though definitely Zwick is still a good leap ahead of other contemporaries in the Hollywood action-film department). The story does lurch forward oddly in a couple of spots, mainly in how Danny and Solomon agree to be partners finally- in the midst of an all out street battle. And there's one scene towards the end of Danny & Solomon's journey- following Solomon reunited with his boy (and the subsequent quasi-deprogramming of the son's killing skills, which is very effective as an emotional scene)- that didn't seem too believable to me. But it's the performances and the heightened atmosphere of suspense in the air of a f****-up environment and topic that make it a worthwhile movie. Even when a story point seemed on the verge of total contrivance, I was always wrapped up in what the filmmakers and the actors were trying to convey, so there was always that emotional connection. It doesn't rise surprisingly above to task like the Last Samurai, Zwick's last flick, but it was a very good time throughout, particularly with one unexpected scene involving an animal carcass.One thing's for sure- you'll be a little more questioning when you look at your local jewelry store for that next big present. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Djimon Hounsou steals the show,"I saw Blood Diamond a couple months ago in theaters.It's the story of Solomon, a fisherman (Hounsou) who loses his family, and then is sent to a diamond digging camp. It takes place during the infamous civil war of Sierra Leone. Men who don't give up the diamonds are killed. But he stumbled upon a gigantic diamond. Luckily, an attack happens at the same time, so he's able to safely bury it. Through multiple events, a diamond smuggler (Dicaprio) finds out about the diamond, wants it for his own reasons, and forces Solomon to lead him back to where he buried it. All Solomon really wants is to find his family, and he needs the Diamond in order to make an exchange.I can say that I think Djimon Hounsou may have given one of the best performances of the year. It's a shame he got snubbed. I also enjoyed the juggling of action and drama. Edward Zwick is probably the best at making a movie have good action scenes, and also be plot driven. The Last Samaraui is okay, and Glory is amazing.I also did like the whole relationship between Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou. Unlike most films, where two enemies traveling together become friends, these two still dislike each other, a more realistic portrayal.While overall it is a decent movie, I did walk away with one complaint that almost ruins the movie. First of all, Jennifer Connelly is an unnecessary addition only for the romantic plot. The romantic plot is unnecessary and has nothing to do with the story. I would have left her out completely.I also would have narrowed down the number of lucky breaks. In the film, a lot of times the characters survive because they get lucky. Luck is used accidentally too much in films. The only film that does it well is Match Point, which is about luck.Anyway, it is a good film, not perfect, but it is interesting to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood spilled by the Script,"Director Edward Zwick brings us the authentic and socially significant Blood Diamond starring Academy Award nominees Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou and winner Jennifer Connelly. This is the story of Danny Archer, (DiCaprio) a South African smuggler who crosses the paths of Solomon Vandy, (Hounsou) a fisherman in search of his lost son and Maddy Bowen, (Connelly) an American journalist in search of a story. When Solomon hides a rare diamond, everyone including Archer will stop at nothing to gain possession.Zwick who has brought some tantalizing and underrated pictures such as The Last Samurai and Glory has truly brought forth a magnificent piece of cinema here. Zwick can't save the film however from the lukewarm script by Charles Leavitt. The message of the film is quite powerful, quickly engaging the viewer and hooking us into it. The film's visual aspects is what pulls the viewer through with the journey a diamond makes from the ruins to the finger.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his strongest performances of his career and the year. Alongside his powerful work in The Departed, 2006 belonged to him. No other performance this year had us invested in a character we know we shouldn't be loving. Its quite remarkable how engaged we become with Danny, the evil, the antics, the redemption, all these qualities arouse the audience in character development. DiCaprio takes his first huge step into an adult role which he's struggled with for the past ten years. Becoming a male Meryl Streep, taking on an accent and an against type character is sensational for the young actor.Djimon Hounsou, showing us high range emotion at every glance ends up coming up a little short. It wasn't really his fault, his character didn't have the investment that DiCaprio's did. As he searches for his son, the story disenchants the audience so by the time we're ready for a meaningful reunion, the audience is left behind in the premise. Hounsou did the best with his material but doesn't even come close to his previous powerhouse performances in Amistad and In America.Jennifer Connelly's talent is entirely wasted in a character of no importance or significance to the story. Her love affair with Archer is so distracting and unwanted that by near end of the film, we yearn for extinction. This is Leavitt's biggest failure of the picture in the creation of a character. Connelly just can't gain any traction after her Oscar for A Beautiful Mind; she remains on the sideline and as the role seemed promising, it bombs from entry.Technical aspects of the film are decent enough with strong film editing, cinematography and musical score. All barely above average, nothing spectacular, just a mediocre picture. I'm afraid I can't blame Zwick, he gets an A for effort as well as the cast. The film failed on story alone.Grade: **½/****",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good, but not Golden.","First, let me comment on the ratings skew given to movies by ""Astroturfing"". When a movie is released, industry shills assault supposedly impartial rating sites in an effort to adjust public perception. And IMDb is a prime target for such faux reviews.As I write this, Blood Diamond appears to be an epic of the decade with a 8.2/10 average score. At the moment, calling this movie anything less than artistic perfection would seem to be the minority opinion. Help 'weed out' the astroturfing, watch this movie for yourself and rate it appropriately.In my opinion this film is good, but not exceptional. Blood Diamond trips slightly on its own ambition. We have too many mixed themes that won't quite blend together into greatness. Some schizophrenia as to whether this movie wants to be a reality based drama, or an action flick spoil the final brew.I generally enjoy DiCaprio's work, but his role and dialogue seem a tad forced in this setting.I *do* like the movie.

"Good, but can't decide if it wants to be serious or not","Blood Diamond is about a quick little diamond smuggler, Danny Archer, played by Di Caprio, partnering with a local man from Sierra Leone played by Djimon Hounsou, as the former is looking to get rich and the latter looking to save his family.The camera captures the dirt of the human conflict and the heat of the jungle, showing every drop of sweat in sharp contrast. Action is not too shaky, and you can usually tell what is going on. It helps that Africa is photogenic. You don't need to work hard to shoot it. It just needs to show up. You can tell the movie uses some computer special effects on occasion but it does so sparingly enough. It looks OK.The soundtrack is a bit of everything. You get the dramatic orchestral music, which sounded rather generic, but you also get some local folk music and French-speaking rap. It sets a good atmosphere and is not overbearing.Di Caprio's acting is not...pleasant, but that is probably the point, since he is playing a sleazy white opportunist. He is supposed to be one of those typical anti-heroes who is hardened and opportunistic on the outside but has a good heart on the inside. Sometimes he is convincing. Other times not so much.The conversations are memorable thanks to occasional good writing, with many little nuggets to be found. In some cases, the dialogue exellently fleshes out the the background of the various characters, especially Danny Archer himself. In other cases, it might not be brilliant if you read the script, but Di Caprio sells it really well.There is a problem. There is something dishonest about Blood Diamond's nature that negatively affects its story, and I am going to try and pinpoint it for you.There is this one shot, a brief scene, that encompasses what is wrong with this movie. A female character is sorrowfully looking at a refugee camp, as the movie is trying to convince you how horrible the humanitarian crisis is, but at the same time her shirt is unbuttoned just far enough for you to see her side-boob. She is standing there in the foreground together with the main protagonist of this film - a blond white guy. Their black companion, who's been searching for his family all this time, is in the background and out of focus.The movie shows how bad the civil violence is, but at the same time, the main protagonist is a white guy who, of course, happens to be an ex-soldier and who can gun down faceless Africans like he's chewing bubble-gum....and of course he is given a photogenic white love interest, even though the story does not call for it at all. This movie has a hard time delivering its solemn message because it insists on retaining elements of a typical western action movie. Once you watch about ten minutes of this film, you can pretty much predict the rest of it by yourself.And so, the narrative does not flow well, making choices that feel odd, because some choices belong in a movie that is serious about its material and other choices belong in a light-hearted adventure flick. It wants to be Schindler's List and Romancing the Stone at the same time.But...
It is entertaining. If you want a well put together action movie with an exotic tint, this will do.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent film about an unfortunate time and place.,"Blood Diamond is a tale of juxtaposition: a naturally beautiful environment beset with unnecessary death and inhumane brutality and well engineered action and battle sequences with all of the adrenalin but none of the usual viewing satisfaction due to the reality of the subject matter.Blood Diamond tells an intense personal story within the framework of a much larger, much more disturbing background of a turbulent time in world history. And it tells both extremely well.The bigger picture shows tiny African nation Sierra Leone at the turn of last century, a land that has lost its way amid corruption and genocide, where armed forces and RUF rebels battle for supremacy with the innocents in the middle quite often the expendable pawns in an often savage and frankly depressing arm wrestle. Early scenes show indiscriminate slaughter of entire villages by rebels, with entire families simply and casually erased, and the boys taken and 'conscripted', and others too old to brainwash enslaved to work on the diamond fields under intense armed scrutiny.Aaaaahhh the diamonds. Civil wars need funding, and as Sierra Leone at the time was a poor nation with millions living in squalid conditions the illicit diamond trade channeled countless millions into the war effort, directly financing the atrocities carried out.This film should be screened for all brides-to-be in the months before the big day – the expenditure outlaid on tissues would result in huge savings with the ring purchase Which brings us to the 'small story' within the film. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou), a simple fisherman separated from his family, finding himself enslaved on the diamond fields. Solomon finds a much sought after pink diamond of undoubted quality and incredible value. Rather than hand it over he decides this could mean freedom and escape for him and his family; only his theft doesn't go unnoticed and he is only saved from certain death when the field is attacked by government troops and he and his captors are imprisoned.It is in prison that Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) hears first hand of the pink diamond and his ears prick up immediately. An ex-soldier, now an opportunistic middle man able to work all sides for his own benefit, Danny cares not for black or white; rebel or government, he is in it for himself.He sees Solomon as his sparkly ticket out of Africa.Danny eventually convinces Solomon that with his contacts and knowledge he can facilitate his escape to freedom and more importantly reunite him and his family. If he can get his hands on the diamond that is.Things heat up further when the rebels invade the capital city and the new mismatched duo are forced to flee for their lives deeper into the lawless lands of the remote villages and surrounding areas. Here contacts and knowledge are less important, so ultimately Danny enlists the help of an American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) to use her press credentials to gain access to areas out of bounds to mere civilians.Maddy initially uses her contacts to help Solomon track down his family, and as if the ordeal wasn't already depressing enough during the brief reunion he learns that his only son Dia has been taken and forcefully conscripted into the RUF, where he is now part of the threat against the innocent.(Without going too much further the scenes where the boys are taken, beaten, bullied and brainwashed are both deeply disturbing and sadly realistic. They pale into insignificance when compared to the scenes only days later when those same children casually cut a swathe through waves of fleeing innocent villagers with automatic weapons, laughing and shrieking as they advance.) The remainder of the tale follows the trio as they move towards their own goals: for Solomon it is his family and freedom, Maddy wants the big story, and for Danny it is the diamond. With a story spanning many countries taking place amid the chaos and maelstrom of a vast civil war, there are many coincidences that take place – all necessary to the story I might add – that find the key characters running into each other at suitably dramatic points of time.Di Caprio is brilliant, shedding his pretty boy image once and for all as the hard as nails, selfish and opportunistic Danny Archer, Djimon Honsou great as the equally desperate Solomon Vandy, his hoarse scream has quite an impact, and Jennifer Connelly hard nosed and resourceful as a journo who could walk away at any time but chooses to allow herself to become involved in proceedings (she is also still insanely hot).As mentioned above the action sequences are especially effective and gruesomely realistic, with the wholesale slaughter of anyone in the vicinity being graphically depicted. In fact the attention to detail in what is a vast story is astonishing, every depressing aspect incredibly realistic. There are no short cuts taken in this film.Add Blood Diamond to Hotel Rwanda, Tsostsi and The Constant Gardener, excellent films that are incredibly hard to watch.Final Rating – 9 / 10. An excellent film. A depressing portrait of an unfortunate time and place. It is at times hard to watch, which is exactly why you should see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Impressive and great film behind these beautiful stones!,"It's incredible when you see a film like this, specially after you have bought a diamond with a lot of economic effort and savings! It's touching how African people do to themselves for this stones, it's very sad. The message left by this film is deep, a great cinematography and absolutely great acting roles of Di Caprio and Hounsou makes this film a masterpiece to think about a deep social problem in Africa!. Di Caprio keeps mastering his acting, playing a difficult role of a mercenary that works for this dark business, and he has to show a hard, ambitious and poor of ethic character, and evolve to the opposite, finding ethics, courage and a good and human man. Hounsou acting is really impressive and the way he plays an African fisherman and father is so deep and focused, that i'm sure that he lived the role totally with his hearth!.Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) a fisherman of Sierra Leona, see how the RUF, an revolutionary army involved in the diamond black business, attacks his village and separate him from his family, and made him work as a slave in a diamond mine, where he find a rare pink diamond. He manages to escape and hide the diamond, and finds Danny Archer (Di Caprio), a mercenary of Zimbabwe that sells guns to the revolutionaries and also traffic with these diamonds to Liberia. They both start a fiery quest to find Solomon's family and the pink diamond, they have to go to hostile villages and places to get both!.In this story you will feel how a terrible war will take place in which men without heart (RUF), kill and mutilate innocent people, enlist kids, wash their brains, drug them and make them killers! all in the pursuit of diamonds, is sad how a country kill each others in the search of this material things! A message is clear in this film: the critic of this industry and the social problems in Africa, and also, that your people, your family, your life and peace are more valuable than any diamond or material thing in the world! In Colombia, my country a business around emeralds also had spilled a lot of blood too (in Boyaca), and this movie made me think about this too; we Colombians know about this but there isn't much things in the news.Really touching movie in which Jennifer Conelly makes a great role too as a journalist with a great human heart and courage about the situation in Sierra Leona.

Intense and emotionally flooring from start to finish,"It's easy to be deceived by the marketing for a movie such as Blood Diamond. While it may have been presented through movie trailers, publicity material and the like as a standardised Hollywood suspense movie, complete with Leonardo DiCaprio and the like... do not be fooled into thinking that is all Blood Diamond boils down to, because there is so very much more to it than that. In essence, the movie seems to be the amalgamation of two or three films shoved together into one - the intense, emotionally draining story of the Sierra Leone atrocities, the political story showing the futility of so much bloodshed over simple stones, and of course the suspenseful adventure movie, but one far more genuine and emotionally gripping than we have seen for years.The thing which really sets Blood Diamond apart from most other movies with similar subject matter is the way that the content is presented. Rather than a borderline propaganda film harping on our sense of guilt, trying to get us to get us to send a cheque, all of the horrendous events shown detailing the Sierra Leone crisis are portrayed in a relatively impartial yet brutally unflinching fashion. In this aspect, Blood Diamond is by far one of the most upsetting films of the past several years simply because it doesn't turn a blind eye to the horrifying massacres - expect to see entire families getting brutally gunned down for no reason at all, limbs being chopped off innocent people unlucky enough to be caught, and children wielding firearms, grunting in the fashion of bloodthirsty adults.Some viewers have complained that the intense violence especially concerning children was almost exploited, a sort of cash in for our entertainment. I disagree; the violence was incredibly upsetting, yes, but in terms of emotional impact it seemed far more genuine than any relief film or commercial. This is just as meaningful as any other Sierra Leone publicity material, and far more relatable. Simply because the massacres and horribly unjust treatment were shown in such a matter of fact fashion, simply as a fact of life, it drove the emotional resonance home all the more strongly, since the audience is haunted all the more by the knowledge that such atrocities are still going on strong in the world, simply for the sake of our decadence.Edward Zwick, director of the terrific The Last Samurai has produced a film of a similar vein, but is ultimately far superior to any work he has done in the past. The sheer emotional impact of the movie feels like a physical blow to the head, yet one cannot deny, despite the disturbingly brutal content how the film is still an enjoyable thrill ride on the side. How the two can be tacked together is beyond me, but somehow Zwick pulls it off - we are horrified yet elated in turn, all the time drawn in by some utterly gorgeous African cinematography, a tense, exciting score, a compelling and terse script by Charles Leavitt, and of course some incredibly affecting and powerful acting. As a matter of fact, there is only one scene in the entire film which comes across as cheesy or clichéd - there are more which come close, but such fears are alleviated by the superb cast acting at the top of their game.Leonardo DiCaprio has been showing a drastic increase in talent of late, but there can be no doubt that 2006 showcases what is by far the strongest work he has ever put onto a movie screen, what with his work here, and stealing the show with an immensely powerful performance in Martin Scorsese's The Departed. DiCaprio makes the role of jaded and cynical diamond smuggler Danny Archer his own, nailing the south African accent, and completely immersing himself in his character, and never once letting any trace of himself save his charismatic and flooring performance through, making it impossible to picture any other actor playing the part. Djimon Hounsou impresses similarly with a simply wonderful and haunting performance as fisherman Solomon Vandy, who is taken through indescribable trials and horrifying tribulations, all the time only wanting to use the priceless conflict diamond he hid in a hole by the river to free his enslaved family.Jennifer Connelly also gives a strong and resonant performance as American journalist Maddy Bowen, a wonderful addition to the film even if she is without question outshone by Hounsou and especially the charismatic DiCaprio. Arnold Vosloo also gives a solid performance as the the military general head of Archer's smuggling ring, and David Harewood makes one of the most horrifying villains of the past few years as one of the Sierra Leone slavers. The terrific Michael Sheen also turns in a tidy little performance as an infuriating buyer of Archer's conflict diamonds.All in all, Blood Diamond is one of the most powerful and stunningly well done films in recent memory, serving as a superb film on so many levels. Politically resonant, emotionally flooring, and packed with wonderfully genuine yet affecting performances from top to bottom, especially the intensely powerful DiCaprio and wonderful Hounsou. A superb piece of work from start to finish, expect this movie to stay with you for days after its initial viewing.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The beauty of the landscapes and the peaceful scenes, the brief appearance of the old man in one village and the flirtation between Maddy and Danny provide a counterfoil to the horror and keep everything relatable in a way that straightforward gruelling horror could not.Djimon Hounsou is wonderful throughout as the father figure of one boy among thousands.Jennifer Connelly has never been more attractive than as the independent, strong-willed, quick-thinking, compassionate journalist on a mission.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a more complicated role than you might first think, as someone very good at one thing and unable to ever be any good at anything else.The only downside is that every time I see this film some punk sneaks up behind me and starts slicing onions with a butter knife.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Zwick is unflinching in telling the story with scenes of violence, torture and bloody war","Blood Diamond is well made, well directed and well acted, especially by Leonardo Di Caprio who gives an Oscar nominated performance as the troubled diamond smuggler navigating the horrors of a Civil War in Sierra Leone to do business.Director Ed Zwick can't resist being a bit preachy to the audience about greed, illegal trading, corrupt politicians and the atrocities of a civil war which at times tends to bog down the script but that aside you get a real sense of time and place and the horrors that derive from political unrest and the innocent people who get caught up in it.Zwick is unflinching in telling the story with scenes of violence, torture and bloody war which all seems justified as it is based on fact. Djimon Hounsou is excellent as the desperate father caught up in the turmoil trying to find his son who has been captured by the rebel leader, chillingly played by David Harewood, to be trained as a military fighter.While the characters themselves are fictional it is based on the political unrest in Sierra Leone in the 1990's and the illegal trading of blood diamonds to Western countries. The film is uncomfortable viewing but it is a compelling watch if you're in the right mood for it. This is the best I've seen DiCaprio who pulls off an impressive Zimbabwean accent.The film is probably 20 minutes too long and slow in places but it's well worth a look if you want to be challenged, entertained and learn a bit about the corruption of diamond smuggling and it's consequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well dosed academy  adventure movie.,"You're warn as soon as the movie began : you will learn lots of things about Africa (and especially the way USA fells about it), while watching a entertaining adventure movie. It opens with a warning about the situation that occurred in Sierra Leone (and particularly about the ""War Children"", that the movie denounces) and even locates it in a map to be sure everyone understands what's the movie talk about. But as soon as the anti-hero played by Leonardo DiCaprio arrives, the movie transforms itself in a (serious but still) fun and entertaining Hollywoodian adventure movie. You'll find reflection in it, but also explosions, denunciation of the ""war children"" but also gigantic gun fights, self criticism but mostly you'll see Oscar's winners stars running in the forest through explosions and gun fights, looking for the big rose blood diamond of the tittle. And of course, it also has an impossible romance between the idealistic Loïs Lane's style journalist and the ex-colonialist bad guy DiCaprio.This well dosed mixture of a serious subject crossed with an adventure movie treatment reminds me of Joffé's ""The Mission"" or of the all serious filmography of the master of this kind of movie : Steven Spielberg (from ""Schindler's List"" to ""Amistad"" or ""Munich""). And although Spielberg is a far more talented, original and interesting director than Edward Zwick, this movie is a sure intelligent and entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolutely Amazing,"I've never been much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I don't really have anything against him, but I've always assumed he was a bit of a 'pretty-boy'. Someone who has millions of teenage girl fans to keep him relevant, despite little to no talent. This movie completely changed my opinion of him.I came across the movie while flipping through the movie channels one night when I was bored out of my mind. I actually got to this right as it was starting, so I decided to watch it. I am so glad I decided to. This movie was extremely powerful, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance really turn this movie from a good movie, to an excellent one. Djimon Hounsou's performance in this movie easily matched Leonardo's.I completely believe this is one of those movies that everyone needs to see at least once in their life. I have it on DVD and re-watch it about once a month, just because I think it's one of the best out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A bit uneven in tone and focus, but interesting and carried by a gripping double act","Blood Diamond, Edward Zwick's latest feature, is supposed to do three things at the same time: a) make the audience feel guilty about the controversy surrounding ""conflict diamonds"", its point being we don't just ignore the problem, but actually support it; b) expose, not afraid of showing cruel details, the problem of child-soldiers, another problem that keeps haunting Africa (and South America, as seen in City of God); c) tell a story, in pure Hollywood tradition, of redemption and reconciliation, connected with the previous two issues. Now, the title seems to suggest Zwick's first aim should be the one that resonates with most energy. Oddly, it doesn't, the anti-diamond lecture being overshadowed by the children's exploitation subplot and its role in the main narrative.The film is set in Sierra Leone, one of the most profitable zones when it comes to finding and selling certain precious little stones. One of these is found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a local who has been taken away from his family and used as a slave by one of the area's most powerful crime-lords. Once the latter is arrested, everything should go back to normal. Unfortunately, he manages to break out and decides to get back at Solomon, who refused to give him the diamond, by kidnapping his son and slowly turning the young boy into a cold, emotionless killing machine. Overwhelmed by despair, Solomon is willing to do anything to get his son back. And that's where Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) enters the game: a cynical mercenary with no concern whatsoever for other human beings, he accepts to help the grief-stricken family man in exchange for the infamous diamond, while a journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) tries to convince him he can become a better man.The screenplay stages the classic confrontation between two radically opposed lines of thought, showing how both can learn something from the other and hopefully get to the end of the movie with a new set of values. This situation also occurred in Zwick's previous film, The Last Samurai, another story of honor and redemption, and both pictures got their main strength from the performances: much like Ken Watanabe, Hounsou is the film's real soul, injecting pain and humanity into the kind of character that would be used as the villain in more traditional flicks; and like Tom Cruise, Di Caprio shows he is capable of some really serious acting, although he should have received the Academy Award nomination (and won the Oscar, hadn't it been for Forest Whitaker) for The Departed instead of this movie. Why? Mostly because of the accent: even if he nails the South-African vocal quirks from his very first scene, every time he speaks it seems like his spot-on delivery and the rest of his intense work belong to two different worlds, whereas in Martin Scorsese's masterful gangster tale the Boston accent and the body language merged into the Titanic star's most accomplished and compelling role so far. Nevertheless, he has enough charisma to carry the plot, as opposed to Connelly who struggles to give something more to an essentially clichéd character.The relationship between Danny and Solomon enables Zwick to lend extra weight to the scenes involving the grueling mental torture African children are subjected to in order to ""serve their country"" as miniaturized assassins. It's all stuff that has been filmed before, but the director knows what buttons to push to make the material shocking and, given it involves at least one person the audience should care about, a little upsetting.By focusing on these elements with more interest, Zwick ironically fails to successfully convey what was intended to be the movie's big message (conflict diamonds are bad, okay?). Even the epilogue, where he ties together the main narrative and the two ""important"" themes he was supposed to explore, causes a sort of mixed reaction: while it is easy to root for the characters and cheer or cry because of how things turn out for them, chances of people starting to boycott ""blood diamonds"" after seeing this film are quite limited.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond Should be Retitled to: Calvin Klein Runs Amok in Africa.,"With much anticipation, I first viewed what I thought would be a poignant film with an interesting 'subject matter' (hence the film's title) about a week ago.Boy, I mean, Maan, did those Hollywood liberals get it wrong; to be honest, that much was to be expected.For starters, everyone is miscast: Leo DiCaprio as the tough guy ex- Rhodie? Pluuuuhesse! Enter Jennifer Connelly straight from the CNN News castoffs list as Maddy (Who thought of that yuppie, fake name?). She, parades around the beach bar at Freetown, with one breast a-dangling and bumps and groans aloud with the other fake name Danny Archer boy. They hit-it-off with designer beers, phony fags and much clichéd trash talk, actually fluff sounds. Oh yeah... 'Danny boy' comes replete with a wretched South African accent; which sounds less than wooden. He hardly qualifies as a respectable 'crunchie' let alone bushveld hardened ex-Rhodie fighter.They are all pathetic, even Djimon Hounsou. Okay, he did pump a little iron between scenes. But even that didn't help him kick Danny boy's tight ass character. What a wimp (both of them).This B-Rated film even stole heavily from the ancient Greeks. The real baddie (African rebel RUF RUFF captain ) is transformed into a silver eyed Cyclops, who then gets his comeuppance from a diamond encrusted shovel, though on the back of his plaster padded skull.Let me explore the plot/theme. Wait a New York minute... There wasn't one. Ahh, yes. Now I remember. It was, get this: TIA (This is Africa). Translation: Ho Ho Ho, Green Giant, Slippery, Slick, Treeky Transnational Corporation.The aforementioned message is approved by Sotheby's, De Beers, The South Hollandia Pretty Green Bottle Beers export subsidiary and The Blue and White Tobacco Company.Well, by now you guessed my opinion: This supposed social commentary film amounted to not much more than pure poppycock. And I am kind.Who in their right mind would even assign more than one star for this flesh-for-fantasy flic? Well, some ninnies, even gave ten of their crooked thumbs. Or something equally ludicrous.However, my film review is not complete without mention of at least one redemptive quality. The outright winner: AK47 (Chinese version) OR the RPG launch sequence.Oh, Danny boy, you have been found 'wanting' but not much more.Go figure!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
This picture has an absolutely magnificent and insightful storyline.,"Blood Diamond (2006) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a man who is captured and forced to work on a diamond mine. One day he escapes but not before burying a huge diamond. Rumors of his treasure spreads quickly and when a smuggler who could use a fortune finds the man who hid the diamond they decide to work together to retrieve it. Traveling through Africa back to the mines, which are heavily guarded, wont be an easy task.This movie is directed by Edward Zwick (Courage Under Fire) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Dont Look Up), Djimon Hounsou (Deep Rising), Jennifer Connelly (Requiem for a Dream), Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy), Benu Mabhena (Night Walkers), Michael Sheen (The Queen) and Stephen Collins (The First Wives Club).This picture has an absolutely magnificent and insightful storyline. The settings and intensity are well established and depicted. The cast is amazing and everyone was brilliant in their role. The refugee camp is so sad every time you see it. You get the feel that so many people go from bad to worse and have to pick which is the lesser evil - being a slave laborer or be jailed in a refugee camp. The ending base camp scene is tremendous with both the action and how the storyline concludes.Overall this is another DiCaprio masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I don't like violent movies, but this movie gives you the underlying history of what is going on and how these revolutionary despots corrupt children into doing horrible things. Also, I get the blood diamond idea, but it's really more than that and can't be blamed just on the diamond trade. There are many factors that lead to and show violence.

"Majestic views, grim reality","Blood diamonds are conflict diamonds being sold by illegitimate rebel groups. Selling of these highly sought gems is a huge business for RUF, a rebel group fighting against government in Sierra Leone civil war.It's hard to describe the way this film manages to touch a viewer like me from a ""rich"" western nation. There are child soldiers with AK's shooting people at random, cruelty, poverty and misery, and to give it contrast, spectacular outdoor shots of majestic Sierra Leone landscape with canyons and jungle. This is a story about people amid civil war, and their search for things they value the most, whether it is diamonds, family or sheer excitement.""Let's hope they don't discover oil here. Then we'll have real problems.""Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, white African diamond smuggler. This is without a doubt one of DiCaprio's best performances, right after unforgettable Jack Dawson in Titanic, and rugged undercover cop in Departed. Danny gets a hint of an enormous diamond hidden in jungle, and is willing to risk his future in search of this gem sought after by many dangerous people. Danny is a former mercenary, and is more than capable of taking care of himself amid the civil war turmoil. He is accompanied by Solomon Vandy (played by Djimon Hounsou), a local searching for his family and Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist.Hounsou with his strong physical appearance is solid actor, and Jennifer Connelly while a bit stiff still plays an OK role as an idealistic American journalist in search for a touching story.""Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us what we've done to each other. Then I look around and realize God left this place a long time ago.""The grim pictures of a white man shooting down Africans are sure to bear a heavy burden on top of this kind of film. However, DiCaprio is so believable and capturing in his role of sole survivalist, that this is hardly an issue. The script is good, director Edward Zwick gives the imagery and themes appropriate space to sink into viewer's consciousness. Besides bearing the obvious message, the film still manages to be an action film enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
a truly moving picture,"My friends kept telling me how good this was, so I finally checked it out. This was really good. It concerns Sierra Leone in a time of unrest and the illegal export of diamonds. One very rare pink diamond, the blood diamond of the title, is the catalyst that brings a smuggler, a local, and a reporter together.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a terrific performance in this, is there a better actor in the world under forty? DIjimon Hounsou is equally impressive and Jennifer Connelly, looking great as she did in the old days, is good to. The move is not usually my type of thing and it is very violent. However thats probably necessary in a film like this. Director Ed Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Glory) keeps things moving fairly well and the film manages to make you think and care about he people. No easy feat, the characters, with the exception of Solomon (Hounsou) are out for themselves. Also in this cynical age it takes some creative dialog to get to you. Blood Diamond accomplishes this quite well.The film delivers a powerful message without being preachy and the film deserved the accolades it received. kudos to all involved, a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A flawed, yet brilliant, diamond","This is a movie I believe you should see. Just don't expect perfection because it isn't there.First, let's discuss DiCaprio and whether the Academy was right in nominating him for this performance rather than for THE DEPARTED. I have to go with this one, and that isn't at all diminishing his other great performance. There simply were more scenes which he commanded here, and IMHO some scenes definitely eclipsed those in the other film. His character here seemed to me to be even more conflicted than his Billy Costigan character, and especially towards the end, you had to depend on minute nuances to tell what his character was actually doing.Then, there's Djimon Hounsou who again deserved his nomination. He exuded braveness, family concern, varying emotions in regards to DiCaprio's character.However, the above and the power of the message of the film just about sums up my feeling you should see it.Pacing between violent and non-violent scenes failed and some scenes, powerful as they were, drug out for too long. The scenes after the mountainside scene were too long and possibly even unnecessary although they gave the viewer some satisfaction and a conclusion to all elements with which we were concerned.This is still a movie to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stunning,"Blood Diamond is gripping, harrowing, powerful, and intense from start to finish. The film follows DiCaprio's smuggler Danny Archer and Djimon Hounsou's desperate father Solomon Vandy, as the fates of both become entwined with the recovery of precious gem.There's a lot to love about this film, but the biggest has to be the outstanding and visceral performance of Hounsou. He brought so much emotion, power, sensitivity and depth to his portrayal of Solomon, and completely stole the show. Not an easy feat when your on screen partner is DiCaprio. It was an absolute triumph from start to finish, and with the majority of the grit and emotion of the film being found in Soloman's arc, this tremendous performance was much needed. DiCaprio's character was contrasted Hounsou's well, one man in search of his son, the other seeking a payday. DiCaprio's Archer had the more transformative arc of the two, and it was well executed by the script, performance and direction. Jennifer Connelly provided a solid performance as well. Overall a fantastic cast, who each delivered transfixing performances through their interesting and well crafted characters.The plot of Blood Diamond is gripping. There's a satisfying level of simplicity at its core, with a more detailed and intricate subplot at the fringes. For a two hour twenty film it was remarkably well paced, never dragging at all and delivering constant suspense and drama over this runtime. What this film also did so well was contrast the horror of the civil war with the beauty of Africa. The visuals and cinematography were gorgeous, providing a vivid and jarring contrast to the violence, which the film didn't shy away from. All of the above made Blood Diamond's powerful message regarding ethical consumption all the stronger.In summary, the acting is sublime. The visuals beautiful. The plot emotional. The score powerful. Blood Diamond is a triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Danny Archer ( Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hired gun who specializes in the scale of so-called ""Blood Diamond "" that are used to finance rebellions and terrorist organizations, and is currently serving time for smuggling.

With the help of an American Journalist, the men embark on a hazardous trek through rebel territory to achieve their goal. ""Blood Diamond "" is the kind of action movie that makes you think that ""a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life"". This movie tells the story of the brutal African diamond trade and its horrific human toll. It's very much a ""message"" movie, with many scenes showing us how children are doped and brainwashed into being the cannon fodder of Africa's civil wars; and a subplot about how the first world's thirst for diamonds and other natural resources. This is an amazing movie and this movie really shows how to a fisherman, a smuggler and a business man match up to achieve their goal. Really an awesome movie. I really love Leonardo DiCaprio's role in this movie( he is nominated for an Oscar for his role). This a movie where we also can see love, emotion in a bad man.

There is some beautiful scenery in the film and other parts of the film where your jaw drops at the sheer horror of what civil war does to a country and what greed does to us all.

Great Performances + Compelling Plot = Good Film,"In ""Blood Diamond,"" Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Danny Archer, a South African diamond smuggler. He comes to Sierra Leone in search of a conflict diamond that can pay off his debt with his vile employer. Djimon Hansou plays Solomon Vandy, a black African whose son was taken by rebel forces and who hopes to retrieve a large conflict diamond he found when in custody. These two men find themselves fighting alongside one another to survive in ""Blood Diamond."" Characters/Plot: 8/10 This is no ""Godfather,"" but the characters are very interesting because they are all so flawed in different ways and have mixed motives. Danny Archer is a great likable anti-hero and Solomon is incredibly strong as a character. The plot also moves at a good pace, and it always keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.Acting: 9/10 Leonardo DiCaprio is flawless as Danny Archer. His accent is perfect and his mannerisms are so precise and believable. He is sowing himself to be the best younger male actor working. Djimon Hansou is also great, adding a bit more roughness and determination to his similar role in ""In America."" Jennifer Connelly is perfect as an attractive reporter. The casting is great all around, and even the supporting characters seem to fit in well.Technical: 10/10 The cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects are all pitch-perfect. The camera moves very smoothly at times and more roughly at others. The sounds and visuals are also brutally realistic.Atmosphere: 6/10 The atmosphere of the film is great at times but at other times falters. Though the yellow and orange color use is very effective in parts, it sometimes glamorizes the scenes rather than makes them real. In ""Hotel Rwanda,"" there is always that sense of desperation and realism, but here it only appears at certain times, and would be appropriate if used more often. The score was also not incredibly strong, and seemed to fail at manipulating emotion in any way.Entertainment: 7/10 ""Blood Diamond"" is not incredibly well edited. I have no problem with long films, but I don'yet know that this one needed a 2 and a half hour run-time. It seems a bit long at times and some of the intensity seems to falter and drop off at certain points. Still, the battle scenes are exhilarating and the story is very interesting.

A strange mix,"What an odd film. I usually go into watch a film with a bit of background knowledge concerning plot or the general theme. I never saw the trailer for this one so i had no idea what to expect. To basic plot is about a civil war in Sera Leon and the murder and exploitation of its own people for the acquisition of its diamonds. Instead of helping the people in the region to free themselves from the tyranny of the rebels who are hell bent on using there own people as slaves to collect and harvest diamonds, the governments of the west exploit them further by aiding the rebels with money and fire arms. There are a few sub plots concerning the political back drop. The problem is its not really that interesting or entertaining. Thankfully there a few of these scenes and the story focuses more on the three lead charterer's and their own individual stories. Decaprio plays a diamond smuggler at odds with himself and his country, and is good in this but I'm not sure about his South African accent. It seemed forced in certain parts but this is only a minor grip. Jennifer Connellys plays a reporter in the midst of the turmoil. Her character seemed a little clichéd at the start with her presence only serving as a love interest but as the film progress's we soon learn more about her motivations and her own personal struggle. Djimon Hounsou really stood out in this in his role. I remember him in Gladiator, however he was a bit wooden there but wasn't given much material to work with. He has more to do in this film and steals every scene with a very genuine performance. My only problem with this film was what it was trying to be. It was a mix of different genres and as a result it felt a bit disjointed. I wasn't sure if i was watching an action adventure, action drama, war/romance or some combination of the above. For the most part this strange mix actually worked and combined to make a very watchable film. I don't think i would watch it again but the performances from its lead characters (especially Djimon Hounsou) make it 2 hours well spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Jennifer Connelly also made a good appearance. Such a cliché with the diamonds that has been selling or has been wearing by people around the world. This movie will give you insight about the cliché.

"Taut, original African drama","When I first saw BLOOD DIAMOND advertised, the trailer put it across as a straightforward action film, nothing more, nothing less. It's nothing of the kind. Although the film does have a handful of well-played action sequences, it is in actual fact a drama through and through, dealing with the horrors of warfare and the plight of an oppressed country in the same way as a film like THE KILLING FIELDS. Despite it's length – it does drag in a few places – this is a very well made film, ably handled by director Edward Zwick, who previously treated us to THE LAST SAMURAI.The camera-work is breathtaking, the script is intelligent and the cast is populated by some very good actors, not least DiCaprio, who with this and THE DEPARTED seems to have set himself a new benchmark in acting performances, and Djimon Hounsou, whose heart and soul performance carries the movie along through its dark places. It's also nice to see genre actors like Basil Wallace and Arnold Vosloo getting a chance to act in more serious fare. The plot is relatively complex, as many rival factions battle it out over the bloody diamond fields of Sierra Leone in the '90s, but it never loses you for a second and there's plenty to say about the situation, particularly in the original sub-plot involving desensitised child soldiers. Not a perfect film perhaps but still a very good one, chilling and moving when it needs to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
That bling on your finger is bloody,"Edward Zwick does another brilliant piece of directing in ""Blood Diamond,"" a 2006 film starring Leonardo di Caprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou.Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1999, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces.[1] The film portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to stop them from voting in upcoming elections.The diamond industry, as the ivory industry before it, is proving disastrous to civilians as the film opens in 1999. When the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invade Shenge, a small Sierra Leonian village, a man, Solomon (Hounsou) is taken as the rest of his family escapes and made to work in the diamond fields. Diamonds are smuggled into Liberia and exported from there, its profits used by the rebels to fund the war. Solomon's son, meanwhile, is conscripted into the rebel forces and brainwashed, becoming a child killer.While working in the fields, Solomon finds a large pink diamond and manages to hide it just as there is an attack. He is seen hiding it by the captain, Poison (David Harewood). Harewood is badly injured, but along with Solomon and the others, he is arrested. While in prison, he screams that Solomon has a large diamond. Once out of prison, Solomon is approached by a mercenary (di Caprio) who wants that diamond in order to sell it to a middleman, who in turn will sell it to one of the legitimate cartels. Solomon wants his family. Then they meet a beautiful journalist (Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the big diamond cartel as dealing in blood diamonds.A violent, powerful, beautifully photographed and fascinating story with an extraordinary performance by Leonardo di Caprio, ""Blood Diamond"" leaves little doubt about the greed that has destroyed the lives of so many millions of people. Zwick tells the story graphically. Hounsou, Connelly, Harewood, and the rest of the cast are excellent as people in one way or another caught up in the quest for diamonds, many times in order to just hide them away in order to keep the prices high.At the end of the film, one of the chirons cautions people to demand that the diamonds they buy are conflict-free. Yet, after seeing ""Blood Diamond,"" I wonder if one can ever be sure of getting the truth.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A nail-biting action movie with a message thrown in,"Edward Zwick's film is that rarest of rare beasts, a genuinely exciting action movie with a social conscience that is neither exploitative nor unduly sentimental. At times it is quite the equal of ""Under Fire"" and ""The Constant Gardener"", one set in Nicaragua, the other, like this, in Africa but all dealing with conflict in the Third World.There is no doubting Zwick's message and the contempt he feels for regimes that allow children as young as ten to train as soldiers and to kill without conscience as much as for the diamond companies in the West that trade in blood diamonds. But Zwick is canny enough to adhere to that old axiom that if you want to send a message use Western Union. Audiences need action and a bona-fide star and here they get both.At times the violence is excruciating but the action sequences are nail-bitingly good, (and sometimes stomach-churningly real), pitching the audience right in there with documentary-like precision. He never shys away from the horror of what is happening while keeping things at a very high octane level.As for that bona-fide star, Leonardo DiCaprio just seems to get better with every movie. His diamond smuggling Danny Archer is no conventional hero, (once upon a time he might even have been the villain), and the script doesn't really give him a lot to work with, but it's a tremendous piece of acting all the same. Arguably it is the most lived-in DiCaprio performance yet.As for the plot, it's hardly innovative. (DiCaprio joins forces with an African mine worker to retrieve a massive uncut diamond which the mine worker has secreted away in the jungle and which he hopes to use to rescue his family who have been taken by rebels while DiCaprio wants the diamond for himself). However, the plot is only the lynch-pin for this powerful indicement of Third World conflict and Western greed. That the African mine worker is played by the great Djimon Hounsou adds considerably to the proceedings. He lends the film a grace-note it might otherwise not have had.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Bling, BangBlood Diamond","Here we have Hollywood's newest addition to the agenda driven film, trying to get people's attention to the plight of Africa. The trailers had me intrigued, but the press stemmed much of that anticipation as most I heard talked about how preachy the movie was, with its only concern being to show Americans the death and destruction that went into their precious engagement ring. I am a big fan of the three principal actors, however, and I tried to leave all the critic's words home when going out to see Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. Thankfully I did, because if I listened to the hype, while some being true about its' purposes, I would have missed one of the best directed and acted films of the year.Similar to last year's The Constant Gardener, Zwick has given us a story about family and sacrifice to mask the underlying theme of exposing the inhumane activities going on inside, in this case, Sierra Leone. While I felt the former film succeeded immensely in veiling its true purpose with a heart-wrenchingly emotional tale of love and faith, the latter tries to do the same, but at certain moments fails. Between the middle of the film, when the main characters discuss what they know about diamond smugglingall generalities they both know already but speak aloud for the sake of letting us the audience in on the atrocitiesand the tacked on epiloguewhich subverts much of the beauty the final scenes before it brought, and serves as what looks like just a means to get Michael Sheen some dialogueI did find myself shaking my head at how heavy-handed the film was at times. I think these moments stuck out most because the rest of the film, the telling of Solomon Vandy's search for his refugee family, was so effective that it overshadowed all the message delivery devices. You really feel for the plight of Vandy and for both Maddy Bowen and Danny Archer as they try to put their professional lives on hold long enough to try and do good for their new friend and for themselves.Leonardo DiCaprio, as Archer, continues to get better and better with each role he gets. An actor that has always impressed me, much of his past work, while effective, has given off an air of boy in man's shoes. DiCaprio looks younger than most characters that he portrays and as a result comes off as unbelievable no matter how well he encompasses the role. An example of this would be The Departed from earlier this year. True I have Tony Leung's spectacular performance in the original film to compare it to, but Leo just seems out of his element at times, not quite yet realistic as a seasoned tough guy. His portrayal of Danny Archer, however, blows the doors off that generality because he truly embodies this character and feels like the 31 year old that has served in the military, been kicked around for years, and recently held in prison for smuggling. Between his first scene trying to see the main guy in charge to sell his guns and the powerful speech with Vandy about baboon hunting among other things, I was completely riveted by the job he did. Also, the accent stays solid throughout and seems natural enough to suspend disbelief that this is an American playing an Afrikaner.There must also be mention of the two other leads that successfully embody their roles. Jennifer Connelly is always solid and one of the best character women working in Hollywood today. Her facially expressions and body language are perfect as the strong reporter looking for the story to break the blood diamond case wide open. I credit Zwick as well for his directing the relationship between her and Archer. The sexual tension is there as well as the comradery needed between them. Their characters never break from who they are in order to enjoy a quick tryst amongst the carnage, they are totally creatures of their past. Our third lead, Djimon Hounsou, carries the emotional barometer here as he usually does. Like DiCaprio, Hounsou continues to grow as an actor and is steadily becoming one of the best in the business. After his debut in Amistad, without yet really knowing English, he had his true breakthrough in In America. He is so real and true in his performances, that you cannot help but pull for him to get through all that the world throws at him.It is true that the moments of preaching took a little away from the film and at times halted the brisk pace in order to give exposition into the diamond trade; exposition that is ultimately unnecessary in the larger story being told. The film is about civil war and three people caught up in the middle of it trying to find a way out that serves each of their needs. It is their survival that the audience gets caught up in, and not the reason the war started in the first place. Zwick shows a deft hand at filming wartime explosions and chaos. I have not yet seen Glory, but there are many moments here that bring to mind his last film, The Last Samurai. Besides the jarring camera-work and brutality that he is unafraid to show, there is also a parallel arc between our hero there and of Danny Archer here. Both films are about a man who has endured a tough life and learned to build a wall around his heart. As a character in Blood Diamond says though, all men may or may not be evil or good, however, they are all people. It may only take one moment to finally live the life they have always wanted, and the path to that moment doesn't always end up being nice.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fabulous,"There's no such thing as a perfect movie though some come awfully close and this is one of them. The flaws are so few that they're not worth mentioning.From the writing, to the cinematography, to the directing, it's all spectacular but it's the performances that are absolutely stellar.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to put out great performances giving the movie goer their money's worth. Now with the hopefully not permanent retirement of Daniel Day Lewis, DiCaprio has moved to the front of today's best actor. He had that accent down pat. He lost the Oscar to Forrest Whitaker who I can't argue was very deserving.On the other hand, Djimon Hounsou got ripped off. Alan Arkin who won for Little Miss Sunshine can't even compare. Hounsou's role was so much larger and way way more demanding. The only reason I can suspect for Hounsou not winning the Oscar is that he is hardly known compared to Arkin plus the Academy is bias toward their own and to the elderly who may not get another crack at the award but again, it's bias. The award is suppose to go to the best performance.This movie is very much worth watching and I believe it speaks the truth about an industry filled and manipulated by greed.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A movie deserving a wide audience,"BLOOD DIAMOND is before everything else a movie full of good intentions. It is probably the type of history that will bother and teach in someway to everybody.Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a pacific and innocent African native that trying to protect his family is captured by rebels and forced to work in a diamond mine. After witness several atrocities in the name of freedom and diamonds, Solomon finds a huge one and decides to keep it for himself (probably as a way to protect or recover his family); he is discovered in the intent and almost killed but saved the last minute by an enemy (or government army) attack. Danny (Leo di Caprio) on the other side is a white African mercenary doing weapon trade (for diamonds of course). Circumstances somewhat difficult to believe put these two on the road Solomon trying to get back his family and Danny the huge diamond.This light and sometimes forced storyline is used to cross over several African countries and see atrocities of every kind between Black African's native; and a few by White people. The images are so strong, that if do not feel at least some guilt seeing a diamond; it is just because you are blind or has strange life values or beliefs.It is true that white men created the huge mess in Africa; but it is also true that local corruption was (and is) the hand pressing the trigger. There are too many to blame for Africa's recent and not so recent history and the movie excels showing the cruelty behind it and even the absurdity of all that.However, the movie with all its good intentions is far from perfect. Perhaps shortening certain scenes and avoiding the ALL American moral ending could make the movie far better and do not diminish the impact of what you just saw; but as many movies intended to create some shock BUT NOT TOO MUCH, it almost implies that even when Americans consume 75% of world diamonds, they will never do it if they knew where they came from.Let's see how truth is in this statement.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond (2006) Review,"Rewatched April 19, 2023It's been like over ten years since seeing this film. This viewing was much different than what I remembered back then. Leo was just ok in this film. I'm sure the South African accent is a hard one to pull off (I know I for sure cannot do it), but it seemed inconsistent to me here... maybe that's just me. I feel like he should have been nominated for The Departed instead, which I feel was the better and more consistent performance. However, Djimon Hounsou is really great, so very believable as the father trying at any cost to get reunited with his family. The actor that played his son, Kagiso Kuypers, was also great in this child performance, especially in the scene where Hounsou's character is trying to deescalate his son (his emotions from feeling absolutely nothing to remembering everything and believing what is being said was portrayed pretty much perfect). The cinematography was excellent. I felt like the film ran too long, like it could have been cut down at least 20-30 minutes. Anyway, this is a short rundown on my take on this viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Lame, artificial, condescending","As with several other recent ""acclaimed"" movies that I've seen (e.g. Casino Royale, Borat) this movie was disappointing. No, more than disappointing, it was just aggravating. The little polemics that Zwick inserted throughout the movie were obvious and lame, which rendered the dialog plain embarrassing, and which caused the actors to look blatantly embarrassed, with good reason.Moreover, the whole black man/white man partnership has been rendered well in many movies, but in this, I found the ""partnership"" was condescending and patronizing towards the black side of the coin. It's not something unique to white film makers - some of Spike Lee's movies, for instance, are equally patronizing to other races - but it's still cringe-worthy, no matter where it comes from.The ending was enormously predictable, although even I didn't predict that it would be so drawn out and, once again, lame. How did Di Caprio get acting nominations for this? He made one truly great movie (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and has been struggling ever since.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama

I cannot rave enough about this movie,"When I saw Hotel Rwanda about a year ago, it was the saddest, most disturbing, most depressing movie I'd seen in my life. Blood Diamond is a very close second. And like Hotel Rwanda, Blood Diamond was masterfully done. It almost seems paradoxical that a movie so incredibly sad and morose could be considered excellent. But oddly, it is the movie's ability to evoke such deep and genuine emotions that makes it so good.DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly were phenomenal. I haven't seen every DiCaprio movie, but his performance in this picture outstrips everything before it. His character was very complex and layered and he nailed it. He displayed greed, love, ambivalence, and even honor. He was magnificent and I never even once honed in on the accent.Hounsou was equally wonderful. He delivered his role with such emotion and such believability that you'd swear that he was reliving an event he'd experienced before. In fact, it was the acting of DiCaprio and Hounsou that triggered most of the various emotions I felt while watching Blood Diamond. I say most of the emotions because the camera work and excellent directing to depict the despair of the African people triggered the rest of the despondent feelings I had.This movie successfully captured the plight of a people and the plight of one man, all the while seamlessly tying in other ancillary interests and conflicts, such as that of Danny Archer (DiCaprio), Maddy Bowen (Connelly), and other characters who were driven solely by greed. This movie was riveting, relevant, very hard hitting, and just gushing with excellence. I was told of this movie's merit and also duly warned because it is not for the faint of heart. But I'd say that the way that this movie was done was necessary in order to avoid belittling an otherwise great and tremendous issue. There was really no other way to impact the audience without the intense scenes and intense drama that was shown. This movie heaped one heavy hearted scene upon another, pushing the audience to the brink and testing our fortitude and resilience. Would we turn away to avoid a stark reality and continue to live happily ever after because ignorance is bliss. Or would we watch so that we can be apprised of what is going on outside of our safe confines and how it in fact has to do with our way of life. Yes, our fancies and indiscretions do affect lives outside of the Western world.As an African-American I felt especially obliged to watch Blood Diamond, and I felt especially saddened by what I saw. And I would be remiss if I didn't cite the most memorable line to me, and that is when Solomon Vandy said:""I understand White people want our diamonds, yes. But how can my own people do this to each other?""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The adventure is enough thought-provoking and the plot focused on modern issues like terrorism, armed conflicts and political upheavals. Actors play very well their roles, they even go beyond their parts - plus Jennifer Connelly's beauty is narcotizing - and the storytelling, though not epic, is inspiring. Runtime is a bit too long but the impression is always of something consistent, by way of guns, thrills but also full of demanding demands and responses.

Good but.....,"Omg, could have shaved off 30 mins of this movie if the makers didn't try and extend its audience to include the usual pointless love scenes.Hmmmm. Well this film was realistic in its portrayal of the conflict in Sierra Leone thats for sure. As someone that was in Sieraa Leone around Freetown aged 15 in 1985 when a coup occurred whilst I was watching a football match and also being offered to smuggle diamonds back to the U.K. by Lebonesse and English in toothpaste tubes (which I didn't do) this film echoes the continuing rape of third world countries by government entities such as my own. This is nothing new of course and 22 years later things are still the same. Blood diamonds indeed.Leonardo is pretty good in this and the accent not half bad. His character is a bit weak though as South African soldiers are usually tight lipped and hard as nails to the extent of eating glass with shots of booze. They would'nt divulge information to a newly met reporter thats for sure ! Sharing a bottle with a 'kaffa' is something also highly unlikely with a soldier from Rhodesia.

Jennifer Connelly wasn't even existing, however Djimon Hounsou's performance is the real reason to see this movie in the theater.

Although I do feel that the mini flood of African themed movies in the past couple of years is a bit lop-sided, with most people these days probably thinking of trucks carrying stoned child soldiers when they think about Africa.Anyways, 'Blood Diamond' is political and dramatic. Maybe at times a little bit to action/entertainment oriented in expense of the political framework. Leonardo DiCaprio reinforces his position as the leading actor of his generation.The only thing that bugged me was how they had to squeeze in the obligatory love story.

"Gripping, captivating, tragically sad","The political movie genre is going through a some sort of an Indian summer lately. Its newest incarnation is Blood Diamond, a violent action flick on first glance, but extremely deep and utterly tragic below the surface.This is a rare opportunity for non-Africans to get a glimpse on the tragedy of Africa: one of the most beautiful places on earth, exploited for ages by the colonial powers, then ravaged by its own people trying to scrape together whatever the colonialists left behind. The filmmakers have done a great job capturing the twisted situation of this continent. Caps of the beautiful countryside interchange with disturbing pictures of village assaults, child soldiers and bloody violence. Everything is held together by a fascinating and memorable musical score.The cast is top notch. I was never a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but he has surpassed himself in this movie. He has also undertaken a commendable effort to imitate a Southern African accent, even though he uses phrases like 'huh', 'bru' (South African slang for Brother or 'bro') or 'my man' way too often to sound truly genuine. Benin actor Djimon Hounsou makes a wonderful counterpart to DiCaprio's character, while South African celebrity Arnold Vosloo adds some authentic touches to his own character.This movie is well worth watching - for its story, for the camera-work, for the scenery and the score - but it is not easy. It stands in line with recent political efforts such as 'Hotel Rwanda', 'Lord Of War' or 'Syriana', and if you have at least one of these in your DVD shelf, you cannot miss 'Blood Diamond'.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Bold Action Movie With A Conscience,"After Director Zwicks impressive ""Last Samurai"" this is an impressive attempt at interweaving a modern action film with difficult contemporary modern issues. De Caprio, taking the lead, comes of age in an all action, but thoughtful performance. Beautifully filmed, and eschewing the gratuitous African ""Lion and Elephant"" shots, the focus instead falls on the bloody civil war in Sierra Leone.Although tales of the butchery have a wide currency, the chilling moments when victims are offered the alternative of ""short sleeve"" or ""long sleeve "" amputation of limbs is gut wrenching. The chaos and mindlessness of the indigenous violence is skilfully juxtaposed with the amoral actions, and inactions, of the diamond trade. As a snapshot of the brutality of the Civil War, and the complicity, of the Diamond Trade this is a searing success.Slightly less successful are the scenes of the mercenary forces.From ""cinema verite"" we career into ""Rambo"" territory. And although enjoyable in its own right the Big Action shoot em up sequences are not as effective as the smaller scale action scenes.Hollywood does rear its ugly head at the end. The tale is powerfully told and graphically illustrated. Point made. The finale depicting a conference condemning the Diamond Trade and espousing the merits of ""conflict free"" diamonds is quite frankly an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, and reprises the quite dreadful ""concentration camp motorcade"" addendum to ""Schindlers List"".Nonetheless this film wins a lot more often than it loses, and neatly interweaves a conventional action movie with a modern morality tale. it scores above average in both genres.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Conflict movie,"Good introduction to one of our contemporary world's most intriguing issues: how natural resources work as a curse for 'developing' countries, and especially for the population of those countries, where they are discovered.The topic has a rapidly growing scientific literature which has carefully pointed out that politics-wise it actually isn't all the same whether it be diamonds or oil that is found in a land (even though it may be the same for the ones who have their village on the spot). That is perhaps the only thing, however, that this film overlooks to a degree (as documented in some remarks by the characters), but that's rather insignificant and overall the movie does aim to be a careful recreation of the madness of the civil war in Sierra Leone - the very special madness that had a large number of elements to it that can be explained rationally, even if in a twisted way (such as, for example, the amputation of limbs as deterrence of resistance by a guerrilla force that wants to firmly control a vast stretch of the countryside without enough armed men for a full-out occupation of it).In taking that approach, the film avoids the mistake of starting from a moralizing perspective, and so it doesn't ignore the structural factors playing into what happened. To give you an example, even brutal RUF commanders have well-outlined characters, speak authentically and don't lack at least an excuse for an ideology - you can hear for instance their famous slogan, 'no more slaves, no more masters', that very distantly reminded me of the similar thing communists promised about putting an end to the exploitation of the working class in Eastern Europe, only to then turn into exploiters themselves. So this again shows that in most parts of the world it is just not enough even if you to wish to be a good person, you may still end up not being one. But usually, of course, there is a bandwagon-ful of people lacking any good intention whatsoever willing to go along with any ideology so long as it takes them to power.It is from this vicious circle that the whole human drama of the story starts. The RUF fighting for control of the mines so they can buy new weapons so they can continue to fight. A fisherman is taken captive by the rebels and only escapes the brutal chopping of his arms because he looks strong enough to do well as a miner (slave) for the RUF. He has to serve his new masters while not knowing if the rest of his family hasn't, or at least hasn't yet, been subjected to the worst possible torture somewhere. Meanwhile the techno-war rages on, drugs help the RUF get a steady flow of child soldiers hold their own in battle (and, mostly, in village massacres). Watch the movie to find out how, out of this situation, a diamond trader entering the scene at one point can become the provider of a ray of hope for fisherman Solomon Vandy. I could say some negative things about the ending, but I won't, out of respect for a mainstream Hollywood movie that dared give a complex treatment to a sensitive issue. To phrase my critique with similar complexity, things are not black and white here - they are dark gray and light gray. There is still room left for some too-easy distinction between shades of gray and for some heart-bleeding stuff, but then this is drama and not a documentary.In the latter respect, if you'd like me to liken the end result to some other recently made movie about Africa, I'd say it's in the league of 'Lord of War', though somewhat better than that film. It raises an issue that's worth raising, but doesn't do it with the same touch, in my view, that the makers of 'Hotel Rwanda' or 'The Constant Gardener' had. That shouldn't be interpreted as my judgment about the actors, however. Of the three leads, all great, I'll only mention DiCaprio specifically, because of the 'Titanic' syndrome that still continues to cost him. Feel free to forget 'Titanic' if you don't want to remember it. DiCaprio is great here, and I would say that even if he wouldn't speak in 'Rhodesian' and Krio English in the movie. He is just really weirdly credible as a South African veteran turned freelance diamond trader, knowing the moves in a fight, but also already feeling the effect of too much smoking.One of the pictures that stayed in my mind for a long time is also connected to DiCaprio. It's him carefully listening to his former commander's words on a South African ranch, looking in many ways different from, but in others similar to, the young Dia, the newly trained child soldier, listening to his RUF commander in Sierra Leone.To finish by something controversial, I'll point to this bunch of teens who were there in the audience when I saw the movie. They were laughing out loud a lot at the sight of violence. I didn't care so much at that moment, but now, coming to think of it, it's just so easy to imagine them turned into psychotic militiamen. Just a little training, you know. They came to watch the movie to see blood. To see hearts bleed literally. For them this was a 'blood movie'.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Highly recommend this film,"In a relation to diamonds trading, Blood diamond is the diamond mined in the war zone and sold to finance conflicts. Solomon, who is a fisherman, found a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels were attacked and Solomon is arrested by the government army. After that, the commandant releases Solomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Danny Archer who is an ex mercenary from Zimbabwe, he was looking for the diamond and finding redemption. Both men were joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. Upon meeting Solomon, and the beautiful Maddy who is an American journalist, Archer's life changes forever as he is given a chance to make peace with the war around him.There is a great interpretation between two excellent performers. Blood Diamond is an excellent example of one of the situation in the war.

It is beyond me how he has been nominated for an Oscar for this role! The film was like an open book, we read it from start to finish. Yet again Hollywood produces an action film with serious undertones. The problem is in doing so the Director has managed to insult the intelligence of the audience and Africa as a whole. The problem in todays society is that people don't read enough and aren't particularly interested in what's going on outside the bottom of their popcorn box and so films like Blood Diamond just add to the stereotypical image we have of the third world.

Heart touching display.,"The film is made again on another rising subject of Africa. There are a lot of activities going on in the world. We are unaware of all those and films are the best medium to show us what we might miss in a newspaper. The film explores the mindset of the people in Africa and how diamond industry works. May be films sometimes show unrealistic things but supposing half of them are true, I cannot imagine the horror that goes on among the people of Africa. The film has a lot of action along with a very nice story with a crisp direction which will take you to an entirely different world. Of course if Leonardo is in a film, much of the success should be attributed to him. It is a real treat to watch him bring a role to life. The role that he plays is very similar to that played in body of lies. The soundtrack is worth mentioning here which emphasizes the horror to a much more extent. The film is successful in exploring how trust swings as circumstances change and of course I got the hang of the ending in the starting only but it is the way how Leonardo successfully plays his character that kept me seated.

It must be incredibly hard to find just the right balance within a script when trying to combine the raw emotional gut-punch needed to convey the central message of a serious movie, whilst still making it entertaining enough to pull in crowds that will help to recover the budget. Edward Zwick and Charles Leavitt, director and writer respectively for Blood Diamond have fashioned a tour de force of film-making that exposes to a wider audience the harsh social and political realities of many African countries. Blood Diamond ranks alongside The Killing Fields in its sterling portrayal of man's inhumanity to his fellow man on an epic scale, whilst still retaining at its core a human interest story that can ground the audience that might be otherwise overwhelmed by sheer and pointless brutality.The principal leads in Blood Diamond give performances that are both powerful and sensitive as required and special mention must be made for Leonardo di Caprio. Di Caprio is rapidly becoming a cinema great; his on-screen presence commands the film throughout and his acting abilities are rapidly becoming exceptional. Recent movies such as The Aviator and The Departed serve only to confirm this. After all, who is going to argue with Martin Scorcese's view of Leonardo's acting talents? Referring back to the one-star haters of this movie, I cannot understand how people can find fault with his Afrikaans accent, which is superbly judged and studied throughout the running time  if it wavers at all (which I don't think it does) it is worth remembering that he is, after all, an actor putting it on for crying out loud. (Actually, as an aside, I am getting disappointed by IMDb letting through so many ill-conceived and poorly judged two or three line reviews by people who can't even take the time to spell correctly. I thought that there was ten line minimum requirement for review?) Anyhow, I am not going to deconstruct the plot  others have done that here far better than I can. Suffice to say that Blood Diamond fully justifies the praise afforded it, to all parties concerned. It deserves ten stars and will take its place among the pantheon of modern epics that deliver blistering social commentary as well as thrilling spectacle.Thanks for reading!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Reality of history,"Such real human tragedies deserve our attention. Now, more than ever, our power of buying as consumers can be informed in such a way that products such diamonds and their processed form come from conflict-free zones. This was an unbelievable interpretation of all actors who depicted the extreme violence and utilization of children indoctrinated to become terrorists, to a realistic level. An amazing contrast of the beauty of Sierra Leone in such picturesque placement of green mountains and luxuriant vegetation with the shed blood of victims and supporters of diamond smuggling reflect the sad truth that money, guns and power are everything important to survival. Ultimately, although dear characters of the movie take their life routes, truth and values of life take their supreme place on the set up stage. Brutality, illegality, terrorism, child abuse, all tie in one big story released in the Western world for everybody to learn. Solomon stands for justice!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent thriller but sanctimoniously self-righteous,"Hands hacked off to prevent voting. Young children trained to machine gun villagers. Try to fight it or try to survive? Try to fight it by getting rich first?Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler and ex-mercenary. He ferries ill-gotten gains from 1990s slave mines in Sierra Leone to fences in Liberia. The initial trade is diamonds for guns, but once in Liberia the stones have access to international markets. He meets Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who has escaped from a slave mine after risking his life hiding an enormous pink diamond. Solomon's son, Dia, went to school every day and dreamed of becoming a doctor - until he was captured by the Revolutionary United Front and brainwashed into becoming a child soldier. For Solomon, recovering the diamond could save his family. For Danny, it could be a ticket out of the cycle of violence in which he has become a willing player.Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist trying to expose the bloodshed and misery fuelled by diamonds. For her, Danny is a major potential story source. For Danny, she becomes a useful diplomatic player as they each try to use each other for their own agenda.Blood Diamond is a taut thriller, but how legitimate is its claim to be a vehicle for human rights?It made considerable furore. In the week of its British release, both The Economist and The New Statesman - leading influential newspapers - published related articles. DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar. The US diamond industry announced it would donate $10,000 to African charities for each star raising a diamond-studded hand at the event - a gesture condemned by director Edward Zwick as distasteful.The film is supported by Amnesty International and also by Global Witness - an organisation highlighting links between environmental exploitation and human rights abuses. Our average audience, in between popcorn and supersized CocaCola, is quite likely to take onboard the message that diamonds should be treated as a pariah like fur. Who wants to be responsible for tying the knot with a gem soaked in blood?To be fair to the film, it goes to considerable lengths to point out that Sierra Leone is now at peace and that regulation of the industry covers all but a minute fraction of diamonds. This was due to a protocol called 'The Kimberley Process' which now regulates trade in rough diamonds. 99.8% of new diamonds are now from conflict-free sources. This doesn't mean that there are not still millions of dollars of blood money involved in the trade of a few diamonds. Or that slavery and child-militias have been wiped out. But the rhetoric of the movie is designed to make us angry rather than conveying precise information. It has a blockbuster style that spotlights the (excellent) performance of its star Leonardo DiCaprio and makes the villagers the supporting cast rather than the focus. Its target audience may enjoy a feeling of righteous moral outrage, but will they linger to absorb the factual information in the credits or on the official website? Will they ask sensible questions when buying diamonds (such as, ""In which country were they mined?"" ""Were the stones traded under the auspices of the Kimberley Process?"" ""Can I see the guarantees""), or will they simply join the director in his tirade against any industry scapegoat, beneficent or not?Acting and editing in Blood Diamond are superb. What could have been a very predictable film, keeps us on seat edge throughout its two-hours-plus running time. DiCaprio is amply rewarding the faith that early directors like James Cameron and Woody Allen expressed in him at a time when the public viewed him as just a pretty face. Djimon Hounsou contributes a towering performance. Only the beautiful Jennifer Connelly is woefully miscast. She is at her best in expressing the subtly ambiguous, restrained feelings she develops for DiCaprio's character, but her portrayal of a hardbitten reporter that goes it alone in Afghanistan and darkest Africa comes less easily.Battles throughout are vicious and realistic. The film does an excellent job of documenting little known areas of human misery and also provides occasional momentary relief with the touching reunions or the re-educating of brainwashed children.Although Blood Diamond raises worrying human rights issues, careful examination suggests there is more than a hint of jumping on a left-wing bandwagon by the film's producers. It covers important issues but audiences are best researching them independently and understanding both the good and the bad associated with the diamond trade. For instance, diamondfacts.org shows the diamond industry in a much better light than the global witness website, though both seem accurate and factual. Much of the human rights abuses over diamonds since 2003 relate to the abysmal conditions in which diamonds are mined; or the failure of some governments to use diamond wealth to benefit the communities concerned. Liberia is already under UN sanctions. Dealing in conflict diamonds is illegal in the UK. The film barely tackles India, one of the weakest links in the present chain. Worst of all, the unproductive misunderstanding over the industry's donation for 'Oscar waves' was down to the irony that, in Sierra Leone, raising of one's hand to vote used to be a signal for the Revolutionary United Front to chop off hands. One has to ask if the filmmakers' priorities are human rights or the financial success that can ride on the back of making a hullabaloo.As a thriller, Blood Diamond has a cutting edge; as a protest film, it has as much subtlety as a machete while being careful about offending present day culprits. Finding a diamond story in present day Guinea rather than Sierra Leone might have been more to the point.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Diamonds are Death,"Blood Diamond is one hell of a movie, and I will rate it as a must see.Definitely is the best movie I have seen this year so far, and i felt mighty surprised that the Academy Awards have snubbed this movie in the nominations especially in the best Picture category which I feel it rightly deserves.What can I say about a movie which revolves around such a sentimental and touching topic ? Illegal Diamond trading in Africa and the civil wars is the primary theme of the movie. The makers of this movie have joined these two ideas and produced a superb script. With some amazing casting, this movie has been brought to life by Mr.Danny Archer and Solomon Vandy. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be getting better and better with each Academy Awards nomination he collects. This being his third, he is a very strong contender for Forest Whitaker. The character of Danny Archer the shrewd and cunning diamond trader who exploits the system, the government and the poor fisherman, farmers to get the diamonds. But even then late in the movie we find a soft side of him, when he sacrifices his own life to save the fisherman and his son. We find out about his horrific past. Djimon Honsu's portrayal of the fisherman is again superb. The poor fisherman estranged from his family by the war, finds his son taken by the rebels, brainwashed and fighting for them. His wife and daughter in a refugee camp. Jennifer Connelly's character Maddy Brown i again precise. A side character who in turn can do anything to meet her own needs, in this case a story about illegal diamond trading. Blood Diamonds. She unfolds the story about the Blood Diamonds and brings down the entire facade.Its really hard to tell your feelings for the movie after the end. I for one was at a loss for words. The one scene where, the fisherman is telling his son,""You are Dia Vandy. You are a good boy, who loves soccer and school. I am your father who loves you and is ready to take you back as my son again."" and the son has an automatic trained on him, will surely bring a tear to ones' eye. The background score for this movie was superb. So was the camera work. Some breathtaking footages about raw African beauty has been captured in the movie. An applause for the director for making a movie on this topic. Thank you sir for such a wonderful 2.5 hours experience.A 9/10 !!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Start to finish, Blood Diamond did not hold up","Although DiCaprio gave one of his best performances, well at least the first one that I have seen where I did not think of Titanic, the movie just did not do it for me. It started off well, but with the introduction of a weak love story, you found yourself asking WHY? In the end, I enjoyed the film, but do not feel it necessary to promote it. I am sure that DiCaprio has enough legions of followers that the movie is doing very well. I am glad to see that he is growing up and taking on more challenging roles. However, in the end, the movie could have been so much more, but Hollywood put its finishing touches on it - it seemed to fall into a formula of how to make a movie.

It is a tremendously well done movie, but it is on a short list of movies I love but never want to see again. This is depressingly poignant and real.All in all?

Zwick strikes out again,"I had my doubts about this film for one reason and one reason only; Edward Zwick. Zwick is one of those directors who can take a potentially brilliant film and reduce it to typical, patronising, Hollywood mediocrity; the kind of film you don't really need to see in order to know what happens and how (more recent examples include 'Legends of the Fall' and 'The Last Samurai'). Sure enough, that's precisely what he's done here.'Blood Diamond' is pitched as a gritty drama about the diamond trade, when in fact it's little more than a generic American action movie which happens to be set in Africa.Every African character in the movie is either a savage, a scumbag or a simpleton, DiCaprio and Hounsou being the ultimate of the latter two stereotypes respectively. The only character blessed with both decency and intelligence is - surprise, surprise - the American. Is this what America really thinks of Africa? If so, how dare they make a film that purports to care about the suffering of the African people?The diamond trade is little more than a backdrop to yet another action-packed ""story of one man's redemption"". Our anti-hero (Leo) is self-serving scum who learns to be a decent guy from a nice American girl. Besides the fact that this idea is obscenely patronising, Jennifer Connelly looks far too beautiful and well-kept to convince us that this girl-with-a-heart-of-gold has been slumming it around Africa for three months. Leo's character development is completely inconsistent and fuelled by awful dialogue and overacting by all concerned. These are all pretty obvious flaws, for which I blame Zwick, not the actors.Hounsou's character is a token ""poor, simple African farmer"" who so desperately needs the help of the white man and the nice American girl to find his family. While these supposed ironies are addressed in the film, its message ultimately seems to be a) that Africa is made up simply of sociopathic mercenaries and their victims, nothing in between; and b) that only the nice Americans can save them all from self-destruction.There is a sub-plot wherein Hounsou's son is turned into a child soldier by the rebels. Firstly, this seemed like it belonged in a different film, and the subject is more than worthy of some strong media attention which is to say, a film of its own. To make matters worse, the boy's transition is hammered home in truly amateur style through a series of over-the-top montages. It would have been much more powerful for the audience not to see the transition, but to see the boy he became and then come to understand how it happened. Ultimately, that part of the story simply felt forced.Alas, that part of the story was really the only part which showed just how awful the effects of the diamond trade are, as the rest of the film was dedicated to Leo's road-to-redemption-movie-by-numbers. Leo does very well with the two-dimensional character he is given, despite Zwick's tendency to push actors too far into the theatrical, and his accent is consistently convincing. That said, his performance in 'Blood Diamond' doesn't come close that in 'The Departed', yet the Academy chose not to acknowledge the latter.Jennifer Connelly seems to have little function other than to look beautiful (which she surely does), and struggles to bring the character to life. Hounsou, however, is typically brilliant and virtually unrecognisable in his role, as his every gesture and mannerism is that of the character. One does get the feeling that Zwick pushed him hardest of all, as his underplaying is periodically interrupted by its antithesis.Some fine acting aside, what we are left with is ultimately just a hollow action movie, a sort of sub-par Indiana Jones, if you will. The action sequences are very well done, but one cannot help but feel a little guilty in ""enjoying"" them, given the context of the film.The action and drama wouldn't be complete without James Newton Howard, whose score reflects the pretentiousness of the film beautifully. Why is it that film-makers want to make a movie about Africa, and have an African score, but they don't want to use an African composer? Needless to say, the music is a completely pseudo (think 'The Lion King'), western interpretation of African music, which only serves to discredit the film further.As for the political intentions of the film, there are early reports that it has had a negative impact on the diamond trade. Some papers even reported that certain diamond outlets offered to give $10,000 to charity for each celebrity that wore a diamond to the film's premier. Realistically though, how long is it likely to be before the next slew of movie divas and rappers make diamonds fashionable again?Sadly, this film is so wide of the mark that it stands no chance of having a lasting impact, despite its noble intentions. The real problem is that however ""real"" or ""shocking"" it strives to be in order to put its message across, it is still just another American movie, and the audience - knowingly or not - always have that comfort in the back of their minds. The reason film-makers like Fernando Meirelles and Alejandro González Iñárritu pull off films like this, is that they take away that comfort.'Blood Diamond' is, at best, a small, guilty pleasure. Of course, it's sufficeiently manipulative to dupe most people into taking it seriously, hence the high rating. It'll be interesting to see how many useful votes I get for this comment... I'm sure they'll prove my point.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Diamonds Are 4ever....they'll never leave in the night,"Leonardo DiCaprio was very good as the young mercenary.

"DiCaprio sustains ""irresistibly vulnerable"" antihero appeal...","After ""The Departed"", Leonardo DiCaprio once more proves he is all grown up with Blood Diamond. He is terrific in this film with an amazing South African accent, and a credible troubled past and tough guy front. He excels at being the irresistibly vulnerable antihero you can't help but root for.Jennifer Connelly was also perfectly cast and believable as investigative journalist Maddy, and she and DiCaprio acted superbly; too bad they lacked chemistry. The heat between them just wasn't enough to graduate into a sizzle.Directed by Edward Zwick (Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Glory, Last Samurai), this pseudo-documentary about the conflict diamond trade in Africa effectively preaches its message while entertaining the audience. However, Zwick lays on the drama too thickly, milking each scene too often, with some sequences running on too long (sobrang babad). After a while, I thought I was watching LOTR or an episode of Lost. While this is a great way to educate people about a cause, nothing new was really given from a film-making perspective. The story unravels in disappointingly safe Hollywood formulaic fashion, a pity when there was so much material, talent and background to exploit further. Still, Zwick manages to arouse enough emotion from audiences enough to make them part with their money for admission, and in that respect, this film is a success.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beware when you wear diamonds!,"*Danny Archer : Sometimes I wonderwill God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other? Then I look around and realize God left this place a long time ago...

It is the worst humanity crisis since the second world war. Just as Danny Archer mentioned, maybe God left this place a long time ago while the civil wars begun, but as the Kimberly Process was signed by many countries, conflict diamonds had been decreased to lower than 4% of the diamond market. And residents in Africa may have the right to live in a peace world. ""Without love, diamond is just a sparkling stone.""

Why It Is Oscar Worthy ?!,"What an unconventional plot! This movie is beautifully scripted, directed, and acted. It possesses within it's fiber all the makings of a truly perennial piece of cinematography. The catharsis effect is unimaginably great. I felt differing emotions such as urgency, remorse, travesty, love, and an everlasting friendship. This is indisputably beyond the pale - it is one of the best movies I have seen in the year 2006.My only regret, is that I didn't get the 'theater' moment, as I sat in the chair, my eyes glued to the computer, my mind, body, and soul attached to the series of event, that unfolded and those to be unfolded. My heart felt for the characters - albeit the fictional addendum to the plot; to me it was outer-body moment, I was there, I was feeling.The character Maddie was an interesting one. At first, I felt nothing special about this typical 'journalist role,' who is without mistake or folly, a seemingly beautiful and radiant young lady. However, I felt she was just another pretty face on TV. Indeed, I was wrong. Truly misguided, or was that the intent of the director? - Which further underscores his brilliance. For you see, even if it was unintended that she (Maddie)came off blah and dull initially, the development throughout the film captivated me. I believed her and the story she was selling to the audience.I felt her pain, her desires, and aspirations for a better life. This to me, was authentic and genuine - practically priceless.Conversely, if indeed the director intended this successive, slow but gradual shift in emotional paradigms - then, he is masterful; making an intentional and climatic build-up. Either way, the character of Maddie was beautifully and meticulously constructed into an object of pure perfection. Her relationship with 'Danny' - the white South African was extraordinarily sincere and unconventional. One can't help if (s)he is endowed with a God-given functioning heart not to gush and glee over the beautify and sincerity that lay in the relationship both in death and life.The film is also jam-packed with numerous elements of sub-plots, themes, and motifs. Due to the constraints of time and to sustain your interest in reading this post I shall offer a succinct listing of these. Love, manipulation, intra-racial subjugation, and finally, hope. As the credits role, I am left with an emotional conflict between redemption and loss. Two very integral emotions that seems to fill the void that was generated at the movie's beginning and so, I was feed. Not my usual preferred climatic ending - perhaps, some would justly argue - an anti-climatic result. Either way, in this case beauty is not in the eye of the beholder but it lays underneath the curtains of this film. From start to finish it was truly exceptional.Oscar worthy, absolutely! Insofar as, it could represent a quintessential message of civil war, continental robbery, and destruction that long predicated and marshaled the United Nations' agenda to do exactly what it's doing now; stopping the blood shedding via 'Blood Diamond' or otherwise.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Whilst the shoot-outs and car chases will refrain your butt from numbing, the political issues will have you stroking your chin all the same.","If diamonds really are a girl's best friend, they must be an African's worst nightmare, as Blood Diamond uncovers the filthy truth behind the murky trade business of conflict diamonds. Ed Zwick's new film is an issue movie, dressed up as a rip-roaring action-thriller (or an issuetainment film to all you Sun readers). The issue of conflict diamonds is raised right at the start, as a table full of UN ""peacekeepers"" discusses the problems with how our sparkly necklaces may have, at one time or another, been drenched in crimson at the hands of smugglers.Our story centres on the family of Soloman Vandy (Honsou), a fisherman from Mende whose village is ravished by an armed mob of diamond smugglers, sealing Vandy into slavery, and kidnapping his son. A South African smuggler by the name of Danny (DiCaprio) is thrown in prison for smuggling, and it is here that he meets Vandy. Learning of Soloman's catch of a massive diamond, he uses him in order to make the sale of a lifetime. Unfortunately, his quest to locate the stone is complicated through both Vandy's son being brainwashed by the RUF mercenaries, and a journalist by the name of Maddy Bowen (Connolly), who they need to take them to the site of the diamond mines.Despite coming under some criticism for his (actually quite good) African accent, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a refreshingly evil performance as the cold-hearted diamond smuggler Danny Archer. But it is Djimon Honsou, as the man desperate to find his family, and escape the wrath of the RUF, who has the stand out performance. Vandy goes through a whole checklist of emotions, each resonating with the audience with true conviction and power. You can almost taste the sweat and smell the fear from his mannerisms. But perhaps the star of the show is the director, who specialises in making entertaining pictures out of political issues. Blood Diamond strikes a worthy balance between the thrills and the chin-stroking.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

When I saw he saying goodbye to them and Maddy Bowen, I felt very sad and it really touched me. I think the movie is an excellent movie, it reflects the society problem of blood diamond.

"It's a ""flawed"" gem, but worth the time (like 143 minutes worth!!)","This is a movie that tries to be all things to all audiences. Its a conscience tweaker like ""Hotel Rwanda"", an action flick and even has the romantic overtones you'd expect from the casting of Leonardo and Jennifer. It's hard to make all three of those jell into a total success, but Zwick has succeeded as well as can be expected.First and foremost it is another gut-wrenching history lesson about the blind eye the world turns towards Africa. Well, that might be unfair given they depict a UN camp of over one MILLION refugees and describe it as the 2nd largest in the country. Since the UN is there supporting the effects, rather than causes of the strife, the ""world"" is at least trying to patch up the blowout. I believe this is based in fact. Real Diamond Companies are indicted and real UN resolutions are alluded to.The action flick head of the movie is fast paced, frightfully bloody and given the ""heroes"" multiple narrow escapes (as in dodging several thousand bullets) is a total stretch of believability. But the show must go on, greed must be explored, fatherly love must be exalted and journalistic integrity satisfied.The romance is handled well enough, with Jennifer Connelly looking better than ever (and in her case, that is saying a lot!!), Leonardo baring his soul and justifications bit by bit and the seed of a mutual understanding and affection planted.So, these three elements add up to an rather entertaining, satisfying whole, but not without much time and effort from the viewer. Yes, the Connelly character seemed convenient to carry plot points, and later, our emotions forward. Yes, a change of heart or two takes place for an emotional kick. Yes, good triumphs over most of the evil we are presented with. Welcome to the Hollywood blockbuster version of the world's strife and suffering.Almost 7 / 10!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clichéd nonsense......,"Having read many other reviews of Blood Diamond on this site, I feel compelled to post my own. It seems everyone who viewed this film was blinded by Leonardo's highlights. Hollywood rarely deals with Africa well when depicting it on celluloid. Blood Diamond is a showcase for a strained and showy performance from Dicaprio. The illegal diamond trade became merely a backdrop for several Rambo like action sequences. Anyone viewing this film with little knowledge of African people would come away thinking they are mostly bloodthirsty diamond grabbing savages. The simplistic portrayal of Djimon Honsous' character does little in humanizing the African for the viewer. Yes, he is an honest fisherman and loves his family, yet he is still merely a prop with minimal depth. Honsou is an accomplished actor who comes through the best with the worst material.In a scene where Jennifer Conollys' journalist character questions why she is bothering to illuminate the atrocities carried out in Guinea and Sierra Leone, she states that her story could just turn in to an infomercial like the ones depicting starving African children with bloated bellies. The irony was all too much. While highlighting such stereotyped representations of Africans by the media, the film itself did not escape such pitfalls. It was guilty of the very same tired African representations it claimed to be distant from.There were also numerous aspects of the plot that defied logic and common sense that i will not get in to here. The movie was also far too long capped by a preposterously melodramatic finale. It seems the exploitation of the Africans to sell products to the west continues, this new product is called Blood Diamond.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Right Up There with Hotel Rwanda & A Place in the Sun,"It's graphic but there's not a clean, nice way to tell a horrific story.

Sounds an awful lot like the line from A Place in the Sun where Bruce Willis says ""God left Africa a long time ago"". Seems to me that the writers could have worked a little harder at being a little more original.

"Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is a blend of gripping drama and frightening reality","For most of us diamonds are a symbol of status and wealth, but in the countries where they are mined it stands for nothing more than racial oppression and economic exploitation.Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is a blend of gripping drama and frightening reality that captures the conflict for the possession of precious stones.It is an edge-of-the-seat action thriller with morality as its subtext. It's difficult to find a superlative for Zwick's excellent craftsmanship which keeps you hooked till the end.As the story unfolds you gasp in shock, flinch in pain, shudder at the unrestrained brutality and by the time the movie reaches its climax you are dismayed and disgusted seeing the so-called civilised people losing their sanity in quest for diamonds.It is one of those rare films that leave you satiated but at the same time has lingering effect on the mind. You are haunted by the images of innocent children, who are kidnapped, brainwashed, drugged and forced to take up arms to terrorise and kill people.You are likely to have an aversion to the precious stones after watching the film.Set in Sierra Leone during the 1990's civil war, it revolves around a diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an ex-mercenary who can go to any length to possess a pink diamond found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsoun), a fisherman.Vandy is a victim of the civil war carried on by hell-raising rebels executing one of the most brutal military campaigns to make more money for themselves and the so-called sophisticated diamond merchants.During an attack by a rebel group, Vandy is captured and separated from his family. The rebels forced him to work in a diamond field and while digging for the precious stones he finds a rare pink diamond and hides it. But, before he could retrieve the priceless stone, the diamond field is attacked.What happens after that forms the climax of the film! Performance wise it is flawless! DiCaprio is simply awesome. He has certainly come a long from his days of ""Gangs of New York"". His maturity as an actor is evident in his two back-to-back releases - ""The Departed"" and ""Blood Diamond"".His character has many shades in the film and he excels in each of them, especially in scenes where he brings forth his character's internal conflict.Djimon Hounsou as Vandy, one of the many Africans who dreams of a normal life, immensely impresses you with his performance. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Hounsou is indeed a highlight of the film.Apart from DiCaprio and Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly too impresses as a journalist who tries to expose the consequences of the conflict through her write-ups. However, she is aware that it will not have the desired effect on people tucked away in a safe world.She knows people will read it, discuss it and then go back to their routine lives.There was a lot of hype about Indian actor Gaurav Chopra sharing screen space with Hollywood biggies, but he just has a blink-and-miss role in the film.The director has not only succeeded in extracting the best from each of his actors but has also managed to put across a moral message without making it too preachy and melodramatic.""Blood diamond"" is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""you find yourself a good man, alright Maddy""","For me, there are three stories going on simultaneously in this movie. First is about the state of Sierra Leone and infighting over blood diamonds - this goes on in the background and forms the basis of whole movie. Second one is about Leonardo, the soldier, smuggler and the survivor, along with Solomon Vandy, the native, fisherman, and a father, and their search for the diamond and their lives in between. Third is the relationship between Connelly and Leonardo - I don't know if I can give it any name, but I don't think I have ever seen such a powerful unexpressed chemistry between two characters in any other movie (and I haven't seen Casablanca or Gone with the wind). There is no kiss, no hug, not even a handshake, there are just words, there are just unexpressed expressions through the eyes, movements of the throat and thats all you need (just to clarify I am more of a mafia, drama, biopics, history genre kind of a guy) Connelly is as beautiful as she has always been, even in her unglamorous journalistic attire, and is quite convincing in her character (perhaps too good looking). Leonardo is natural self, which means fabulous, may be at par with his Howard Hughes role in Aviator. In all, its a very tightly written gripping script - I watch it every time it is on TV (sometimes just to get to the last scene between Leonardo and Connelly). Pity that it didn't get any academy - I would have expected it to at least win for supporting actor or editing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Often bleak but certainly compelling,"With its brutally honest look at the harsh realities of life in war-torn Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond can at times be a hard movie to sit through. But there is no denying the fact that the story told here is very powerful and compelling. With atrocities occurring all around this film certainly has its share of painful, depressing moments. But the story is so good, and that story is performed so well by a fine cast, that the film is well worth your while.The film is set in 1999, when Sierra Leone was in the midst of a brutal civil war. In the midst of this war, the big business of illegally exporting diamonds out of the war zone carries on. Our story here mainly focuses on two men caught up in this illicit, and often deadly, business. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a loving husband and father living a relatively simple, peaceful life as a fisherman. That peaceful life is shattered when rebels come to his village, take his family away and put him to work searching for diamonds. The other key character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is Danny Archer, a ""soldier of fortune"" as he describes himself who makes his living smuggling diamonds out of Africa. These two men's paths will cross in jail, Archer there after one of his smuggling efforts goes awry, Solomon having been rounded up in a government raid on the rebels' diamond mining operation. While in jail, Archer learns that Solomon has a secret. Just before being hauled off to jail Solomon had found, and proceeded to bury, a huge diamond of immense value. When the two men are released form jail, they form an uneasy alliance. Solomon will lead Archer to the diamond, Archer will help Solomon find his family. These mens' respective quests, and their very different motivations, will drive the film.While the story certainly is a strong one the film does tend to drag at times. A few scenes left on the cutting room floor probably would have helped matters. There are some ""action"" moments sprinkled throughout but it's certainly not an action film. It's well-done compelling human drama. Hounsou is terrific in his role, brilliantly bringing the strong, powerful, determined Solomon to life. DiCaprio is also very good, although in a minor quibble, he never does seem entirely comfortable with the accent. Jennifer Connelly has a smaller role as one of those idealistic investigative reporters who always seem to turn up in movies like this. Her character in many ways is very clichéd but Connelly does a good job with what she has to work with. All in all this film may fall just short of being labeled great but it is certainly very good and well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
diamonds are a warlord's best friend,"Diamonds. For years they have been treated as exotic and glamorous. Maybe they are the type of things worn by high society, but the story of how they ended up on the market is one of the ugliest. ""Blood Diamond"" tells the story of several people whose lives cross due to the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leone. It begins when fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is walking his son Dia to school, when the rebels attack them. The rebels set about turning Dia into a child soldier while making Solomon mine diamonds that they use to finance their war. But Solomon manages to escape.Meanwhile, there's Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an amoral jack-of-all-trades from South Africa looking to make a few bucks off of the diamonds coming from Sierra Leone. While in Sierra Leone, he meets American reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), tired of having to report on pap when there's a civil war going on in the country. But when the rebels start closing in on the capital, Solomon, Danny and Maddy have to flee together. As time passes and they look for Solomon's son, the three of them are forced to reconsider their loyalties to various causes.Aside from showing the brutality inherent in Sierra Leone's civil war, the movie gives you a sense of how, in the midst of a civil war, the common people probably view the revolutionaries as no different from the dictatorship; Sierra Leone's government was pretty vile, but the rebels became just as bad. If the movie has any problem, it's that we see a lot of the events through the eyes of white people, and thus the whole issue looks sort of like another civil war in Africa. But overall, I think that the movie did a very good job showing how the diamond trade has financed some of the worst atrocities of the past ten years.Also starring Arnold Vosloo (of ""The Mummy"") and Marius Weyers (of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"").",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Worth seeing, but the filmmakers might have missed the mark","This movie doesn't change your life in epic ways; however, every time you go to the mall, or see an ad for Kay jewelers or even see the diamond ring of a wealthy woman in a restaurant, you will think of this movie. You will wonder whether or not the diamond in the glass case was smuggled across a border, or whether someone was shot for it or not. You will wonder if it was mined by slave labor, digging through muddy rivers while brainwashed AK-47 wielding children watched, anxious to kill somebody.What should be noted are the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of his career and is utterly convincing as a South African (by way of Zimbabwe) mercenary who's seen too much bad in Africa to be anything more than an anti-hero. Djimon Hounsou tries hard not to be the black and white character that the script has written for him, and performs well for what he is given. Of note are his devastating emotional outbursts. His screaming truly portrays anger and vanquish, and its quite powerful.I enjoyed this movie, but there was something not quite right about it. The scenes involving ""love interests"" have a cheesy oboe tune playing in the background. The scenes of children killing innocent villagers have poignancy and remind me of the seriousness shown in Black Hawk Down when the little boy shot his father trying to kill Twombly. However, the villains seem pretty one-dimensional, and a lot of the action stinks of special effects and Hollywood exaggeration.Had the film focused more on the devastating effects of the Diamonds-for-arms trade, this movie could've found itself in Oscar territory. However, it pushed too hard to be an action movie, and the moral of the story was pushed out of focus for too long to really be driven home.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Solid movie, with some excellent performances","Africa is a war torn country. Over the past century it has been plagued by minor and major conflicts, some which are still apparent today. Creating a film that is set and based upon such events is both risky and sensitive, but Edward Zwick once again fronts old critics with an engaging, dramatic, enlightening and overall a very entertaining experience. The story basically revolves around Danny Archer (Learnado Di Caprio) a diamond smuggler who learns of a diamond which has been buried by an African fisherman Solomon Vandy. Solomon agrees to show him the where abouts of the 100 carrot diamond in return for some help in finding his family. However in a country which is seriously ravaged by war and poverty this is no easy task. It was good to see that Blood Diamond is not scared to portray the realism of living in Africa in that time. While violence and gore is strong in this film it is certainly not over the top, which for many people will be a welcome change.The performances in this film was the main highlight for me though. While Di Caprio outdoes himself and excels as the aggressive, and also at times sensitive smuggler. Djimon Hounson is the main star. His performance was uplifting, strong and very convincing.There is very little negative feedback I can say about Blood Diamond. Perhaps there are some unconvincing moments involving Solomon Vandy and maybe at times the term "" Hollywood "" could be used but overall this is a very good film. Good writing, excellent performances, lots of action, an enthralling storyline, and Learnado Di Caprio with a awesome accent makes this a certain Oscar nominee.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Movie,"In recent cinema history, I can rarely remember movies that hit so well on all fronts. This movie had it all. The action is heart-pounding and nonstop, and additionally, it does not distract from the storyline. The viewer sympathizes most with Hounsou's character, as his motivation is strictly as a family man. Yet, the interesting part arises from the sympathy the audience will want to give to DiCaprio's character, who is utterly horrible. The romance story is slightly underdeveloped, but this most likely corresponds to the lack of emotions the characters can give to each other since the setting and situation of war is emotional enough. Overall, the movie shines: the performances are spot on, the script is well written, and the cinematography is splendid. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Powerful, difficult to watch","Blood Diamond is a powerful film. It was very difficult to watch due to the subject matter, and cried for the people of Africa not five minutes into the film. I liken the effect to that of Schindler's List, but whereas the Holocaust happened 50 years before that film, the atrocities surrounding African conflict diamonds is happening now. The most disheartening thing is that not much is being done about it.But Blood Diamond does have heart. It has a big heart that refuses to give in to cynicism and despair. It is an ""if only"" film--as in, if only more things this world-changing would happen in real life--yet it is far from being idealistic. Hopefully, everyone who sees it will take it with them long after they leave the theater and will remember it the next time they find themselves eying a diamond in the jewelry store.As for the actors, Djimon Hounsou shows again what a powerful actor he is, and Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better. He has had a great year between this and The Departed, and is becoming better at his craft every time he appears in a film. I love Jennifer Connelly, but she makes little impact here.Edward Zwick continues to make powerful films.

Important  and perfectly executed - one of the best movies ever made!,"Living in New York City, I used the opportunity to see a pre-screening of Eduard Zwick's latest movie and with BLOOD DIAMOND we have this year's major Oscar contender. Not only will this film get nominated in all main categories but it will most likely take home the big ones like BEST MOVIE, BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST SCRIPT, BEST EDIITING, etc.If not BEST DIRECTOR, as well as the BEST ACTOR trophies for either DiCAPRO or HOUNSOU - are they going to be pitched against each other?! JENIFFER CONELLY is excellent too, but she will face the toughest competition since female supporting roles are the ones women usually get in Hollywood, but let's not get side tracked.Enough Oscar talk, the season is not yet here and there's still room for another movie to convince that much as Eduard Zwick's masterpiece does. I doubt however that any other still to be released movie can keep up with the high quality of BLOOD DIAMOND. The topic is as relevant and important as the topic of a movie can be. It's almost filmed as a documentary. Mr. Zwick never lets you from the hook. There's lots of shooting and dying and only occasional breaks that let you breath again. There's no room to slow down, there's no shelter to take, no room for peace.Life, as we, who are able to peacefully watch movies in theaters, know it, is put upside down. The society has gone bonkers! Violence, injustice, cruelty everywhere.

Human Greed at any cost,"I just have to start by saying this is one of the best films of the last 12 months - violent? Yes! Historically correct -probably! Exciting -Yes! Well-acted - Very much so! Good photography - Yes! The list of positives could go on, as there is so much to this movie, and when one now understands the problems and the travails that Sierra Leone endured in the 1990's, the rest of the world should hang its heads in shame. Leonardo de Caprio reaches his peak thus far, and continues to impress more in each movie I've seen him in - his role is very much an umsympathetic one yet he is able to win you over - Jennifer Connelly is very competent in a smaller role, while the supporting cast are superb, with accolades going to the character of Solomon - a tour-de-force achievement.

Too Distracted by its own Message,"Blood Diamond reviewed by Sam OsbornFilms should be made to tell a story. For me, that's their only function, and it's a function that's beautiful and endless. A message film is a hindered film because it never keeps its eye on the ball. It's like taking a class where your professor is Miss Universe; your attention is directed to the right object, but never for the right reasons. In order for us to believe in a message, we must first believe in the story it has to tell.The message in Blood Diamond, of course, has something to do with diamonds. The title, a delicious double entendre, refers to the pink hue of the diamond in question, and also to the blood spilled in trying to obtain it. The obtainer is Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Zimbabwean diamond smuggler with a South African background. His charge is to hunt the diamonds down, buy them for cheap, and hump them across African state lines to sell them for an illegal profit to Van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a two-faced diamond retailer mirroring the real-life De Beers. The diamonds involved in this trade are known as conflict diamonds, since the groups that initially profit from the sale are warlords and rebel groups who force slaves to do the requisite mining for them.Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a father stolen from wife and three kids to work as a diamond miner, sifting rocks from gems in a muddy West African river. He stumbles upon the blood diamond, burying it just before a happenstance government raid puts him in a Freetown jail. Also in this jail is Danny Archer, having been caught smuggling diamonds under the skin of a goat along Sierra Leonean border. When Danny gets word that Solomon knows of the diamond's hiding place, he spins a deal to bail both of them from prison. And because Danny owes a certain Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) some lost diamonds and Solomon's still missing his family, the two have reason to go diamond-hunting. Jennifer Connelly works her way into the story as Maddy Bowen, the frustrated journalist looking for the inside scoop on the conflict diamond trade.DiCaprio turns in a satisfyingly ironic performance here, seeming to exploit all the reasons people despised him in the first place. He plays a would-be fraternity brother who seems to have been accidentally born into African violence. He's an overconfident prick with just enough oil-slick charm and big-bulk intensity for us not to hate him. Connelly doesn't have much to work with, granted, but her sympathetic maternal stares at Hounsou could have been laced with more condescension. But then again, maybe not. Hounsou hammers out an affecting role from the little he has to work with. The man is best when screaming and barreling through in a blood-soaked fury, and Director Zwick gives him numerous reasons to do so.Zwick's direction is lively and strong, giving Blood Diamond a much undeserved umph. But the screenplay devolves its characters into the African sob acts we've seen played out on the Hallmark Channel before: Connelly's American journalist looking to make a difference, DiCaprio's heartless cum last-second humanitarian, and Hounsou's sad African from infomercial land. And as many lines as they can spew on about the ignorance of certain first-world nations and the schmaltzy National Geographic articles cranked out each month, their own uselessness is always underlined by the film's paucity of power. The story turns like clockwork, all mechanical and repeated, because the characters seem always on the verge of looking straight into camera, asking for a tax-deductible donation to save the victims of the conflict diamond trade.Samuel Osborn",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond exceeds expectations,"Tonight I saw a sneak peak of the movie ""Blood Diamond,"" and I entered the theater with low expectations. Previews for the movie came off as weak and melodramatic, yet I had the slight hope that Leo would continue his superior acting streak from ""the Aviator,"" and ""the Departed."" My preconception was both right and wrong. I was right about Leo, he was phenomenal. I would not be surprised if he were nominated for Best Actor this winter. His South African smuggler character is believable, as well as charismatic and driven. I was truly wrong about the movie itself however. ""Blood Diamond"" is a great movie. It is powerful in it's portrayal of civil war torn Sierra Leone, yet an incredibly fun and entertaining movie from beginning to end. Gritty action mixed with a spanning story of a brutal struggle for diamonds, family, and greed. The fact that actual events were not too dissimilar from the bloodshed in the movie are what makes this movie really touch a viewer. SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another film with potential shafted by lazy writing,"The first indication that something went very wrong at the screenplay stage in Edward Zwick's new film Blood Diamond occurs around the twenty minute mark, when Leonard DiCaprio's character is asked, ""How long have I known, you, Danny?"" Attention, anyone with even a vague interest in film: this is poor screen writing. There is no quicker, more dependable indication of a lazy, sub-par writer than this little ditty, which appears in an astonishing number of very bad scripts. It is a writer saying, in essence, ""I cannot be bothered to think of a way to impart this information in natural, conversational dialog, so I will simply have one character ask another character something that no human being would ever say to another, because I have total contempt for my audience."" Because, really, why would any person ever ask another person how long they'd known each other? Don't they both know? The screenplay is again the downfall of a film with potential in Blood Diamond. It is not quite as bad a script as the one that Emilio Estevez slapped together for Bobby, but it's a photo finish. Estevez' scenario was full of one-dimensional characters and bland, clunky exposition, but there was a little bit of color and voice to at least some of it; Blood Diamond plays like a filmed outline. The film is built around the germ of an intriguing idea, and everything follows a fairly logical progression, but none of it happens in a particularly interesting or memorable way.DiCaprio stars as Danny Archer, a smuggler and hustler who overhears a holding cell confrontation between a rebel soldier and Solomon (the reliably soulful and effective Djimon Hounsou), a diamond field worker who has hidden a huge, uncut stone in the jungle. Solomon was taken from his family by the rebels and only wants to find them; Archer wants the stone, and figures they can help each other out.There's also the predictably hot American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), who pops up every once in a while to engage in political arguments with Archer and provide him with an uninteresting pseudo-romantic subplot. There's a lot of talk in Blood Diamond-- about Africa and the diamond trade and working for change and American complicity and so forth, and there are two problems with all of this talk. The first is that these lengthy political discourses are usually followed by a car chase or a shoot-out, and the two mix uneasily. The second is that when people have these conversations, they turn into mouthpieces; nothing is less entertaining (or interesting) than A Film With An Agenda, and when a writer is not clever enough to engage in subtext and instead has every character constantly represent exactly What They Believe, then we're veering into Crash territory.The structure is less than perfect; the film takes entirely too long to get going (and at 143 minutes, it overstays its welcome considerably), and it arrives at what looks, feels, and should be an ending before going on for at least ten more minutes with an entirely unnecessary epilogue (though said epilogue does give us the required moment where the journalist, seeing a private, personal moment, puts down her camera to keep from exploiting her subjects. Shattering stuffback in the 80s, when we first saw it).However, Blood Diamond is not altogether unsuccessful. There are some moments of real power (though they are fleeting), and however incongruent the action sequences might be, they are well-staged and shot by director Zwick. Connelly does reasonably well with her poorly developed role (no talented actor should be saddled with her stump speech on what it is to be a journalist), and DiCaprio is refreshingly effective as a scumbag (though his accent is a tad dodgy, and his third act change-of-heart is entirely out of nowhere, even by Hollywood standards).So, yeah, even what works requires qualifiers. And the film's successes are shattered by the laugh-out-loud moment in the end title cards where the audience is informed that these ""conflict diamonds"" still make their way, in spite of legislation to the contrary, into America, so (and I'm quoting here) ""it is up to the consumer to insist that diamonds are conflict free."" By that point, I was expecting MacGruff the crime dog to pop in and encourage us to take a bite out of exploitation.Blood Diamond is reasonably well-made, and as well-acted as can be expected. It is not bad in any particular way, or in any particularly aggressive way. It is just sort of bland and uninspired, and there are too many fine films in theaters now to kill two and a half hours with this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent is all I can say,"Wow, I wasn't expecting this. I wanted to go see Apocalypto but it was sold out. Thank goodness it was. This movie was an eye opener in every way possible.

I recommend it and hopefully some Oscars are coming there way. To me, DiCaprio, did an outstanding performance as well did Connelly, but Hounsou will definitely get the supporting actor award.

Worthy and welcome,"There are not many Hollywood movies shot in Africa that deal with a specifically African subject, so this examination of the role of conflict diamonds in wars such as that in Sierra Leone is worthy and welcome. It is written by Charles Leavitt (""K-PAX"") and directed by Edward Zwick (""The Last Samarai"") and it was filmed largely in Mozambique with other scenes in South Africa.The film does not flinch from depicting some terrible images including child soldiers and limb amputation and raises the question of responsibility of the diamond industry plus governments and media. However, at heart this is an action thriller revolving around three very different characters: African-born white smuggler Danny Archer played by Leonard Di Caprio whose accent here may vacillate somewhat but whose thespian talents continue to grow; Solomon Vandy, a local fisherman and father, portrayed by Benin-born Djimon Hounsou who was so memorable in ""Gladiator""; and American journalist and campaigner Maddy Bowen acted by one-time model Jennifer Connelly of ""A Beautiful Mind"".Politically this is a somewhat simplistic offering but its intentions are honourable and it manages to be entertaining as well as instructive.",,Anonymous,Drama

Bad Editing; Music Score 180 Degrees Wrong; Acting is Superb!,"The editing doesn't let you dwell or savor anything. The editing is singly responsible for destroying any cinematic quality the film could have, whether it's grace, elegance, or narrative. The editing never allows a single thought on the cinematic narrative speak. It's the largest cause of the film's weakness.The music score by James Newton Howard is way off. During scenes where our main characters are trying to escape rebel forces in order to either save his family or find salvation, the music chooses instead to be testosterone driven and percussive, completely missing the reason d'etre, and making it a vanilla action scene all about rebel invasion. Even if it was the Director who made this poor decision, it was Mr. Howard's responsibility to illuminate to Mr. Zwick the poor direction that choice is. That the right choice was not made, either says Howard is ignorant to such score-film dynamics, or is too passive or weak of a creative team member to actually heighten any film he works on beyond just the power of the Director's own boundaries.The story is in itself undeniably important. It doesn't fail on this level at all. Except perhaps by being unbiased and insensitive.Last and most important, DiCaprio's performance would be easy for Academy Members to feel proud awarding a nomination at this year's Oscar's contest. That isn't to say he'd win, since the film he's in is whirling around him at sub par levels to his performance, but his job is stellar, 100% top notch, and it's an easy non fiction vital subject matter that is politically correct to support.See it.

Thoughts,"I have just seen the movie at a screening, and I thought it was very well made. The trailers did no do Leonardo DiCaprio's acting justice, since it seemed that his accent was not accurate, but after listening to the rest of the cast and their accents, DiCaprio's is actually surprisingly accurate. The funny part about the film is that it seems to be one of the few DiCaprio films where he doesn't take his clothes off. It seems to me that Hollywood has such an attraction to the physical side of a player that they distract the viewer from the acting and the storyline by adding love scenes etc. something which this film did not have any of. The film was beautifully shot, with amazing establishing shots, which at certain points, although beautiful, made the movie appear to be too long. Overall, the acting was great and the film was well shot. The storyline was accurate and realistic, mainly because of the lack of a love scene (which obviously seems unnecessary, but many filmmakers would have included).",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another disappointment,"I'll give Blood Diamonds a 3 for the visuals but everything else about this film, from the script, to the ""acting"", to its themes were just plain bad.Going in, I thought this was going to be a thinking man's movie, but all I got was a young boy (Leo) trying to play a grown up bad boy by growing a face full of beard and putting on a god-knows-what accent (Is it African? Australian? British? Who knows!). Leo is one of the most overrated actors of all time. He was great in Basketball Dairies and Titanic but he CANNOT play a tough guy and certainly not one that needs an accent. Throughout this entire movie, he had one expression on his face for 95% of the time, and that was his ""oh I'm really serious and quite angry"" look. That's NOT acting, there's no range, no emotion, he's just frowning his face and delivering his lines while moving his eyeballs and looking away from the camera for a slight variation so hopefully the audience doesn't get bored.Then Connelly's character, a ""journalist"", suddenly appears at the right spot and blooms this one dimensional relationship with Leo in a matter of a few hours. The two of them go on a little ""adventure"" in the outback of Africa. First of all, what newspaper/magazine operation would send a woman like that on her own in the middle of a warzone without any restrictions whatsoever and allow her to go anywhere she wishes? Second, was there even a point to her character other than to add cliché romance and tell us that this white woman isn't a bad person but she cares about what she's writing (like it would have went down any other way).This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. One moment it was comedic, the next it was a drama with some lame-forced romance added in. Suddenly out of nowhere roll into this shaky-cam, 3 seconds per shot-sequence that looks like it was taken out of a Borne movie. It is riddled with one coincidence after another. In one scene Leo's character somehow finds Connelly character after escaping from a warzone in which every civilian including local soldiers all died in. In the next scene, you have the father being locked out of a refugee camp filled with a million people then out of nowhere the family he has desperately searched for magically appears right infront of him. Wow! What are the odds? When our three main ""heroes"" are lost in the woods they somehow end up in the backyard of a friend's house whose sole purpose was to give cliché lines about life, morality, death and righteousness then eventually get shot to give the script some ""dramatic"" effect.This is nothing more than an Oscar bait with a huge budget and a stinker of a script. Is it really about blood diamonds? No, this ""romance/action"" film could have had any other backdrop and it would have turned out the exact same way. I'm very disappointed by this film. It's the type of movies that come out these days with a lot of hype but absolutely nothing to back up for it. Sure you have starpower with a controversial hot topic but that alone does not make a movie decent. If they only made a movie about AFRICANS and kept it about the BLOOD DIAMONDS then you'd have had a much better film, but of course this is Hollywood, so if the film does not contain big stars with sex appeal the studio wouldn't have okay'ed it.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Everything you want from a suspense adventure movie and a cut above: this one informs about 'conflict diamonds,' 'child soldiers' - gritty livelihoods beyond US","'Blood Diamond' is the story of Solomon Vandy (the fisherman, the family man, the father - passionately portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) in Sierra Leone who by circumstance, ran into Danny Archer (the soldier of fortune, loner without family ties - Leonardo DiCarprio is Archer, accent and all) from 'Rhodesia' who by chance met Maddy Bowen (the persistent war correspondent - a naturally convincing journalist by Jennifer Connelly) an American who's been in Capetown for three months. Story spans from Sierra Leone, Africa, cross continents to London, United Kingdom. [1] Director Edward Zwick (and his producing partner, Marshall Herskovitz of Bedford Falls Productions - gave us ""The Last Samurai"" 2003 with Tom Cruise) once again delivered a memorable meticulously executed film journey, with well-researched informative story subjects. [2]By Hollywood standard, it is an entertaining film with involving drama of intersecting lives crossing paths and superb performances from the three leads (and a solid debut from young Kagiso Kuypers as Dia Vandy the son), with well-paced action & sound of explosive city-in-turmoil military scenes. Yet no scenes are gratuitous: scenes of war, civil or any scale, are never mind-settling; the 'child soldiers' segments felt 'documentary-real' - mind-boggling (can they really do such 'heinous' things?), and on diamond mining - provocative (is that how diamonds are extracted from the earth? Is human kindness ever universal?) Script by Charles Leavitt ('K-PAX' 2001, 'The Mighty' 1998), cinematography by Eduardo Serra ('Girl With A Pearl Earring' 2003, 'What Dreams May Come' 1998), music by James Newton Howard (w-d M. Night Shyamalan's films; 'Batman Begins' 2005) and proficient production team complemented the sensitive (ever perceptive and responsible) direction by Zwick.Some scenes could be difficult to take, but this is an engaging, touching film, and informing (eye-opener) to worlds beyond 'us'. 'Conflict Diamonds' and 'Child Soldiers' are existing realities, 'Blood Diamond' the film has made a difference, the crew, production and distribution companies. It's a movie not to be missed.[1] Sierra Leone is a country on the Atlantic coast of northwest Africa. Formerly a British colony, it became independent in 1961. Its capital is Freetown. Population 2 million.[2] There are detail behind the scenes production notes accessible on the official Web site at 'blooddiamondmovie.warnerbros.com'. The 'EYEWITNESS' section tells how director-producer Ed Zwick connected with documentary filmmaker Sorious Samura (his actual experience in Sierra Leone and ""Cry Freetown""), who became the 'soul of the production.'",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"BLOOD DIAMOND (Edward Zwick, 2006) ***","This film created some controversy when it emerged because it exposed the grim realities behind the diamond industry. Combining action, politics, romance and star power, BLOOD DIAMOND is well-made but essentially manipulative and sentimental; one even begins to doubt its intentions, whether it was genuinely made to raise awareness of the situation in South African diamond-mines or film-wise exploit their novelty and scoop value!Leonardo Di Caprio is saddled with a silly accent - I personally found his performance in THE DEPARTED (2006) more impressive; Jennifer Connelly is pretty good, but her character seems like a glamorized version of a modern female reporter; as for Djimon Honsou, his undeniably heartfelt performance too often translates into grating hysterics. The rambling narrative sags alarmingly in its third act and, in any case, the film is full of the hand-held carnage we've been suffering from for the last decade or so!It's been a week since I've watched BLOOD DIAMOND and, honestly, I can find nothing more appreciative to say about it which would justify my relatively high rating.

"Brilliant all around...powerful, intense, and thrilling.  One of my all time favorites","Blood Diamond is among the most impactful films of recent memory. It ranks up there with films such as Schindler's List and United 93. Similar to United 93, Blood Diamond brings into focus an atrocity which is affecting our world now: the struggle for control of the diamonds in Africa. This film focuses on the perspectives of a diamond smuggler named Danny Archer (Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), a fisherman called Solomon Vandy (Oscar Nominee Djimon Hounsou), and a journalist named Maddy Bowen (Oscar Winner Jennifer Connelly) as they struggle to understand each other during a search for the Blood Diamond in the middle of war torn Africa. After Solomon is separated from his family after a rebel invasion, he discovers the blood diamond, which he quickly hides during another rebel attack. Soon after, Archer recruits him to find the diamond with the promise that he'll see his family again.The film does not pull any punches when showing us the conflict between the governments of Africa and the rebels plotting to overthrow them. We also get brief glimpses of the political side of the conflict, but it is mostly the up close and personal violence. This film is not for the faint of heart in that the violence and subject are not physically overdone (there is a fair share of graphic violence and gore), but the are emotionally disturbing. Most of the violence involves children and unimaginably cruel men.The acting behind Blood Diamond is among the best of the year, without a doubt. Only 'The Departed' can boast this kind of talent. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply brilliant as Danny Archer, the flawed, intelligent, and dedicated smuggler who will stop at nothing to get the diamond. DiCaprio gives us the best character of the year, a character motivated by greed and desperation, but one who is still human and can feel after witnessing so much horror in his life. DiCaprio commands the screen and your attention for the entire film. Easily his best performance of his career. DiCaprio disappears into the role of Danny Archer, and many times you'll have to remind yourself that it's him...Archer is, at times, scary and emotionless, but at the same time, DiCaprio shows that he is a truly good person. With one of the most powerful performances I've seen, Djimon Hounsou will blow you away with is amazing and emotional performance. I believe he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar over Alan Arkin (no knocking Arkin, he was great). Hounsou already has the reputation for this kind of thing, but he blew me out of the water with his performance in the film. His role as the man who is as dedicated to finding his family as Archer is to finding the diamond is so emotional and gut wrenching, that it's not hard to love him. Hounsou and DiCaprio feed off each other in a way that makes their roles even more believable. They both disappear into their roles and make this film brilliant. Jennifer Connelly is, as usual, excellent. While she is absent from most of the film, she is great whenever she gets on there. She has good chemistry with DiCaprio, and their early meetings provide us with some comic relief. Like Hounsou and DiCaprio, Connelly's character is extremely dedicated. All three of the characters are very similar: they are all truly good people, all of them are dedicated to their goal, no matter what the cost, and all three of them change somewhat throughout the film.Edward Zwick's work on this film rivals his work on Glory and The Last Samurai, and that is saying something. The music is one of the key parts of the film, as it makes the scenes even more powerful. The mood of the film is established perfectly by Zwick. Once the film gets going, you'll know exactly what it's about. Another great thing that Zwick does is that he makes the messages and themes easily visible to us as an audience. Those themes are dedication and survival. With Blood Diamond, Zwick brings to the stage an issue that is silently affecting the world. These wars in Africa have been reduced, but not been eliminated. With the graphic violence and emotionally moving acting, the foursome of Zwick, DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly have constructed a film that stands for so much more than just an adventure film. I recommend Blood Diamond to all age 17 and older, but those who couldn't take Schindler's List or United 93 probably won't be able to take this either. It is a truly impactful and important film. A must see.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

very good if not great.... but DiCaprio's performance is the stuff dreams are made off... and Honsou deserves an Oscar,"I'm continually surprised at the maturation of Leonardo DiCaprio... his performances in the Aviator and The Departed were simply amazing, yet to some of the general fan base of cinema, he continues to be thought of as just another pretty boy teen beat cover story... this film marks yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio. Along with his performance in the Departed, the Aviator, Gangs of New York, What's eating Gilbert Grape, and even Catch me if you Can and Romeo and Juliet... Blood Diamond joins the list of films where Leonardo DiCaprio proves he's one of America's top actors today, if not THE top leading man.....Now I guess if I have one complaint it would have to be I guess the accent he uses, but it's more or less one hundred percent accurate...it's just that everyone's accent from that region is a little hard to bare so... I don't blame leo, in fact I only brought this up because it might tire for some and it's really my only complaint, but is in no means a major factor to whether or not you'll like this film...Also, as I've said, I think Leo's performance in The Departed was simply amazing, and I hope he wins a best actor Oscar for it, but after seeing that movie I thought Jack Nicholson was the leading candidate for this years bestsupporting Actor Oscar....that is not true anymore. Djimon Honsou'sperformance in Blood diamond is probably the best supporting performance I've seen this year... it's arguably the best ofhis career in a career full of great performances...

Blood Diamond- They Are Not A Gal's Best Friend **1/2,"An overly violent film dealing with diamond smuggling in Africa. Sierra Leone is where the action is at.In a rather stunning performance, Leonardo Di Caprio portrays a soldier of smuggling who gets involved with Solomon (a fine performance by Djimon Hounsou. The latter's son has been kidnapped by a rebel gang. They have converted captured children into robot-like killers. Don't mess with these dudes. Even Fagin's band of thieves would fear them.Jennifer Connelly plays a photo-journalist caught up in the revolutionary violence.Nothing is spared from the viewer in recreating the bloody, gory scenes.Somewhere along the way you get confused regarding who the good guys are in comparison to the bad ones. Naturally, Danny Archer (Di Caprio) develops a bond with Solomon similar to the running of ""The Defiant Ones"" Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis of that classic 1958 film.The ending scene is similar to Gary Cooper's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Leo Scores Twice In One Year - One Of The Years Best""","Archer is a diamond smuggler who is thrown in jail after being caught on a routine smuggle. Solomon is a fisherman who is captured by guerrillas and is forced to mining diamonds. Solomon comes across a rare diamond and decides to hide it. A raid occurs and the 'RUF' and the diamond miners are thrown in jail. This is where Archer and Solomon meet and where the word about the diamond being buried is let loose.Blood Diamond is the second film to feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the year 2006. The other was 'The Departed' and both films found their way to the Oscars, with Leo's performance in Diamond going up for Best Actor. While I personally believe the stronger performance was in The Departed, Blood Diamond still is an awakening to the viewer and not only send out a message, but entertains its audience at the same time. Not many films can do this, but Diamond executes it very well.Zwick's previous film was 'The Last Samurai' with Tom Cruise. That film was good, but it left me with an awkward feeling. Everything was good until it's bogus ending, in which Tom Cruise, the one American, is the only person who survives the onslaught at the film's climax. All emotion is basically stripped at the end. With Diamond, Zwick learns from his mistakes in Samurai and is actually able to convey some emotion in this film. With a depressing story being told, Zwick needed actors who were able to translate this emotion, he found them in DiCaprio and Hounsou.Both actors received critical acclaim for their performances and rightfully so. Hounsou captures the screen with every minute he graces it. Playing a man who is tripped away from his family and then learns his son is captured and turned into a soldier is demanding, but Hounsou depicts everything perfectly, even stealing some scenes away from DiCaprio. DiCaprio scored big with 'The Departed' and here is smacks another one out of the park. Before the film came out all I heard were negative things about him in this film, most people nitpicking on his accent. Truth be told, it's pitch perfect and is consistent all throughout the film. DiCaprio is intense and believable all throughout and deserves his Oscar nomination, even if it is for the wrong film.Blood Diamond feels like two films, one wants to entertain the audience with it's thrilling action scenes and gun battles galore; while the other feels the need to beat us over the head with the message that we may have blood on our hands. While the film does a fairly good job at balancing the two, at times it's just blatantly obvious that the one outweighs the other. By the way, it's the message and not the action. Through dialogue and actions from the characters might as well just turn to the screen and tell us that ""This is bad"".Straight from the start you know how real and brutal the film is going to be. It's relentless with it's killings, most notably on the village raid in the opening scenes, tying in with the message that the film is trying to get out there. On a technical aspect the film is beautiful, from the desert grounds to the green forests. The art direction and cinematography are both breathtaking and add to the overall authentic experience this film offers.Blood Diamond, is a film that delivers what it promises. It delivers its message when it needs to and the action when it needs too, only in a few instances it faults. With great performances and beautifully filmed scenes, it's no surprise that Blood Diamond is one of the years best films. Although it could have been a little shorter, clocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes. The film tends to drag in the final 20 minutes. I can recommend Blood Diamond, it will most certainly entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
great action and good acting,"Notwithstanding the clear political agenda, this movie is one of the fastest paced 130 minute action movies i can remember. And despite becoming famous with a pretty face, Leonardo is a very capable actor and potentially one of the great actors of his generation. Jennifer Connolly pulls her own weight. The standout is Djimon Hounsou, who ultimately carries much of the movie.There are definitely moments when the special effects remind one of Apocalypse Now, but in this case, the action includes the main characters in most scenes, making the intensity of effect all the more real.The child who plays Dia is also to be noted, as he acts both in words and facial effects, in a role that must truly risk emotional scarring.All-in-all, one of the top ten movies of the year, in my estimation.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Touching but not memorable,"I was apprehensive about this movie considering the ambivalent critic response and the huge outpouring of African tragedies that have come out in the last year (The Constant Gardner, The Last King of Scotland etc.) My reaction after was: Alright...could have waited until DVD.The story is about the illicit diamond trade in Sierra Leone. Blood Diamond's strong point is showing a beautiful country (sadly, not actually filmed in Sierra Leone) torn apart by a horrific civil war. Neither the rebels nor the government are portrayed in a favorable light, and the characters are just trying to survive in the crossfire.Portraying an African-born white diamond trader, Leonardo DiCaprio does a credible job with a believable accent. However, every once in awhile he became ""Leo"" instead of Archer (I didn't feel that way about him in the Departed). Hounsou is compelling as a fisherman trying to find his son.The romance between Connelly and DiCaprio seems to have been heavily edited out or should never have been there in the first place. Their story works better as strangers using each other and eventually coming to an uneasy understanding. Not a deeply felt love/attachment.In the second half, the movie focuses on the characters and their goals instead of the civil war at large. At this point, I was tempted to check my cellphone for the time. While the movie was compelling depicting the actual events of the civil war, I never really cared about the fates of the individual characters.I believe its valuable and necessary to learn about Sierra Leone's recent civil war.

a beautiful movie  made right from the heart with beautiful message,"Blood Diamond was a great hard-hitting movie with heart-felt story and brave performance by Leanardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou. The StoryWest Africa is dominated by diamond smugglers who are capturing the poor and innocent people to use them as a slave for digging out the diamond stones underneath the ground. A fisherman is captured and forced to work there. During one such operation , he finds a big piece of diamond which he hides at secret place. Leonardo Dicaprio is hired by mafia to find the man and search for the diamond. The Review Directed by Edward Zwick ( The Last Samurai ) , Blood Diamond is a path breaking film never attempted by any on silver screen. Right from the beginning , the film is hard-hitting and gives a sympathetic feeling for innocent fisherman and their kids who are brain-washed by the diamond mafia and turned into a terrorist. Leonardo's character starts off with negative vibes but his transformation into good human being is the highlight of the film. Few scenes do stand out. The jail scene where Solomon vents out his anger at the mafia leader. The interaction between Leonardo and Djimon in the beginning and how they become friends and help each is the highlight of the film. Hats off to Edward Zwick for making a brave film like. It really takes courage to showcase how a small piece of diamond can bring in a huge difference when it sold in European countries. Screenplay holds your attention right from the beginning and is crispy. Cinematography is awesome capturing the rough terrain of Africa with aplomb. Background score goes well with the film. Leonardo Dicaprio is superb. His transformation from a bad-ass army guy into a good human being with big-heart is captured appropriately. Djimon Honsou completely surprises you with powerful performances. He get into a character of a man who must do anything to protect his family. Jennifer Connelly provide ample support to the star cast. The Bottomline Overall , a beautiful movie made right from the heart with beautiful message. Highly recommended 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Shattered Illusions about the Stark Reality Behind,"This film not only sparked my love for cinema but also instilled a deep desire to visit Sierra Leone, the setting of this memorable work. In Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography, ""Blood Diamond"" stands alongside ""Titanic"" and ""Inception"" as a favorite.The film revolves around diamonds, specifically 'blood diamonds' as indicated by the title, which refers to gems mined in war zones and sold to finance rebel militias.The film probes deeply into geopolitical dynamics, questioning the persistent civil strife in Sierra Leone and examining its intricate relationship with neighboring Guinea. The film suggests a semblance of peace, but it's premature to consider the absence of civil war as a true resolution. The country's wealth is still low, and there is a need for support, especially in the medical field.Additionally, the film brings attention to the 'pink diamond,' a symbol of controversy and rarity, with a reported occurrence of only 1 in 10,000 compared to colorless diamonds. With an appearance rate said to be 1/10,000 of that of colorless diamonds.Released nine years after ""Titanic"" (1997), where DiCaprio portrayed a young, struggling artist, ""Blood Diamond"" showcases his evolution from his twenties to his thirties.""Titanic"" (1997)
""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002)
""Blood Diamond"" (2006)
""Inception"" (2010)Though set in a land distant from Japan, the film mirrors the turbulent past of Africa, it also captures the ugliness of human nature surrounding the value and rarity of diamonds and other minerals.

A truly awe-inspiring movie with a powerful message,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out in cinema. To give you a glimpse into my life, i was suffering from an eating disorder at the time and was very very ill at the time. My dad took me to the cinema in an attempt to try and connect with me. The story of a father doing everything he could to get his son back from the arms of an African warlord was emotional enough on its own. When my dad said that he would do the same to get me back I truly broke down and it was a turning point in my life. From that point I got the care I needed and am now writing this review as a final year medical student in at Cambridge university. How things change, huh?Well, back to the movie. The story line hinges on the discovery of a huge diamond that was hidden by a father who had his son taken by an African warlord. When the DiCaprio's character learns of this, he uses the father to get the diamond, whilst the father uses DiCaprio's influence on various means of transportation to get his son back. A sort of mutual agreement. The journey these characters go on from there, both physically and emotionally, was just incredible. The script was well-written and the acting was truly some of the best I had ever seen. In particular, DiCaprio's accent made me believe he had been South African born and bred.Honestly, I cannot fault this movie. Maybe it is because it has such a special place in my heart, but I think it is more than that. I never cry watching a movie, but there is always one scene (near the end) that gets me every time.

Almost great.   So close.,"Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is a local fisherman in 1990s Sierra-Leone, whose son Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) has been captured by the RUF. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian diamond smuggler coming slowly to terms with the corruptive nature of his enterprise. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a maverick American journalist striving to expose the war's atrocities and dodging no punches in doing so. Their lives thrown together by the traumas of the nation, they embark on a harrowing odyssey that takes them from one side of the spectrum to the other, from the war's most rudimentary horrors to the corporate diamond dealers working behind the curtains, Bowen in search of the mother-lode story, Archer in search of the mother-lode diamond, and Vandy in search of his son, whom the rebels have turned into a soldier.The film dives headfirst into the horrors of the conflict, but does so responsibly, without ever losing its sense of direction. The plot, while bordering on convolution, makes adequate use of all its characters, and manages to address nearly all of the war's most prominent attributes without feeling forced or unnatural.On a visceral level, the film fares especially well. The battle scenes are superbly shot, the use of color is amazing, and the machine gun fire is so encompassing that it went on rattling in my head a full three hours after I walked out of the theater. Hollywood, in its anti-war persuasion, has a long-standing tradition of removing all the glamour and virtue from the battlefield, but the one thing it hasn't transplanted, at least not measurably, is war itself. The class of conflict we see in Blood Diamond  far from the battlefield, far from the domain of soldiers and trained professionals, and far, even, from the needs and ideals of the people in its shadow  is, for the most part, uncharted territory. In their chaos, brutality, and total lack of redemption, Zwick's battle sequences show us just how low civil conflict can sink, to a greater extent than any other movie I can think of. The scenes depicting the child soldiers and their mental conditioning are of a piece all their own, and can't be praised enough.Yet for all its merits, there's still something rotten at the heart of the movie, and it has something to do with the dynamic between Archer and Vandy, Archer dominant, Vandy subservient. It's Archer who leads the operation, Archer who makes all the crucial decisions, Archer who saves the day whenever the going gets tough, and Vandy who wanders dutifully behind, distinguishing himself only by his way of his blunders.And that's just the beginning.At one point, the two pilgrims express their bewilderment at the savagery and frequency of African conflicts. It's a perfect opportunity to pose questions about the ongoing effects of European colonialism, but Zwick chooses instead to leave the question unanswered, and even goes a little in the opposite direction, suggesting that the African psychology might be inherently violent.But it's not the implied racism of these details that bothers me so much as their distraction from what the movie should inherently be about  the Sierra Leonians and their struggle for survival. It's their future at stake. Their nation. Their diamonds. Their war. As such, it should be their story that we're focusing on, but instead, we get the story of an outsider, and experience the war from his point-of-view. Danny Archer is, beyond doubt, an interesting figure, and so is Maddy Bowen, if somewhat woodenly portrayed. We definitely want them in the movie, but we want them in supporting roles, not prancing about in the foreground. The core of the story should be Vandy's search for his son, not Archer's search for redemption.

"""Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?""","When did action-adventure movies become so relentlessly mercenary, with scenes of bloody torture and mass mayhem (vis-à-vis political turmoil) replacing all the thrills? Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is morose and despairing--bloodshed in the sunshine--and is filled with ludicrous platitudes and world-weary observations from characters who fail to learn from their own mistakes. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia (talking with a clammy, unconvincing accent) who attempts to partner up with a poor fisherman from Sierra Leone, Africa (Djimon Hounsou) whom he believes knows the whereabouts of a rare pink diamond. A sub-plot about the fisherman's young son being trained for the guerrilla army is pretty brutal, yet it's just used as padding for this story, as is Jennifer Connelly's fatuous role as an American journalist who spits out bitter cynicism about her wealthy, indifferent country (after joining the two men, Connelly asks DiCaprio if she's exploiting the fisherman's grief, a question which the filmmakers would be well advised to ask themselves). Extremely well-produced and filmed, the picture has just one standout performance (by Hounsou, whose urgency grounds the movie in a solemn reality) and much screaming, gunfire, and anguish. Zwick may have purposefully ditched the high-end adventure of old-school films in the smugglers genre, but his political high-mindedness is a drag and the dialogue and most of the characters are insufferable. *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie to let you think of how artificial prices are set and what the people of Africa suffer for diamonds and War.,"Really short and sweet, without the dissecting of the movie. Watch it. Judge for yourself. Really lets you think about conflict diamonds when next you even make a purchase. This movie let me really think of and research diamonds overall online. Lets you also think of the artificial price diamonds are set at in order to keep the price high.OK. IMDb says I have to submit 10 lines.In MY OPINION as an avid movie watcher who does not dissect a movie but just watches a movie an comments on my personal opinions and how the movie lets me feel. IF I watch a movie that will persuade me to buy it on DVD then IN MY OPINION then that is a good movie.I do not care about what this movie will be likened, the stars in it, what they starred in before, who are the other stars and also what they starred in or plot lines.I judge a movie on the actual Movie and how the actors of this movie portrait ed the Movie and how the movie felt to me. And not by what movie critics think of it as I think they are always thinking ""Is this movie Academy Award material""IN MY OPINION. this was a brilliantly acted movie. I was totally into the movie within 10 minutes.It felt real to me, which is important in a Drama/Action/Adventure movieI could relate to the characters and feel their pains. I have no idea what it would feel like to like in a conflict zone but after watching this movie, I doubt it would be a pleasant experience.MY Opinion:Watch a trailer, which is fairly accurate of the movie, and judge for yourself if this a a movie you would like to watch.My opinion.

Powerful drama about love and greed,"18, almost 19 years apart from the release of Blood Diamond, this movie is already a sensation, a must watch for thriller lovers. I figure there is not much I can talk about this movie, in 2024, that has missed reviews back then, but I will give it a shot.Let's start with what is wrong in this movie, the things that don't work.Even though this movie is rated R, we see little violence overall compared to what a true R movie is nowadays. This lack of explicitness has a toll on the character development of Dia Vandy, especially at the later stages of the film.The feud implied by characters Colonel Coetzee and Danny Archer due to Danny's failure is too simplistic. Yes, Danny's apartment gets trashed, but that is the extent of the damage. Maybe this side story could have added additional tension to the overall story arc.The love arc between characters Danny and Maddy Bowen is also lacking a bit. Feels to pure and fantastic, especially when character Maddy explicitly asks Danny if they are not going to ""do it"", but, then later, their love is pretty much Platonic, idealized and ramped up to muse level.One negative thing that truly stands out is America's involvement on it all. The story makes it like America is the one peacemaker, the bringers of True Democracy and Fairness, the Eagle of Justice here to defend the oppressed and poor. We all know how trueful that is, how much America likes to get involved in things.But all this is little compared to the power this movie has. Nit-pickings for the sake of this review, they exist but they remove little from the overall story.The story itself is a great depiction of conflict diamond exploration, its price on Africans, the lives it destroys, the lives it builds. A story about the cruel world of a continent's richness exploration and salvaging. A powerful drama exposing all this to the world to the lens of great actors.Enough said.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
I got a message!! Lets not bother with a decent director???,"OK it's got a message. The film actually says that only 15% of diamonds come from conflict zones so the odds are your diamond came from somewhere else. Incidentally the only decent pink diamonds come from a mine in Australia,so not much slavery there. Oh yeah talking about slavery!! The next time a black person goes on about 400 years and guilt of white people,maybe you could tell them to have a look at this and say what about now. I know they are still gonna turn it around and blame whites again,but there's no way out of that argument,unless they are in total denial. The journalist character gets silly as the movie goes on and all of a suddon she's talking photos??(black and white...Ohhh how very dramatic!!) Still there is plenty of action although seeing as Decaprio is supposed to be a super soldier it looks a bit camp as he seems to flinch when the bullets are flying. Just another thing. I brought back a rough diamond from Ghana(still got it somewhere) years ago?? and they are not that valuable,and it's quite expensive to have them cut and then you have to find someone to actually buy the thing. The movies a bit like fox hunting It good to hate rich people and also good to feel sorry for poor Africans.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Very Underrated Film That Deserves More Attention,"Blood Diamond is directed by Edward Zwick and is the true story of Denny Archer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a smuggler who, in the middle of a civil war in Sierra Leone, meets a fisherman named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) that is the only man who knows the location of a giant diamond, buried deep underground. With the help of a news reporter named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), they must find the diamond, and Solomon's family, before the native rebels, or the British military, find it, or them.This film is very underrated. I wouldn't say it's one of DiCaprio's best, just because of the rest of his filmography, but it really is a great movie. I only had a couple of complaints, and that's really saying a lot. Although Edward Zwick, the director, hasn't really done too much, he really does a great job with the camera work. Every shot captures the African landscape beautifully, and really pays respect to the film's cause.The acting is also amazing. DiCaprio, as always, does fantastic, and Djimon Hounsou does really well too. I've seen him in other stuff, namely Gladiator (2000), but he really shines in this movie. I would even go as far as to say that this is his best work. Jennifer Connelly does really well, and also sticks out, in a good way. She plays a strong female role, without having to have a man beside her, despite the inevitable romance in the film.The action in the movie is very well directed, and is paced well. There's no sequences of non stop action, but there's not any boring parts either. The action scenes and drama scenes are spaced evenly, and add to the film in a good way. The hand to hand fights were very well choreographed, as were the firefights. The last pro I have is the score. The score for this, done by James Newton Howard, really pounds into you the feel of the movie, and really won't let you forget the theme. This film was mostly made to let privileged people know what life is like in third world countries, and it does a great job at it, especially with the ending, where the score was at its peak, despite how good it was through the whole film.The only real complaint I had with this film is the transition of scenes toward the middle. Now, this is a bit confusing, but I can explain it. Say in one scene, it would show the character of Danny talking with Maddy, then the next scene would show Danny and Solomon having a conversation. Now, this is a problem because the movie doesn't explain where the other character, be it Maddy or Solomon, is at the current time. Not all scenes were like this, and this is very nitpicky, but I would've just preferred a bit more clarification.In short, Blood Diamond is a very underrated film, and worth anybody's time. I suggest you check it out, and even buy it on Blu- Ray; you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond,"The story happened in a village in Africa. It begins with Solomon Vandy's son, Dia, who was caught by the rebels. Solomon was also caught to work in the diamond field where he found an extraordinary rough diamond. While in jail, hearing Soloman found a pink diamond, a man called Danny Archer - an ex mercenary from Zimbabwe is deeply attracted because he could make a huge profit once he gets it! One condition that Soloman promised to find the diamond is finding his son back Blood Diamond is an exciting movie in whole as the sound of guns is surrounding nearly every scene. Sometimes, I was even shocked by it! Of course, it is also a quite moving while Solomon got reunion with Dia but he seemed forget about his father and even holding a gun and pointing at his father. In fact, this movie does not have impact on me because I am indulging in diamonds. However, I realize that I am living in a really lucky generation and place!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Blood Diamond, not the best it could be","Personally, the way the people of this time and place were represented was rather one-sided, and didn't have any heart whatsoever. The heart lay in the main characters, and was well-written in that respect. It's just the people of the land, especially the children, that seemed completely and irreverently heartless. Even if these children were supposed killing machines, there's no way that they couldn't have felt some sort of guilt. Yes, this is shown in one instance, when a child kills a man blindfolded for the first time, as part of a training program for infantile foot soldiers. But, nonetheless, this aspect should have been shown in more than one instance for the good of balancing out the characters. In Shakespeare, every character, even the utilities, have some sort of 3rd dimension. But to make the children of the film completely heartless seems rather careless.Otherwise, I thought that the writing served some of its purpose. It's borderline propaghanda, but remains entirely entertaining the whole way through. I only fell asleep because I was extremely comfortable and had a rather long and arduous schedule that day.The acting was top notch in every respect, especially the stars of the film. Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't have so much of a stretch, seemingly, in the suit of his character. BUT!, this is not what I mean. Leo's character actually had a sarcastic depth not seen in Jack from Titanic or his character in The Departed. His strengths show brilliantly in the film, and create a glowing effect throughout the film. You can't get enough of him. Djimon Hounsou's raw performance is as outstanding as Leo's, and typically shines in all of his works, even in The Island he is entirely entrancing. Jennifer Connelly is above her standard performances, and satisfyingly delivers. The utility characters, though some are carelessly written, are still well acted, and make great use of the text they are given.The cinematography was completely standard. No artistic eye shows up in this film at all. It's rather disheartening to think that Zwick didn't take advantage of the boundaries outside of an action film's cinematographic stylings. There are times throughout the film where a beautiful frame may be shown of a particular instance, and the moment is not taken advantage of. I was rather disappointed in this department.And in these negative respects, I'm disappointed in Zwick as well. His direction of the images and the story being told could have been far more commanding and innovative. The story was absolutely fantastic, tight, intricate, and well furbished. The substance could have been boosted tremendously, and as the director of the film, if Zwick felt this, he could have solved the problem by either meeting with the screenwriter or sending the script to a decent script doctor, like David Mamet (not to put him secondhand to his stellar play and screen writing careers). Zwick's commitment to the project didn't reach its full potential in my opinion.In conclusion, Blood Diamond delivers a fun-to-watch action flick with a fantastic cast, great performances, and a great story. Everything else can be seen in your standard horror movie or adventure picture, such as Laura Croft: Tomb Raider, or something of the like.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A truly good film, which seems to be unfairly forgotten and is worth revisiting.","I waited a long time to see this movie. When it was released, it benefited from the whole propaganda machine of the big studios and was successful. Currently, however, I feel that it is a little forgotten, and I am sorry, because it is a film of great quality and worthy of our attention. It's not a perfect movie, it has some flaws, but I think they're forgivable and don't diminish its value. The script is heavily political: set in the midst of the Sierra Leone Civil War, the film directly links the diamond trade and conflict financing. It's not something that we didn't already know or that was unknown when the film came out: the merit of the film is that it shows us that in such a raw, intense and disturbing way.Since the 1970s, Africa has been a pole of continuous conflict between countries, ethnic groups, creeds and tribes. From the Rwandan genocide and the war in Darfur to the civil wars and bloody coups in Guinea, Liberia, Angola or Chad, examples abound and have filled the news and also contributed to a small group of people (arms dealers, diamonds, other resources) to make enormous fortunes bathed in blood. If war is a business, Africa is fertile ground to invest, boosted by the abundance of natural resources and the lack of scruples of governments and chiefs, indifferent to civilian losses, hordes of refugees or humanitarian crises, mere collateral damage.The script begins with an attack by the RUF, the Sierra Leonean revolutionary guerrilla, on a village where they kill many civilians and cut off the hands of those who remain alive. Solomon is taken away from his family by the guerrillas and put to work as a slave in the diamond mines, where he happens to find a huge diamond of great value. He quickly hides the stone, but the guerrillas notice, and he has to flee. Later, the existence of the stone reaches the ears of Danny Archer, a smuggler, who decides to obtain the stone to sell it, taking advantage of Solomon's despair, who only thinks about finding his family and rescuing his son, who the guerrillas turned into a child soldier. Willing to help is journalist Maddy Bowen, who is looking for a truly relevant story to publish.The cast has immense quality and is intelligently directed by Edward Zwick. Leo DiCaprio is the best-sounding name and the one that stands out the most: used to playing heartthrob roles, this film marks a turning point in the actor's career, determined to become versatile and prove that he is more than a pretty face to spice up his fans dreams. The actor is amazing and does a truly challenging job with a very amoral, complex and psychologically challenging character. Djimon Hounsou is not far behind him, and he also offers us a very competent work, albeit more conventional. Jennifer Connelly also handles the challenges she faces very well, giving life to an active and courageous investigative journalist.Technically, the film is of immense quality. The cinematography is very good, it takes advantage of the African landscapes and the action scenes are truly raw, intense and fast, taking full advantage of the special effects and the impeccable work of the stunts and sound and sound effects technicians. Very well shot and edited, the film has an excellent pace, and we hardly feel the time passing while we watch it. The editing and sound work deserved an Oscar nomination, along with the efforts of DiCaprio and Hounsou. Despite this, I think the film suffered a lot from strong competition from other high-quality films and only Hounsou really had a good chance of winning the coveted statuette, as Best Supporting Actor. There was still talk of DiCaprio, but I always thought it was impossible for him to surpass the greatness of Forest Whitaker, who won the Oscar for Best Actor with an impeccable work in a film that, curiously, also has Africa as a privileged stage. Finally, with these considerations made, a word of appreciation for the soundtrack, signed by James Newton Howard.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie portrays the civil war in Sierra Leone, a battle sponsored by the diamonds that people slave about in the mud to get.It is a good movie, worth seeing and praised even by people who have lived in the area. However, I felt it went soft in order to accommodate the cinema market. When the feelings get strong, the movie goes easy, inserts a funny moment or a glorious speech. The Americans are shown as compassionate people fighting for the good of mankind, while the diamond companies that pray on the African misery just exceptions, with ""good"" diamond dealers coming to testify and support the ban on ""blood diamond"" commerce.Memorable part of the movie, an old man saying he hopes they don't find oil there, or they'd really be screwed.

Hollywood should take notice that a longer run time doesn't mean a better film. This movie could have and should have been shortened. Even with the storyline and fast action scenes, the film still drags in places. DiCaprio and Hounsou are indeed the diamonds in this film. Brilliant talent shining brightly throughout the film is what will hold your interest. The accents were a bit difficult to follow in places, but not enough to cloud the understanding of the scenes. The storyline serves up political intrigue, brutal violence, child exploitation, shoot outs/explosions, car chases, greed, and even love. There are a few shots of breathtaking beautiful mountain scenery. Overall, a film worth watching, but it is a bit too long and a bit too political.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Once I saw the trailers however I decided to go against my gut reaction and see the movie and was stunned by the spectacular quality of it, award winning performances were given by both DiCaprio and his co-star Houston and Jennifer Connelly's performance can not be overlooked as the journalist who wants to make a difference for the country. Contrary to anything you might hear DiCaprio's accent is flawless, If I didn't know better I'd swear up and down it was real, kudos to him because an African accent is some of the most difficult to master and he somehow manages to pull it off perfectly.

Three characters from different backgrounds USE each other for very different goals,"My first impression of the movie was that Leonardo DiCaprio was not deep enough and that he was just trying to force out a tough version of Indiana Jones.---WRONG! His role as a South African diamond smuggler, Danny Archer, evolves into a very full and complex character with a very important story to be told.Other first impressions about the expected stereotypical roles of the Western journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) and the native Sierra Leonean fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) turn out to be equally wrong as the movie unfolds and the nature of their roles becomes more apparent.These three central characters—from totally different backgrounds--meet under unusual circumstances, but they all eventually need and explicitly USE each other to achieve their very different goals.The story behind the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leon is told here in an enlightening and entertaining way. After seeing the movie, I was prompted to Google more details about the West African location of Sierra Leon and the actual history behind the civil war there.

Tightly Directed Action Thriller,"Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone. Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life. However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade. Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles. But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film. Recommended. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
I think Blood Diamond is a special movie.,"I watched the Blood Diamond movie last weekend. Ever since I saw the trailer of the movie, I was curious, how they could perform a film about blood diamond in African Sierra Leone.Especially during the last years my basic criterion for evaluation of a movie is how much Hollywood style the movie is. In fact this one can also be categorised as a Hollywood movie. With the proudly mastered fighting scenes, where crazy rebels and high tech soldiers shooting bullets showers like a heavy rain, and moreover our heroes running around and surviving this inferno without even a scratch, the Blood Diamond movie is surely not poor with such action.Another detail in the movie, which makes me annoyed was that the ordinary African people speaking in English in their own distinct accents. The only thought came to my mind at that moment was, ""Oh the movie is again prepared especially for the English speaking audiences, but I want to watch and listen to them in their own language"" Anyway, now I know, after reading in the Wikipedia, Sierra Leone was founded in 18th century by the freed slaves under the effective shadow of Britain, and only gained their independence in 1961. Which means it is understandable that they still try to speak in English even sometimes among themselves.I think the director Mr. Zmick is successful in putting the movie smoothly in these poor countries streets and people. But I couldn't catch any distinct signature of him throughout the movie. I can save a few words for Mr. Di Caprio. During the last couple of years as he is getting maturer in his age and losing his baby face with the weights put on, we started to realise how a good actor he actually is. He already deserved my admiration, since breaking my heart as being obsessive-compulsive Howard Hughes in The Aviator. And in this movie only his almost genuine South African English accent proves us how much he's focused to be Danny Archer. Instead of writing too much about the African co-star Mr. Hounsou, I just would like to remind his acting in Amistad in 1997, (here ignoring his other movies in between). For me recalling him as a young, proud and leader spirited slave was a sudden flashback. Considering that he had a difficult child-young hood, I don't think he had to act too much.Generally speaking, despite some of the cliché scenes, Blood Diamond is a special movie. It sheds a light on how diamond brings everything but money and wealth to this tiny poor country. Screenplay is trying to be honest and sincere, and besides the simple core story tries to cover too many facts about the illicit diamond trade. The rebel group (RUF) which was somehow created by any malicious intentions, fights against the government and people and makes massacre a reality of life in Sierra Leone. With their famous way of punishment especially to the young ones, to amputate one of the arms or legs, and using others in the so called diamond mines, to finance their rebel organization. And those stones, smuggled through the borders, exchanged in the hands and laundered by the brokers in Antwerp-Belgium and Israel, finally find their way to European customers in their most conflict-free and brilliant forms. And nobody is innocent in this story, neither the governments, nor the terrorised groups, nor the white African soldiers equipped with the very hi-tech combat gears whose so called mission is to clear the continent from socialist rebels, nor the smugglers and brokers, and lastly nor the young modern-life girls who are wishing for a diamond wedding ring without considering all the happenings till it's polished resplendently. Personally speaking there is an influence on me by this movie, and at this moment I am happy I don't have any diamond jewels, and do not plan to buy any.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Please see this movie, for everyone's sake.","I just recently saw this movie, and I must say that, even as a huge movie fan, this is an important film. It was not only grippingly entertaining, but pointed in its attack of the diamond industry's morally repugnant way of doing business. The relentless barrage or images of children soldiers, reckless violence and disturbing nihilism lend this film much credibility in its portrayal of the diamond conflict in Sierra Leone. I hope my future wife will forgive me for not getting her a diamond engagement ring, but i don't see how it will be possible with everything I now know, thanks to Blood Diamond.(BTW: Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in this film, this coming from a skeptic of his work. Most amazing of all is the accuracy with which he nailed the South African accent he was forced to adopt, one of the least-distinguishable accents in the world.) I would absolutely encourage everyone to see this movie if at all possible. It is not only entertaining, but informative in a disturbing makes-you-think sort of way.

"Not good, not bad...","I confess that clearly after I had watched ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""God of War"", Blood Diamond didn't become attractive for me. The subject of it is a little different from thoses. In this film, a chaos between Sierra Leone's people is described like most of the African's country.I think, the time of film was lengthened unnecesarrily and this condition gets me bored. But, Di Caprio plays very well his role that is a man who are working to gain something from the chaos. Also, Jennifer Connely became a good choice for the role of a journalist who does her best. His and her performance are also remarkable.The song that played in background for the struggle scenes fits with the theme. Effects aren't so charming to me. Details and dialogs aren't worthy to talk about them. The film isn't so fluent and most of times are passing so boring. I wasn't curious about the end of the film.Although there are such routine points about the film, it deserves seven point because it arouses interest the facts that happened in Sierra Leone.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Cheap Zirconia,"I didn't know this was the same director who did ""Thirtysomething"" until after I saw this film. Now it's obvious he's still doing the same material only with bigger budgets and pricier actors. I like DiCaprio very much, I think he has a lot of talent and is developing into quite a fine actor. I wished he hadn't done this one though. I don't know if the writing was just so badly clichéd, lifeless and tedious or if this was a character not within his range. Certainly the former is true: the writing sounds like a smugly self righteous thirty-something American who feels somewhat guilty for his good fortune in this mostly unfortunate world and tries to alleviate his guilt by preaching about some of the evils in Africa and how he has brilliantly realized the solution to these evils comes down to a simplistic little step we can all do here and now. Of course being a sheltered, usually very self absorbed thirty-something kid his insights and solutions are naively simplistic and unrealistic. The situation this film is based on is very complex and the problems are so entrenched due to so many differing factors that a cute, neat happily-ever-after Hollywood solution won't work no matter how much wishing and believing we want to do. As well, every time DiCaprio did the white African accent I had to wince a little because it sounded just slightly off key enough to not seem natural.I suppose I should mention Jennifer Connelly but after a few seconds with her character I kept turning away from the film and thinking of other things. She was so badly unrealistic as the savvy, seasoned reporter with her sophomoric self righteous indignation that she seemed to have been an irate and grotesquely self indulgent customer who was plucked from Macy's as she was raging at some poor clerk because the right shade of drapes aren't available that she ""absolutely needs"" because they go with her new carpet and is now doing this tirade in the middle of Africa in the place of some reporter. Her character seems better fitted for a ""Twilight Zone"" twist than anything resembling a reporter who has ever slept in a place worse than a Holiday Inn. (Ugh! Heavens no!)Djimon Hounsou gives the only credible performance of the three main characters but even he can't save this smugly false vehicle from crash burning into a pile of toxic clichés. Perhaps my sights were too high, I had really enjoyed ""The Constant Gardner"" and felt everything worked very well in that slice of the exploited life in one of the way too many unfortunate places in Africa. But this was no Gardner, not even a part time one. This wasn't even a decent ""save the children"" ad: at least the solution they offer may have some real merit, while this one was dreamed up by a detached arm chair observer who has come up with their solution by scanning page six of the Times and catching the tail end of a documentary or two. Like the solution for world peace given by a young beauty contest candidate, it has a lot of nice sounding words and phrases but it's nevertheless just a few cute platitudes that have no real practical value.Edward Zwick is way over his head here. I'd appreciate it if he'd stick to another ""thirty-something"" venture. Those projects I can clearly see from far away are things I can avoid so as not to have my intelligence insulted by a smugly self righteous and self absorbed preacher who thinks he has all the brilliant solutions to all the problems and lives he hasn't the vaguest real knowledge of beyond what he's caught in a National Geographic article and thinks by looking carefully at the accompanying pretty pictures he can figure it all out.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

One Of The Most Impacting Films In Years,"I wanted to see this film because it seemed interesting. I went in looking for entertainment. After I started watching it though I was to put it lightly impressed. The story while simple and based on actual happenings is amazing. Not only does it have depth to it, it grabs your attention and actually brings you into the lives of these characters.The acting is some of the best I've seen in a long time. I've never really been a DiCaprio fan until lately and this is one of the reasons why. I'm happy to see him mature as an actor and sort of shed his pretty boy image. He truly came across as a great actor here. Though his character uses people for gain you learn to like him. As good as DiCaprio was,Djimon Hounsou stole the entire show. He delivered one of the most moving performances I've seen. The pain and emotion his character shows strikes you and leaves a lasting impression.Finally while the film does contain some harsh scenes of violence I feel they were needed to tell the story. There is not just violence for shock value, trying to tone down the realities of these African cultures would be doing them a disrespect. You get to realize their struggle and find how small and pointless the problems of America are.You will not only leave having been entertained with a well developed story but you will also find an appreciation for a beautiful location or more importantly an understanding and harsh realization of the lives these characters are based on.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A story about an African family,"I tried to approach this film with a cool head, which I could do since I've watched it several times. The first time, I was shocked too-and that may well have been its intention. At that point, I couldn't have said anything. But can one even think or say anything after watching a film like this? Yes, it portrays an evil world. Deeply unfair and completely random. With various beliefs or stories like this one, we might convince ourselves that no, it's not random-there's a system to it. What's certain is that they put together a beautiful, rounded, and somehow comforting story for us.Although the discussion tends to center on DiCaprio's performance, this is more a story of a family. The film both starts and ends with them, and it feels almost dismissive, in a ""white-centric"" way, not to acknowledge them. It's as though they're mere props: ""They're African-just let them be themselves, huh, yah?"" I think Djimon Hounsou's portrayal of the father's complex emotions and impulses-through serious acting-is too often dismissed as ""just natural."" If he were white or the setting and cast more diverse, there would likely be a flood of praise for his self-control, dynamism, body language, emotional expression, and range. But here, it's hardly noticed. And then there's his son! He conveys both the obedient, studious little boy and the mentally ""switched-off"" child soldier just as convincingly...
Alright, I understand that this film is aimed at the white man's conscience. It needs standout white characters to create connection and encourage comfortable moviegoers to reflect on what they might do for Africa, for justice. But at the same time, Archer is a white African, his fate just as brutal as others on the continent. His tragedy is that he couldn't rise to the exploiters' higher caste. His cruelty and underlying goodness feel a bit questionable to me, and I found it hard to buy into his character's evolution and internal struggles. Fortunately, the storyline doesn't put him in situations where this would cause significant conflict.And even after all these viewings, I still find the theme thought-provoking-although, rather than inspiring action, it increasingly just makes me feel lucky. And that's all.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The film addresses important discussions about the harmful effects of certain capitalist interests in the Third World,"Written by Charles Leavitt, the script seeks to explore the political, economic and social problem represented by diamonds mined in conflict zones and used by militias and rulers of these areas as a way to generate funds to buy weapons or even to pay mercenaries. With commercialization prohibited by international treaties, these diamonds are routinely smuggled and mixed with stones originating in neighboring countries, falling without major problems on the market - although, according to the film, their true origins are known to businessmen and executives who theoretically committed not to sell them.Edward Zwick seeks to rawly portray the misery of a country plunged into the chaos of civil war - and the intense urban guerrilla warfare is effectively focused in a sequence that does not try to disguise the horror of civilians trapped between soldiers and rebels: in the midst of battle, we see bloodied children and a young mother carrying a baby as she tries to escape bullets and explosions. And the most tragic thing is that, in this type of war, there are children as victims and executioners, since the high rate of casualties entails the ""need"" to look for combatants in increasingly smaller age groups - and few images are more painful than that of that of a child wielding a gun. Likewise, Blood Diamond makes a brief but intriguing comment on the necessary coldness in journalistic coverage (especially in times of war): at a certain moment, dozens of photographers come across the victims of an attack promoted by rebels and immediately they fire their machines - and it is up to Solomon (Hounsou's character), the only native, to offer some kind of help to the wounded.What can most attract Blood Diamond audiences is the action and tension of the events shown. In some respects, it may even remind one of John Huston's classics with some of his plots about human ambition: adventurers trying to find relics (albeit macabre), kingdoms waiting for a man (who wanted to be king), jewels (with their secret) - and especially treasures like the one in the Sierra Madre. Generally, such objects of desire did not materialize in well-being, but, on the contrary, brought misfortunes and/or - at least - bitter frustrations. Without there being moralism in the presentation of excesses of the desire that one wants to fulfill ""at any price"".The ongoing action, production resources and efficient performance of this film's cast (with Djimon Hounson in particular) can engage the viewer. But there is discomfort in the mixture of a lot of explicit violence with a politically correct ""message"" ""denouncing"" both the horrors of the civil war in Sierra Leone (one of the lowest HDI in the world), and the indifference of rich countries that buy extracted diamonds at the expense of slave labor, deaths, severed arms and, of course, a lot of blood. So that the metaphor (?) is not too abstract, the stone that gives the film its name is neither a broad reference nor a generality: it is actually a rough diamond with a pink hue - like the imaginary ""Pink Panther"" that gave the pretext to the comic series of Blake Edwards with the character of Inspector Clouseau created by Peter Sellers.Throughout the feature film, the destruction of an entire nation becomes visible, as a result of the appearance of several rebel groups that presented themselves against government measures. Groups that killed and tortured all people who did not ally themselves with them and presented themselves in favor of the new norms of the rulers. In addition to all the deaths and torture caused by these rebels, the most striking scene is still at the beginning of the film where the captured men's hands are cut off, in order to prevent them from voting in future.By itself, a war scenario is already annoying enough, however, the cruelty of the FRU went much further. Children were captured in order to make them murderers. The rebels drugged them, gave them tobacco, taught them to kill and instilled in them false moral values, claiming that their parents were wrong and that they deserved to die for believing in false rulers. The subject of diamond smuggling was given more emphasis, developing the plot around the search for diamonds.Regrettably, while looking for misery in his locations, Zwick cannot resist the temptation to include shots photographed with a beauty (in fact, an almost glamor) that simply does not match the proposal of rawness presented at the beginning. Its director of photography is the brilliant Portuguese Eduardo Serra, who, unfortunately, was unable to maintain the stylistic cohesion achieved by his colleague César Charlone in Fernando Meirelles' ""The Constant Gardener"", for example.Furthermore, by trying to close the narrative on a note of undeniable optimism, the film surrenders to the worst of Hollywood vices, even betraying its good intention of alerting the spectator through the shock of reality: after all, it is as if the civilized world finally managed to tame the African barbarians through international conferences and press conferences - which couldn't be further from the truth.But this film, with its bloodthirsty theme, was not meant to be funny - even if it looks with some sympathy at everything Leonardo DiCaprio's character does. This is commented by the journalist played by Jennifer Connally: he is capable of saying anything to achieve his objectives - not at all ethical. And the script even hints at some discussion in this delicate area: after all, what the journalist does, does it do any good? Does it serve to change world savagery and barbarism? Or does it just expose horrors on TV screens?However, perhaps the most serious of Blood Diamond's problems resides in Jennifer Connelly's character, who alone represents some appalling examples of the simplistic mentality of much of contemporary American cinema. First, she emerges as an entirely expendable romantic interest for Leonardo DiCaprio, whose moral rottenness (which I'll discuss later) proves redeemable simply because of ""Love"" (yes, capital letter and all). Furthermore, the journalist played by Connelly is used, by the screenwriter, as the point of view of the spectator, expressing our shock and our revolt before all the brutal events that we witness - as if this were necessary to clarify that the directors themselves refuse to condone the actions of their violent protagonist. As if that weren't enough, the actress is also driven to deliver the sermons that the director and screenwriter cannot personally deliver, chewing up the film's messages in an irritatingly condescending manner, as if we weren't capable of perceiving them without the not-so-subtle help of journalist. Thus, trapped by representing a mere narrative-moral artifice in the script, Connelly can do nothing but create a unidimensional figure in her goodness and noble intentions.And that's precisely why Leonardo DiCaprio's uncompromising performance represents Blood Diamond's greatest strength: cynical and tough, Archer is the type of guy who doesn't hesitate to fire extra shots into his enemies' bodies to make sure they're gone. They won't rise to bother him again - and even after we've created a certain connection with the character (and even affection) we still recognize that this is a dangerous man even for his ally Solomon (especially if the fisherman poses an unnecessary risk for your life). Incidentally, DiCaprio's determination to maintain Archer's internal coherence is such that, even when the script seeks to soften him (with a tragic and - once again - unnecessary past), the actor returns to show the mercenary's claws as soon as possible.Meanwhile, Djimon Hounsou incarnates Solomon as a man always at the extreme of his strength and with a great emotional intensity: manipulated by everyone, the character finds the only possible way to maintain his sanity and the will to live by focusing exclusively on the desire to rescue the son. On the other hand, Blood Diamond is not very subtle in the composition of the other characters, particularly exaggerating the senseless and self-destructive benevolence of Professor Benjamin Kapanay (Wallace) and the caricatured villainy (with a scar over his eye!) of the rebellious Captain Poison ( Harewood).Combining a good cast with phenomenal visual aspects, ranging from makeup to some simple special effect (or not!), ""Blood Diamond"" is more than a film that tries to recreate a situation experienced at some point in humanity and starts to be much more documentary than it seems. Unafraid to show commendable yet shocking scenes, the feature will certainly please those demanding and force others to have a little patience. Seeking to address more issues than it manages to discuss, ""Blood Diamond"" is divided between the initial proposal of talking about ""blood diamonds"" and the attempt to also develop discussions about the harmful effects of certain capitalist interests in the Third World; the inhuman misery of these countries; the constant plundering of its natural resources; the use of children in guerrilla warfare; the role of the media in this changing scenario; and the hiring of private armies by unscrupulous governments (something covered by the brilliant documentary Shadow Company, by the way). It's no wonder that, with so many preoccupations, the film occasionally becomes unfocused, losing some of its power in its sprawling second act. Anyway, Blood Diamond is efficient enough to make us agree with the desire expressed by a character, at a certain moment in the projection: God willing that they never find oil in one of those countries.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Accurate enough to be used in history classes,"Brutal conflicts over natural resources have been a fundamental component of African life for several generations. Fueled by the western need for resources, most of the combatants have been Africans that have claimed the same national allegiance. The companies and governments of the western nations understand how the battles are being carried out and the level of human carnage, but generally are only interested in maintaining the production.
The setting is the African nation of Sierra Leone in 1999, when there was an outbreak of a brutal civil war. Men and boys are forcibly recruited by rebel groups to work in the diamond mines and any attempt to steal a diamond leads to execution. The armed groups regularly enter villages suspected of allegiance to the other side and shoot down innocents, rape the women and will cut off the limbs of children in order to make a point.
Leonardo di Caprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian veteran of the wars in Southern Africa and now a diamond smuggler. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman in a village of Sierra Leone when the civil war breaks out in earnest. A rebel group attacks his village and while his wife and youngest children manage to escape, Vandy is captured and forced to work in the diamond mines. He discovers a monstrous stone and when he is about to be forced to turn it over to his overlord, government troops attack and Solomon manages to bury the stone before being captured.
Archer has been arrested while attempting to smuggle diamonds across the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia and ends up in the same prison as Vandy. This is the spark of an unlikely alliance between the two men. Archer is a man that is at times as ruthless as the people he is fighting, yet he does retain a spark of humanity. The remainder of the story has the two men on a hunt to recover the diamond by any means necessary.
The violence in the movie is significant, but it does genuinely reflect what was going on in Africa at the time. Entire villages were being wiped out, children were being impressed into armed groups to serve as ruthless soldiers and the diamond companies mostly stood back unless they considered it necessary to send in their mercenary units. The best aspect of the movie is that it genuinely reflects what took place in Africa.
One of the best lines in the movie references the historical fact that the Belgian controllers of the Congo implemented a policy of cutting off the hands of workers in order to keep them terrified and working. Given that a bounty for scalps has been a part of law of the European based governments in the United States for centuries, the point is that the acts of barbarism towards enemies has a lot of European origins.

An Eye Opener !,"Gripping, touching, thrilling, awesome; just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Blood Diamond. It's just a terrific film and what I really liked was how much depth the characters where given, not just the protagonists but even the lesser characters such as the villain, RUF leader Captain Poison. This is something that director Edward Zwick has always been very good at and has demonstrated in earlier films such as Glory or The Last Samurai and I hope he begins directing such films again soon.Other than that, the music was excellent (One of James Newton Howard's finest) and the pacing was effective in that you truly felt as if you were on a journey with these characters. The cinematography was outstanding, and despite being centered on a civil war, the film allows for some beautiful shots further emphasizing the natural beauty of the majestic African continent. Important issues were touched in the film such as the Wests exploitation of third world countries but it was done in a way that (at least in my opinion) was not too controversial in a time where films can be banned in countries, so I don't feel the film went too far. Also the film touched on the West's view of Africa, as brought up by Hounsou's character in the film, and I do share his view that Africa will one day be a ""paradise.""

"Oscar worthy DiCaprio, Oscar worthy film","Having just looked at the numbers for this weekend at the box office, it's a bit saddening to see a popcorn film at the top of the list over an intelligently made action/adventure film of much higher caliber and quality.I've been waiting for Mr. DiCaprio to pull off something as original as Jack Dawson in the Titanic, and I think that here he's managed to do just that. And now he's got real action hero chops, knocking people around and knocking off the bad guys with a power rifle while dodging bullets and bodies.In general, it seems, the American public pays virtually no attention to the horrors of Africa, and why should we when we can simply change the channel and not look. Watching the fleeing white Surban with O.J.

I believe, this part was added only to glorify the character of the protagonist.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Excellent film, terrible advertising.","I truly had low expectations for this movie. When I saw the commercials for this, it looked like another action dud. It had good press and had garnered a couple of nods from the Academy, but I just could not get past the advertising. So, my friend loans me the DVD the other day, and to my surprise I really liked it. The performances are very strong by all three main characters. The action is not overwhelming, and well executed. I see two primary flaws in this film. First, it is a little melodramatic. The weight of the subject matter is enough. The constant fist clenching, screaming at the sky seemed forced. Second, I feel the movie should have ended ten minutes earlier. Far to often studios feel the need to punctuate movies with a tidy conclusion. Sometimes a film is well served by a little ambiguity. Despite it's flaws, this a very good film. Not just the sum of it's action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is Africa,"I watched Traffic the night before I watched Blood Diamond and I can't help to notice the similarity. Both movies have a substance, that makes money for some and makes others suffer for it. In Blood Diamond's case it's, surprise surprise, diamonds. Blood Diamond is more of a popcorn flick movie than Traffic was, but Blood Diamond doesn't lack any of the emotion or depth. Actually I think Blood Diamond had much more emotion than Traffic. Blood Diamond is a great film with good, but at times too convenient, story for my taste. The movie's story is fiction but some of the events happening are/have been real. There is a great mix of fiction and true story blended in.Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in the leading role as a smuggler who beneath the rough exterior has a deeper side. Djimon Hounsou is good as well. Both of them were nominated for an Oscar I saw. Jennifer Connelly wasn't too shabby neither.Real deal however is the beauty of Africa. The film was really filmed in Africa and the result is wonderful. The movie almost feels like a tourist tour to Africa's nature. Also, I have been very pleased with James Newton Howard's scores. Most recently in The Hunger Games series. And this score was once again nothing more than amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Important story turns to predictable clichéd action film...,"It's like two different movies, and not in the interesting Kubrick way. it starts out as intelligent and devastating, ends up so predictable and hack I can't understand the 10s and the critical raves. Acting is good, story is not so good, film making becomes Rambo and takes you out of the powerful ideas behind the movie. Turns into a typical ""everyone wants the treasure"" movie and that's not what I was expecting to see when I started watching. And it wasn't a happy surprise. Others may love the action, but it becomes stupid as more and more Africans fall as fodder but somehow Leo continues to duck bullets and bombs. Whatever...",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

DiCaprio is the diamond and there's a lot of blood,"Once again, DiCaprio demonstrates he is one of the most interesting and talented actors. He's never shied from difficult roles (think Who's Eating Gilbert Grape?, ""This Boy's Life"" and just about every part played in the 21st century). You can see his attention to detail and dedication to the part, the intensity of his acting. In this case, his use of a local African accent is, to my ears, flawless.As to the movie, well, compared to ""Hotel Rwanda"", it still looks more like ""Con Air Goes To Africa"". Nevertheless, the character development is interesting even if obvious and the movie is well paced, so you never get bored. Djimoun Hounsou is a Mende fisherman. His village is attacked by the Revolutionary United Front and he is captured in order to search for diamonds to be traded. DiCaprio is a white Rhoedsian mercenary smuggling diamonds. They will both at some point meet in jail and DiCaprio will find out Hounsou has hidden a diamond worth millions of dollars. They will start a journey together, trying to recover the hidden diamond and Hounsou's family that was taken to ca camp. They will try to arrange an escape to America for both the family and the diamond.The depiction of the cruel African attacks owe more to ""Saving Private Ryan"" than reality, which is a shame, but then, this is a fiction that only uses African conflicts as a backdrop to what the DiCaprio's character has to go through along with Djimoun Hounsou, even if the movie is billed as being about the blood diamond trades.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Simply Unbelievable!,"THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING! Easily one of the best films in the past decade. If you really think about it, it shows how spoiled America is.

Good - for Hollywood!,"This is classic Hollywood ""dual-use"" - tell a popular story to send a serious message. The idea is that you can use formula elements to get a huge audience who then learns uncomfortable things. You can tell the truth about the world and make enormous amounts of box office - no conflict there, right? The movie takes on big issues like child soldiers, diamond wars, failed states, kids with chopped-off hands, random slaughter of villagers, millions of refugees. It has excellent Hollywood production values - the action scenes dip you into terrifying violence and stir you around. The lead performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djiman Hounsou are wonderful. DiCaprio's character, an ex-military diamond smuggler, is interesting and complex. But there are limits to dual-use strategy. The white hero has a love interest, an implausibly beautiful American journalist who tries to flirt her way into a scoop and then implausibly toughens up. In a Hollywood film individuals always have to be able to make a difference and not just save their own skin, so Solomon Vandy's search for his family is juxtaposed with the more ridiculous, self-flattering story of a journalist taking on the world-wide diamond trade. Finally, there's Hollywood's compulsory narcissism, which means that it can't explain why control of diamond fields requires rebel posses to massacre innocent villagers, or imagine African solutions to anything. There's a weird racism floating through all the sympathy for African victims, so that the rebel army scenes are shot Pirates-of-the-Caribbean style with gun-toting children dancing insanely around roaring fires in bloody compounds in an unwitting repeat of old Western stereotypes of bloodthirsty African savages. In Hollywood dual-use, structural problems are suppressed in favor of lone villains with a long reach, so that it is impossible to imagine, for example, that there may be a problem with capitalism itself, which has done so little good for so long for Africa. It all leads to a consumer boycott, the ultimate middle-class American political gesture - to not shop for one thing we want! It's true that Americans aren't interested in wearing ""conflict diamonds"" dug by one-handed African slave children. It's true that Hollywood does not exist in order to refute naive business books like ""The World Is Flat."" But putting a little more African thought and society in place of American journalists might have made the movie's hope for the future at least half as convincing as its blood-soaked action.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb and Unmissable,"If you get some spare time then I cannot recommend this film enough. It ranks up there with my all time favourites and is definitely up there with the best of them. See it on the big screen. It will lose too much on the small one (even though I shall be buying the DVD lol) Superb acting - Leo DiCaprisun & Djimon Hounsou are outstanding. Excellent script, superb direction and the cinematography is fantastic. It's fast, it's emotional, it's REAL, it's believable and the characters really pull you in. There are some difficult scenes to watch with rebel brutality (especially where the children are concerned) but they are just part of what makes it so real and so shocking.There is a scene about three quarters of the way though the film where Leo's character is telling Jennifery Connelly's character about the brutal murder of his parents and how he grew up and what he now thinks of South Africa and it's people which I thought was outstanding. It was easy to forget for that ten or so minutes that he was actually acting - that's how good he was. Of course they went and ruined the end of that scene by sneaking in a little bit of romance. Aaaaagggghhh!The battle/action scenes were shot all in one take which makes them pretty special. Especially where the rebels come to town and all hell breaks loose. You've got a good ten to fifteen minutes of mayhem, bullets, bombs, guns, bodies, fights, etc and each time it's all being done in just one take. Wow! If I had one criticism it would be Jennifer Connelly's character. Or was it her acting? I'm not sure. Either way she was the weakest link who I kept wishing would go away.I've been a big fan of Leo's acting for a long time now and he's played some superb parts. He is one of those actors who doesn't seem to need to act - to act. He's up for an Oscar for this and I'd really like to see him get it (he should have won one for The Aviator!) but he has tough competition from Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland (also an Oscar worthy performance) Memorable Quotes: Danny Archer (Leo): Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...

"A lot of blood behind the lustre of diamonds, and this film just shows it to save humanity","Blood Diamond (2006) :
Brief Review -A lot of blood behind the lustre of diamonds, and this film just shows it to save humanity. One can never think about the behind-the-scenes story of diamonds when you go to a jewellery shop or buy them online. But there are many secrets-hidden, of course-that we shouldn't know. The same happens with the leather products we buy. We don't know, or we know but don't care, how many animals were killed to get those leather bags. The same happens with elephant ivory. Maybe someday the picture might change, but I don't see that day coming anytime soon. So, Blood Diamond takes you behind the smuggling, black market, revolution, slavery, killings, and political conspiracies that took place behind the diamonds during the Sierra Leone Civil War. Solomon Vandy has hidden a diamond, and his family is kept at a homeless people's camp. A diamond smuggler named Daniel convinces him to tell him the location of the pink diamond so that they can split the profits and Vandy can get his family back. During the expedition, Daniel uses a female journalist, Maddy, and later falls in love with her. There are many more conflicts in this story that come up with dramatic and sometimes explosive presentations. The script has a motive, which doesn't seem very important, but the message was much clearer. ""An American girl would not buy a necklace if she knew that there were so many deaths behind it,"" Maddy tells Danny, and that's what the prime subject is here. The love story angles seemed desperate and forced right from the beginning. Those conversations between Leonardo and Jennifer were looking fake, but the storyline picked it up well from there with a journalist's angle and how she becomes a part of this journey, only to end up with some outdated melodrama. Connelly's noble talk about the right people and right things was out of context yet somehow fit the box. Overall, a well-performed and well executed film, and almost close to a cinematic treat.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good film, but needed some edit's for pacing","Saw a sneak preview of Blood diamond yesterday, and I thought the movie served it's point, but it was a little slow in some places. The message that they were trying to get out was in your face and at times painful to watch. This movie kinda reminded me of Saving Private Ryan a bit, in that women will go see this film because of the star of the film, but the violence might deter some viewers from receiving the message. Digimon Hanzoo, as I like calling him was amazing. You could feel his pain through out the movie. Leonardo did a really good job, I'm not a huge fan of his, but he's starting to become the next Sean Penn in my opinion. I have always had problems with the diamond industry, and I have always tried to put across my message to women, but failed. I hope that this film might make some people understand the bloodshed that is spilled for a shinny rock.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A bleak view of war torn Sierra Leone and the how the conflict was fuelled,"The film is action packed, with an obvious love story but don't let that detract from a brutal realism of how barbaric the civil war in Sierra Leone was. The acting is led by Leo's strong performance and although he is not in my top ten actors by any stretch of the imagination i think he is going to get better and better in much the same way Brad Pitt has. The plot itself is served up in a series of chapters and i assume this is to retain some link to the book it was based on (?). I did like this format but think that the real quality in the film comes from the abhorrant and misguided violence of the rebel forces. A strong focus is on the people of the conflict, and the innocent role the civilians played. Whilst a complex political arena highlights the mechanism behind the civil war, it is obvious to see parallels to current world conflicts. The timing of this movie lends itself to further comment on the economic motives for any war and once these wars have begun, who keeps them going.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good intentions, average movie","Going a little further than just displaying Africa's doomed fate, bringing more than routine characters, telling us a story about people before it is about politics and economics... in all three directions Blood Diamond is weak.Edward Zwick's work brings no emotion, no suspense, to a story that is already too episodic and blended with on-the-nose dialogue. The actors try to make us believe in their stories, but they're one-dimension characters with some stock back-stories to make up for true flesh and bones. Djimon Honsou's part is the one that works best: it is simple alright, yet it never comes near to filling the flatness and predictability of ""Big Boy"" DiCaprio's nice and tidy mercenary.Fortunately the location scouting was great, and Jennifer Connelly is gorgeous although only a part of the glorious scenery.

At one point you kind of forget what they are looking for. And Jennifer Connelly is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen. It was like she was too beautiful for this movie.

It starts out very serenely then smacks you in the face with the violence of the region. Little kids mowing down whole villages. Point blank shots to heads and chests, and backs. The message of the film should not be lost on anyone, and you get a good action flick mixed in. Leo's accent isn't as bad as you think from the trailers. And is actually very good, and unwavering. Jennifer Connelly, Maddy Bowen, was more fleshed out than I was reading about. And the relationship forged between her and Danny is much needed for the progression of his character.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond is a true Gem.,"What can I say? Edward Zwick has mastered a phenomenal challenge to bring awareness to movie goers embellishing political blasphemy and socio-economic curtailment of life regarding blood diamonds. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting career has reveled in subjects that perhaps not many have come to really appreciate. He is not ""just"" an actor. He is trying to ferment the actualization that there is a major and disturbing reality of corruption and death in countries worldwide, and whilst doing so has brought forth a deep meaning of self-reliance, when attempting to embellish his role playing. DiCaprio has surely defined himself as an action star, with more finesse and confidence than anyone working in that field today.Blood Diamond visualizes the physical deprivation of humanity, through the limb dismemberment and massacre of the Sierra Leone people. It truly exemplifies how individuals wielding a gun on a pick-up truck can claim themselves as a revolutionary, no matter what the age group. This film only scratches the surface of the growing problems in Africa, describing these problems with a simple acronym, TIA, standing for This Is Africa, an internationally mutilated abyss.Djimon Hounsou, who has been appropriately typecast as the African fisherman, delivers a heartfelt, honest and tear inducing performance. DiCaprio and Hounsou's performances will definitely be worthy of the proverbial Oscar nod this year. How many actors do we know that can make his audience feel what he sees with his eyes. Unfortunately, Jennifer Connelly brings one her most dull performances, never coming close to the caliber of acting that surrounds her. Blood Diamond delivers direct assertions as a socio-political thriller, and hopefully this will be another jab at the sheer evasion of this much ignored topic.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Diamond Polished,"In the other side of the world conflicts arise with us being truly unaware. When one buys a diamond, it's difficult to imagine its path all along and the blood it may have been spilled for it: how much a simple thing like a diamond revolves so much around it.Thanks to this film by Edward Zwick, besides being plunged into a fabulously well told story, ones head is open wide. A story garmented by a neat love trail and a constant run on survival.The settings are divided into the marvelous, jaw-breaking African prairies and the poor, dusty villages of the African inhabitants. This great contrasts works perfectly also with the idea that there is another contrast within the world that makes the diamond and the world that buys it, the poor and the rich.This film being highly entertaining, moderately politic and classy acted; is a very good choice I'd say for everyone. The gripping tension owes an applause, because throughout the film you will be grounding further and further for any good character that is presented on you. Nasty good option.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very realistic - a Kalaschnikow sounds like a Kalaschnikow,"Yesterday I went with Gisela, with whom I have been traveling for one year 25 000 kilometers through Africa with a Ford Transit, to see the Blood Diamond Movie.

I have seen the horror and so it took Gisi and me about an hour to recover after leaving the theater. Gunfire sounded like gunfire. A Kalaschnikow like a Kalaschnikow. So the horror came up very realistic. Leonardo DiCaprio (Danny Archer), Jennifer Connelly (Maddy Bowen) and Djimon Hounsou (Solomon Vandy) played very well and you really take their characters.Just the last 15 minutes are typical Hollywood as we say in Europe, but OK.

A thriller with a conscience,"""Blood Diamond"" takes place in Sierra Leone and tells the story of an unlikely alliance between a smuggler (DiCaprio) and a fisherman (Hounsou), the latter of whom hid a valuable diamond during his forced stint in the rebel controlled diamond mines. Each has a different plan for the diamond: One wants to make his fortune and escape while the other is bent on being reunited with his family.The cast is a fine one with multiple Oscar nominees Leonardo DiCaprio & Djimon Hounsou leading the way while Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly's also along for the ride. Personally I'm not much of a fan of Connelly but DiCaprio & Hounsou are eminently reliable. That being said, I'm not sure if I completely buy DiCaprio as a South African but that's subject to debate.The storyline is pretty exhilarating stuff though it does have a somewhat manufactured, Hollywood-ized feel. If you expect a realistic exploration of the diamond-fueled conflict in Sierra Leone then I would advise you to look elsewhere since this film is more action-oriented. That, of course, isn't necessarily a bad thing but the semi-strained credulity doesn't exactly work in favour of the film's more serious points.The direction by Edward Zwick is well executed and captures the action admirably. The visuals are attractive though not particularly remarkable. I can't recall any specifics about the score but since it was by seven time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard that suggests that it was unobtrusive rather than mediocre.If you're a fan of the stars of this film or if you're looking for a thriller that balances action & drama then this film ought to entertain you. While it's not as good as the current rating (8.0) might lead you to believe it's certainly worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Ridiculous in More Ways Than I Can Count,"Just in time for the holiday season, director Edward Zwick offers the latest in his long line of bloated, liberal do-gooder movies, this one designed to make a bunch of privileged Americans feel ever-so-slightly-guilty about all of their Christmas consumerism. Of course, he (and Hollywood) doesn't want you to feel TOO bad about it (they want to make money off of us after all), so he gussies up his movie with a bunch of traditional action-movie histrionics that maybe wouldn't seem ridiculous if this was a jungle flick from the 1940s, but that in the here and now of 2006 feels like a hopeless attempt to give us our medicine with one hand while spoon feeding us ice cream with the other.This is sanctimonious, hypocritical film-making as only Hollywood can deliver, folks. Let's show people what it's like in Africa, but let's not make it too realistic for them or they might not enjoy that popcorn they're scarfing down. We could tell the real story the way it really is, though no one would come to see it, or we can show Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio flexing their pecs and capitalize on people's love of a good ol' blockbuster.DiCaprio plays a jaded diamond smuggler with a heart of gold. Jennifer Connelley plays a fiery reporter with whom he falls in love (yeah, right). Djimon Hounsou plays the noble savage (big surprise), who once again proves that he is cast in films primarily for his ability to scream at the top of his voice while delivering his lines. If you can muster up one ounce of concern about what happens to any of these people, good for you. I certainly couldn't, and while the lady next to me in the theater was sniffling and dabbing her eyes at any one of the film's shameless bits of sentimental nonsense, I was checking my watch and stifling a yawn.I have no doubt that Edward Zwick has the best of intentions when making his movies, but I should have listened to my gut and stayed away from this film. He treats his audience as if they're stupid and can't understand a point unless it's underlined three times and has 20 exclamation points tacked on to the end. Yes, I'm glad that there are filmmakers who want to tell important stories to mass audiences and try to find methods of storytelling to which those audiences will respond. But if you're the kind of moviegoer who would rather engage in an intelligent discussion than listen to a bully -- no matter how well intentioned he may be -- pound away from his pulpit, Zwick's films are nearly intolerable, as this one is.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
The noisiest lecture I've ever seen but brilliant nonetheless - 90%,"Despite having been in my film collection for a long time, I can't really explain why I haven't watched this before now. The only other movie to suffer a similar limbo-like existence is ""Jackie Brown"" which I left for so long that I traded it instead of watching it. Still, better late than never and with a film as great as this, I'm glad that I gave it a chance. Remembered mainly for Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, this is an extremely rare action in that it manages to both entertain and educate at exactly the same time. And yet somehow, it has maintained a quiet, under-the-radar aura that belies its quality.Welcome to Sierra Leone in 1999, where the rebel forces of the RUF - funded by the illegal trade in conflict diamonds - engage in a bloody civil war against the government. Amid the chaos, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is separated from his wife and family and ordered to mine for diamonds by RUF commander Captain Poison (David Harewood). After uncovering a huge pink stone and burying it, Solomon is arrested and finds himself working alongside mercenary-with-a-past Daniel Archer (DiCaprio) and American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) in order to recover both the stone and his son, captured by Poison and brainwashed into becoming yet another child soldier.As I said, ""Blood Diamond"" is an action film that works on many levels. Not only is it an explosive action film with war scenes reminiscent of stuff like ""Black Hawk Down"" but it also acts as a strong message about the hidden costs of conflict diamonds and the ugly greed that captivates so many. Not only this but the acting in this movie is almost in a different league to other films in this genre - DiCaprio is simply brilliant (take it from someone who works with a lot of people from that part of the world - his accent is faultless) but he is matched every inch by Hounsou as the tortured everyman caught up in a seemingly endless nightmare. The storyline between Archer and Bowen was a tad predictable but other than that, this was an old-fashioned adventure movie with fantastic action sequences and lit up with quality in the casting.It might not be the easiest film to watch - the scenes of carnage brought by the RUF, especially, are savage and brutal - but like ""Black Hawk Down"", this is a simply unmissable movie for any action fan. But by also highlighting the numerous problems with conflict diamonds and the terror they are responsible for, ""Blood Diamond"" is a lot more effective at bringing the issue to your attention than any song by Kanye West. And also like ""Black Hawk Down"", this movie seems to be rather under-rated and forgotten about for reasons I can only speculate on. This was nominated for five Oscars not that long ago and yet, I can't remember hearing anyone tell me how good this was. Maybe it's sitting in everyone else's film collection and they haven't got round to watching it yet. If so, take it from me - this is a magnificent film and one that you'll kick yourself for missing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well acted and thoughtful action flick,"A very good movie that tells an important story. I'll second all the well deserved praise regarding the actors; after Leo's turn in this movie (and ""The Departed"") I'm a newly minted DiCaprio fan. Djimon Hounsou, serving as the emotional center of the film, adds another good performance to his resume. Jennifer Connelly's presence is always a plus to this viewer. While the theme of the story was interesting and the screen play generally well-written, some of character interactions came off as slightly clichéd. The direction served the story; the action scenes were convincing and the movie, as a whole, flowed. I also enjoyed much of the music in the film.Definitely not just another empty action flick, but a film that tells a story that many of us haven't followed.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The film points out that we must determine where a diamond comes from before buying it and so I don't buy the stuff about the movie causing problems for the diamond industry.I take my hat off to those involved with making films like this (also Lord of War, The Constant Gardner and Hotel Rwanda) as the enlighten us on the way the west can exploit Africa. Sure, there are other places in the world that deserve our sympathy and attention, but the magnitude and scale of the atrocities that have faced/face Africa should not go untold. We don't pay attention to the stories on the news and so at least we cant ignore it for long thanks to such movies. The child soldier stuff is particularly horrible and it really is time people did more to figure out how to combat that problem.Leo is great as always. Good film, lets now check out antislavery.org or amnesty and prove that Hollywood can inspire and bring out the greater good in our hearts...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beware The Pink Bleeding Heart,"As with his film 'Defiance' there is a good movie in 'Blood Diamond' but Ed Zwick fails to make it. Hollywood must be the only place left in the world that thinks 'journalism' is still an admirable profession. I don't always like Leo, but I thought his accent was terrific and his swashbuckling fortune hunter persona, spot on. It's the script that lets Leo down. I don't buy his character's massive change of heart for a second. Nor do I accept Jennifer Connally as some sort of heroine. Hounsou is excellent, albeit somewhat type cast and David Harewood is terrifying. Zwick has now spoiled, at least, two potentially good films by concentrating on the small picture rather than the big picture. Maybe he should get a dog.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Unimpressive, loud, unmoving","Blood diamonds are pinkish in nature, and the term ""blood diamond"" refers to the blood spilled by those who were killed during its mining or transfer from the heart of Africa to stores around the world. That much I learned from the movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral smuggler who teams up with a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) and an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). I also learned that huge multinational companies control the diamond market by hoarding all the diamonds. Actually, I knew that part already.Denny Archer (DiCaprio) sells guns to rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds, which he then turns over to a diamond cartel. Pretty nice gig, really, especially since apparently everyone in Sierra Leone is in on it except for the poor souls who have to mine the stuff. The revolutionaries rampage through villages, killing most of the citizens, including the women and children, and taking the men to work in the diamond mines. Some of the male children are taken to be ""baby killers"" among the rebels. So you see, everyone has a nice job.Until the day that Solomon (Hounsou), mining in a creek for the rebels against his will, comes across a pink stone described as being about the size of a bird's egg. (It's never mentioned which bird, though.) As the rebels are being bombed by the government, Solomon buries the stone. But of course he's been spotted, and the rest of the movie is spent by everyone trying to get his or her hands on it to get out of Africa in one piece.One of those people is Archer. At first you get the impression that he's sort of a summa-cum-Indy, an adventurer who looks like he's out for himself but deep down is a right respectable bastard who'll save a pretty girl and prevent an innocent man from being stabbed. Well, he's sort of that person, in that he'll save the pretty girl (Connelly), as long as he still gets his money. Kind of a low-rent Han Solo, really, only without the cool ride. At any rate, while in jail in Sierra Leone, Archer overhears a captured rebel commander accuse the also-imprisoned Solomon of hiding a big ol' diamond. And that, apparently, is all Archer needs to know, as he gets Solomon bailed out for the sole purpose of getting him to lead Archer to the diamond.To accomplish this, Archer joins forces with Maddy (Connelly), a journalist looking for the real story of the rape of the African continent. She knows the diamond cartels are behind all the mayhem but can't print anything without anyone willing to go on the record with names and dates and other information. Of course, the swaggering Archer might be that person. Might they strike a deal? Oh, even better yet - perhaps they'll fall in love with each other, running through the jungles and plains? Leonardo DiCaprio could wear a four-foot beard and still look about sixteen years old. He can't disguise his youthfulness with a somewhat-acceptable Afrikaans accent (Archer is supposed to be from Rhodesia, aka Zimbabwe). And were we supposed to root for him or against him? In the hands of a skilled actor, ambiguous intentions can lend an air of mystery to a character, but it's a delicate chore; otherwise, you wind up not really caring if the guy's supposed to be good or bad. Such it is with Archer. I got it. He's in it for himself. Okay, I wondered, now what? Give me a reason why I should care if he dies, if all he's after is the diamond, no matter the cost of human life.On the other hand, Hounsou is exceptional as a man who's quiet life has been incontrovertibly rent asunder by the invading rebel forces, which kidnap his son and turn him against his own people, and the government itself, which quarantines all refugees with the idea that it's too tough to tell which refugees are with the rebels and which are not. Having lost nearly everything save his own dignity, Solomon does not break, but bends when he must. His urgent need is to reunite with his family and restore order to their lives. Nothing else matters; he sees his diamond as a way out of everything.Completing the troika is Connelly, who offers a somewhat distaff performance as the naive, unlikeable journo Maddy. Why would Maddy feel compelled to help Archer? Oh, that's right, he's Leonardo DiCaprio. The blunt sexual tension gets to be a bit too much at times; try to avoid screaming ""oh, just get on with it, already!"" at the screen. Connelly's done much better work than here, of course. It's just that she seems so listless, almost bored at times by the proceedings, like she can't quite believe she's in this junky, pseudoaction movie.We're supposed to take away from this movie the central message that Diamonds Are Bad, at least if people died in order for them to make it to us. As soon as the movie came out, various diamond companies announced they were upstanding companies who'd never, ever do anything like this. I don't know what I should believe, because I've always sort of thought that buying shiny rocks was a dumb thing to do, anyway. But overall, the impression one gets is that this is just another dumb Hollywood message/action movie. A lot of the time, the scenes are basically people running from one explosion to another; luckily, the fine acting of Hounsou allows the audience to track what's going on rather effectively. And of course, in the end Things Are Solved, as I'm sure they are in real life.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
One Leo's best performances,"Blood Diamond was a remarkable film that should of gotten film of the year award after The Departed. NOT that I am saying The Departed was no good I just felt in Blood Diamond we were given true depth into Leo DiCaprio's ability as an actor. Set in the back drop of the Seirra Leone Civil War, Blood Diamond is the story of lust power , money , greed to the highest degree all over a rare pink diamond for which all this madness and chaos is about. There is a lot happening in this film so you do have to watch it carefully and usually that would be a complaint of mine but in this film it was I felt an important part because it is all about the chaos that happens in a nation and how the ones in power will do absolutely everything to make sure that carnage ensues so that they can line their pockets with the blood money. The acting was top notch and I really could go on forever how Leo DiCap stole the show with one of his best performances (he starting to compete with Jhonny Depp now , as he has long shrug of his handsome, pretty boy image in Titanic). Djimou Houston acting was also something special as he plays an innocent man caught up in all this and not to mention Jennifer Connolley as a reporter trying ever so hard to make a difference but frustrated at the lack of international attention and not to mention stand out performance's from Arnold Vosloo and the Rebel United Front leader. The action was fast and non-stop with equal amounts of wit and humour from every angle, my only thing was that apart from its romantic moments which never really hit the spot apart from in one scene because we all know really that everybody is out for them-selves at the end of the day. To sum it I would have to say that Blood Diamond is an experiment with the truth. It shows how far a people with power are willing to stretch to ensure that a nation will tear it-self apart so the customer demands of the likes 50 cents, Snopp Dogg are met but only if they realised the amount of blood spilt for a diamond which shows how cheap life really is worth out there.BLOOD DIAMOND - 8.8 OUT OF 10IT WILL COST YOU EVERYTHING !",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
That's Africa,"Do you notice any blood on your diamond ring when you look at it Madam? No? Then go to see this movie and you'll notice it next time. The most remarkably good features of this movie are the reality of today's Africa and the amazing rhythm of the cut and the images with no dead moments. Particularly remarkable are the constant contrast of the appalling African sequences with the meetings and forums in the comfortable atmosphere of the First World where some dressy gentlemen discuss the problems of the diamond trade in a distant and unaffected way while a lot of bloodshed occurs because of it. This movie shows us a truth that can no longer be ignored after viewing it. In parallel with the struggle for the command of the diamond trade our attention is also drawn to the problem of the children soldiers in which the little children are changed into little killing monsters after being violently abducted from their families and subjected to a terrible brainwashing. The romantic and idealistic story which is the backbone of the movie, joining a white smuggler and a poor African fisherman has got a few flaws perhaps for excess of idealism but it arrives of moving us in the end. Maybe human nature is not so bad indeed after all. Those two characters are looking with different aims for a most invaluable diamond the fisherman has hidden underground. The smuggler wants the money it will give him while the fisherman wants only to be helped in finding his son that a rebel army has kidnapped to make him a child soldier. There is also the sentimental relationship between the smuggler and the woman journalist which occurs in an almost chaste and restrained atmosphere though we can feel its real deepness in some dialogues and even in some silences for instance when the woman caresses the smuggler's hand after he has told her how his parents were killed in Zimbabwe; we can feel his contained emotion after he finishes his story. This is one of the most moving scenes of the movie. But I need hardly say that in this movie nobody goes to bed with nobody. The fact is that we don't even see a single kiss which is rare in movies nowadays. And it looks like the most violent sequences which are numerous and admirably filmed are done without resorting to any special effects or computer tricks which makes them to appear extremely real.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A film that goes beyond the simplicity and the ""love of country""","A film that goes beyond the simplicity and the ""love of country"". With an interesting story, based on the search for a diamond, with the backdrop of the regime of slavery and misery found in Sierra Leone during the Civil War. With scenes that depict the conflict lived in this corner of the world, that excel in reality most cruel, not glosses the suffering of the people in that reality, and fantastic cast as Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Honsou, again with excellent performance . All this makes this feature film an accurate portrayal of the suffering of the people and more an attempt to elucidate the existing world of countless conflicts around the globe. Allegations of living conditions of the people are there, the pictures are well done and representative of reality. The hunt Solomon (Honsou) and Danny (Dicaprio) for the diamond is quite interesting, showing ably present reality in the world, the value given to money, despising the way to obtain it. An exceptional film, not leaving anyone indifferent.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond,"Blood Diamond I like Leonardo DiCaprio, and I am happy he has done this movie. He gets into the skin of every character he plays, and I like that dedication of his. He has learned and is improving with every challenging performance.Blood Diamond is a typical 70-80's American adventure movie. Such movies are nice to see after a long time, it reminded me of Indiana Jones series, a power packed adventure drama. Only addition this time is that the narrative has more violence in it.Without mentioning the director  Edward Zwick in the beginning of my review, I would be doing disservice. Edward Zwick has punched in enough commercial delight with a human rights (that's what I heard on TV!?) message. Yes, he touches the fringes of critical issues that tingles the mind. The movie casually makes philosophical, political, economic and a few cynical statements especially against American life and thinking. But that does not stop the director to carve out his narrative out of the Hollywood style of story telling.The setting is epic  in the backdrop of Sierra Leone diamond mines and rebel war lords who fight inhumanly for getting a few more diamonds. The story is about Djimon Hounson who finds and hides a big diamond; Leonardo in pursue of the diamond joins hand with Djimon  who now wants to go back to his land to find his son. Jennifer Connelly is a journalist (so typical!!) in search for an expose to illegal diamond trade, who develops a love bond with Leonardo and helps him at crucial juncture.But let me tell you that the story is bit over-stretched, and linking all child soldiers to diamond trade is untrue. Nor the persistent violence of such a heavy shooting and killings on the streets exists amidst environment of normal life. But this is a commercial format  and I think such liberties are permissible.The movie is well made  and scores high on every department of movie making techniques  cinematography, actions, sets, music and above all acting. Leonardo is great, Djimon is terrific and Jennifer is 'American'!! I think the credit of bringing out this story and screenplay should be given to Charles Leavitt, who successfully blends good story (like a typical epic action novel) in a commercial format. There are softer moments in the film, that dwells into and touches intense global issues  but I thought that it fell one or two notches short of hitting bulls eye.If you like Leonardo, go and see the movie  you will love him. And even if you do not like Leonardo, but like good commercial movies go and see the movie, you will like it.(6.5 Stars)",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond Movie Review,"The background of this film is in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. During his time in the diamond mines, he finds the pink diamond and the commandant of the rebels sees. If Solomon wants to get the pink diamond, he must avoid the commandant of the rebels. Then he meets Danny Archer. Since Danny wants to get the pink diamond from Solomon and Solomon wants to meet his son again, Danny would like to help Solomon in order to get the pink diamond.In my opinion, I would like to suggest this movie for every people to watch. It is because it is a gripping film from start to finish. When the rebels kidnap children from the village and train them to become devils. That's a horrible and memorable performance. You should absolutely see it. And once you have seen it, I assure you that you will think twice before purchasing diamonds in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Chinese food of a film.,"A solid entry to the 'trials of post-colonial Africa' sub-genre, Blood Diamond is a bit like a lavish Chinese takeaway. It feels very good and is quite moving when you're watching it, the acting from DiCaprio and Hounsou is strong stuff and, as ever, Connelly is radiantly beautiful, but ten minutes after the film I feltnot much. Maybe it is just less affecting than Last King of Scotland, or, as someone without a diamond in the house, maybe the guilt trip it lays was less pressing than the unilateral Western shame of Hotel Rwanda. Either way, I think this is a solid and enjoyable movie, but less potent than the director and all-star cast were perhaps hoping for.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Over-acted, over-preachy, overwrought, underwhelming","The last few years have produced quite a few films about the seemingly intractable plight of the African continent: ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Hotel Rwanda"", ""The Interpreter"", and ""The Last King of Scotland"" rank among the best. ""Blood Diamond"" ranks among the worst.The film is bookended by Stephen Collins as a noble American ambassador trying to end the sale of diamonds from combat zones. In between, there is a stale action-movie plot with preachy dialog and over-acting that redefines scenery-chewing.Leonardo DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a cynical smuggler/mercenary trying to make enough money from Sierra Leone's civil war in the 1990's so that he can leave for Europe of America. Djimon Honsou is Solomon, a sympathetic everyman with a loving wife and family. When the rebels--commanded by Captain Poison (David Harewood in full melodrama-villain mode)--come to his town, they enslave him to pan for diamonds in the river. Right when he finds a really big diamond, government troops raid the camp and take everyone prisoner. During their night in jail together, Danny overhears about Solomon's find & spends the rest of the movie trying to get Solomon to dig it up and give it to him. Meanwhile Captain Poison kidnaps Solomon's son Dia and tries to mold him into a rebel soldier.For sex appeal, we have Jennifer Connely as Maddy, a noble American journalist. She and Danny are supposed to have some kind of attraction; but instead of having sex, kissing, or even flirting, they just bicker about the state of post-colonial Africa, and she keeps preaching at him about the diamond trade, his profession and his cynicism.Director Ed Zwick has made other sermon-films such as ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"". ""Glory"" succeeded because it was a true story. ""The Last Samurai"" succeeded because the anti-imperialist message fit neatly within the plot and didn't seem forced. In ""Blood Diamond"", I can even imagine Bono thinking ""enough already"" during one of Stephen Collins' or Jennifer Connelly's monologues.As to DiCaprio's and Honsou's Oscar nominations: DiCaprio was deserving this year, but for ""The Departed"", not this film. In this one, he completely hams it up, especially toward the end. I can only imagine the Academy was impressed by the fact that not once does he slip into an American accent, and that he has finally figured out how to trim his beard so it's not dorky-looking. Why Honsou was nominated remains a mystery to me. He is a fine actor and has had far superior roles in the past; but he was nominated for them, so this is hardly a case of the Academy trying to right past wrongs. In this film--I kid you not--he shouts, goes bug-eyed and drools during the action sequences.Africa's problems are a fascinating and worthy subject for Hollywood to deal with, especially since the rest of the world has cast a blind eye for far too long. But ""Blood Diamond"" will not change anyone's minds or alter their buying habits. Instead of being like ""Three Kings""--which refused to be predictable in combining Hollywood action and a socially conscious message--it is more like ""The Day After Tomorrow""--which used the worst Hollywood action clichés in an unsuccessful attempt to try and preach at us. 5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

No joke.I say this because Blood Diamonds reveals the truth about the diamond trade which leads straight up to the big diamond stores in the West.

This was the most interesting part and SHOULD HAVE been the entire movie. But, instead we got a brief glimpse of the inner-workings which was cased in a Hollywood love and chase story formula we are used to seeing in every other Hollywood suspense-action flick.Still, go see it.Best part: Jennifer Connelly is beautiful. Best actor: main black actor Worst part: script faults. He buries the diamond whilst the main villain is there. But after this only he knows its whereabouts but the villain doesn't know where it is??

The Blood Diamond- Could it be Leo's chance to Shine at the Oscars?,"Edward Zwick's new film the Blood Diamond is a true piece of cinematic art. Leonardo Dicaprio once again delivers a powerful performance & is without a doubt a tour de force.Playing a South African there was concern about the accent but he has perfected it to such a degree that one can mistake him for an Afrikaner.nobody could've embodied such a complex character better or with more honesty and he gives Danny Archer so much depth.Even with a different accent he never wavers. Both Djimon & Jennifer give fantastic performances and should not be overlooked in any way,Djimon is very emotionally engaging and has a great presence on screen while Jennifer brings a softer side to the tough reporter she portrays giving a quiet but memorable performance.These characters are raw and real and they draw you into their world.add to that locations & outstanding cinematography with its panning shots and fast paced angles used during the action sequences & you have a film that is so gripping it captures its audience like a rabbit in a snare. although the story & the characters are fictitious the issue of conflict-diamonds is very real.this can be seen as the eye-opening film of the year and will hopefully cause us to recognize what corruption occurs when people take advantage of their own struggling countries to ensure their own selfish gain.Zwick has successfully made a heartfelt action drama with emotional depth and which opens us up to the horrors of the civil war of 1999.He brings fact and fiction together beautifully and we feel for both the characters and the situation faced in Sierre Leone.the theme has stirred concern but in my opinion that only makes the film more worthy.It truly deserves Oscar praise in all categories.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Perfect Movie,"""Blood Diamond"" works in the two most lucrative ways: both as a powerful film that the Oscars love, and a summer action/adventure film. It is both of these at the same time for its nearly two-and-a-half hour running length. Despite its length, it is always fully engaging and NEVER boring.The best way to classify this movie is as an epic, though not in the same sense as say, ""Braveheart"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia."" It has wide epic scale, fully realized characters, a thoroughly compelling plot and thrilling action. I don't think there is a person alive who wouldn't find something to appreciate in ""Blood Diamond.""1999. Sierra Leone is in the midst of a brutal civil war. Both the government and the rebel RUF are battling for the control of the diamond trade. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) has found a giant, priceless diamond, and just before he is captured, he hides it. A smuggler named Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) finds out about it, and promises to help him find his son if Vandy shows him where he hid it. Along for the ride is journalist Maddie Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who also wants to write the story of how one company makes money off the war.The film features two brilliant performances. Leonardo DiCaprio has long since left his ""Titanic""-era heartthrob days behind him, and continues to impress as a serious thespian. This is his best performance yet. Danny Archer is a familiar character, but DiCaprio does enough with him to make him unique. He doesn't like having to help Solomon, but he knows he doesn't have much choice. The same goes for Maddie Bowen, as he is reluctant to give her information, but he has to in order to use the resources that she has. Matching him is Djimon Hounsou, who continues to astound with his mostly unrecognized acting abilities. Solomon Vandy is a desperate man, but he will not let someone push him around, even if they are pointing a gun in his face. To him, the diamond is nothing. All that matters is getting his family back. Hounsou uses his capacity for power and strength to portray a man who is so desperate that he becomes fearless. Jennifer Connelly may have a less showy role, but she does enough with it that it avoids becoming a cliché.This is clearly a movie for Edward Zwick. He's no stranger to this kind of film, and he knows exactly what to do with it. He treats the material with respect, and gets his point across, but he knows that people go to the movies to be entertained, and he balances that perfectly. ""Blood Diamond"" has a lot to say, but Zwick keeps things movie at a brisk pace. This is his best film yet, and I am eager to see what the future has in store for him.Typically, musical scores are a small part of a film, but nevertheless a film wouldn't be the same without them (or in some cases, with them). Here, the score plays a big part in the film's success. It's not that its noticeable, or anything special (you're not likely to come out humming its main theme, if it even has one). But it perfectly sets to tone. Without the viewer really noticing it, the music changes the film's tone from something serious and hard-hitting to something more alive and adventurous. James Newton Howard's score is brilliant in how it accomplishes this, because if the film had a different score, it would feel a lot different.""Blood Diamond"" is the perfect movie. Sure, a lot of the stuff is familiar, but there's a lot of new stuff as well, and the filmmakers and actors do enough to make it all seem fresh. This is one of the best films of 2006, and one of my all-time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Blood Diamond, Finally some tragedy and Reality","Set in a war torn Africa the story follows an apparently emotionless mercenary turned diamond smuggler. The imagery used to portray the violence and heartlessness that is the way of life in these war torn countries should be enough to leave the audience in a severe state of shock. Nominated for best picture and several other Oscars and awards including ones for acting which surprisingly went to Leo DiCaprio when Djimon Honssou portrayed the true acting skills. The stunning contrast between the violence and deprivation of the war torn country of Sierra Leon and the majestic beauty that is the true essence of the African continent, create the perfect setting and ideas that the audience should see. Despite the clichéd but seemingly necessary romance the film was surprisingly ""unidealistic"", which is uncharacteristic of Hollywood, however the director (Edward Zwick) would seem to be making a name for himself with the tragedy that runs rampant in his films.

Blood Diamond shines,"Director/Producer Edward Zwick's (""Last Samurai,"" ""Courage Under Fire,"" ""Glory"") ""Blood Diamond"" couldn't have been made without Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad,"" ""Gladiator"") who hails from the Dark Continent that has been plagued by ravaging disease, famine and civil war for decades. Set in Sierra Leone, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) hooks up with the main protagonist of the story, mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, in an Oscar worthy performance, complete with South African dialect on the money) while in prison. Seems Vandy has unearthed a rare pink diamond in the rough during his forced labor work after local insurgents separate him from his family, now on the run. He buries the gem, worth enough to change all their lives, in a conflict diamond field. Archer wants a cut, but he and Vandy clash on values; Vandy just wants to locate his family. To that end, Archer employs the help of newfound friend, an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, ""A Beautiful Mind""), who accompanies the unlikely duo in their quest for the life-altering bling. Along the way, Bowen realizes her crisis-driven career as a conflict story reporter for a value- based magazine lines up with Archer's angst having been brought up in dangerous territories like the ones she reports on. Hounsou's performance is so powerful and believable that he becomes part of the war torn yet breathtaking landscape as he races to find his estranged family. The movie soars as the characters' plight coaxes viewers to find out more about how approximately 15 percent of the world's consumer diamonds exported to places like the United States and United Kingdom are delivered with blood in their carats. And that blood is often spilled by child soldiers.Writer's note: I actually know Djimon Hounsou from a cultural exchange program his brother participated in when Hounsou was working on his first film, ""Stargate.""

Blood Diamond: Dazzling yet Flawed,"""Blood Diamond"" boasts noteworthy performances from its cast, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, whose acting prowess instills a level of emotional depth and authenticity into the narrative. Yet, a discernible disconnect emerges between the film's stunning visuals and its core message - the poignant reality of the conflict diamond trade sometimes appears glossed over by captivating cinematography.Jennifer Connelly's character, Maddy Bowen, unfortunately, falls prey to weak character development, with her arguments often coming across as one-dimensional, thus diminishing the credibility of the film. Her perceived cultural naivety seems to tarnish her role as a journalist, resulting in interactions that appear more contrived than authentic.Despite DiCaprio's convincing portrayal of the hardened mercenary, Danny Archer, his character's evolution towards a more compassionate individual through ""love"" feels overly stereotyped, catering to conventional Hollywood narratives. Similarly, Djimon Hounsou's potent portrayal of Solomon Vandy sometimes veers towards the clichéd ""noble savage"" archetype, thereby oversimplifying the nuances of his ordeal.The film's reliance on familiar Hollywood tropes, such as superfluous gunfights and a forced romantic subplot, detracts from its pressing commentary on conflict diamonds.Nonetheless, ""Blood Diamond"" impressively leverages the power of sound design and musical selection, successfully immersing the audience in the turbulent environment of Sierra Leone, and providing poignant depth to pivotal scenes.In summation, while ""Blood Diamond"" showcases strengths in acting caliber and auditory design, it is hampered by its failure to fully realize character complexity and its resort to clichéd storytelling. Although it remains entertaining, a more integrated approach could have significantly amplified its impact. Despite its flaws, I would offer the film a rating of 7, acknowledging its earnest effort to bring a global issue to the forefront of public awareness.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
taking a serious plot not so seriously,"This movie was worse than just a disappointment, it was a joke. The entire film followed one plot twist after another. It's a clear example of poor storytelling. The writing seemed unable to hold its ground both artistically and intellectually, relying on gimmicks to awe the audience. This only made the plot seem desperate and laughable--partially exhilarating for only 1.5 hours of this nearly 2.5 hour film.The film was much like a cheap clock from The Sharper Image. It might contain an alarm, CD player, radio and weather station for the price of one, but all the parts are cheap--getting them all in one makes for a poorly constructed clock. This movie tried to mix James Bond with Hotel Rwanda and the emotional tension and drama of Real World. It attempted a serious plot with little affection.I recommend seeing Babel and then Casino Royale--not both at the same time.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
A bloody good movie,"What BABEL strives for with 4 contrived tragic intertwined story threads, THE BLOOD DIAMOND hits a bullseye with one excellent and timely topic with a powerful and believable subplot.......and a stellar performance by an ever increasingly admirable Leonardo Di Caprio. Like Matt Damon in THE GOOD SHEPHERD and James Franco in FLYBOYS we see a major young male actor delivering a performance that carries the whole film, elevating it to near classic proportions and allowing for a complete absorption and focus for the astonished viewer. I have high admiration for the massive production undertaking that is clearly on screen allowing for a spectacular and tragic epic drama that bats political home runs right to the viewer's increasing awareness of the horrors and cruelties of Africa. As 'worldly' as BABEL attempts and becomes laboured, preachy and contrived; this film succeeds because it is mounted as a combat political thriller with deep social awareness, family realities and utter sadness of loss of spirit. THE BLOOD DIAMOND is terrifying in every way and clever to allow the viewer to be so well swept up that any 'lessons' of the plot and character come as welcome fascinating insights rather than a shopping list of BABEL misery. Director Edward Zwick who also was behind GLORY in 1989 sees the power in the struggle of injustice and noble races has, to me, now offered a superb tough look at the reality of recent Africa and a consumer issue still valid in 2007.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Blood Diamond: Leo's gem of an SA accent!,"Finally Hollywood has brought through its ranks someone who can pull off a South African accent without getting laughed of stage.This has been a point of some concern for South Africans who have seen their lovely accent slaughtered in films like Lethal Weapon 2 and Mission Impossible 2. It seems to always be villains that get lumbered with the task, that and cheesy action sequels. An exception was ""the interpreter"", where Nicole Kidman, wisely stayed away from doing a ""full blown"" rendition and opted for a softer inferred accent. Even so it was still a little crap, and if Nicole Kidman can't pull it off then who can. Remember she kissed Tom ""alien lover"" Cruise with a straight face!.Strangely enough, South African actors in Hollywood, never get to use their elusive and enigmatic voice in films. Arnold Vosloo was ""the Mummy"" in the ""The Mummy"" and would have been much scarier if he was Afrikaans. Charlize Theron, would have been far more believable as a serial-killer-lesbian, if she spoke like us.Apparently Leo is the man we were waiting for. Leonardo Dicaprio, is the first to my knowledge that has managed to get the subtle guttural tones without it sounding parodic or just plain silly. He also went one step further to mimic the ""meat eating"" body language of our fair nation. Our hats are off to him and he is welcome back anytime.Actually while he was here filming, my wife bumped into him at the Diesel shop at the V&A Waterfront, the shop assistants were all in a tizz and dragged up rails from the other diesel shops and closed the doors for a private shopping spree.

Gripping and Informative Story With Interesting Characters,"Blood Diamond is a very moving film. The story will grip you from the very first moment and drag you on one intense ride. You want action?

He gets the most out of his actors, he chooses the most beautiful and the most ugly locations, and he tells this story in a way that draws you in as if you are in the throes of hypnosis. I thought Leonardo Dicaprio's best performance to date might have been The Departed. Not so. He is just as good, if not better, in Blood Diamond. High marks also go to Djimon Hounsou and youngster Kagiso Kuypers.And although there is less screen time for the romance between Jennifer Connolly and Dicaprio, it is every bit as intense as the one you witness in Titanic.

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Blood Diamond (2006),"This will make you think about that big shiny rock on your finger. This reminded me of Tears of the Sun.

He hasn't won as many awards as he should have. Something that might annoy some people is he accent in this movie. I liked it but some might not. Djimon Hounsou,who is one of the most underrated actors in movies today brought a intense and powerful performance. Jennifer Connelly was not bad but not good. It felt like she was there so it wasn't a total sausage fest. Kagiso Kuypers played Dia Vandy(Hounsou's son in the film)who was IMO the best performance in this movie. He has only been in one movie and he was excellent.As i said before. It is like Tears of the Sun.

Politically charged action thriller,"*Note: This review contains a SPOILER. Not a very big one, hell not even worth ticking the spoiler warning box when typing it up. But if you want to go in completely blind I suggest skipping to the next one. Unless that has spoilers too.*Overly preachy epics about the nonchalance of the Capitalist West when it comes to the suffering of the third world have been getting something of a resurgence of late. First, we got George Clooney pointing an accusing finger at the global oil industry for the radicalised violence of the Middle East in Syriana and just before Christmas, Forrest Whitaker came charging out of the starting gates in The Last King Of Scotland to show exactly what sort of people are supported by Western Governments in order to keep the rich/poor imbalance in place around the world. Next to join this rapidly growing club is Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. The target this time round though is not corrupt oil barons or African dictators but the diamond industry and their fuelling of third world conflicts by buying up diamonds from combat zone warlords. For those of you worried about another talk-heavy slow burner though then we may have found a solution, for while Blood Dimaond may be so preachy that it's borderline propaganda, it's also an action movie.Yes, Zwick and co have decided to use the civil war that ravaged Sierra Leone in the late 90s as a backdrop for an adrenaline charged gun flick that is reminiscent of John Woo's Bullet In The Head for putting a civilian face on war rather than a military one. The film follows Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a South African mercenary who recruits down on his luck native Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) to help him find a king size diamond out in the bush while the country falls apart around them. This deranged little quest soon turns into an epic journey with them battling from one set piece to another. Thus, we get the pair ducking and diving around street corners as they try to escape the country's capital during the rebel invasion, the city torn apart as gunfire rips into soldiers and civilians alike with reckless abandon. Later, we get a brutal massacre of a group of journalists leading to a fast paced car chase and also helicopter attacks on guerrilla camps. As the duo hurtle in and out of life and death scenarios, you find yourself wondering exactly how much violence an Oscar nominated 'serious' film can possibly contain? Right up until another truckload of soldiers come bellowing out of the jungle with guns blazing...Mixed up in all this is a variety of subplots showing the plight of the country. Solomon's decision to join Archer is fired not by greed but by the desire to find his missing son, who has been captured by the rebels and turned into a child soldier. This provides the most harrowing element of the film, with youngsters barely past their tenth year being brainwashed into killing machines who slaughter their own people without any sign of remorse. It's lifted right from the pages of National Geographic magazine and is all the more haunting for it.Unfortunately, not everything works as well as it should. The running time especially is pushing it, clocking in just shy of three hours which could have been trimmed down by jettisoning the unnecessary ending, a hasty epilogue tacked on when it would have worked far better to end on the mountainside. Whatsmore, Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen is a bit too heavy handed. She works as mouthpiece for the writers opinions and not a lot more, associating love struck men who buy diamond rings for their childhood sweethearts with mass murderers with all the tact and grace of an appropriate metaphor with a tact bypass and no grace.Preachy though it may be though, Blood Diamond is still an enjoyable film and a noble one at that. Like Syriana beforehand, it illustrates how everything in the world is connected and how something as innocuous as going to the shops can lead to hundreds of people in another country being slaughtered by AK totting eleven year olds. It's a very slick, dramatic movie and has another impressive performance from DiCaprio. It might be over the top but when most films would turn a blind eye to the world, this one shoves it right in your face and will leave you with at least a few difficult questions to consider.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Blood Diamond: A brilliant film about a shocking, inconvenient truth","The Blood Diamond is a really 'strong' film that presents facts (in particular, how diamonds reach our hands) in a most realistic way.

"Man, I'm glad I live in America!","Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, ""This is Africa.""The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or 'blood diamonds' until seeing ""Blood Diamond,"" so the film is successful just by being educational.Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.The film runs 143 minutes.FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
This Diamond Doesn't Shine,"Against the backdrop of the civil war in Sierra Leone, a soldier of fortune and a fisherman try to retrieve a rare diamond that the latter has buried. The ravages of war are effectively conveyed but it takes a while for a narrative to emerge from all that chaos. And the narrative is less than compelling due to a weak script and undeveloped characters. Although they find time to espouse philosophy in breaks between frequent gun battles, the characters remain one-dimensional. The film is meant to be emotionally gripping but is tedious instead.

Blood Diamond,"Blood Diamond is set in the late 90's in Africa and is about a fisherman named Solomon Vandy who is taken away from his family and forced to work in the diamond mines. The film is also about an ex mercenary named Danny Archer who is looking for diamonds. Solomon finds a diamond and hides it and soon meets up with Danny who helps him escape from the mine and Solomon promises to help Danny find the diamond he buried if Danny will help him relocate his family. The two are also helped by a journalist named Maddy Bowen. The film is in some ways a thriller about escaping the guards and the violence that rule the country and in other ways is a drama dealing with political issues and about a man trying to get back to his family. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Supporting Actor (Djimon Hounsou, who plays Solomon) at The National Board of Review. Blood Diamond has good direction, a good script, great performances by the cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. I was impressed by this film in the way that it was a longer running film, but it never got boring and always had a good steady pace. The performances are great and worthy of award nominations and I like how the film incorporated political issues into this story and at the same time got to focus on these characters and become a bit of a character study. This is a good looking film as well and it is well directed and has a good script too. The film is quite powerful and moving in several ways as we care about Solomon and wish to see him reunited with his family and we also feel bad for the people of Africa who have been subjected to all this violence and loss. This is a well made and engaging film with a great cast and crew behind it and a powerful and engaging story that should keep your interest right till the end.

TIA  - This Is Africa,"I really wanted to see this movie but was scared by the drama element ever since I've seen Titanic Leonardo Di-Caprio has left a scar on me, the wound has since healed and Leo has matured on to become one of the finest actors in Hollywood but I'm still scared I'm going to walk into a much hyped movie and come out suffering from 3.5 hours of exposure to drama and romance.Yet I did see the movie the weekend it released in India and was happy I did.""This is Africa"" as the actors of the film often repeat is the in fact the central theme of the movie.The movie explores the ground situation in most war torn countries of Africa and shows us some very interesting and thought inducing facts.1)That natural resources have indeed on bought about death and destruction to Africa (true from historic times) this is summed up brilliantly by the dialogue in the movie ""Thank good they didn't find oil"" (something middle east will vouch for).2)That indigenous people in Africa are in fact as responsible for the problems in Africa as the foreigners and instead of organising themselves into helping each other they allow themselves to be manipulated into helplessness, the spate of the people in Africa can again be summed up brilliantly by the dialogue ""....then you'll just be another black man in Africa"".3)That there is hope and even though they are war torn and death and destruction is part of their everyday lives the people who dare to dream in Africa and and there are others who want to make a difference.4)The child soldiers (not only in Africa) are the most frightening part of any war torn country children and fragile and when they cross the line they don't just walk but run. Child Soldiers are known to be most brutal of any soldiers and the most heinous war crimes like rape, dismemberment and even cannibalism are mostly carried out by them. Tackling this is going to be the biggest problem, that those trying to restructure such countries face.5)And my favourite part is how the movie has explored the mixed feelings that the local white people of Africa feel. They are the most interesting part of the movie. Wanting to leave and at the same time struggling with the love for the land they were born and brought up in, are just some of the problems they face, confused about loyalties, racism and to boot it all the funny accents (Leo did a brilliant job here, he sounded just like some of the South African and Zimbabwean cricketers ).The part about blood diamonds should have been only the the foundation on which the movie was built but was in fact given undue credit in the movie, sensationalists and I believe untrue figures were used to make it look like conflict diamonds were the only cause of Africas Problems and extra-brownie points were earned by putting the onus on the American People (sometimes the I think the Americans like to see themselves as the centre of the world and responsible for everything even death and destruction).The movie also seems out of date considering that Sierra Leone and many other Diamond Rich African States are now Conflict Free and the hordes of diamonds that had been stored can now be freely sold, yet peace has hardly bought any progress Sierra Leone has the highest infant mortality rate in the world and average lifespan is 38 years.Yet the movie has put a lot of focus and Africa and Africans and for that it gets huge credit.Techinically this movie is as good as any movie with this sort of budget and cast should be.Acting was nearly flawless every actor doing his job perfectly, yet Leo shown above the lot.The direction and cinematography was superb helped by Africas Natural Beauty.Background sounds, languages and accents showed superb research and were used effectively.And once again special effects were top notch.A flaw in the movie is its failure to show the double standards and opposing faces of the life and relief work in Africa, billions are being spent and while many (including relief workers) spend life luxuriously other grovel in poverty.The only other flaw the movie has (besides its diamond centric viewpoint )is the ending IT WAS WAY TO PREDICTABLE AND QUITE HYPOCRITICAL, there are enough clues in the movie that you are absolutely sure of the ending and it robs its effectiveness. Also the manner in which movie ends clearly shows double standards.I hate dramas but the brutal life like action and the interesting viewpoints ensure that you are always connected to the movie and the same time you are entertained and excited an extremely rare combination for movies that try to posses any measure of social commentary.A movie that can be watched and enjoyed by all, even by action/comedy only watcher like me.THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.-s slightly uni-dimensional portrayals and viewpoints, VERY PREDICTABLE ENDING.+/s romance ???? too universal to be a classic??.+s technically flawless in all aspects of films, Leonardo Di Caprio, great Africa Centric viewpoint which includes white Africans.total 8/10 (actually if you factor in expectations and universal appeal it actually a nine but my close friend is one the biggest cutters of diamonds (has never bought uncertified rough) and he assures me that the diamond issue is blown out of proportion (way to shift blame away from arms dealers and relief agencies? )and I trust him enough to give the movie a slightly lower rating)",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Blood Diamond Movie Review,"It is a movie about the blood diamond's war. In 1999, Sierra Leone, the government army and the rebels fight against each other in order to solve the conflicts of diamond by violence. A fisherman Solomon Vandy was kidnapped to work in the diamond mines and he found a huge pink diamond but his family members got lost during the war, and his son has been recruited by the rebels. Danny Archer, an ex mercenary from Zimbabwe, was going to help Solomon to find his family in order to exchange the pink diamond that Solomon found. During their trip, they met an American journalist, Maddy Bowen, who helps Solomon to find the exact place of their family. Did they finish their dreams finally?It is a moving story that full of sadness and it is a memorable movie thatthe plot is still running in my brain. The diamond war resulted in manydeaths and it is touch my feeling inside. It was harrowing about the war and the refugee camps. When Solomon saw his wife and daughter, it is touchable and gratified to have been favored by luck that I am now being with my family every day. It was a gripping file from start to finish. You can know more about the third world and the problem of child labor nowadays. I would highly recommend this film to all of you since you will get more than you give from this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Grade A,"Let me start with the performances: Leonardo DiCaprio as Danny Archer and Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy are exceptional. DiCaprio's accent is almost perfect (he spent time at South African bars to learn it). He has really matured as an actor -- I thought he was in the bottom 10% of all actors before seeing Blood Diamond and The Departed...After those two movies (and the most recent ones count the most) he's in the top 10%. Djimon Hounsou is ridiculously authentic as the farmer from Sierra Leonne.The plot line...The last 5 minutes of the movie seemed too much like the director was preaching. The other 138 minutes were that of a pure thriller based in a nonfictional setting.All in all, a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond An Excellent Film,"Blood Diamond is an excellent film with a compelling story, plenty of action, drama, suspense, and character development. The movie breezes by even with a running time of 143 minutes. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Danny Archer a South African ex-soldier turned smuggler. DiCaprio has really established himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood today with films like The Avaitor, Gangs Of New York, Catch Me If You Can, Titanic, and The Departed to name a few and he continues to show that in Blood Diamond. Equally impressive are Jennifer Connelly as Maddie Bowen a dedicated journalist and possible love interest and Djimon Honsou as Solomon Vandy a Mende fisherman who finds a rare pink diamond that could help him get back his family. At first Archer uses Solomon in order to get the diamond so that he can payback his employer for a deal that went bad earlier on in the film but a bond eventually grows between the two men that becomes an admiring friendship. All the supporting actors are good in the small roles including Arnold Vosloo and Michael Sheen. The director Edward Zwick does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen which couldn't have been an easy task. If you're looking for an entertaining film to watch then Blood Diamond is the movie for you. It has it all action, drama, suspense, thrills, adventure, some humor and a little romance that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Leo At His Best,"One of the best flicks out there in a few years. Along with The Departed, Leo has out done himself. He was excellent in both films and should of gotten the Oscar for one or the other.Actually the whole cast was excellent and the actor who played Solomon Vandy surely deserved recognition for a fine performance in this movie. Jennifer Connelly was very good, but still trying to think of another actress who could of played that part a bit better.You have action, romance, a true account of history, fine acting and directing, what else could you ask for.No spoiler here, but if anyone could sit thru Leo's last scenes without shedding a tear, I would have to say they have the coldest heart on earth.

In this movie he is a diamond dealer both a soldier.I realized two negative things about the movie; first is: the movie is too long, it takes 2 hours and 10 minutes. After one hour I get bored because story is not that deep or biographical. Second one is: first conversation between Di Caprio and Jennifer Connelly; it was not realistic. they weren't look like real characters of real world, they look like actors that acting not so well in this scene. Long memorized dialogs, arrogant moves and etc.Finally end of movie was good, it was satisfying and not very predictable.

"Good ideas, subpar execution","It's one of the few white savior films that has done the miracle of being fun to watch, despite the fair debate that it's part of a bankrupt cinema troupeMaybe because it shows Djimon Hounsou's character Solomon Vandy as a real person and someone who was already trying to save his family alone in Kimberly's blood diamond market with his own arc and conflicts.Maybe because it shows Danny as he really is, selfish, disillusioned, someone who takes advantage of his sweet talk at every possible opportunity for his own benefit.Perhaps because of the fantastic performances, despite the shallow and mediocre script that doesn't delve into anything it addresses, such as corruption, the field of blood diamonds, the dynamics between white and black Africans, how NGOs are used in the Third World for money laundering. Capitals, the influence of the US-EU in these diamond war fields in Africa or the ethics of war journalism and the terrible accent that Dicaprio tries to playUnlike pedantic films like Greenbook or The Blind Side, the white character in this adventure is not a hero, he is human, he is selfish, he is internally destroyed by a catastrophist mentality consistent with the tone of the story and his surroundings, which makes that the character's arc is very interesting and satisfying with good cinematography, despite some moments of superficial moral sermons common in this type of filmJennifer Connelly's character could have been explored much more, like almost everyone in the film, who ends up very superficial.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Good idea, just tried too hard","""Blood Diamond""  Rated R, C""Blood Diamond"" is one of the most confusing movies I've seen in quite some time. I can't say that I enjoyed it or hated it. Some parts are brilliant, but others are preachy and predictable.There are too many stories within the film to describe. It might be easier to list what I consider the main themes of the film, most of which are universal: · Parents want a better life for their kids. · Individuals are greedy, but governments are greedier. · Redemption is always possible. · Dire circumstances force people to perform unlikely actions to survive. · People will trade whatever they have for whatever they want.In late 1990s Sierra Leone, the main commodity is diamonds. Rebels coerce the locals into sifting through the muddy river to get them. If they do, they get to live. If not, they don't. It's that simple. But one man (Djimon Hounsou) sees a way out of the refugee camps for himself and his family when he finds a large diamond, which he then steals and buries.After getting arrested, he gets accused of stealing the diamond but there's no proof. Fortunately (or maybe not) there just happens to be a diamond smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the other cell. After springing him, the smuggler offers to find the missing family in exchange for the diamond. After exhausting any legal possible alternatives, the two join forces.The other integral part of this trio is an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). After her initial fishing attempts are rebuffed, she decides to give her aide to the pair in exchange for proof of the story that she knows is there.But this was where I started to get confused. What was the main point of the film? I can't even classify it  is it a drama, an action film, a political statement, or something else? I understood that Africa is a very chaotic place and that anything can happen at any time. Maybe I just didn't get it.The scenes that affected me the most didn't have anything to do with the main characters  it had to do with the training of children. One scene in particular hit me  a child is blindfolded, given a machine gun and then told to shoot. He does, but what's he's not told is that an adult will be thrown in front of him, who is obviously killed. The look on his face made me feel more than any speech of dialogue in the whole film.At one point, Connelly's character is typing a story. She remarks that whatever she types won't make a difference. That maybe, if she's lucky, it may convince someone to write a check.I can't help thinking that if this film wasn't quite as fragmented, it could have made some solid point  even if I'm not exactly sure what it would have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Blood Diamond,"Summary:This is a story about the smuggling of blood diamonds produced in Africa. Archer is a white African who smuggles diamonds. Solomon was forced to be a salve and works in the diamond field but unfortunately his son is kidnapped. As Solomon finds the pink diamond which can change the life of Archer and Solomon, they starts their adventurous journey. At a time of instability of government, with the help of a beautiful reporter, Maddy, they find the stone and rescue the son. Through the journey, Maddy reported the truth of smuggling problems and aroused the attention of this problem. Finally the problem is solved and people in Africa have a better life.Review : This film started in Africa and a human slaughter. It is a bit scary and bloody. However this movie can clearly points out the problem and the truth of what is happening in Africa. The view in the film is beautiful and that is what we cannot see in Hong Kong. It just makes me feel the Earth is so amazing. The scenes also impress me a lot, there is a lot of sound effect like gun shooting, incidental music etc. Music makes the film more convulsed and give a good effect. Also, the rhyme of this movie is appropriate, it presents the story in a short period of time. For people like me, without any patience, this film must suit your taste. It is a good movie for us to have a reflection of the life that we enjoying. All the things we got are not a must. Please treasure what we have.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Shocking,"Edward Zwick has crafted a wonderful movie. It is a great escape ride, and somehow manages to be a deeply moving human drama, as well as a political thriller. It is hard to determine its genre, and that's one of the many reasons this was one of the best movies of 2006.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is an African father who lives in Sierra Leone during 1999. Civil war is everywhere. One day, while walking his son home from school, rebels attack his village. He knows and understands that these rebels are ruthless, and kill without mercy. He tells his son to hide behind a boat. Solomon races to the village to help his wife and other kids escape. However, in the process, Solomon and his son are the ones who are captured. He (Solomon) is sent to dig for conflict diamonds under the strict supervision of the rebel RUF. One day, he finds a large, pink diamond. He understands that this rock could influence his son's freedom. He takes the diamond and hides it. The story eventually makes it to diamond smuggler and former mercenary, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). He believes that this diamond, is ""his ticket out"" of Africa. He understands that it must be worth some millions to the diamond industry back in London or the United States. Archer agrees to help Solomon get his son back if he gets the diamond in return. It is also the story of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American reporter who is intrigued by Danny's role in the illegal diamond trade. All three must find a way to come together, or else none of them will get what they want. Or need.Leondardo DiCaprio has grown so much as an actor. I never thought very highly of him. He was always OK. Then I saw Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed."" As Billy Costigan he blew me away in that masterpiece. Now, he delivers another superb performance. When it comes to Leonardo DiCaprio, I will start looking for his movies more often. He is wonderful here. Some critics have complained of his accent. Why? Many South Africans have said that is is very accurate. They have sounded off in the message board. So have people who have been to South Africa or know those who are from there. The accent is true, and there is nothing annoying about it. I wonder if those who complain about the accent have any association with Africa? Sorry, I got off track. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful here as well, a good actress in a role not based on looks. Djimon Hounsou gives the performance of the movie. He is shockingly emotional and deep. I will be surprised if he does not get an Oscar nod.The screenplay by Charles Leavitt, off of a story by Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell, also deserves and Oscar nomination. It it made up of so many elements, layers, violence, and heart. It is deep. It is wonderful.Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai), uses his amazing ability as a director to shoot this artistically crafted picture. This movie is nowhere without him.Africa has had many horrible things happen in it. I'm not saying other countries haven't, but here Africa is the focus, and to know that some of this is still happening is gut-wrenching. The murder and genocide there never seems to stop. This is a film that wants to tell people there's hope. Hope for a better world. It is a moving film. A lot of what we see is disturbing, but life can be disturbing, and this film doesn't shy away from it. It uses its disturbing content to move you into action. Yes, there has been an act to stop the selling of conflict diamonds in over 40 countries. However, illegal diamonds still make it to the market. This movie will make the most serious diamond-lovers reconsider what they're paying for. Any movie that has the ability to make you rethink and take action, was very well-made. Wonderful.Danny Archer: Sometimes, I wonder; will God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One of the best of the year! Academy Awards for Djimon Hounsou, Leo, Jennifer Connelly etc.","We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.What can you say after wow!

Excellent,"This is one of the most astounding movies I have ever seen. The acting is brilliant -although being South African - I must say that Leonardo DiCaprio's attempt at a South African accent is rather poor. Jennifer Connelly did an outstanding job in her role as a journalist, and Djimon Hounsou had an enormous presence and captivated the audience in his role as a Mende fisherman. This is a brilliant, heart-rendering movie. One of the best, if not THE best, of 2006. I don't recommend taking children to see it... the violence and graphic nature is sickening. But we are given insight into what the idea of power,control & money can do to people. Edward Zwick did an amazing job ofdirecting this movie, and was able to capture the harsh, untamed beauty of Africa. I believe the viewer would have to be from Africa to truly understand the poignancy of the movie.I sincerely hope this movie receives the recognition and acclaim it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Attention-grabbing, if somewhat flawed movie.","If nothing else, this film does a good job in bringing to light the controversy over ""conflic diamonds"", which I've not seen anywhere else. The story takes place during a violent revolution in Sierra Leone where the male child of a fisherman is conscripted into a sadistic army funded by diamonds sold for weapons. Djimon Hounsou, whom you may recognize from other films, plays Solomon Vandy whose family is terrorized in early scenes, and then broken apart by these revolutionaries. His only hope is that he knows the location of an enormous diamond big enough to get all the right (white) people involved that may help him track down his son and defeat those who have taken him. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a white African diamond smuggler/soldier of fortune kind of guy who really, really wants this diamond and knows he has to keep Solomon safe in order for him to show him where it is buried. Along the way, the two befriend a female journalist (Connelly) who is more interested in the plight of the masses displaced by the violence. Each of these three need and use each other when it suits them best. The action is often intense, and the carnage is jarring, to say the least.The film has many strengths. It does get the viewer involved in the struggles of this part of Africa, and it does make you care about the personal plight of these characters. DiCaprio is pretty much hit and miss in terms of acting. Though his performance is not spectacular, I did buy his character a bit more than I expected to. Hounsou is much more believable, and Connelly often comes off as window dressing. The film relies maybe a bit more on action than it needs to. And one may think the white leads are here only for box office fuel. The film was kind of a bomb in theaters, but it did garner some Oscar nominations for DiCaprio and Hounsou. The photography is very lush and makes one lament what a beautiful place Africa would be without all of the carnage and human problems that seem endless.Go ahead and give this film a try. It will keep your interest throughout, and if nothing else it may make you think twice about where pretty diamond jewelry comes from. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thriller can make us cry.,"The film is about conflicts in Africa due to particular types of diamonds. However, leading role is a person who only endeavor to get the most expensive one which was found by individual. In a brief, the film talk about how to find family of slave and how to come back to US from Africa. In addition, to find blood diamond is their purpose. Very dramatic and effective film. Sound effects should be mentioned in a particular way. From my point of view, role of slave is more dramatic. At the same time, leading role influence us in a cruel way.

Still Wanna Buy That Diamond Ring?,"Blood Diamond is the perfect movie which pokes in your eyes how many lives it takes to buy that piece of ""shiny stone"". Since the diamond market is definitely a huge one, at the end of the movie there is a text which tries to encourage us to buy ""clean diamond"". Why buy diamond at all? Even apes don't try to seduce their females with shiny rocks. Anyway, ""Blood Diamond"" is not just a movie limited with a good story, it is packed with good acting and good quality action scenes. In my opinion the most memorable scene was where little children get drugged and become killers, giving themselves English nicknames, like ""I am, master of disaster"", ""I am, see me no more"" I had watched ""Lord of War"" right before this movie. Those bloody diamonds are what two movies have in common and I think both of them must be seen. There's definitely a huge amount of work put in the movie, sometimes I was feeling I was the director and getting exhausted just watching the movie.

"Perfectly pitched, well executed action adventure flick with a point","I wasn't overly enthused at the prospect of seeing this film upon it's release in late 2006, mostly owing to the fact that the previous two Edward Zwick films I saw (Glory, The Last Samurai) were rubbish; but to my greatest surprise, Blood Diamond is an excellent film. The film is about 'conflict diamonds' and the effects they have on the African countries that produce them. This provides the backbone of the film, but there is much more to it than that as aside from the main theme; the film is also an action thriller, a character study and a very entertaining adventure film. The plot focuses on Solomon Vandy; a man whose village is attacked by rebels and his son taken. He is forced to work in the diamond mines. One day, while mining diamonds, he comes across a huge and priceless pink diamond, and promptly hides it. After finding himself in jail, a conversation between him and the slave master is overheard by Danny Archer; a Zimbabwean diamond smuggler who convinces Solomon to take him to where the diamond is hidden...This film is bolstered by two excellent central performances courtesy of Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was seen earlier in 2006 in Scorsese's excellent 'The Departed', and here the great actor is just as good, in spite of the silly African accent. Djimon Hounsou is the real standout, however, as the unfortunate African man who finds the diamond; the French-African actor fits into his role excellently and constantly convinces that he is the character he is portraying. The two men are joined by Jennifer Connelly who impresses also with her limited screen time. The film takes place in war-torn Africa and Edward Zwick manages to get across the danger of the continent really well, and many of the locations are beautiful to look at. I have to say that the 'conflict diamond' theme of the movie doesn't really concern me much; but the reason this film works has nothing to do with what it's about but rather the way it works. Zwick has really succeeded here in making a film with a point that has enough about it to entertain audience members who don't really care. There's a constant stream of action and the characters are fleshed out enough to ensure that we care about them. The film lasts for over two hours but it really flies by. It boils down to a satisfying conclusion and this undeniably one of the best films of 2006.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A great action adventure flick with a strong message,"After seeing the DEPARTED, I wanted to see if DeCaprio would continue his flawless acting. He was very good once again.The movie started off with a heavy action sequence that resulted in axed off limbs of women, men and kids (quite disturbing). My eyes were already glued as this movie was already more brutal than any movie I've seen this year.DeCaprio played a man in search of diamonds so he can go to America. He conflicts with Jennifer Connelly's character who's a journalist in search of the perfect story. Djimon Hounsou's son is kidnapped by diamond killing rebels and DiCaprio helps him get his son back by getting a large and very expensive diamond in return. Seems typical? It is not. Lots of action in this one and the best part is, there is no token sex scene.DiCaprio is brilliant and did a pretty good job with the accent. Connelly was quite attractive and was very good but I thought Hounsou was the best in my opinion. This movie was much like TEARS OF THE SUN but much more thought out and much better written.

The message cut short by the action,"""Blood Diamond"" sheds light on the complicated, far-reaching, and bloody world of the conflict/blood diamond trade. 2 hours and 20 min is hardly enough time to expose every detail; so the film focuses on the most evocative aspect: the innocent bystanders, the refugees, the slaves, and the death generated by civil wars and greed for prized resources.The main characters, through whose eyes we learn about this vicious world, are Djimon Hounsou, an honest family-man/fisherman, and Leonardo DiCaprio, a cynical and driven smuggler. Hounsou has a great character, full of strength and love, and who faces terrible struggles. Sadly, his performance is given the passenger's seat to DiCaprio. DiCaprio's character hardly speaks for the film (that's Stephen Collins's job). He is at every point the embodiment of the ""white devil"", the trickster caucasian, betraying even himself at his best moments. DiCaprio plays this with a drive devoid of remorse - good or bad, he survives on his selfishness.Hats off to Kagiso Kuypers (playing Hounson's son). A dark and challenging role for someone so young.The film makes compelling points about the immorality of the blood diamond trade; how even the ends - the classic diamond engagement ring in Sydney, Toronto, or Honolulu - still bear the stain of rape, mass-murder, and colonialism. However, these points are given to us in brief, expositional dialogue between aggressive and apathetic action/battle sequences. These scenes are shot fast and loud - like a short roll of black cats - popping machine guns flash between quick shots of women and children falling, cap the enemy soldiers or rebels, back to DiCaprio bossing Hounsou around. Apartheid isn't over here.It seems like ""Blood Diamond"" was dumbed down for Americans, betting against our empathy and instead trying to exploit the action/adventure blockbuster market. There are some deep, touching scenes, but they're cut short and ruined predictably by gunfire and explosions.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Africa is burning, and for what reason?","An abandoned village burns, the vibrant flames lighting the darkness of the night and children and young adults dance to heavy music in and around the flames, firing there weapons into the night as if to celebrate victory.In recent years, African nations have become fertile ground for Hollywood to exploit(?) for cinematic, and thus financial purposes, in spite of the necessity for film to tell powerful narratives of issues and conflicts still pertinent to the contemporary world. So, although these films, including The Constant Gardener, Blood Diamond, Hotel Rwanda and The Last King of Scotland tell stories simultaneously inspirational, horrific, despicable, shaming, compelling and unique, they also are produced to make profit, and in retrospective analysis, are quite successful in doing so. Blood Diamond is certainly no exception, and ironically, money is one of the predominant themes (among others) of the film.The story centres around a smuggler, Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a journalist, Maddy Bowen (Connelly) and a fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Hounsou), each with their own motives (freedom, truth and justice respectively). Thus, in both subtle and overt ways, each uses the others for their own benefit, and the benefit of each other. As a result, the three central characters form a framework of trust and dependency, for better or worse.Of the 'worse' are the events of the African conflict diamond trade, and the rebel force, the RUF. The film does not hold back in this respect, portraying to the audience the despicable acts this force carry out, and many rebel/ militia forces still carry out today, and that is to do with child soldiers. Bringing shame to such an act, we see children being taken from their parents, their families and tribes, and being bribed and manipulated, corrupted, into loyal troops for the rebel force - and thus we also see the horrific acts these children and then carry out, and with such unrelenting glee, and unrelenting loyalty.The performances are all excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio is indeed a fine actor, although his accent for the first hour of the film seemed to fluctuate between Australian, British, French, and Afrikaans. Jennifer Connelly, as always is excellent (and bears close resemblance to Tea Leoni - in voice and appearance) and the supporting cast is also good. The only actor I'm troubled by is Djimon Hounsou. He is a great actor, which I will not deny at all, however, I found his character in this film to be slightly cliché, as if to say we've scene his character elsewhere many times, and this screen presence also doesn't change. But overall, the performative and emotional intensity from all actors reaches beyond the standard level.It is here that I would like to digress a little and make some general comments about factual films. While I find that these stories, historical facts, must be brought to screen, and make compelling films, I am equally concerned about the cinematic imperatives that must be considered for the commercial success of the film. For example, in Blood Diamond, it is true that the context and 'A' storyline about the diamond trade and conflict between rebel and government forces occurred. It is also very likely that events that happen in the film to Hounsou's character also occurred to real people. However, the nature of film is to tell narratives, and narratives have a beginning, middle, and end, all of which must conform to an overarching template, and Blood Diamond is no different.That is to say, the camera has the ability (both intentional and unintentional) to distort reality. That is to say, scenes may be included in the film because they make powerful cinema. This may be by entertaining the audience, or equally by shocking the audience - either way, the audience is responding to the film, and any response to a film, is paramount to not feeling anything. This is a major strength of Blood Diamond and, like Hotel Rwanda and The Constant Gardener, why it is highly recommended.Ultimately, this conflict was about money. Money from the sale of conflict diamonds, filtered into the market with diamonds mined without conflict. Hence the title 'Blood Diamond' - diamonds traded in the market at the hands of human life. The question the film wants us to ask ourselves, is ""How much blood was spilt for these diamonds to be released in to the market?"" So, returning to the beginning, Africa is indeed burning, and we must ask ourselves, why?",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
an action packed film that will hit home with many.,"This film was the complete package in casting, directing, cinematography and editing. Djimon Honsou was exquisite as the father desperately using the only leverage he had to reclaim his family and Leonardo DiCaprio was the only choice for the diamond smuggler who marks him as his ticket out of town. Jennifer Connolly should not be forgotten either as the journalist trying to make a difference by getting the impossible story that would 'awaken' the western world to what is occurring. All play their parts brilliantly and convincingly with wonderful chemistry shared between them. The story begins by introducing the main characters and then among the violence and civil unrest in the region, allows their stories to unfold. The direction lets events unfold before you with honesty and emotional intensity, aided greatly by some of the best editing I've seen in film for years. This movie will reach all with a conscience, as it not only lays the guilt for ignoring the conflict, but for aiding it also. To understand, go and see the film. I look forward to seeing it's deserving nominee's at the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
masterpiece,"this IMDb review section for members is hilarious, a great masterpiece movie like this here, gets positive and also destroying reviews. so you will never be able to find out in this way if a movie works for you , until you see it yourself. i think it is funny to read how some reviewers say this movie was really bad. i could understand if it was bad , but it probably had to do with their taste. this movie was farrrrr from bad.four years after release i finally took time to see it , it was on my list for a while ,i didn't expect such a masterpiece,Leonardo DI Caprio is playing in pretty good movies here and there , but for sure this is one of his remarkable works. what touched me was the idea that it all was reality and not some kind of fiction from some writer. i am sorry for the people that died in this story , i really felt that it all actually happened.i mean: in some other police story , people die as well , but you know it's all fake. in this story you know it really happened just like they showed you. lucky this movie is not just about the people who died but also about love , destiny and luck and so much more.the locations are incredible , it shows you a good picture of the real life in that continent . very interesting. often the endings are weak in other movies , but i can say the end in this story is a masterpiece. it goes as far as i would have like to see. a real end . in other movies they leave you with questions and it suddenly stops. that could be nice as well , but in this one everything get said and done. a real end .i was not planning to buy a diamond , but after this movie i know for sure that i will never buy a diamond in my life , now i know the story behind it . of course not all diamonds came this way ... but you never know if some kid lost his hand for your diamond ...and also the cast is great , this movie will go in my top 10 all timesi recommend this movie , but be aware for extreme violence against humanity",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sloppy production of important subjects.,"You can't really say that the producers of this film are as much heroes as the film's characters. Leonardo DiCaprio is doing one of his best roles, and is great as the diamond-hungry smuggler from Rhodesia. Djimon Hounsou is equally marvelous as the family father who just happened to find the largest diamond in the world.The story revolves around conflict diamonds, large business conspiracies and child soldiers. Most of it is created from true stories. But some stuff that are extremely important to lift forward (like that the price of diamonds are kept up by a cartel) are just mentioned quickly.Likewise, the ending is soft and tacky. Don't be fooled to think that this is an African movie depicting Africa, Sierra Leone or any other African country or place, in its right way. This is purely Hollywood speaking, and it has nothing to do with anything but selling a product to a domestic audience.This comes evidently clear when you hear the hip-hop for the first time. Why is it that all films with black actors HAS to have hip-hop music - just because there are black people in the film? If Hollywood wanted to stay free from racial slurs, then they should try to re-think their productions a bit more. BLOOD DIAMOND have many of these almost racist characterizations, and that doesn't give these tough and important subjects justice.But even though the producers are cowards, and the PR-people stupid fat white men, the rest of the film is quite nicely done. It could have been more violent though, since watching a war movie without blood feels like watching a TV-film from the 1960:s.The movie itself has a very nice script, the locations are great and the actors are mostly very good. The director tries hard, and gives us as much as he's allowed to show. The producers, though, should probably try to produce children movies in the future and stay clear of hard subjects. Some people just doesn't have the guts for the real thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Treasure what you have,"Film Review Blood Diamond The story happened in Sierra Leone in 1990, an unpeaceful place where civil war was happening and people living in horror and fear. Solomon Vandy was one of the victims, who used to have a lovely family, but was forced to be a diamond miner after being kidnapped by the rebel. However, a pink diamond he found changed his density. A mercenary smuggler Danny Archer made agreement with Solomon to get that precious diamond in exchange of Solomon family's position. They began the journey with an America journalist Maddy Bowen and built up a praiseworthy friendship.The film, doubtlessly, is very touching and meaningful. It may be impenetrable for us of what was happening in the film, but it makes an impact on me and I truly believe the story. I love the character of Danny Archer, acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, who always reflects on his life, his density, and his ideal future. It brings some message to everyone, that we should have a clear target to our future, and try our very best to attach. The smiling face on Archer shows that he had no regret on his life. The varicolored world nowadays made us forget the hardness people had paid behind. Please treasure what you have, and do all we can to have our meaningful live.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Diamond is important more than people's life?,"The film takes place in civil war overtaking 1999 Sierra Leone. The role characters such as mercenary, fisherman and journalist have two missions: recovering a pink diamond and save fisherman's son who is a child soldier into the brutal rebelliously. The mercenary want to use pink diamond to change his life but he give the pink diamond to fisherman to help his family lastly. When the fisherman recovers the pink diamond and use pink diamond save his family as well as help journalist to write news.Although this film is not hackneying, I think so touching because the characters are good and they told me that a real story at Sierra Leone. I don't understand why pink diamond is important more than people's life. Why can people kill each other just want to get this diamond? Luckily, when I watch this film, I know people just want to money. I think diamond's supplies are richer more than many people, but they don't think this is enough. I think diamond is so beautiful but I don't want to buy it. I hate the diamond has a story with shed blood. When I buy the diamond, it is look like a kill people such as the diamond's supplies.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good film,"Good film. The main strength of this film is that it is a message movie packed into a commercial film. So that it could reach a wider audience. And for that it's recommended. Another reason is the characters and the events they go through,which are executed skillfully by a veteran like Ed Zwick. Di Caprio has been making some really great films the past few years. Post-Beach,he's been making some really memorable and striking pictures and working with the best in Hollywood. And each time his performances get better and better. As Danny Archer,Di Caprio infests unpredictability in an otherwise predictable anti-hero. He makes us hard to predict Danny's moves. You are not sure whether you should trust him or not,even till the final few moments of his time in the film. But he makes Danny more human and sympathetic. And he nails it once again with his biting performance. It's unlike any character he's ever played and he's a totally different kind of Di Caprio here. But,I still loved his portrayal of Howard Hughes more than this. And every time he is beaten by a greater performance at the year end awards.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

My favourite movie,The greatest movie on planet earth. A severely underrated gem,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I love it!,"Blood Diamond has a dark background story, but I was surprised by how it blends humor with sarcastic comments, which Leonardo DiCaprio delivers with perfection.Both Leonardo and Djimon Hounsou give outstanding performances with a wide range of emotions. The rest of the cast is adequate, but these two actors are exceptional. Their collaboration is like a Buddy Cop duo. The movie deals with harsh realities like child soldiers and the exploitation of entire nations in a brutally realistic way, which can be difficult to watch.However, my main criticism is that it focuses too much on being a Hollywood blockbuster instead of a drama set in a unique scenario. The character stories are full of stereotypes, and the ending is predictable, which detracts from the overall impact. Despite this, DiCaprio's performance is thoroughly enjoyable. If it had prioritized the dramatic events over the contrived love story, it could easily have earned a perfect 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
OK action film,"The latest Leonardo outing is based on some facts but also contains some fiction. Set in 1999 against the backdrop of the bitter rebel fighting in Africa it tells the tale of how the exporting of illegal diamonds funds the fighting that is wiping out thousands of Africans and making even more homeless. Leo plays Danny Archer ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler and all round wheeler dealer and hard man, along with a reporter played by Jennifer Connelly and a local desperate to be reunited with his family they embark on a journey to recover a diamond big enough to get Connelly her story and Danny out of the imploding country. With rebels and the corrupt army also in pursuit there is enough action to keep the film moving along at a fair old pace and with some great performances the overall film is OK. One thing I didn't like was Leo's South African accent and all I could think about was the boss of Dante fires from 'Alan Partridge' and at times he does border on comical. The camera work on the fighting and set pieces is reminiscent of 'Black Hawk Down' with whizzing bullets and showers of debris which draws you in with the intensity of the action. Dimjoi Houston clearly has a chance at the best supporting actor Oscar as he gives such a passionate performance from start to finish. There are a few obvious bits of plot but also a few not so obvious that lead the viewer in a different direction than expected. But from what clearly starts off as a friendship due to the money at stake it does turn slightly towards the end and veers a bit to close to an ebony and ivory buddy romp through the jungle, that said I did enjoy the film not fully polished but by no means a rough diamond.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thrilling action meets shocking essential history,"There are so many great films out at this time of the Awards season that I find it difficult to decide which ones to watch and not watch. After noticing that DiCaprio (coming off the back of his fantastic turn in The Departed) was starring, and Zwick (the architect of recent glittering panoramas such as The Last Samurai) directing, I decided to immerse myself in the civil war of Sierra Leone. I was glad that I had as I was swept by the beauty of the country, the exotic jungles and vibrant deserts in the film.DiCaprio has matured into a fine compelling actor especially since his striking role in the Aviator. In Diamond, his thick South-African accent was just another dimension to the rough, charming, roguish diamond smuggler that serves as our eclectic tour through the fiery Sierra Leone. His performance was charismatic, stunning and heartbreaking. Not to mention he carries the film almost entirely with wonderful help from Connelly and Hounsou. He is at times is dangerous, confident, but tender and I was captivated in his company in war-zone Sierra Leone. Some of the quiet moments in the film where his character is trying to justify his actions and make sense of the world current situation are without a doubt his truly splendid ""money"" moments in acting. His final scene in the film is so poignant and intense - the character truly alluring and remarkable.Jennifer Connelly is once again a headstrong, confident and eloquent strong female character. Her ideals and determination force her to expose the corrupt trade of diamond mining and hence the blood yielded for each diamond earned. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio was edgy, clever and well grounded thanks to some tantalizing exchanges from the screenplay. I thought she has never looked more beautiful, articulate and admirable. I think I must have fell in love with her again.Honsou exuded a quiet intensity throughout. He remains relatively silent for most of the film but when he speaks out under oppression or violence his intensity rages with ferociousness. His tender scenes with his son near the end of the film are also incredibly moving. Not to take anything away from DiCaprio (superbly) playing a South African but Hounson (an African-born) filled the role in every way.The landscape was beautifully filmed, taking us over fleshy jungles, cocky and rollicking villages, unrepentant deserts and picturesque mountainsides. The Hollywood factor was felt in many scenes with the overpowering use of Newton Howard's score and the money on the formidable sets. But I must be gracious because the sets definitely deserve mention for there complexity, variety and character. Not least the action sequences were fast-paced, sharply photographed and edge-of-my seat suspense. Notably (and thankfully) was the absence of CG effects and explosions which made the experience of being in a war zone even more terrifying.The commendable and guileless storytelling of the director and producers must also be mentioned. They have brought us a movie that highlights the effects of modern war and civil unrest in our world including the exploitation of people who cannot experience the free will and the quality of life that we take for granted. Myself being for the most part ignorant of these events in our world's history will definitely be learning more about the Africa's bloodshed history and their countries still in desperate need of aid.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Terrific thriller with top performances and just a touch of sermonizing,"Some nasty cranky critics gave this film a hard time, like they would have written it differently. Geez, so make your own movies.I disagree, thought it was terrific. Never boring, and not at all predictable. The character development was very good, especially seeing how fast the supposedly unsophisticated fisherman Solomon accurately sizes up Danny for a completely unprincipled opportunist. This is a story that could have gone quite badly if not for the fast action and top rate performances, by the three lead characters. DiCaprio's accent was a bit inconsistent but never distracting.

"Overrated, Total Disappointment!","I had little doubts prior to watching this movie as to whether or not I would like it...I was sooo wrong! I was completely shocked that this movie was as weak as it was! It's not a good movie on so many levels. Come to find out, the critics didn't rate this movie very well either. I have little doubt that the user ratings were artificially inflated, because this movie is not an 8. Realistically it's more like a 6.I'll start off with the positives. The movie had good acting and pretty landscape/imagery! Major props to Decaprio for maintaining a great acting performance despite the weak storyline/dialogue etc. That's where the optimism stops. The story-line is dreadful!... The far fetched story and action sequences put a Rambo movie to shame! Trust me, I am not exaggerating! Especially for a movie that's supposed to take itself seriously. DiCaprio's story with Connelly had little development and I felt no connection what so ever. spoiler - Is it really supposed to be a sad moment when he calls her up on the phone in the end? Talk about a dud of a movie.Spoiler DiCaprio's character starts off like-able and becomes increasingly dislike-able as the movie plays out. It's one of those rare occasions when I would have been all down for the cliché' of essentially becoming enlightened along the way and giving the diamond away like he did, although the only reason he handed it off was because he was dying. I think if you throw Dicaprio and Connelly in a movie you could fool a lot of people into liking a movie. If these ratings are legitimate (which I doubt) people were fooled into liking it, because it's factually a weak movie! BTW I can't believe Dicaprio got nominated for best actor in this movie and not The Departed (one of the greatest acting performances in cinematic history).",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lengthy but well worth seeing and an understandable Oscar contender,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDanny Archer (Leo Di Caprio) is a South African born diamond smuggler who transports diamonds illegally for a London based firm. Meanwhile Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a typical African villager who dreams that his son will grow up to be a doctor, only for a militant band of rebels called the KUF to invade his village, take his son hostage and force him to work fishing diamonds out the rivers. Their paths are about to cross in an explosive way when Solomon is caught by a KUF commander trying to conceal a precious diamond for himself and is thrown into a prison camp. Danny gets him out to work for him but Solomon won't do anything until he's found his son and so begins a desperate and deadly race across Africa for the two men, along with idealistic reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly) who wants to expose the corruption going on.In the leading role, Di Caprio's never been an actor I've really warmed to, as I've always seen him as more of a teen heart-throb rather than a serious actor, but he's making that transition now and roles like this will raise his profile to where he wants to be. His accent was a bit shaky, to be honest, meant to be South African but at times it sounded vaguely cockney and then even Austrailian. Nevertheless, he delivered a fairly commanding performance in the lead role. In the main supporting roles, Hounsou and Connolly are also commendable, if not anything really special.Performances don't drive the film, the story does, a sprawling, sweeping tale that brings the decadence and evil of the African situation to life, as we see the same problems faced there as they are for black people all over the world, with child soldiers being recruited to serve for militant soldiers, in much the same way as any gang member would do to a kid living in Rio or SC Los Angeles, their young, naive minds being corrupted into thinking they are doing the right thing, made to feel big with a gun and an attitude, and with the same horrid, hollering gangsta rap music blaring all around them. That said, the film also manages some nicer moments, with some great cinematography of wide, luscious African hills, forests and rivers and a genuinely engaging central story of hope and survival. Edward Zwick, whose Legends of the Fall is the main film of his that springs to mind, guides the whole thing along in a manner that's sometimes a bit wavey but nevertheless engaging.Your attention might wonder a bit sometimes, but overall this is a very rewarding and well made film that was pretty much made for Oscar night. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great Movie,"sometimes you walk out of films and forget them easily, but films like Blood Diamond get your mind moving even after its over. first and foremost, this film sheds light on the murderous scandals in Africa which occur over diamonds. It keeps the viewers attention by providing outstanding realism through beautiful locations, mixed with great acting, and creative direction turning Blood Diamond into a must see. The film is one of my favorites and will truly resonate with people who have been to Africa.Most films that try overly hard to preach a message end up getting bogged down with superficiality, but Blood Diamond keeps its strong message while remaining a highly entertaining flick. I enjoy getting lost in the story or feeling like I'm in one of the scenes which this film accomplishes. The RUF troops ravage the local villages and mercilessly kill hundreds of innocent people. This rebel army brainwashes the male children and turns them into cold blooded killers and reward them with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes afterwords. The film makes the viewer see how lucky they are to not be involved in such civil uncertainty. It also shows people that the country needs help and can't fix these problems alone. The issues certainly set the stage for a dramatic film, but without performances and direction it may have fallen short.The stars of the film were Leonardo Dicaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly who all deliver outstanding performances. Leonardo Dicaprio looked like a real war veteran with everything from his gunman-ship to his South-African accent. Jennifer Connelly played the pretty American journalist who would do anything for a juicy story, but also showed a deep affection to the issues Africa was facing, her emotion felt very believable. The standout was Djimon Hounsou (Solomon), i mean wow! This guy should be getting more leads if this film was any indication of his body of work. His emotion, believability and commitment were fantastic. There were times his lines would give me shivers up my spine because it felt so real. You can tell the piece meant a lot to him and it shows in his performance. The scene where he strips naked and screams ""WHERE IS THE DIAMOND, you have taken my family, my home, EVERYTHING"", really helps the viewer connect with Solomon. The acting helps the audience really believe this film, and the direction puts everything in place to be a success.Edward Zwick does a good job at mixing entertainment with an important political message which is no easy feat. Watching this movie as a 21 year old made a huge difference from when i was 16. I connected with the film a lot more and felt the gravity of everything. If you have only seen this film once when you were younger, or for some reason haven't, it is totally worth the 2 hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Blood Diamond better than is being said!,"While I was looking at various negative reviews for Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"", I realized that while most critics didn't like it, not one has come up with a plausible reason why except one. They all say that Zwick tries to hard to pound the film's ideas into your head. That's no reason to give it two stars, or C's and D's, just for being a little preachy. And yes, it was a little preachy, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an exceptional film with stunning performances. ""Blood Diamond"" isn't preachy in a bad way either, the director just wanted to make sure the audience was educated to what was happening with the diamond trade in Africa.I'll explain; the film opens with rebels going into a village and taking young kids and men to go work in the diamond mines, and then destroy the village. The rebels mine the diamonds and sell them to American jewelry dealers who then sell them to us. In the process, the rebels destroy innocent villages, capture the men, and train the children to use weapons for their cause. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, who is taken along with his son. While working in the mind, Solomon finds a large diamond, which he hides. Before he is discovered hiding it, American troops arrive and drive out the rebels. Solomon escapes and joins up with Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler played by Leonardo DiCaprio- who promises to help Solomon find his son in exchange for the diamond. Chase scenes galore ensue as Danny and Solomon make their way across Africa.Before seeing this film, I never realized how some diamonds were come by, and the things done to the African people for them. Though, it is true, that at times it seemed like an exciting history lesson. The acting is superb and is all Oscar worthy. Leonardo finally breaks his pretty boy, sissy mold and becomes a macho, man's man, reminiscent of Indiana Jones. The cinematography is amazing, especially since Africa is already beautiful. The camera work accentuates the action scenes just so, that it makes it all the more exciting and intense.So even though critics are being dumb again and bashing Zwick for making a ""history lesson"" film, it is still important to see. Even if it's just to see Leo and Djimon's Oscar worthy performances, and the insanely intense action sequences. I give ""Blood Diamond"" 8 out of 10. It is rated R for strong violence and language.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Excellent Work by Leo,"Many comments have been made about the accent, the subject matter, the script, etc. I want to talk about the ""character"" DiCaprio plays. It is not just the accent ( excellent) but the attitude he has and the subtle way he conveys his feelings. The way he refers to his former commander as ""sir"" even when he is being used and the story he tells to Jennifer Connelly of losing his parents punctuated by the half sad/half joking "" Boo-hoo huh?""are two examples of acting that going beyond mimicking and gets to the heart of this very complex character.

Leo's ongoing fight with Hollywood!,"Leonardo DiCaprio troubles me. Rarely have I felt as strong an empathy or understanding with an actor! Simply, i think he is truly gifted, a rare and welcome talent in todays 'shout and cry' world of acting. But why, with the utmost respect to all involved in his films, can he not stray from movies laden with Hollywood stereotypes and restrictions. Not since Basketball Diaries have i seen DiCaprio 'let rip', obviously revelling as a young actor in a role packed with freedom and interpretation. And it seems since then DiCaprio has sought out roles which, I feel, prohibit him from true greatness, whatever such a notion is.I have a great deal of time for Hollywood, and although i feel i enjoy a wide variety of 'world' and 'independent' cinema, i am not pretentious enough to take a disliking to Hollywood or blockbuster offerings. The recent offering of The Departed seems to highlight my point here excellently. I greatly enjoyed Infernal Affairs, and unlike many, was not filled with dread when Scorsese announced his intentions to sample the movie. And, overall, i enjoyed his product, but could not help thinking DiCaprio looked far from free, a mile away from where he seemed so desperate be. The Aviator and Catch Me If You Can seemed more organic an experience, but these offerings are balanced completely by restrictive and stiff performances in Gangs of New York (yes the sets are amazing, yes Daniel Day Lewis can act BIGTIME, NO it isn't a good film.) Blood Diamond by a mile offers Leonardo the most freedom and range of his modern offerings, if not all of them. Perhaps it is the darker, selfish element of DiCaprio's character that is so powerful, or perhaps Zwick is able to prise a show stopping performance from all of his actors, Leo not being in bad company with Washington, Pitt and Cruise arguably best performances! I guess my point is that, for actors like DiCaprio, who have scores of scripts to choose from and the phenomenal power to get them made, i wish they would allow themselves to take risks! Is it the case that a film can ruin a career? Lets ask Ben Affleck, who may never fully recover from a certain collaboration! I hope this doesn't sound negative as a comment, as i say i greatly enjoyed seeing Dicaprio let loose and act as, i believe, only he can in places, but perhaps that is because not many actors are afforded the chance! And perhaps if DiCaprio strayed slightly from the Hollywood forced romantic slow motion politically edgy climax, he could reach new levels of greatness! Let me know what you think",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
the best movie of the year,"So many emotions rise up in this story of family, greed, war, and love. It is emotionally powerful, there were at least three moments in this film where I felt tears coming out of my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Djimon Honsou gives the performance of his career, he should definitely at least be nominated in the best supporting actor category when the Oscars come around. There was one moment that was so compelling that my lips began trembling and I think my heart skipped a beat, and it is very seldom that a movie can give you that kind of shock and thrill. It is very thought provoking and touching with Edward Zwick proving he is one of the top directors out there currently. It gives you loads of political insights that a lot of people haven't been very aware of, I know. The photography is beautiful, there were two shots in the movie that left a smile on my face even after the tears were shed.This one of the best films to come around in a long time, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Shining Truth in a Dark World!!,"The movie's power lies in its ability to balance emotional drama with action, showing the devastating impact of the diamond industry on the lives of everyday people. The scenes are intense, and the film doesn't shy away from showing the brutal consequences of greed and corruption. However, while the story is compelling, some parts feel a little too dramatic or simplified for the sake of delivering a clear message.Despite this, Blood Diamond does its job in educating the audience, sparking conversations about ethical consumerism and the real-world consequences of buying untraceable diamonds. It's not a perfect film, but its impact is undeniable, making it a worthwhile watch. I'd give it an 8/10 for its solid performances, strong message, and the emotional journey it takes you on.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Insights on Blood Diamond,"This film showed not only the conflict on diamond but the different conflicts of our own personal values. Danny values the diamond so much, Solomon value his family more than diamonds, Maddy just want to show the world the real scenario of the diamond in conflict, The RUF.s for their survival even to the point of killing their own fellow Africans. Just like fame, fortune and money, diamonds became the root of those evils but it was not the diamonds but the man's action towards diamonds makes it evil or not. The whole story pushed me to do my part and be an instrument of peace not only within my family but also to those people whom I can reach out. Not to mention the scenery, I love to go there, I have dreams of going to Africa. Congratulations to the writer, director and I love Danny Archer's acting and character here.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Blood Diamond,"Blood diamonds talked about the story of Archer, an African mercenary smuggler and a fisherman Solomon in Sierra Leone. One day, rebels invade Solomon's village and caught his son Dia. After that, Solomon had separated with his family and worked in a diamond fields. In the diamond field, Solomon found a valuable pink diamond and he hided it in a mountain. Archer knew it when Solomon was arrested by the government army. So Archer tried to approach Solomon and asked Solomon to give him the diamond and Archer promised to help him to find his missing family.Through the story of Archer, Blood Diamond shows the dark sides and real situation of Africa. It shows the serious problem of children soldier in Africa. The ending of the movies is quite touch as a cold-blooded person Archer chose to forgive the diamond he had found for a long time to protect the one he loved.

This is Africa,"Lately there have been a lot of movies coming out that I would consider a sub-category of drama. I would name this sub-category either human interest or cause acknowledgment/awareness. The title Blood Diamond gives away the subject matter, which a lot of movie titles have been straying away from.Film doesn't necessarily have to be a form of entertainment. These specialized dramas are almost documentary-like, but when you throw in a Leonardo Dicaprio all the sudden a movie transforms from awareness to blockbuster. It's a very ingenious way to promote a cause. What I like about the movie is it goes back to the basic element of movie-making: it actually tells a story.I've never been to Africa, but I was able to empathize with the characters. I have a sense of family, and I hoped Solomon would be able to enjoy his family's company again. His confrontation with his son who was turned brain-washed soldier was very emotional for me. The character of Solomon was acted perfectly. You saw a range of emotions during the film which were portrayed physically. His lips quivered and he didn't say a word when he was angry; he had to hold back his thoughts,feelings, opinions, angers. His reaction when he faced the leader of the R.U.F.It goes back to a simple statement repeated several times in the movie: T.I.A. (This is Africa). This is what people will do either by force or by will in Africa under the circumstances. Same could be said anywhere: This is Iraq, This is America - this is how we do things here (good or bad; like it or not - and it's almost expected).The story crosses subject matters though because you can replace blood diamonds with oil, or another material as they mention in the beginning. What has this world become? What is one person or many people willing to do for money? If it means getting out of your situation would you do it too?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Diamonds are a girls best friend, unless they're African","Tara had been keen to see this for a while, so we got it out last night ""Blood Diamond"" is a story based upon the ruthless diamond industry in Africa. It follows the story of Solomon, an African man who discovers a massive diamond while prospecting under duress. Word gets out about his discovery and he soon is tracked down by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a much manlier role than ""Titanic""). Danny is a diamond smuggler and sees getting this diamond as his chance to get out of Africa.It's a powerful movie, giving great insight into the diamond trade in Africa. It shows us the horrific political struggles going on in parts of Africa and the devastation many people face.

When Good Men Act,"In the midst of civil war in Sierra Leone, South Africa ex-mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) confesses to American reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), ""God left this place (the world) a long time ago"" DiCaprio is powerful and poignant. This is the unforgiving and savage world of Director Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"". Writers Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell tell the story of African ""conflict diamonds"" that are brokered to Antwerp, Belgium stained with the blood of enslaved laborers, merciless gangs, and ruthless mercenaries.Maddy (Connelly) is in Sierra Leone to expose the diamond conspiracy that generates a glut of diamonds yet imposes a perceived scarcity that drives the market demand. Danny (DiCaprio) is her only credible inside source on the ""conflict diamond"" market. Although mutually attracted to Maddy, Danny is invariably tied to Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who possesses the whereabouts of a rare and valuable pink diamond. Solomon escaped imprisonment in a diamond mine operation and is in search of his displaced family; including his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers), captured and trained by a violent gang. Initially, Danny's motives are driven by greed that transforms to heroic selflessness. Leonardo DiCaprio is mesmerizing and powerful in Danny's character arc. I never really got DiCaprio's star quality, until now. DiCaprio is older, filled out and decidedly manly as Danny. He brings such a passion and rugged intensity to the role. Also compelling is his chemistry with the strong Jennifer Connelly as Maddy, who believes in Danny's best. There is a touchingly eloquent scene with the two when Danny tells Maddy, ""You find yourself a good man"" DiCaprio is powerful as a man flawed and ultimately a hero. Connelly is equally powerful, smart with great compassion. She is so compelling, particularly in her silence. Hounsou is truly a commanding force. He is electrifying as the courageous father seeking to reunite his stolen family. Hounsou captures the anguish and strength as the loving and dedicated father and husband.Edward Zwick (""The Last Samurai"", ""Glory"") is the masterful storyteller. Zwick along Leavitt and Mitchell give us a glimpse of poverty stricken Africa ruled by ruthless regimes where young men have their hands chopped to prevent them from voting. Lives are expendable. Diamonds are everything. Zwick also keeps the story moving with crisp action, and high drama. Unlike the confessed resignation of Danny that God left the world a long time ago, Zwick tells his story of good men who act. Leonardo DiCaprio's Danny and Hounsou's Solomon symbolize this. Reminiscent of ""Three Kings"", the self interested Danny surrenders to his own nobility and grace. DiCaprio is so engaging and compellinghe gives his best performance. Jennifer Connelly is amazing, both radiant and powerful. Though in a supporting role, she grounds the movie. Her Maddy sees the greatness in Danny, and her faith is unyielding. ""Blood Diamond"" concludes in great catharsis. Things don't always end as we wish. But the world is a greater place when good men choose to act out of conscience and valor. Zwick poignantly reminds of this in his ""Blood Diamond"". It is one of the year's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
DiCaprio's Best,"An absolute knock-out on all accounts. Blood Diamond takes a heartbreaking story, and masterfully crafts it into a captivating and emotionally impacting motion picture.Personally, not being a fan of Edward Zwick I was quickly anxious to see what he's done with his cast. Thankfully, I was not disappointed.Leonardo DiCaprio just keeps getting better. He will quickly build up a resumé that won't be matched. Danny Archer is the character of charm and wit that everyone admires. Though, our admiration as viewers will be somewhat diminished as the true nature of the character is revealed.Djimon Hounsou is remarkable, and well deserving of an Academy Award. It would be late to say, that Alan Arkin did not match the intensity and conviction that Mr. Hounsou has brought upon us.Viewers will sympathize with everyone, not in terms of their actual personality, but more from the realism which is brought by an all-star cast. Not often am I terrified by what I've seen on screen, and yet Edward Zwick tells the story through his vision.The murders, shooting, and destruction are a symbol of evil that we are unaware of. The diamond corporation is revolved around beauty and glamor, but the origins of these stones go unrecognized by nearly everyone.In terms of relevance, Blood Diamond takes the honor. It takes the honor and smashes it over every single Best Picture nominee. The fact that this film was excluded is a sin, and a crime at the least. Are the majority of film goers claiming Little Miss Sunshine to surpass the mastery of Blood Diamond? Is Scorsese's gangster film worthy of the title on surpassing this? The answer is simply, ""no"" but it does bring up interesting questions. Blood Diamond may have a more personal connection rather than targeting the general population. I mean no offense for the previous films, but if it is a connection aspect, then yes Blood Diamond is far superior based upon my own opinions.If you haven't seen Blood Diamond, rent it or buy it immediately. There won't be a film to match this caliber for decades.This is the greatest motion picture of 2006, and if based on personal connection, a Best Picture victory would have been deserving.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nothing memorable and visually uninteresting,"This film makes me doubt a lot about this kind of docudrama (which seems to be «en vogue» at Hollywood), I mean about its reason to be done. The acting was completely unconvincing and the script predictable. Just to point a precise moment, the speech of Solomon Vandy to his son in the gun-threat scene was almost ridiculous and it could be great. Also Danny Archer was far from being the «tough guy» deeply troubled by his dark childhood in Africa (I appreciated the irony of stop smoking in the last minutes of the film / before his death: «smoking is dangerous only if you are alive», he used to say). It's a pity that instead of get me worried about what is happening in Africa, the film only get me bored.

Strong performances bring this very real story to life,"Im not going to get to much into this comment...but I will say this:This is down right one of the best most moving films that I have ever seen in my entire life. I was left in a state of shock walking out of the theater. I Haven't felt this way about a movie since seeing saving private ryan for the first time in theater so long ago. What really struck me the most about this movie was how ""non-hollywood"" it was. It out you right there in Sierra Leone. It was so amazingly realistic, almost like you were watching a documentary. Im not a big fan of Dicaprio, and that some what turned me off about seeing this movie at first, but 10 minutes into the movie, you will totally forget about that. Let me reassure you, after seeing this (and the Departed),He is not that sissy pretty boy he was in Titanic. He has grown up and this movie really shows it. As my gf and I walked out of the theater, got in the car, and drove home, there wasn't much said between us. You don't really want to talk about it. It evokes such strong and powerful emotions, that it almost leaves you speechless. You just think, wow, that was amazing but at the same time, you realize that what you just watched actually is going on over there. I felt like driving straight to my bank and donating everything that was in my savings account to the people of that country. It's a fairly long movie, but it never leads you astray. The entire time, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It is a very tightly constructed movie and it never loses its focus. From its quick ""throw you right in the middle of it"" beginning to the powerful end, the movie will captivate you.

It puts your nose in the muck all the way,"I just looked at Blood Diamond. This is really depressing. What is going on in this world? How could I go to a jeweler's store to buy a wedding ring for my loved one, when I think of this movie? Okay, I can hear you say, it is just a movie. Right, it's not a documentary; what happened here didn't really happen. But we see it in the news everyday. Things like this happen. It may be diamonds, it may be oil, it may be gold or it may even be wood. We know it happens, and we unwillingly take part in it. And we get numb. I looked at news footage like this so much, it sometimes changed my perspective. The other day, the news showed a clip of so called freedom fighters, ripping of the clothes of a young woman, throwing her down, in the street, naked. She fell on her knees, and there the clip halted. And my first thought was, she looks nice, immediately followed by the thought, she must have hurt herself. And after that, only then I thought, she may not be alive in a couple of seconds. What kind of world is this, to make thoughts put in this order? This movie shows it all. Of course it's a movie, so it has to be entertaining too, but it puts your nose in the muck all the way. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, it shows. He had a hard time to find his way up again, but he did. Djimon Hounsou, Kagiso Kuypers and Benu Mabhena play very credibly a family that gets ripped apart in this war. Jennifer Connelly, as the journalist, is less convincing but don't worry, it doesn't break the movie. All in all this is a very good movie, and, I think, worth an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

This Movie Was Great,"Some have noted this movie as a heavy message movie, others that it is too much of a formula type plot; but I saw a well paced action drama with just the right amount of reality to let you know what really happened with diamond mining in Africa. DiCaprio has his accent down - didn't take long for me to adjust to it and Djimon Hounsou showed he is a consistently thoughtful actor that seems to have really taken this role to heart. The movie went by quickly with just the right amount of tension between the characters to keep your interest in what was going to happen next. I'm not a big Jennifer Connelly fan so her role could have been played by anyone but it was credible enough to keep me involved when she was on the scene.I strongly recommend this film because it hasn't been a great year for movies but now it seems a few goods are making their way to us and Blood Diamond is definitely one of the best. Not sure if DiCaprio gets best actor for this or Departed but one thing is for sure, Djimon Hounsou should get best supporting actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
