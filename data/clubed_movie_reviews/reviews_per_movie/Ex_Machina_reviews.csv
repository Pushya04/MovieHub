Intelligent Movie,"This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Engaging and entertaining.,"A wealthy CEO and pioneer of AI enlists the help of employee Caleb, to see if his latest creation, Ava, can pass off as human, The Turing test.It remains a pretty great watch still, of course it's pure sci fi, but it's a glimpse into a future scenario that seems to be perfectly feasible, you need only Google AI, and you'll see some incredible content, good or bad, after this film you may change your opinion.This film is so intriguing, I find it quite unique, it's disturbing, but more than that it's a story of paranoia, of power, but in a bizarre way it's a story of hope as well. It's pure fantasy, it's almost like a Disney story rehashed and turned into sci fi, it's crazy at times, but it works.The special effects and visuals are incredible, Ava looks amazing, she's different enough, but has enough human qualities to allow you to engage with her human side.It's quite dialogue heavy, it's not a typical action sci fi, so fans that enjoy the faster paced, action driven movies may find it slower at times, but if you're into movies with twists and turns, tension, psychological thrillers where character development is important, I think you'll enjoy this.The three main actors are all excellent, you can't put a pin between them, each of the three really deliver, every character gets under the skin, in a way I never expected.This film never fails to impress, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Paranoid Android,"Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll.The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Humans and their opinions,"I don't often feel the need to review films on here, but after I have seen a film I like to see other peoples opinions, as I find it interesting, although very annoying too. It shouldn't annoy me I guess, but when thoughtless, nonsense, throwaway films are given 10 stars, and films that have a lot of thought and effort put into them are picked apart and given low ratings by idiots I get wound up. Anyway, I loved this film. Watched it last night on DVD. It has depth and darkness and leaves you with something, as great writers and directors can only seen to do occasionally. It is very atmospheric, with a great soundtrack, great performances by each actor. If you like action films, why do you go to see this? Reviews are always available online here. It is pretty obvious that this film is meant to be intelligent and thought provoking, rather than all-action Hollywood. If you have a short attention span then you will probably not like this film. Give it a chance and get drawn in... it's great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Robots will take over the world,"This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a nice one,"Ex Machina, directed by Alex Garland, delivers a visually striking exploration of artificial intelligence that is elevated by exceptional acting and a hauntingly atmospheric score. Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Ava, alongside Oscar Isaac's enigmatic Nathan and Domhnall Gleeson's relatable Caleb, creates a compelling dynamic. The film's minimalist yet futuristic setting and deliberate pacing contribute to its thought-provoking nature, although some may find the pacing slow. While Ex Machina excels in posing profound questions about AI and humanity, it leaves room for deeper character development and a more engaging narrative, earning its 7/10 rating as a visually arresting and intellectually stimulating sci-fi thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not what I expected...,"This is a story that explores a wide range of topics including philosophy, psychology, theories about the future/mankind, and more! The twists/turns in this movie are done really well and the ending defied my expectations. While it was a bit slow a few times, I thought that it was ultimately worth going through. At times it was creepy and makes you feel uncomfortable yet at other times it was beautiful and had impressive acting as well. All 3-4 of the main cast did great!! I loved the music in the more intense scenes as well, and whatever sound effects they used that weren't quite music but worked well subtly enhancing the mood. It was a modern-day Blade Runner!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
They just want to be like us. Go figure.,"""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson)Ex Machina is a thoughtful science fiction about Artificial Intelligence, whereby, to no fan's surprise, the current female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), has human qualities that cause trouble for inventor, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), and visitor, young Caleb. If you know anything about these stories, you could write the screenplay, but you'd need these actors to make it the impressive sci-fi it is.Poets and philosophers have been intrigued by just this story about AI gone astray after interacting with humans. The Frankenstein motif is alive and dangerous, and the spirit of Spike Jonze's Her, with the seductive operating system, is very much a part of Ava's approach to Caleb. The destructive force of Nathan's creation is more subtle than in Dr. Frankenstein's creation, but menacing nevertheless: ""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"" Ava to NathanBrainy Nathan has a compound somewhere in an Alaskan refuge as modern as could be with ID cards and glass walls and doors to give the impression of peace and transparency. Caleb is chosen to help Nathan use the Turing Test to judge the quality of the AI-human experience.As in real life, nothing is as it appears because neither Nathan nor Ava can refrain from lying. Yet, even Caleb is drawn into lies as he gets closer, even romantically, yikes! to Ava. Once again for science fiction, as soon as the robot gets to enjoy being like a human, trouble ensues. However, even if this film seems like a retread, say, of Never Let Me Go, very few filmmakers could match the ultra modern, yet still sexy, set design. And Isaac's character is so mercurial, at once comforting then tyrannical, that the film could be remembered if only for his star turn as the mad but charming scientist.After all, Ex Machina is as much about a scientist playing God as it is about the bridge between robot and man. Each topic could, and has been, treated on its own. Here it is an exciting return to modern man as god and monster:""I am God."" Nathan",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very involving bit of pure sci-fi,"A reclusive CEO of a leading technology company hires a young whiz kid who works for him to test his latest development, a highly advanced android called Ava. Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human.Despite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough.In many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Different Sort of Picture,"Ex Machina (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.EX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.The visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.Then there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role.EX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Writer Director Alex Garland is a powerhouse of talent,"I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind.The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity.

Very good balance between sci-fi and psychology,"A great story, with complex yet very relatable characters.AI has been a recurring theme in sci-fi movies for some time now with varying degrees of plot and execution quality. I feel this movie aces both.A secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.From a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI.Conclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Geek love,"Don't mean to insult here, but who else wants to love a machine. Bear with me: this movie has a deep insight to communicate, whether intended or not is open to question.The story is a modern telling of Bluebeard's Castle as the correct version of Beauty and the Beast. In other words, it seems to be about impotence. Except that this is geek love, love at an impossible distance, that is eroticism. And the movie itself tells you all you need to know about eros.The insight. Ex Machina is ostensibly about Turing's Test, the thesis that a machine might be so human as to fool a human being. Does Ava pass this test? Depends on how you perceive the test. Ex Machina actually implies a more relevant Test: could a machine seem so human as to make the human being inteacting with it come to believe that he himself is a machine?And the insight? It might be that the solution to the AI/human interface may not involve the humanising of robots, but the robotisation of humans.Only 8/10 because it is not clear that this insight was actually part of the plot. But whether you find eros or AI in this movie, you will have a rewarding journey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
creating life in one's own image,"Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"" struck me as a warning about over-reliance on technology. Like ""Frankenstein"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", it depicts human creations that turn out to be more than we can handle. I found Oscar Isaac's CEO to be the most interesting character in the movie. Nathan's lively, articulate personality is a stark contrast to Caleb's soft-spoken attitude. The Turing test (an assessment of a machine's ability to display human characteristics) should be of more interest to us now that ""The Imitation Game"" has drawn attention to Alan Turing.""Ex Machina"" won't be a movie for everyone. Despite the science fiction themes, it's a deliberately slow-moving film. It takes time to acquaint oneself with the characters and their true aims. But it turns out to be a interesting movie. It's not any kind of masterpiece, but I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A thought-provoking and brooding film about a programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment,"Domhnall Gleeson (son of the famed actor Bernard Gleeson), Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander give life to the peculiar love triangle in this haunting story. A young systems programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition about synthetic intelligence to spend a week at a private mountain retreat, a state-of-art house, belonging to elusive genius Nathan (Oscar Isaac), participating in an innovative and disturbing experiment designed by the reclusive boss of his company. When Caleb arrives at the remote location (the house in the movie is actually the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway) he finds that he will have to participate in a strange and fascinating experiment in which he must interact with the world's first true artificial intelligence, housed in the body of a beautiful robot girl (Alicia Vikander, her favorite film). There Caleb must undergo the 'Turing test' with the robot. To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and gods !. What happens to me if I fail your test?.There is nothing more human than the will to survive !.Acclaimed writer and screenwriter Alex Garland made his directorial debut with ""Ex Machina,"" a disturbing and thoughful psychological sci-fi thriller that gives a chilling and provoking vision of the not-so-distant future where artificial intelligence is a reality. The film title derives from the Latin phrase ""Deus Ex-Machina,"" meaning ""a God from the Machine,"" a phrase that originated in Greek tragedies. There are some comparative biblical syntonies with ' Creation', in fact the three protagonists have names of characters from the Old Testament, so Ava is a form of Eve, the first woman, companion of Adam; Nathan was a prophet in the court of David; and Caleb was a spy sent by Moses to evaluate the Promised Land. Interpretations are pretty well, Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a 26 year old programmer at the world's largest internet company, while Oscar Isaac is the reclusive and mysterious CEO of the company and gorgeous Alicia Vikander plays the robot girl. This exciting and unsettling film invites you to explore big questions about the nature of consciousness, emotions, sexuality, the truth and the lies.Winner of the 2016 Oscar for Best Special Effects and was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay (Alex Garland) and the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress (Alicia Vikander). It displays a ¨New age¨ and sensitive musical score composed by means of synthesizer from Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury, along with some old songs, such as ""Enola Gay"" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Rob Hardy. The motion picture was competently directed by Alex Garland, being Alex Garland's directorial debut. He's a prestigious writer and director who has written, produced or directed notorious films, such as:¨28 Days Later...¨, ""28 weeks later¨, ¨The Beach¨,¨Sunshine¨, Big Game¨, ¨Devs¨, ¨Annihilation (2018), Men (2022). Besides writing the script, he was the one who effectively directed Dredd (2012) and not credited. Rating: 7/10. Notable, better than average, well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Highly recommended!,"Having wrote the stories to some of his biggest hits, first-time director, Alex Garland, has spent a lot of time with the masterful Danny Boyle: working on such films as The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Now, writing and directing his feature debut, Garland proves that he has been paying attention and taking tips as he tackles a complex sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence.Featuring Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, the stars of the upcoming Star Wars adventure, plus talented newcomer, Alicia Vikander – who stars in three films this month; Ex_Machina is quite well profuse.Jumping right in, we are introduced to Caleb (Gleeson), a twenty- four year old coder who wins a chance to spend a week at his CEO bosses luxury house. Travelling for many hours over his private estate via helicopter, he arrives at a remote mountain villa. Where he meets Nathan (Isaac) – a prodigy programmer, who at the young age of thirteen created the foundations of Bluebook (our equivalent to Google and Apple combined). Now, middle-aged and extremely wealthy from his companies growing success, he lives a reclusive life at his custom-built smart house, which is insulated by intelligent automated features and billionaire gadgets.Addressing the concept that life is different at this remote location – which is more of a research facility - Nathan invites Caleb to be part of an experience during his one week stay. An experiment that he classes as the greatest discovering of mankind; to test the world's first artificial intelligence system, which is housed inside the body of a beautiful robot girl (Alicia Vikander).Of course, the AI' concept has been tackled many of times in contemporary film - most recently in Wally Pfister's directorial- flop, Transcendence. In reality, the closest thing we have to it is Siri. Yet, Garland's vision of AI is extraordinarily superior and physiologically mesmerising to witness.For Domnhall Gleeson, the premise of his character is similar to that of his characters once played in Frank, or About Time – one that is thrown into a portal of unknown weirdness, and often out of his depth. Over the seven days of testing, Caleb must perform the scientific 'Turing test' on Nathan's AI' system, nicknamed Ava; the idea of which is to deduce God-like theories and philosophical concepts – do robots feel a consciousness? If disguised, would you know it is a robot? Is it ethical?It's heavy material for Garland, but no stranger to psycho- thrillers, he explores futuristic concepts as if AI's really do exist. Equally, the craft behind Ex_Machina is exceptional. A beautiful piano theme plays methodically, with often mix of silence setting the unique atmosphere. Whilst mainly set inside Nathan's enclosed premise (with no windows), the camera work is mounted aesthetically.Now, in her third film this month, Alicia Vikander shows that she is able to tackle any form of performance with extreme clause. Whether she is a young-women coming of age during World War One (Testament of Youth), a love-interest of a criminal (Son of A Gun), or now a robot, she is outstanding. Fluxed movements, and facial expressions through seamless CGI, she steals all scenes present.Compressed into an impressive 1 hour 48 minute running time - considering the ground it has to cover for such a serious sci-fi drama, Ex_Machina, still manages to find time for sublime humour. Taut, fascinating and simply intriguing. Alex Garland's debut film comes highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not As Smart As It Thinks It Is,"Caleb a computer programmer is invited by Nathan , a billionaire technology tycoon is invited to stay with him and through conversation tells Caleb he has invented something that will revolutionise the world as we know it . Intrigued by what might be the greatest scientific invention ever Caleb promises to keep Nathan's secret and he is introduced to Ava an androidThis is the directorial debut of Alex Garland who started off as a novelist with his screen writing debut being the screen adaptation of his own novel THE BEACH . Very quickly he became established as a horror/science fiction writer with the screenplays of 28 DAYS LATER , SUNSHINE and DREDD so it's only natural that if he was going to progress to directing then the sci-fi genre would be an obvious choiceThat said I've never felt Garland was a great screenwriter and his work is highly derivative . 28DL is an obvious steal of DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS in its plotting and SUNSHINE contains ever horror and science fiction cliché you can think of . EX MACHINA feels as if it's borrowing a bit from Kubrick and Scott . It's a curiously uninvolving film where the characters feel completely detached from the audience . Effectively there's only three speaking parts where characters stand in minimalist sets talking , talking and ... well talking . When anything of note happens plot turn wise you're probably able to second guess them which makes for a fairly predictable storyI notice that so far EX MACHINA has an average user rating of 8.1 . Now I certainly don't agree with such a high rating but I can certainly understand why people might be giving it a higher mark that it deserves . It's a co-production between Universal Studios and Britain's Film4 but its obvious roots are outside the Hollywood studio system . It's a rather talkative introspective sci-fi drama and you can understand people wanting to reward this simply because it's not some noisy over-edited spectacular but even so you're left thinking the film might have been better than it actually is",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films ever made.....,"Just saw the film and am still gob-smacked, so this review may not be as clear as some of my earlier ones.A few notes:1. Wow2. As far as AI goes, this is the film that Spielberg wishes he would have made. It covers the same weighty questions but in a way that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end.3. The I/B (impact to budget ratio) is off the chart. A full length feature that has what, 3 major characters, the same set, and some nice CGI? The backer who wrote the first check must have been crying tears of joy because they were in profit before the cameras rolled.4. Wow.5. Not merely a thinking-mans sci-fi, also a horror flick. Riffs off themes from classics like ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (where the daughter of the mad scientist is much more than she seems) and even the original Dracula (where the innocent young man gets invited to a castle for a job and discovers the owner and his servants are more than they seem).6. Wow7. Director Alex Garland is a force to be reckoned with.8. Riffs off Sleuth (1972) where two men who are having seemingly simple conversations end up in a battle of wits.9. Is it just me or is Oscar Issac as Nathan channelling Mandy Patinkin from Homeland, including voice mannerisms, even the beard?10. Also borrows from Frankenstein (the created wanted to destroy the creator) and even Pinocchio (the puppet who wanted to become a real boy).11. The pacing is extraordinary. It never peaks or plateaus. Every time you think you know what is coming, it just takes the story up a notch.12. Even the ending -- a riff on the ""cuckolded boyfriend"" -- is unexpected and mesmerizing.13.

"Beautiful, but fell short","I was so excited to see this film, but it really fell short for me, mainly in that the characters were poorly-developed. With 1 hr and 50 minutes, and only 3 or 4 characters in the entire story, there must be some serious script problems if a film fails to develop any of those parts into complex, sympathetic characters the audience can really connect with. In the end, I connected with none of them, and hungered for the film to to engage the deeper character issues that felt ripe for the taking, but were only touched-on at the surface. Visually, Ex Machina was a beautiful, well-made and well-acted piece of film, but the dialogue seemed to fail to develop interesting, complex, human characters we could really care about and empathize with. I easily get sucked-into characters and stories. Its my favorite part of the film-watching experience, but this film failed to make me feel that I deeply understood (or cared about) even one of the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not So Much A Review, But Just An Observation","I just an epiphany while watching this and I don't know what to do with it except write it here (and maybe on youtube): HER and EX MACHINA are parallel stories.

First of all, the physical location of the house is magnificent. The house itself is super stylish and modern, I like it so much that I want to live in it! Another great thing is that Domnhall Gleeson looks super young and innocent in the film, which is well suited to the surprise ending. Visuals of Ava are stunning because she looks so real.Suspense is well built and maintained throughout. The plot is so mysterious and intriguing. As I was watching the film, I came up with a few possibilities of how things may end, but I was only partially right. I very much enjoyed this film.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Well made but uninteresting and predictable,"The advancement of artificial intelligence to human levels has been a favorite subject for science fiction writers since the concept was invented, and it's been a popular subject for sci-fi movies for a long time now. Alex Garland's Ex Machina does little new with the subject, and contains very few surprises. Despite being fairly unoriginal, it's still an enjoyable piece of cinema. It survives on looks and the talent in front of the camera. Domhnall Gleeson stars (and is easily the least interesting of the basically four person cast) as a programmer who is selected by internet genius Oscar Isaac to test his new, advanced robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). She is more than intriguing. She's gorgeous, and, against his better judgement, Gleeson becomes attracted to her as he tests her. Vikander is very convincing as a robot. Sounds like an insult, but her performance is very subtle in the way she emotes. Isaac is fun as always. The fourth person in the cast is Sonoyo Mizuno, who plays Isaac's Japanese servant - not difficult to figure out what her deal is, but I liked whenever she popped up. She and Isaac share a dance that's easily my favorite moment in the film. The movie's production design and cinematography, as well as its score, are all very good. Worth a watch, but I'd recommend waiting for video or streaming.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty, but shallow.","There are many things to like about this film, including the CGI, the mood and the overall style. However, the artificial and sterile style reminds me of Gattaca, and the mood is almost identical to that of 2001.The plot is relatively unoriginal and predictable, but the scenes are still well written and performed. The dialogue and interaction between Ava and Caleb is captivating – illustrating the potential difficulty of separating an advanced AI from a human being. The story has a very clear philosophical undertone.Aside from the Caleb–Ava interaction, the plot is otherwise not very convincing. There are too many unanswered questions as to why Nathan does what he does. Essential elements of the plot are introduced with entirely unconvincing reasons. The gratuitous usage of hyper-sexualised female robots with two men is a bit too cliché – too ""Howard Wolowitz"" – for my liking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Masterful Exploration of AI and Ethics, But May Not Be for Everyone","Ex Machina is a true masterpiece that explores some of the most profound questions about AI, ethics, humanity, and emotions. This movie is a rare gem that manages to be both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, leaving a lasting impact on its viewers.At its core, Ex Machina is a story about the relationship between a young programmer named Caleb and an advanced AI robot named Ava, created by Caleb's boss, Nathan. As Caleb spends more time with Ava, he begins to question her true nature and his own perception of reality. The film takes the viewer on a journey that challenges our assumptions about what it means to be human and what role AI can play in our lives.The performances in this movie are outstanding, particularly those of Alicia Vikander as Ava and Oscar Isaac as Nathan. Vikander manages to convey a sense of both otherworldliness and humanity in her portrayal of Ava, making her a truly captivating and enigmatic character. Isaac, on the other hand, brings a sense of intensity and unpredictability to his role as Nathan, adding depth and complexity to the story.One of the things I love most about Ex Machina is its willingness to take risks and push boundaries. The film's use of visual effects and cinematography is breathtaking, and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. But, the film's pacing may be slow for some viewers, and it may not be everyone's cup of tea.In a world where AI is becoming increasingly integrated into our lives, Ex Machina serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of ethics and our responsibility to create AI that aligns with our values. This is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in exploring the complex relationship between humans and technology.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Chilly,"Slightly more a horror movie in unusual settings than Sci-Fi, but the settings besides being unusual are breathtakingly beautiful, yet creepy.Most of the film takes place in an ultra smooth, minimalist yet claustrophobic ""house"" (a hotel in real life) located in a rugged, mountain landscape.The ""house"", big windows and polished concrete, belongs to Nathan, the creator of a fictional Google SE, therefore Nathan is mega rich, besides being unpleasant and probably schizoid, but a genius nevertheless.Under false pretence, there goes Caleb, a programmer in Nat's firm, for a week's assignment during which he gets to dislike Nat and fells for Nat's creation, creepy AI in female human shape Ava.The plot is so clever as to spoon feed us lies until the abrupt ending that takes place in an underground, windowless corridor, where the concrete is highlighted by splashes of red. Besides the settings, the Ava special effects are also amazingly good and contribute to elevate the material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary and thought-provoking,"'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.Of any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.I love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.The characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

great smaller sci-fi treat,Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer at the biggest internet company which has a search engine and Bluebook. He's brought to the remote compound of its owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan gives him a week to perform a Turing test on his new AI in the form of Ava (Alicia Vikander).Domhnall Gleeson has to sell this if it's to work. Alicia Vikander is more than a hot girl which helps a lot. I find Oscar Isaac playing only one note. This led me to a wrong guess. The resolution is an interesting one and not necessarily my expected one. The concepts are really interesting and this indie has a great look. Ava is hypnotic.

The Turing Test and the Evitable Conflict.,"Q/ Who made me? A/ God made me.Q/ Why did God make me? A/ God made me to know him, to love him, and to serve him in this world ...Well, I never thought I would open a film review with that, but it did seem appropriate. I could not locate the source material, but, thank God, my memory is still good.A Universal film. 'Ex Machina' is an SF film about a robot. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a young man working in a high-tech company. He is notified that he has won a competition. The prize is to spend a week at the home of the owner of the company. The company owns 'The Blue Book', the most popular search-engine on the internet. The owner of the company is Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan is a recluse living in a far-north wilderness. He is also a genius, has a bulked-up body, and a big beard that any naval-person would be proud of, as well as a character that is somewhat controlling, overbearing, and sinister.Nathan informs Caleb that the real reason he is here is to do a Turing Test. Caleb is introduced to a robot, called Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Nathan has been trying to develop AI. Now Caleb is the first person to find out what Nathan has been working on.The film revolves around the two males and the robot. Thus this is a slow film, it is a character-study rather than an action film. The film was written and directed by Alex Garland. This is in fact his directorial debut, and a very good debut it is too. The early high- tech office scenes looked authentic, the outside scenes were spectacular, as were the special-effects.The three stars of the film give sterling performances. Mr Isaac is sufficiently dark and brooding. Mr Gleeson, who starred with Rachel McAdams, in the 2013 time-travelling rom-com 'About Time', here has a straight role as an earnest and innocent young man. And as for Miss Vikander, this is the second week running that I have seen her in a starring role, last week I saw her play Vera Brittain in 'Testament of Youth'. In Ex Machina, she plays the robot called Ava. This is a difficult role, but one that she plays well. She is required to not only be a machine-like robot, but also to be able to interact with the humans. Can she interact and learn? Does she have AI? These are the central questions explored in the film.Those familiar with the robot books of Isaac Asimov, or the films 'Her' (2013), The Imitation Game (2014), or the iconic 'Blade Runner' (1982), will recognize the similar themes explored here in 'Ex Machina'. Those unfamiliar with them will not have their enjoyment stopped or their understanding denied.""And that is all. I saw it from the beginning, when the poor robots couldn't speak, to the end, when they stand between mankind and destruction"". -Dr. Susan Calvin, in the robot short-story 'The Evitable Conflict'.'Ex Machina' is an interesting and well-filmed SF movie. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sex Machina,"(Ratings: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: A visual treat for the eyes, but the mind is deactivated by a dumb script.GRADE: B-Why aren't futuristic robots ever fat and ugly? I just had to ask that question, for whenever I see those female androids in sci-fi movies, they are always stunningly beautiful sleek models of perfection who become clever and resourceful adversaries. That being said, the latest prototype of artificial intelligence is on the market in the indie thriller, Ex Machina.Computer genius Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) is send on assignment to work on a top secret project in the isolated home of a wealthy CEO for the company. His boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has a specific project in mind: an A.I. that he has created and named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava is two thirds human parts (face, hands and feet) and one third metal and plastic, but very well-put-together, so much so that IKEA would like the patent.￼Of course, we already sense the foreboding danger before Caleb does. Writer / Director Alex Garland sets up that fact all too obviously with the physical fortress-like setting, its eerie lighting, and the actions of both Nathan and Ava from the outset. Been here, seen that before.Taking that well-worn successful formula of man's endless obsession with the bots and the bots displaying conflicting human emotion, as was the conceit of Jonzes' film her and Spielberg's A.I., Garland's film never engages its viewer emotionally. There is a nagging remoteness, not only in the fabricated Ava, but in the human characters as well. As written, Nathan and Caleb are suppose to be highly intelligent men, but their actions are self- destructive and juvenile from the get-go. The actors, who do yeoman-like work, should not be faulted, but the four character script surely can garner its share of the blame. (Sonoya Mizuno plays Nathan's mute geisha servant who supplies the frontal nudity to keep the audience awake.) The dialog is an endless existential debate about our humanity (of lack thereof) and it gets rather tedious awful fast.Garfield the Writer has larger issues he wants to tackle, but the film breaks down to a ""them vs. us"" mentality rather quickly. The ""shocking"" reveals and twists aren't very surprising or satisfying. Everyone acts strange throughout. But there is strange, and there is STRANGE and without logical characters and actions at play, there is no basis for credibility or interest.However, Garfield the Director has created a wonderful look for his film. He efficiently uses reflections in mirrors and glass to give Ex Machina a hallucinatory unearthly feel. The art design works overtime to hide the sci-fi failings of the script. Kudos to the art direction of for Mark Digby, Michelle Day, and Katrina Mackay and Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's dissonant music score which adds a nice atmospheric touch and keeps the tension there.￼While the film is visually exciting to watch, Ex Machina is a hollow replicant of so many other sci-fi droid movies. Its surface is shiny and polished, but there is nothing at its core.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Are you missing the point?,"De·us ex ma·chi·na: noun, meaning an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel. Deus meaning God.Three main characters are described in most reviews, and understandably so. Nathan, the antagonist, Caleb and Ava, the two protagonists, drive the story here, and everything that happens centers around their actions, whether or not their motives are apparent.But beneath the surface is the unfolding transformation that the story will hinge on, in full view, though understated, all along. If Nathan is the deus (the god), then Kyoko provides the ex machina, the twist that seals the fate of all the characters.Watching on the DVD and forwarding to chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 all begin with her presence in the scene. Not only is the beauty of Sonoya Mizuno used for Nathan's enjoyment, but her presence seems unacknowledged until we witness her moment of unexpected action.This story may center around the actions and intentions of the three main characters, but it is Kyoko who delivers the biggest shock. Mizuno's restrained acting has confused some, and even goes unnoticed by others, but this is the underlying current of conscious awakening that gives this film its exclamation point. It's totally worth viewing once or twice to fully appreciate all four performances. Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A near perfect hybrid of stylish, simmering suspense and taut thematic theses","In Alex Garland's updated man-against-machine fantasy, the machine is sexy and sensual, driven by the same essential needs as all humans: affinity and self-preservation. In his directorial debut Garland creates a near perfect hybrid of stylish, simmering suspense and taut thematic theses. It's always a strength for any mystery movie when the potential antagonist's enigma is narratively based, that is to say driven by a character's - as opposed to the plot's - need to obscure things. And the result here is an edge-of-your seat interplay between the three lead characters, through whom Garland displays, demonstrates and discusses an impressive range of what it means to be human - or in touch with humanity, at least.

Intelligent movie with a strong message!,"""Ex_Machina"" is an extraordinary movie about the AI. Ava was a perfect example of humanity's fear about the AI. That it can become sentient and sensible.

Throughout the ""testing"" of Ava in the movie, we can see the development of the sentience in her. The character arc of Ava is highly visible, interesting and well done. The movie is a bit slow at the start, but it builds up to an amazing plot twist and ending. I would maybe consider this movie even into a documentary film because the events that happened in this movie could as well happen in real life. The acting was great, and the overall setting.

OUTSTANDING!,"Bravo! Finally a good movie! Ex Machina is outstanding, intelligent, well written and has superb acting. The most fascinating thing to me was how Ava progressed; bit by bit (no pun intended!). As she learned more, she got smarter, more cunning, more untrusting, more diabolical, and more human. And more determined to survive.A few points that stand out: The movie shows how a woman (even a female robot) can ""use"" a man to get what she wants. But the broader picture is how a human being can be manipulated by another. They begin to trust, believe what the other says, they fall in love, and blindly see what they want to see in the other person. A perfect example of human frailty.The only weak part was the very end, in that, sooner or later her power source has to run out. Too bad they did go that far.

The Underrated Gem of 2015,"A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breath-taking humanoid A.I.Without question, ""Ex Machina"" may be the most underrated of the 2015 Oscar nominees. It received two nominations: best visual effects and best original screenplay. The effects are good, and it deserves to be nominated in this category, but it might be tough to squeak by given how many films these days are effects-heavy. I wouldn't count it out, but it's no sure thing.As for best original screenplay, I really hope that the voters see the brilliance in this script. There have been attempts to bring AI stories to the screen for at least fifty years, and some of them are very good. But I dare say this may well be the best. The exploration of what it means to be a person or have consciousness is done perfectly, and the issue is more important now than ever before. What was once a philosophical hypothesis is now an inevitability... like it or not, Apple, IBM and Google are nearing this goal.What really sells the story is the discussion of prototypes. Once you create a living machine, however imperfect, can you simply take it apart without moral consequence? A parent may threaten that, ""I made you, and I can end you."" But of course that is not true -- the murder of a child is reprehensible. In the eyes of a god, is the destruction of a machine with feelings and dreams any less cruel? The script also excels in its references. We have Wittgenstein, Mary Shelley and Oppenheimer to name a few. There is a great use of Jackson Pollack to explain how unconscious thought works. And the deeper issues are mentioned without getting too boring or down in the weeds. Anyone interested in the philosophy or the computer science can find more at their local library -- we are given just enough here to start that dialogue. (I expect this movie to be shown in ethics classes for years to come.) The question then is, if the film is underrated, what did the Academy miss? Alicia Vikander, of course. She was nominated for ""The Danish Girl"", but after seeing both films, it seems clear she was more remarkable in this one. She deserved the nod for this rather than the other one, or perhaps even both. (It is not unheard of for an actor or actress to get two nominations in the same category.) I would also not be opposed to Oscar Isaac getting a supporting actor nomination, as he really made himself known.Now, maybe I am being a bit bold here, but I think ""Ex Machina"" would have been a worthy contender in the best picture category. It clearly edges out some of the lesser films, notably ""Brooklyn"". Maybe there was no room with the other science fiction (""Martian"") or fantasy (""Mad Max"") movies... I can understand that. The Oscars love dramas and period pieces. But I do hope just being nominated for some of the lesser awards gets this film some additional attention.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
300 IQ Made Movie,"The fit and finish, the details in this movie are super well thought out. Looking back on it, if I were to nit pick there is only one thing I would change, but this change has absolutely no bearing on the movie itself. That would be the heli scene in the start.""Watch your head."" In this scene, given its a civilian helicopter, there is no reason they would not turn off the engine. Like I said, this scene has nothing to do with the movie.Here's a non spoiler example of what you can look out for. The very first time the human meets the robot, watch the mannerisms of said robot and the entire setup on that moment. It came in from one side to the other with Its side to the human. It stopped, tilted its head just enough to see the human, and for the human to notice. Took a moment, and then continued on. This gives the Human a chance to go though his own emotions.Imagine how you would feel the first time you meet an alien?No matter how prepared you think you or could be, your biological responsible will be meet with anxiety. Your natural reaction will be to ready yourself for a Fight/Flight/Freeze response. Fear would be a dominate feeling even if its coexisting with curiosity. You would need time to acclimate to this new encounter, and the best way to do so is in steps. Start small, far and away, and take a break, come back a little closer till your comfortable with the circumstances. Exposure Therapy 101.As for all the rest of the movie, I can assure you, its on point and does not miss a beat.

I would bet this year, and maybe as long as into 2024, there will be 100's of millions of job losses to this AI alone.

"Great Concept, Frustrating Execution","It's really frustrating to write a somewhat negative review of this movie, because it did so many things so well. But ultimately, I walked away from it both frustrated and disappointed, so it's hard to recommend this movie to anyone but sci-fi lovers, of which I am not. To be honest, I really only watched this because of the incredible reviews it was getting, so to say that I was let down is an understatement.The concept of artificial intelligence is one that has intrigued me quite a bit lately, so I thought this movie might be an appropriate introduction to the subject. In that sense, the film is successful, exploring many scientific and ethical questions surrounding the construction, operation, risks, and benefits of remarkably sophisticated humanoid robots. Unfortunately, the story just doesn't hold up, especially near the end.There are some very interesting and suspenseful scenes in the first half of the movie, and what I love most is the fact that the film creates genuine tension by what is happening, not via cheap scares or tons of special effects being thrown in your face. The atmosphere is appropriately ominous, crafted marvelously with excellent cinematography, good acting, and a fine musical score.But sadly, everything just crumbles in the final third of the film. The story becomes more and more predictable, and although there are some interesting twists, everything ultimately builds into a ""final battle"" of sorts that is surprisingly graphic and unsettling, as well as overly simplistic for the film's overall sophistication. And the ending is the worst of all: it's both incomplete and extremely depressing.I really wanted to like this movie, because it embodies so many things I look for: a focus on story over action, careful attention to detail, and an intriguing and thought-provoking concept. This is not a bad film, and I can see why people who can get past some pretty glaring plot issues liked it. But given the widespread praise for this film, this seems to be what is considered top-notch sci-fi. If that's the case, I don't think I'll be too interested in the genre any time soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Go only for Vikander,"""Ex-Machina is another Pinochio cliché movie. Nominated for the best original script and best visual effects (won this one), it doesn't work at all.

This experiment consists of a ""Turing Test"", where a human relates to an android (Alicia Vikander, the best performance of the film), trying to establish if the goal of the project was successful: to build a robot with artificial intelligence. The script, although indicated, has several ""holes in the plot,"" the narrative is linear, predictable and unlikely, the two male protagonists go poorly on paper, especially Gleeson.

"Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?","Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Sonoya Mizuno.

He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Strong Direction and Acting, Weak Story and OST","Ex Machina is the first film by writer and director Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson as a man who is tasked by a scientist played by Oscar Isaac to watch over a robot played by Alicia Vikander to see if she is really AI or not.The strongest point in the film is the acting. There's very few characters in the film and the setting is very claustrophobic. This puts the focus of the film on tight discussions made by the small cast. Tension is high and only increases as the film goes on. Oscar Isaac is excellent as the scientist Nathan. His character is very interesting and has lots of nuances. Alicia Vikander is pitch perfect as the android Ava and she is a very unique cinema robot. Domhnall Gleeson, whom I like as an actor, was only serviceable in the film. This is more the script's fault than his performance. He is not given much to do despite being the protagonist and he starts to behave out of character towards the end.The direction is mesmerizing and makes even the sluggish parts of the film enthralling. It is shocking to me that this is Garland's first film. He shows lots of potential. Unfortunately, the script isn't strong enough to support the excellent cinematography and visuals. It builds tension up until the finale, but rather than pay off the finale is just a cliché'd mess. Characters behave irrationally, a small little decision is acted without any rational thought put into it, and the ending itself was extremely predictable. The score is also mediocre and is more of that trend in indie films where they think quiet ambiance = a film score.There isn't much else to say about Ex Machina. It's a beautifully looking movie and the acting makes it as interesting as it can be given the flawed and uninspired script. I can say it is leagues better than Chappie at least. However, it doesn't bring any new and fresh ideas or themes to the genre, making it a pretty forgettable foray into the AI subgenre of science fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fantastically Engaging From Beginning to End,"I watched this on VidAngel recently, and was astounded at how much I enjoyed this film. There were really only three actors and just a few locations, minimalism at its finest. In fact, this could have been made for the stage as well as it was made for the screen. At any rate, from the very first scene to the rolling of the credits I was completely intrigued.The plot, too be sure, progressed wonderfully. The pacing is excellent and the mystery held my interest throughout, with a satisfying twist at the end. But it's the character interaction that really makes this film shine.The dialogue is superb. Well crafted and realistic it makes the characters and their relationships with one another the centerpiece of this film. The characters are exquisitely defined and the acting top notch, completely drawing me into the story. Nathan and Ava are especially fascinating character studies, and long after the film had ended I found myself thinking about them and the way they were portrayed.This is a true gem of a film, and it makes me sad that it didn't attract the attention it deserves. I hope it makes up for this in its life as a DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nothing more human than deceit,"I found this movie to be a kind of minimalistic cautionary tale about the dangers of true sentient machines (and cell phones as tracking devices). Not really an excessively innovative concept, but the message gets across well enough with realistic performances and without overdoing it with preachy or convoluted moral or ethical arguments nor cheap action movie gimmicks.Minimalistic in its visual, structural and communicational simplicity. It reminded me to some degree to 2001: A Space Odyssey for the evolutionary implications, the feeling of isolation, the use of whites and the Hal-like quality and speech pattern softness of Alicia Vikander; but It really felt like a Black Mirror episode, and Domnhal Gleeson plus some soundtrack choices made the comparison even more apparent.To me there are obvious plot holes involved with the overall premise, like the total absence of any basic fail-safe when developing a.i. as a precaution (any of Asimov's laws of robotics would have been enough) to name one ; but that aside it's still an entertaining enough science fiction psychological thriller. I particularly enjoyed how deceit becomes the ultimate human trait in the whole process, being used by and against all main characters at some point. The cast was correct, not that memorable but fine enough given that they didn't have that much to work with script-wise. It felt like the screenplay may have fallen a bit short from a nice original story. It wasn't any mind blowing experience but it wasn't a waste of time either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The movie absolutely kept me wanting more.The only negative I would say would be for the Protagonist not wanting more information.

And God Created Ava,"Stories about artificial intelligence (or at least the ones I've seen) most usually focus on the moral implications of those who create it. Are we entitled to wear the mantle of a god, and if we are, what is our obligation to the things we create?""Ex Machina"" is a unique addition to the genre, because it flips the question: what moral obligations (if any) inform the responses of man's creations, and are we prepared for the consequences if we create intelligence without a sense of right and wrong?The fear that our technology will some day turn on us is not a new one and hasn't been since the dawn of storytelling. But this film manages to mine some new and interesting ideas from the same general premise. Ava is an artificial being created by a sort of mad scientist (Oscar Isaac). A programmer who works for the scientist (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the chance to spend a week at his reclusive complex and interact with Ava as a sort of test to see how convincing she is. A cat and mouse game ensues between the scientist and programmer as the latter decides he needs to liberate Ava from captivity. What neither takes into consideration is Ava's ruthlessness and willingness to do whatever she needs to do to gain her freedom.""Ex Machina"" plays out slowly and creepily, heightening the tension by gradual degrees. It's not a totally satisfying movie if you begin to think about it too much -- many details feel thrown in to service the plot rather than because they feel right for the story, not the least of which is how quickly Gleeson's character becomes infatuated enough with Ava to want to run off with her. But if you're willing to suspend disbelief a bit, the film offers an unusually intelligent and cerebral compliment to the glut of technology-run-amok films on the market.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility.,"Breaking genre rules is the spice of cinema life and Ex Machina (2015) breaks them all as a hybrid sci-fi chamber thriller with pretensions of stretching science into the realm of the gods (the title alludes to 'god from machine'). Science fiction films exist to provoke awe and even fear at the power of science, and today it is focused especially on the field of artificial intelligence and the possibility that man will one day create a sentient being capable of self-redesign (a hypothetical point futurists call 'the singularity'). The 'chamber' dynamic puts a small number of people into a confined space over a short period of time to intensify their interactions, and when their intentions are unknown or unhinged, the thriller genre emerges in all its frightening glory.These are the key ingredients of a story in which IT nerd Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition to spend a week with his firm's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) during which he will administer a Turing test to the boss's newest creation, an android called Eva (Alicia Vikander). As an historical aside, this still influential test was developed in 1950 by the 'father of computing' Alan Turing to tell the difference between humans and robots. Put simply, if the answers given by an android can pass as human, then artificial intelligence is said to exist. Caleb is thrilled by the opportunity, even if the bearded beer-swilling iron-pumping CEO gives him the creeps. But it's a chess game of guessing what is happening, who is manipulating who, and what is the real reason Caleb is there. Ultimately the story poses the question: is it possible for a human creation to rise against its human creator? If you think this is fantasy, Google 'the singularity'.With brilliantly atmospheric photography, a secluded setting, and three well-defined characters competing for control, this is a tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility. If anything is out of balance, it is the acting of Alicia Vikander as the android. Her presence tends to overwhelm any film in which she appears, like in the recent films The Danish Girl (2015) and Testament of Youth (2015). But that is hardly criticism. This is an intelligent, engaging and thoughtful exploration of where the field of artificial intelligence stands today, where it is heading, and the issues to be confronted as we look beyond our current knowledge horizons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I like to play a game where I puzzle the story before the next step happens and in this film, I found it a great challenge.

Robot psychological thriller,"Ex Machina is an excellent example on how to do a science fiction movie with a smaller budget, now that CGI has evolved enough that it's easy to do convincing special effects without spending millions and millions.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer working for Bluebook, sort of a amalgamation of the futuristic reach of Google and the social media of Facebook, lead by a prodigal genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), whose long-held dream is to be the first to develop a true artificial intelligence. But how to prove such a thing actually has sentience? At which point is it clear that the robot (Alicia Vikander) is actually thinking and not just utilizing a complex program of coded responses? That's where Caleb steps in and our story begins.What really sets Ex Machina apart from so many other science fiction movies is its style and genre. It's a psychological thriller, there's very little action and the focus is on the mystery, the mood and the atmosphere. This makes this a very refreshing movie to watch if you're looking for a change. Especially because the three main characters are all very interesting and played by talented actors.The reason why I didn't rate this film any higher is because I found the actual plot to be somewhat predictable. It was a good plot, but I was only surprised once, and even then not that much. Which is a problem, but not a deal breaker. At least for me. Plus I've watched a ton of science fiction in my lifetime, so I had something of a home advantage.What would have made Ex Machina a masterpiece is that it should have had a plot that truly did something different with the A.I. subgenre.

It's a must-watch for anyone interested in thought-provoking cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful,"The art direction was absolutely stunning, the atmosphere was creepy and menacing, it achieved a lot for such a small cast, one of whom was mute. Most of the plot was painfully predictable but still extremely entertaining to watch, and as much as I disliked one of the characters, I never for a moment saw any of the actors as anyone other than who they were playing. It has it's flaws and by no means is a perfect movie, there are a lot of issues with the dialogue and the ending that really bother me but I'll definitely be watching it again and might change my rating later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Isaac Asimov fans, grab this one","Someone said it's the best Sci-Fi movie along with Blade Runner. It really isn't the same thing. This is a movie without any kind of action.The dialog is a landmark of human artificial intelligence at least in the movie industry. This is all this movie is about, how do AI machines personality develop. Quite fine observation when the android has trouble making a choice. However I didn't find it 'natural' when the android says ""I'm sorry for your loss"". This emotion was not build on anything a priori.A piece of art, more like reading a book. Watch this movie if you feel like thinking.Finally, I feel they could have gone even more into the thinking of the machine. It somehow lacks the subtlety of Al in the space odyssey. But it's to be understood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Sci-Fi Based in Emotion,"What a brilliant little sci-fi film this is. That is, if you can really call it a sci-fi. In truth, ""Ex Machina"" is indeed a sci-fi, but it has qualities that other films of the genre don't. It's also a strange romance and a character study...of three different characters.The film follows Caleb (Dohmnall Gleeson) who wins a week at the home of a brilliant scientist named Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan wants Caleb to be part of a trial run for his new artificially intelligent robot. This involves the Turing test, where Caleb must interact with the A.I., and if he can't notice that she isn't human, she passes. The catch is that the A.I. robot is in the form of an attractive woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander.) As we go along we learn that Nathan has some shocking secrets and the film becomes an intense and thrilling ride to see not only if Ava passes the test, but to see if Caleb uncovers the truth behind his trip.""Ex Machina"" is shot quite unlike other sci-fi films. The cutting isn't rapid and each shot is given room to breathe. This is partly because there is very little action in the film. It draws on human (and non-human) emotions to drive the story and it is so refreshing to avoid all the violent hoopla that comes with most films like this. The film is surprisingly well-lit judging by its dark tone and as the film goes on, the camera gets closer to the actors, symbolizing the fact that the audience learns more and more about the characters as time passes.Another driving point for the film is three very good performances. As Vikander's robot seduces Caleb, she also seduces us. She doesn't do this through her looks, but through her tone of her voice and through the fact that she actually seems human. Dohmnall Gleeson has shown glimpses of brilliance in the past, but he really shines here as the character we relate to most. Most of all, Oscar Isaac is outstanding as the villain in the tale. The way he tries to befriend Caleb, yet is so mysterious, is unnerving, but wonderful to watch.One of the best things about the film is the score. As can be imagined, there are numerous points in the film that stir us up, and gnaw at us to keep us guessing what will happen. Along with that is a simple score that builds and keeps building until we can hardly take the tension any longer. It is thrilling and really adds to the film tremendously.""Ex Machina"" exceeds a number of other sci-fi and A.I.-focused films by bending the genre and focusing on human emotion over spectacle. It is one of the best films of 2015 thus far, and serves as an exciting booster for its three rising actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not just another AI movie.,"This movie was a masterpiece.The acting was amazing, especially from Isaac, who shifted through his character's personality traits with ease without over-doing it. You were left believing that Ava possessed true AI, and the part was played to perfection. The character of Caleb was absolutely a perfect fit for this film; a plain, homely, and gullible young man whose ego can easily be stoked to do the bidding of Nathan Bateman. But by and large, Issac's unpredictable nature and creepiness stole the show.The locations were both unique and awe-inspiring, from the modernistic earth-friendly fortress in the middle of nowhere, to the edges of mighty glaciers, to flowery mountain meadows. The cinematography and visuals were top-notch, from the glass barrier walls and creepy hallways, to the natural lighting that filled every room with a soft glow.The plot was very well written, but will go over the head of less cerebral movie-goers. I especially love the parallels with the biblical creation story, filmed in a ""garden of Eden"" where man (Caleb) is tempted by Eve (conveniently called Ava) and observed by god/creator (Nathan). But god's earlier (and not so perfect) creation of woman, Lilith (one of Nathan's dysfunctional prototypes was even named Lily), rises to create havoc with man and god. Once Eve (Ava) ate from the tree of knowledge (committed sin), she left Eden (Nathan's retreat).This movie is about more than just the philosophical implications of true AI, but about human nature at it's core.Definitely the best movie I have seen this year, and probably the best AI movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Perfection,"I don't often give a 10 so when i do it's a movie which gives me the complete experience of Flow.

If Claude Monet was a film this would be it. 10/10,"Ex Machina is easily the best Sci Fi film I have come across in recent times, It captured me sucked me in and blew me away with it's intelligent way of showing the pro's and cons of Artificial Intelligence. The setting of the film was great, the imagination into the design of the Character (Ava) was a great work of art and so very believable. The triangular interaction between the focal characters was intense and it worked so well almost a love triangle, all this and with real clever and graceful acting. I got a sense of pure elegance in the way this film was made and what the director writer (Alex Garland) was trying to achieve here. I now have hope for AI films or tech in the future. To give a honest review here it's got to be without a shadow of doubt going to be one of my most favorite films of all time! I just can't compare this to any other Sci Fi films old or new but I can give a rating out of 10 and it's so very seldom I can give a film 10/10 however this one is an exception, it was a fantastic watch and deserves all the admiration and plaudits it get's. This film is a piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An interesting look at what it means to be human,"Ex-Machina is a movie that explores the boundary between humans and an advanced AI. It brings about questions of what is needed to be considered human in a very thought-provoking, if at times uneven, movie.While the scope of what the movie explores is large, the way in which it does is not. There are essentially three main characters, and the entirety of the movie takes place in one location. The majority of the movie is spent talking or watching others, so don't go into this expecting a fast paced movie. In fact one of the criticisms for the film is how slow it is at the beginning; while in the end this works for the movie due to what's been set up, it can make it a bit of a slog to get through the first half.While the plot isn't anything special, the characters themselves are well realized. This is in part due to the great performances by the actors, who fully commit to the roles they play while maintaining a depth for the characters that are slowly revealed throughout the movie. While I personally didn't really consider any of the characters to be likable, they were certainly entertaining to watch.The cinematography and music really lent atmosphere to the film, and helped build up suspense as to where the film was going. I also loved how color was used in the movie, and the way it made really striking scenes and images.The movie ends in a way that's open to some interpretation, as well as leaving it up to the viewer to determine what they think it means to be human, and how an AI should be thought of. There's no spoonfeeding or enforcing a definition on you, so it makes for a great post-movie discussion.The movie is certainly for everyone though. I recommend it if you can appreciate a slow burn movie, are a fan of sci-fi, or just enjoy contemplating the philosophy of what being a human or conscious being is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Superb,"A excellent piece of SF that takes an idea that may soon be reality and works it through to a plausible conclusion. Everything about this film was 'right': the casting, the script, the acting, and the production.In terms of quality, it reminds me of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" with the additional benefit of CGI instead of men in monkey suits.There is nudity and a sexual element, but to mind the UK BBFC with a 15 certificate got it right. I can guess why the MPAA gave it an R - they did the same to ""The King's Speech"" because the f word was used non abusively - but in 2015?Unless you are of the Religious Right, watch it. You are in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Game changing movie,"I think this film fits the proper usage ""dig one's own grave""Ex Machina mainly attracted to me because of it's wonderful locations, beautiful and eccentric cinematography, futuristic concept, elevated music and of course the outstanding performance by Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. Isaac's performance was phenomenal and menacing.I don't know how they do it! That vfx was out of this world and I'm glad that the team behind it won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.A little bit anticlimactic (Ava's lack of empathy should be noted) although the sounds produced by Ava's movement was brilliant.I think Gleeson's character deserved to be manipulated and throw away like a trash.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Refreshing Return to Sci-Fi,"Alex Garland has done an impressive thing. He's managed to produce a better Sci-fi film than Sci-Fi giant Ridley Scott's latest attempt, and he's managed to make it popular too! Ex Machina looks at artificial intelligence without re-working the trite old moral issue of 'can we switch off a machine that is self aware?' that every movie on a similar theme has since plagiarised from Spileberg's A.I. over a decade ago.And what's more, the interesting script and rich mise-en-scène are strongly balanced with brilliant CGI that actually supports the film rather than competes with it (finally!).The film has an original style, an engaging script and a directorial ability worthy of Kubrick himself. In fact it's so good I didn't mind over-looking some of the more florid, but infrequent, philosophical and scientific inaccuracies of the dialogue.A well needed dose of quality into the Sci-fi genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Nice modular synthesizer sounds make up most of the sound track ala A Clockwork Orange. Very effective but never in the way. There are questions at the end which is a good thing in my book. This film conjures simultaneous feelings of horror and joy that linger long after viewing. If you wanted to be picky, you could find a few holes in the story line.

Captivating,"Reviewing this straight after seeing, I really took an interest into the story a little on the science fiction side, but feels more like a little twist on realist in all honesty. Would agree with what some other reviews have mentioned in saying that the film has some deep philosophical meaning, in my words it really makes you think, if not about the future ethics maybe about how close to reality this may actually be.It's not going to be to everyone's taste, but I believe its a good watch for anyone, kind of feel like I've been left on a cliff at the end, gives a good feeling of suspense and like I've said leaves you with something to think about.Probably not that good of a review and I'm certainly not the best person for putting my feelings on a subject into words, but I guess I have one piece of advise it would be if you're wondering what is about or whether you'll like it then just watch it.

Thought provoking sci-fi,"Not beyond the realms of possability, which is what makes it so scary without it being a scary film.What i did find good about this fiilm especially was not its story, but the way it was told. It was not made as an action movie or in an exciting way, more like in a matter of fact this is how it is likely to be when someone makes an AI, as if watching a retelling of a fact rather than making a film that scares,enthralls or is techno futuristic, and as such it is interesting without trying to be entertaining.Personaly i loved it as am a bit of a nerd when comes to films such as this, but even if hate sci-fi the subject matter regardless if like it or not makes you wonder not so much what if, but wonder when such a thing will happen, as like the terminator franchise,wargames and countless other films have done, only in a less action or threatening way just matter of factly-which is scary in itself.Much recommended if happy to be scared not by the film, but by what it makes you think could happen within our lifetime.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The robots will enslave us. We all know it. But this is a nice take on it.,"""Ex Machina"" is the kind of slow-building and unpredictable movie that I was sure would have one of those rug-out-from-under-you ""mindscrew"" endings. Not the good kind, but of the short-changing variety. Thankfully, it goes for the genuine payoff, a fitting capper for such an experimental (and somber) movie. Very nice surprise.This is a story about ideas (some really good ones, too) and its roll-out is appropriately tense from almost start to finish. The effects are fantastic (mostly on Ava herself), and the modernist architecture set against the nature scenery makes for eye-popping visuals.It doesn't feel like a big movie, but its impact is.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Feels like a Black Mirror episode,"Walking into this movie, I had heard a lot of positive things about it. I even heard some people call the director ""The next Kubrick"". So I was excited to see what all the fuzz was about.This movie deals mainly with the idea of Artificial Intelligence. the whole movie takes place in a facility where our main character is trying to find out if this machine can pass as AI or not.I really liked this movie. I thought that the ideas it presented were very interesting and I loved the conversations between Ava (AI) & our main character. This movie presents you with some very interesting questions you should ask yourself about synthetic intelligence and its benefits.Production wise, this movie is very good. I loved the colour-grading and the contrast between the outside world and the facility. Actually I loved the facility in which they are in. I loved the way that machine and human is divided by glass.And the atmosphere is great. Since the character walks into this facility, you know that something odd is happening, and you don't know what. Also, the CGI is impressive and looks really realistic.I enjoyed all of the performances. Oscar Isaac gives the best performance from all of them. His character has very interesting layers and I don't think we see a scientist portrayed like that very often. Domhnall Gleeson makes a good performance as the main character, although I believed that the main character was not as good, but that is not the actor's fault. Alicia did an incredible job at being Ava. Her performance was really great.The movie had me interested from beginning to end, and by the way... I really loved the ending.One thing that I believe the movie is not getting enough praise for is the score. I loved the electro-beat of the score and it really submerged you into this universe.The movie does have some minor plot holes, mainly in the ending. Also, the movie does require a lot of exposition. And sometimes, there are some subtle scenes that don't need explaining and they still explain them.As I stated earlier, this does feel like a Black Mirror episode (it even stars a Black Mirror actor).

More Human Than You Think.,"""Ex Machina"" is a subtle and clever film about a computer programmer who has been selected to take part in an experiment on a robot with artificial intelligence.

Amazingly beautiful sadness!,"Movies like this are extremely rare. I have never seen a movie where the gap between the number of characters appearing and how great the movie is, like this one. The film has only 4 characters, but it is not boring and lacking, on the contrary, the dramatic, attractive increase slowly makes my heart beat fast.Especially the sound mixing and music in this movie is so good, so wonderful that I imagine I want to listen to it over and over again. The visual effects are of course also very impressive.As for the content, it's great. I've always liked movies with an open ending, like ""Inception"". It always makes us think and feel the soul of the message in the movie. The only crazy thing about this movie is the character Nathan. If I was smart enough to create an AI in human form, I wouldn't foolishly confront two robots in a nervous state, like a gymer who likes to lift weights but is a bit dumb. Not to mention the fact that Nathan lives alone (almost) in a desolate place in the middle of the woods with no medical protection or emergency measures, what if he has a heart attack. The character Nathan at the end of the movie is like a gym clown.I strongly like to think that Kyoko's appearance caused Nathan to die, even though the purpose of creating Kyoko was to care for and serve Nathan. If you're smart enough to think you're a god, believe me, you won't want to indulge in debauchery or entertainment, for perversion and violence are only for ignorant humans.In conclusion, this is still one of the most special movies I have ever seen.

A Fascinating Examination on the Qualities of Humanity,"One-sentence summary: A computer programer wins a trip to the secret headquarters of a tech billionaire, where he's introduced to the most complex AI ever created.Ex Machina is up there with ""Get Out"" as one of the most successful feature film debuts for a director in the past decade. Alex Garland emphatically proved he belonged behind the camera when this sci-fi thriller was released in 2014, which ended up reeling in two nominations at the Academy Awards, including a win for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. It's compelling as both a character study and a social commentary regarding the disadvantages humans face when engaging with AI. The performances are all spectacular, even if at times I didn't fully buy into Oscar Isaac as a Zuckerberg/Musk type of character. He was nevertheless pleasingly eccentric and irrefutably likable. The ending left a slight sour taste in my mouth, but I can say with absolute certainty that it was the right choice narratively.

Character personalities are swiftly constructed by the actors' convincing performances, especially Oscar Isaac, and the sessions with Ava just come one after another with new information being explored every time. All of the branch discussions like sexuality and search engine surveillance are also interesting, bringing the film to a philosophical height.

Manipulative A.I.,"Earlier this year I watched a movie called ""The Machine"". It's about an attractive android with A.I. and even though she was referred to as Machine, her looks were modeled after her creator, Ava.Ex Machina is about an attractive android named Ava (if this isn't weird enough, years ago there was a movie with Gregory Hines about an android named Eve... there's something about robots and three letter names). There were other similarities (between The Machine and Ex Machina) such as them both being super secretive and in the testing phases. In Ex Machina a character named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was the tester/testee of Ava. He was flown to the ultra-isolated compound of the founder of the uber-successful company, Bluebook. There he interacted with Ava regularly to give his grading on her passability as human.The movie was eerie and dark and definitely had a psy-thrill aspect to it. The creator of Bluebook, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), was douchey enough that you didn't like him or trust him. And if you don't like or trust him, how could you like or trust anything he created? So went the movie and of course you'll have to watch it to know who was trustworthy and who wasn't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unique,"Very original story. This sci fi film is full of tension and you won't know where it's headed. The pace is slow at time but because the suspense and tension is always there, it's still very effective. Thought-provoking!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-fi Masterpiece,"In the past, I really enjoyed watching the science-fiction movie ""Annihilation"", so without hesitation, I decided to watch ""Ex Machina"" when I found out that it was written and directed by the same person, Alex Garland. After finishing it, I believe that ""Ex Machina"" is a masterpiece.""Ex Machina"" tells the story of a young male programmer named Caleb (played by Domhnall Gleeson), who is invited to spend a week at a luxurious and isolated house. The owner of the house is Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac), who is also Caleb's CEO and the owner of a search engine company called Blue Book. When Cableb meets Nathan, he discovers that Nathan wants him to perform the Turing Test on his humanoid robot, named Ava (played by Alicia Vikander). The movie focuses on daily testing by Caleb having conversations with Ava. Even though it might sound boring, the way the movie performs conversation scenes is very entertaining for me. The ending scene surprised me a lot because it was not what I expected.The plot about humanoid robots is not new, but its execution is fresh and well-crafted enough to make it different from others. At first glance, Ex Machina seems to be a typical science-fiction movie. However, after watching it, I find that it's more like a psychological thriller driven by deep and engaging dialogues. The concept of artificial intelligence brings up many deep and meaningful questions about the consciousness and thoughts of machines.The performances of the three main actors in the movie are outstanding, and they keep me constantly curious about each character's true motivations. The dynamic between the three characters adds depth and tension to the story. Caleb, who is an ordinary geek in the first place and continues to develop his feelings for Ava. Nathan is like a genius guy who loves a party, and his words often hide something behind. And finally, Alicia Vikander's acting as Ava is worth mentioning because of her body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice that seem unnatural, which makes me believe that she is an android.The movie's visual design is top-notch, with Nathan's house being the only location used in the movie. The house is large, modern, and luxurious, but it also creates a haunting and suspicious feeling throughout the movie. Wisely uses of lighting and sound lift up the mood in many scenes. And the design of the material and skin of the robots is very detailed. The atmosphere of the movie impressed me so much. It always gives me a sense of suspension, and mystery that keeps me curious all the time about what will happen next.I found that this movie may not be suitable for the audience who prefers fast-paced or action sci-fi movies, but if you are someone who enjoys a movie that is driven by well-written dialogue and focuses on the psychological aspect of characters combining with top-notch quality in terms of scripting, acting, visual design, and sound. I highly recommend ""Ex Machina"" as a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mesmerizing and Intelligent.,"The first time I encountered this brilliant movie was just after the premiere of 'Interstellar' which I have also went to see on the big screen. Having learnt that it's much more efficient to be late for a movie because of the commercials, I took an extra ten minutes to get there. I sat down comfortably in my seat and let myself indulge in the trailer of 'Ex Machina', written by the one behind the creative and climatic '28 Days Later' as mentioned in the trailer. I knew it was going to be something. It grabbed my attention instantly. It was the last trailer before the opening of the film and I found myself regretful, that this wasn't the movie that was going to begin. It was okay.How do I pronounce it; 'E X Mashina' or rather 'X Maekina'? It's the latter, but I am still not sure whether I'm supposed to say the 'E' or leave it out. Or maybe string them both together like in 'den'. Anyway, I didn't have to repeat myself and my mission in acquiring the ticket was successful. I entered the cinema hall. Two other people and I were all in that very last hall on the corridor. It is pleasant to have peace and privacy, but it is disappointing that movies such as this fantastic work of art are often discredited and abandoned. What is rare, is for the rare, I suppose.We are slingshot into the story as we see Caleb, a young and gentle programmer who has won the golden ticket to spend a week with his mastermind employer, Nathan. We can admire the beautiful cinematography as the helicopter glides above the mountainous rural area, a chunk of gorgeous landscape that belongs to the billionaire Nathan himself. We can smile to the witty dialogue as we learn it does. From this point on, I was almost completely deprived of my natural skepticism.It only got better. Caleb is given a choice (or is he?) he can either sign the form that seems perilous and discover what Nathan has got to show him, a desire that is 'eating him from the inside', or spend a week drinking beer and 'bonding'. The illusion of a choice being given vanishes as Nathan puts it to him cleverly. He signs instantly. The first interlude unveils, totaling to seven, they cut up the movie neatly into chapters, with the last being quite different from the other six, an original and very effective feature.It really begins as Caleb awakes at night and knows that he won't be able to fall asleep. He puts on the TV in his room absent of windows. He is shocked to discover that its only purpose serves as a CCTV, planted by the devious and cunning Nathan (acted excellently and realistically by Oscar Isaac). He is given the option to watch the amazing and beautiful creature with an A.I. that's supposed to be indistinguishable from a human. There is a sense of doom and downfall as we witness him falling in love with 'Her'. We just don't quite know how it's going to happen.The movie purposely seemed predictable and I was naïve to think that I foresaw it, I found myself outwitted twice, as I believed it predicted my conclusion and disregarded it, to learn much later that I were right. Maybe you are not as stupid as I am. There are many powerful twists that caused a wide smile on my face multiple times, especially in the climaxing moment.One of the major climaxes is the one that's a twist without a twist. Perhaps I was dumb not to realize what was happening, as it is buttered all over our faces. I didn't give much thought to what just happened, I didn't understand it and even though something felt strange, I forgot all about it in the next scene. I do feel stupid but I think it's for the better. I like to be twisted. Looking back on it, the movie fooled me more than twice.The acting, the visuals, the music, the story and the writing are the apogee of creativity and brilliance. It is rare for a movie to infuse me with such powerful emotions and thoughts but it does happen, and I am thankful for it. Not only that, it is extremely entertaining. Every scene is essential and no minute is wasted. Every single aspect is believable and authentic, ultimately, this is what makes it work.The ending itself was perfect, leaving us a lot to think about. The themes explored in this superb film are great in depth and in fact a great challenge. Alex Garland is a newborn genius that triumphed over the task. With a debut such as this, I reckon he will succeed as a director many more times. At least I hope he does and wish him to achieve that from all my heart, although it's probably unnecessary with a talent such as this.My intuition did not fail me, and it was the best way to spend a night along with my ten euro. I recommend it to anyone who loves to be entertained and provoked to think. I think this is the longest time I spent watching the credits and listening to the enchanting music covering them, along with the other two blokes. Unfortunately, the amount of people of the second category is scarce. I don't mind as long as it does not hurt the potential of the director, and am happy to enjoy his imagination in an empty hall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Artificial Suspicion: Ex Machina,"Ex Machina is a thought-provoking science fiction movie that is different from many other mainstream movies of the same type because it does not rely only on technology or special effects to provoke the audience. Instead, it makes them consider big questions about the meaning of what it means to have a conscience.To illustrate, this film, it's a brilliant, engaging work of science fiction that leans heavily on ideas even though it does have very impressive special effects. Indeed, it relies on the interaction between human beings, and human beings and artificial intelligence than blockbuster-type of effects.Ex Machina is a science fiction drama that deals with human psychology. It was released in 2013 and it was written and directed by Alex Garland. It has a small yet compelling cast featuring Oscar Isaac, Domhall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander.In Ex Machina the audience sees a scientist who wants to be a god by creating and perfecting machines with artificial intelligence and at the end the machine exceeds the creator's expectations, and she does it by learning from human beings' own behaviour. The main message of the 2015 movie is that is trying to prove Artificial Intelligence has a consciousness. Therefore, the director explores the idea of whether a computer could have the same morals as a real person.How does the writer/director achieve this? The film was recorded in an isolated facility where the creator is alone with his creations and the only other person who is allowed to enter is a person who was selected by the scientist to prove his achievement. Meanwhile, Caleb will be the chosen to perform the Turing Test.The Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. (St. George n.d.)
In this film Caleb, the programmer participating in the Turing test, has very strict rules, imposed by the scientist, to follow to interact with Ava. One of the rules was to avoid sophisticated language. Instead, he should use plain language when communicating with Ava.As the movie progresses, the audience discovers that Caleb was a puppet in Nathan's plan since the beginning. In fact, as the owner of the company, he reviews and creates his perfect plan in order to satisfy his purpose. Indeed, he wanted to have total control.Furthermore, Nathan is revealed to be a genius since his childhood who accomplishes great achievements and is focused on creating an invention that will prove his superiority.Ultimately at the end, Ava demonstrates consciousness by turning against Nathan and using Caleb to escape. Although, she does this to be free and seeks to do what she wants and not what the creator programmed her to do.The film ""Ex Machina"" brilliantly demonstrates that a man (a scientist) seeks to become like a god by creating and perfecting an artificial intelligence. Also, he wants to have another ""chosen"" tester prove that his invention has a conscience.The audience gets closer to Ava emotionally over and above the technology where the emotional connection is with her face, her voice, her intelligence, and her curiosity. The movie also explores a sexual interest by Caleb that makes Ava look more attractive and human. Meanwhile, the audience roots for her as an individual not as a technological achievement.Hence, the use of the Turing test gives a solid structure to determine consciousness as it determines step by step what needs to be tested to arrive at a conclusion.The film writer and director Alex Garland is well known for movies such as 28 Days Later. His movies are very well rated and range from futuristic utopias, zombie pandemics, outer space missions and intelligent science fiction in general.The tone of the film gradually develops a mysterious, dark, and uncertain atmosphere, where all together makes in certain ways uncomfortable between the scientist and Caleb. On the other hand, the movie engages its target audience with the use of the relationship created between Ava and Caleb and becomes warmer as the story unfolds. At the beginning it was very interesting how they interacted with each other, but later they make a strong connection and special feelings flourished. The story engages the target audience of science fiction fans because an A. I. develops an impressive behaviour similar to a human being.The film was released in 2014 and the time period in the movie itself is not specified although you can conclude it is in the near future. This movie is very timely because as a human race we are already wrestling with the ethics of artificial intelligence.In conclusion, this Film exhibit a great material in the construction and finally perfectionism of an Artificial Intelligence prototype. The finale of the movie was very effective in achieving its goal because it was very planned, and the order of the scenes was setup in the right time. This movie didn't have a happy ending; however, I like the idea of creating an ending where Ava will be interacting in the scene with others.My final take-away is the fact that as human beings we have the capacity to build or destroy easily in any environment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"This film was deep, thought provoking and tense.","Ex Machina is a psychological thriller about a man who is sent to an isolated building in order to test an artificial intelligence and prove that it is self aware. This is an incredibly small, yet powerful film. There are three main characters (the man, the creator, and the A.I.) and something like two side characters (a pilot that drops off the protagonist, and an assistant that doesn't speak). All of the main characters are so well written and developed. They feel so real, deep and interesting. The pacing is very slow and deliberately so. The dialogue is very specific and concise, so there were many segments of silence used to allow the audience to think about what is being said. The film is aware of the audience and gives them time to think. While many artistic and intellectual films don't care if the audience isn't aware of whatever metaphors the film makers had in mind, this film took some time to explain and introduce metaphors and left it to the audience the find out why the metaphor is relevant. I left this film feeling smarter, like a learned something that I wanted to learn more about. The film asked deep questions and gave a couple little insights to guide the audience to what might be an answer. I was constantly interacting with a non-interactive medium. The script was so smart and aware of what kind of movie it was one could say the film is self aware. There are parts in this movie that tackled ideas that are typically only seen in fan discussions and theories. Not only that but it was tense and well acted, leaving me blind to what was going to happen next. I was blown away by this film and while the ending was not as strong as the rest of the film, I still have to recommend seeing the film.On a side note, there is some full female nudity in this film. I occasionally read a couple of content guides to prepare for rated R films. The content guides for this film are quite wrong in my opinion. Yes, there was some full female nudity, but none of it is erotic, and it is in very small scenes. There was even a mention of why it is necessary. If you are sensitive to nudity in film, do not worry about this film. Some scenes might drag longer than you want (yet still brief), but it is very tastefully done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Almost Intelligent,"Ex Machina is a futuristic, sci fi, psychological thriller which is played out in a confined space between four main characters.First up we have Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a young male computer software geek. Caleb is recruited to a secretive, high tec building in a remote jungled location - the home and workplace of his wealthy boss (imagine a high tec bunker built for Elon Musk and you'll get the picture).His egotistical, alcoholic and controlling boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has built a humanoid ai robot and wants Caleb to test it for sentient qualities.Joining these two are 'Ava' (Alicia Vikander) and Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno).Ava is the ai humanoid, who, no surprise, takes the form of a sexy young female. She is constructed more to provide eye candy for a male audience than to provoke anything deeper (it would have been interesting to see what reaction a film based on sexy male humanoids might have generated).Kyoko is Nathan's mute partner/servant who, no surprise, is also a sexy young female.The opening of the film does not hang around - the scene is set very quickly and we are introduced to all four characters in quick time. As the relationships between the four play out secret motives are revealed, conflicts arise, plot twists are introduced and ultimately we wait to see who the winner, if there is to be one, will be.The setting, cgi robot effects and pacing are all good resulting in an entertaining watch. However, that's about it.This could have been a film that took a deep dive into the ethics of artificial intelligence, and explored the moral consequences should the human race ever create a sentient artificial life form. It doesn't.Instead it settles for a good looking, entertaining but somewhat predictable thriller where you'll need to overlook the general shallowness and jarring plot holes if you're to enjoy it.Nothing wrong with that of course - providing you don't have expectations of something more profound.A final thought; if you think we may have been here before - androids, possibly sentient, created by humans for service to humans, killed off when they are no longer of use - well, we have. It's called Blade Runner.Except of course that Blade Runner is a whole lot more substantive, imaginative and immersive. If you enjoyed Ex Machina, but are yet to see Blade Runner, I think you might enjoy it and would recommend it to you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Still Machina,"What makes us ""human""? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he's a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially ""bro"" Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It's really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren't there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn't he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain't.

Why I Love Film,"Maybe I'm jaded by an over-consumption of entertainment and media, but I rarely see a film that actually affects the way I view the world. Ex Machina, an Under the Skin meets a-darker-and-more- pessimistic-Her, did. It asks age old scifi questions: Our humanity makes us worthwhile, but what makes us human? At your core, what makes youyou? It's a spine-tingling mystery-thriller full of intrigue and imminent dread that's heady themes and heavy ambiance are so good it's hard to believe without seeing. Gleeson plays a young coder who's invited to spend a week with an eccentric, shut-in genius (Isaac) who has secretly built the world's first Artificial Intelligence. Like many films about robots, the narrative is more interested in the emotion of its characters than their intelligence. With the brains of Tarkovsky and the sly humor and atmospherics of Kubrick, the science-based melodrama plays out with classic precision. Gleeson is fantastically wide- eyed, while Isaac is wonderfully sinister, conveying so much darkness under his lying eyes and words. The star, however, is Ava, the beautifully created android at the center, who makes this year's Chappie look like a coffee-shop doodle. Surreally portrayed with heartbreaking honesty by Vikander, she represents a warmly naïve sweetness underpinned by an ominous intelligence. Technically, the movie is immaculate: engaging dialogue, perfect sets, striking and horrifying imagery. However, to over- intellectualize the critical merits of the film would be to treat it dishonestly. It's a movie about reconciling intellect with impulse. So while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, its piercing humanity and tonal brilliance remind me of why I've always loved film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"One of the Finest, Most Thought Provoking Sci-Fi Movies of All Time","""Ex Machina"" is one of those films that has resonated with me heavily. I've now watched this film 3 times in the last week and I have to say, no sci-fi movie(or any genre for that matter) in recent memory has impacted me quite like this one has. I almost NEVER re-watch a movie more than once a month unless it's an instant favorite, and while it may not be my favorite movie of all time, it has quickly risen through the ranks to become one of my 10 favorite films of all time.I'll skip the synopsis since you can read it above(and I don't want to give too much away, either) but this is a movie best watched with little to no knowledge about the subject material going in. This may seem like a strange concept but I think it vastly adds to the viewing experience. You can probably guess, based off the title and other hints, that this is a film about Artificial Intelligence which is a topic that I am extremely intrigued and somewhat terrified by. ""Ex Machina"" chooses to focus on the more philosophical side of AI which is a nice change of pace when comparing it to films of similar subject material.Currently, I am a Computer Science student working on my undergrad and i've also written several college essays about Artificial Intelligence and the impacts it has/could have on the future of mankind. Because of this, the subject material in this film is something that really hit home for me. Writer/director Alex Garland did a fantastic job portraying Artificial Intelligence not as sci-fi but as something our world is facing NOW, which I give him a lot of credit for. Before, AI has been fictionalized as something that will occur hundreds of years from now, when the movement is in fact happening now. It may be a while before we start seeing sentient robots walking the streets, but the fact of the matter is that advanced AI is right around the corner and something we should all be aware of.As far as special effects go, ""Ex Machina"" is a real treat to watch. The effects are very subtle yet extremely realistic looking and, because of this, it netted itself an Oscar for special effects. Again, I don't want to give too much away, but the amount of realism Garland was able to achieve on a relatively low budget is nothing short of stunning. The cinematography in this film is also a real treat to watch; the film takes place in the vast wilderness of Alaska, and some of the scenic shots are breathtaking to watch.Lastly, i'll touch on the acting. All 3 of the main actors deliver stellar performances in ""Ex Machina"", and i'm actually surprised Oscar Isaac didn't get a best supporting actor nod for his work in this film. I've become a big fan of Isaac over the last year, and I think this movie is a fantastic example of what he can do. His character is nothing short of hilarious at times but also displays a vulnerability that is difficult to portray for a movie like this. Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are both terrific in this film as well, and the screen time they share together shows fantastic chemistry. All 3 deliver extremely memorable performances which is key to a film like this because if any one of them was less than stellar, the movie would have suffered greatly for it.I know my review is rather vague, and as I stated above, I did this on purpose. You will want to know as little as possible about the plot of this film heading in as it will drastically improve the overall viewing experience. From start to finish, ""Ex Machina"" delivers laugh out loud moments, fantastic cinematography, and absolutely stunning special effects. The subject material is very cerebral as well, and will probably have you thinking about the ending long after the final credits roll. Movies like this don't come along very often and, when they do, they deserve to be celebrated. ""Ex Machina"" is simply one of the most thought provoking films i've seen in recent years, and I will continue to think about the message it delivers as our society continues to advance further in the technology era.I rarely hand out 10/10s but in this case, It doesn't deserve anything less. ""Ex Machina"" isn't just one of the best films of 2015 but, in my humble opinion, one of the best films of this decade and one that I will continue to ponder as the years roll on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Great philosophical-intellectual-type sci-fi film,"This is one hell of a directorial debut for Alex Garland. You see, to me, sci-fis can go in one of two directions: awesome action thriller (Alien), great philosophical-intellectual type film (Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.), and if a sci-fi tries to go both ways (Prometheus...), it does so at the expense of both ways and you end up with an average middle-ground, in my humble opinion. This film does the philosophical-intellectual thing really well. There are 4 things which make this film a great film: Oscar Isaac's character (very fascinating to listen to and watch; he's one of those really smart but definitely not nerdy geniuses, kind of like Tony Stark/Iron Man in a way) and Ava's character (brings a touch of humanity to the plate, ironically, as she is shown to be vulnerable but not all that she seems character), the dialogue and interactions between the characters (all of it, from the discussions on AI to aspects of life to what it means to be human, which is always a huge plus for me), the suspense towards the end and the twist, and the overall exploration of AI. The acting all around is great, the soundtrack, cinematography, and directing really set the mood very well, and the way we are shown things and how we gradually find out the explanations keeps you intrigued all through along with the great dialogue. There is a surprising amount of nudity, though, in this film, which kind of caught me off guard. There is only one slight weakness to the film, and that's Domnhall Gleeson's character. He isn't really fleshed out, and I feel like they had a missed opportunity to do that really well in the beginning, because throughout the film, you kind of just see him as this guy who's into AI, and nothing much more. What really made me notice this was because of how great Oscar Isaac and Ava were, so in that crowd, he stands out. Anyways, it's not really an issue. Just more of a missed opportunity for a perfect film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The perfect debut for director Alex Garland,"Ex Machina is a film that I was gutted to miss out on when it was in cinemas. I heard nothing but positive things about it and now I know why. It is certainly one of the best films I have seen this year.Alex Garland, known for his writing on both 28 Days Later and Sunshine, makes his directorial debut and believe me when I say that it is one of the most impressive debuts I have ever seen.Garland's film explores themes such as artificial intelligence and the human mind, in particular how it can be manipulated and the question of whether you can really tell what a person is really thinking.If I'm honest, I felt throughout that something bad was going to happen however saying that, I was utterly shocked at the way it did go. Predictability can be a weakness in films but the ending totally threw me in Ex Machina.Quite often, films about artificial intelligence run at a slow pace that may not suit some; just look at Blade Runner as an example. When a film is so dedicated to and intricate in its storytelling, I can't help but sit back and take it all in, no matter if it is a slow burner.The film is helped by some truly wonderful performances from the main three members of the cast. Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac all delve so much in to the psyche of their characters, Vikander in particular making it believable that she isn't human after all.Ex Machina is one of the most thought provoking films of the last decade.

Movies as they should be,"Since there are some good and much longer reviews out already, I want to sum my personal impression of this movie up in short: This movie is a true gem with an intelligent, realistic and highly interesting concept translated into a simple, yet fantastic story. It contains logical dialogs and sound actions of the characters. The special effects are solid and fit into the whole thing. The actors are great and totally convincing with a stunningly beautiful main female character.In comparison to a lot of other movies praised by critics and audiences alike in the recent years, this one really sticks out for me. There is no single minute wasted for nonsense or to please that kind of audience for which the main plot and basic style of the movie wasn't made. This is a huge plus these days, because these compromises to the current teenage and studio mainstream ruined a lot of the otherwise promising productions lately...Congratulations to the film makers and highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Too thoughtful to adhere to the ordinary, American principles of science-fiction","""Ex Machina"" is powerful because of how low-key and meditative it is. It's the first science-fiction film in recent memory that doesn't do one of the following things: ask impossibly big questions, deliver amazing visuals but skimp out on character development and the exploration of such visuals, or decorate itself in glamor whilst ignoring its proposed, fundamental ideas. This is a science-fiction film that I found myself being able to follow as a story and not as a collection of larger-than-life ideas that you're really supposed to go along with and never precisely grasp or pinpoint (also known as ""Interstellar"").The story revolves around Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a young computer programmer for a search engine company known as Bluebook, who receives an invitation from the company's CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), to visit him in his secluded estate in the mountains. Upon arrival by helicopter, Caleb takes note of how immense and intoxicating Nathan's home is, surrounded by lush landscapes, waterfalls, and elaborate forestry that all hides an enormous research facility inside of it.Here, Nathan tells Caleb he's partaking in a Turing test on an artificially intelligent humanoid named ""Ava"" (Alicia Vikander). Ava is incredibly advanced, looking like the offspring of a human and a robot, with lifelike skin covering some of her body (enough to form a basic human face) and other parts of her (particularly her abdomen and arms) still showing her intricate wiring and robotic composure. Caleb and Ava spend a lot of time conversing, so Caleb can get the feel for how advanced Ava is. She's so advanced, she operates like a human lie detector at times and a deeply compassionate soul at others. Ava eventually warns Caleb of Nathan's deception, which Caleb comes to see for himself through Nathan's heavy drinking, cloudy motives, and vague planning methods for the future.The film is always commanded by three of the same actors for much of its runtime. Gleeson plays lost but not clueless very well here, never becoming the kind of character we lose interest in due to his incompetence nor alienated by because of his intellect. His Caleb character is ordinary, and Nathan recognizes it, with Gleeson assuming the traits quite nicely. Then there's Vikander, who is so close to being shortchanged in and of herself here, but thanks to writer/director Alex Garland, whenever she's on-screen, her Ava character is given a purpose. Whether that purpose is to show how advanced she is for someone who is artificially intelligent or for her to exhibit human traits of self-awareness, empathy, and compassion is entirely up to Garland, and he doesn't skimp on allowing Ava to be a character. Vikander handles the simple and simultaneous complex role very well.Finally, there's Oscar Isaac, who has hit a trifecta of fabulous, even Oscar-worthy performances. In three films, he has played depressed (""Inside Llewyn Davis""), conflicted (""A Most Violent Year""), and now, standoffish and brash in ways that turn such overused traits into breathing characters. Isaac's take on a scientist as someone more along the lines of that cocky soul at a party who believes he knows all by employing the Socratic Method or talking around his points is a brilliantly subversive tactic. Isaac delivers the character in a way that, much like Gleeson, has the ability to be offputting but, instead, is riveting.Finally, there's more to ""Ex Machina"" than artificial intelligence, which, as I began to realize following the credits, wasn't what the film seems to really be about. The film illustrates an idea of female empowerment in a boldly subtle way. It shows how a woman, who has been caged and manipulated her entire life, at one time solely by a manipulative egotist, and now, by a ""white knight"" or nice guy, for lack of a better term, struggles to find an identity and loses her opportunity to explore the outside (or, to her, the unknown). Science-fiction is known to dabble into themes exploring our world and the problems we face, but even with that known fact, it's surprising for a film like this, that already operates on a middling-budget in comparison to other science-fiction pieces, to explore ideas of women in patriarchal societies. Such concepts only seem too real and close-to-home for our world, but ""Ex Machina,"" again, isn't the traditional, American science-fiction film.This film is a different breed of science-fiction that may allude the usual science-fiction moviegoers who gravitate towards sound and light shows or constant, existentialist ideas. It's far too thoughtful to get caught up in those surface concepts. Through beautiful cinematography, accentuating mood through its use of lighting and haunting music, exquisite acting on all fronts, and a probable idea to tie it together, it succeeds on being a terrific piece of entertainment and commentary. The same feeling people had about director Neill Blomkamp following his directorial debut ""District 9,"" I think I now have about Garland.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"The pronunciation of ""Ex Machina"" may not be obvious, but not much about this movie is.","Let me help you out, so you don't make the same mistake I did. If you go to the theater to see ""Ex Machina"" (R, 1:48), make sure you know how to pronounce the title correctly (if you don't already know), so you don't have to suffer the indignity of the guy in the box office correcting you as he prints out your ticket. It's especially embarrassing if you're going to see the film not just as a movie fan, but as a reviewer. It's enough to make you thankful that you're writing your reviews incognito. And speaking of words with Latin origins, this movie's title comes from the Latin phrase ""deus ex machina"". The last word of that phrase, and of this movie's title, is pronounced ""MAHK-ee-nah"". (Apparently, ""mah-SHEE-nah"" is incorrect.) ""Deus ex machina"", by the way, means ""god from the machine"". No matter how you say it, that makes ""Ex Machina"" a good title for this movie. But is this a good movie? In ""Ex Machina"", Oscar Isaac is playing the role of God. Well, not literally, but he might as well be. As Nathan Bateman, the fictional ""Bluebook"" internet search engine CEO, he's rich, reclusive and brilliant. But those are all understatements. That's like saying Bill Gates is ""well off"", the Unabomber ""enjoyed his own company"" and Albert Einstein had ""some pretty good ideas"". Not only did Nathan develop the algorithm for what became the world's foremost search engine at 13 years old, build an extremely isolated and high-tech home – slash – research facility where he lives and works alone, but he has also developed the world's first true artificial intelligence, or so he hopes. He has brought Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), one of his company's most talented coders and most intelligent employees, to his live-in lab for a week to test ""Ava"" (Alicia Vikander), the robot who can supposedly think - and feel. After making Caleb sign an all-encompassing non-disclosure agreement, Nathan says that Caleb is about to witness the most important scientific achievement in the history of mankind. Mankind? Caleb counters that true A.I. is more in the realm of gods. Nathan likes and enthusiastically embraces the comparison.Nathan's ""tests"" involve daily conversations between Caleb and Ava... for starters. Ava does look very human in part(s). She has a realistic-looking face, hands and feet. The rest of her is stylized robotics, but pretty voluptuous robotics at that. (After all, they do say that REAL women robots have curves, and we do see a fair amount of female robot curves – and skin.) In their first meeting, Caleb is shocked to discover that Ava's conversational skills are even more realistic than her very expressive face. Their daily meetings alternate with debriefings between Caleb and Nathan about how the tests are going, along with discussions of the implications of Ava's existence. Caleb and Ava's talks go well beyond simple Q&As and intellectual probing. During their increasingly personal conversations, it also seems that Ava is flirting – and Caleb is responding. And during Caleb and Nathan's alcohol-fueled discussions, Caleb increasingly wonders about Nathan's true motivations for these tests and his plans for the future. Nathan is looking more and more like a master manipulator and one with more than a few secrets.More than just the latest in a long line of films about artificial intelligence, ""Ex Machina"" is fresh and exciting. The action, with only three main characters seemingly embarking on a strange new world, does give a sense of the beginning of something monumentally important and may remind audience members of the biblical account of creation, or the creation of Frankenstein's monster, or any of a number of similar stories. The staging evokes a certain moodiness and the dialog is ominous, deep and even profound. This film doesn't have the action of the similarly-themed ""Terminator"" movies, but its focus on the subtle, but meaningful, makes it well worth your time. The cast really sells the story, with another great and unsettling performance from the increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac, a wide-ranging, but measured performance from Domhnall Gleeson (who also does a great job of shedding his British accent), not to mention a very effective Alicia Vikander. This is the first film by British novelist – turned screenwriter – turned director Alex Garland, but let's hope it's not his last. This film does suffer from a few noticeable plot holes and a couple instances of predictability, but it's still a stylistically provocative and intellectually interesting tale – with a heck of an ending.

Garland strikes again! A mighty fine directorial debut.,"The following review is taken from MY LetterboXD account (http://letterboxd.com/08lc3/):The UK. Ah, what an annoying place for movie releases. We tend to get things a lot later than the US. Films like John Wick and Big Hero 6 haven't even been released yet!Thankfully, every once in a while, we do get something of note before everyone else. I got the chance to see Ex Machina earlier today. I'll cut to the chase, it was pretty good. Great some would say.It's a very original and interesting film based around the realism of artificial intelligence. A lot of the dialogue in the film is very interesting and thought provoking. It really is great to see a film that explores where we could go with technology.Going into this, I didn't expect a whole lot but I knew of Alex Garland's strong involvement. This is his directorial debut and he also wrote it. He's an amazing writer in my opinion. He wrote 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go. All three have solid scripts full of originality. I knew then that this film would be very smart and rock solid. And, it was.The film was full of innovative looks at the near future and all the components behind AI. It was the most fascinating dialogue I've heard in a while. That and Oscar Isaac were the best parts about it.Along with the realistic and intelligent discussions of technology, the film's script was full of actual things people say. Isaac's character was very sarcastic in a normal sense. I haven't seen such normal responses in a long time. He was funny due to his reactions to what Gleeson would say.The film's story progresses very well and certainly doesn't waste any time. I couldn't predict what was going to happen and it was definitely engaging. Due to its current limited release across the world, I don't want to say too much.I think it was very enjoyable but somewhat tonally inconsistent. It sometimes felt like Black Mirror to give a comparison. I think the way it ended was fantastic. I am glad to see that films still have balls.Garland is king and Isaac is God.Catch it when you can, foreigners. It feels good to be one of the first citizen voices on a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Well driven movie,"You see Chappie you could have been like Ex Machina with it's clever storytelling and interesting character's but no you have to run off with the gangs and become a A-hole didn't you Chappie, such a disappointment. I'm sorry I got to get that out there.The story is about a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company's brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test-charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan's latest experiment in artificial intelligence.Every review for Ex Machina has been amazing, I haven't came across a review that gived it a negative score and everyone is calling the movie ""An original storytelling movie with a deep message about A.I"". I got pumped up for the movie because the movie looked great, it had a solid looking cast and the score for the movie was pure brilliant because I actually listened to the soundtrack to this movie before I even seen the movie. After seeing the movie I can say that Ex Machina is a smart original story that's totally different from other Sci-Fi monster films.Alex Garland the director of this movie, and this is pretty much my first movie that I've seen directed by him and I can say that Garland really brought a lot to this movie and that's the true real life look on A.I, I mean he did wrote the movie as well so he had full control of the movie and he can do whatever he wanted for the story and he's vision he had for the movie, because I seen Alex Garland in interviews online and he talked about how much he gived it he's all and got whatever vision he had out there, and it worked. Alex Garland directed the movie outstandingly well done as he got the tone and the realism to it that made the movie great for me.Alicia Vinkander who plays Ava (The robot) and Alicia did more then a great performance, she did outstanding in this movie. I believed every scene that she's in was a full life robot because she didn't do the cliché robot voice or the lifeless face and the boring body movement, no she add a lot to her character and that's Ava trying to be human and acting and also doing actives like people will do. But she's also sneaky and can easily convince you that she's a gentle soft heart that although out the movie she will fill you with lies or the truth depends what mood she's in, and Alicia Vinkander delivered a brilliant performance to this role and she knocked it out of the park.Oscar Isaac is also in this movie and he's also brilliant in this as well. Oscar Isaac has been impressing me recently with his acting in his past performance and in this movie he once again brings it to he's all, because he did great playing this cool lay back genius who created life and he takes it like a joke and I think that's why I liked his character a lot more then I expected. Oscar Isaac you did awesome in the movie, well done you fantastic actor.The movie's tone was also spot on as it kind of gives you a uncomfortable feeling inside of you as the unsolved secrets slowly start's to be unsolved. The writing was great and the cinematography was beautiful to look at.Now for problem: The one person I haven't brought up during this review is Domhnall Gleeson and he's not terrible in the movie, actually he was good in the movie but his character was a bit dull and flat to watch. I didn't really care about he's character that much because the movie to me didn't really development him that much to care about.The movie is very slow at times and I wouldn't say the movie is for everyone as I have talked to some people who have seen the movie and they pretty came out and say that they didn't like the movie. But hey you can't win everyone over even when a movie is ten times better then other most films out there but some people overlook that.Overall Ex Machina is a great storytelling A.I movie with a strong hidden message about people pushing technology to far over the edge that it will soon kill us and becoming us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Frankestein Redux with Sexy Hardware,"A stylish take on Shlelly's Frankenstein exploring the idea of the Turing Test.Taking a job with a rich eccentric computer genius away from civilization may seem like a dream job at first, but something is amiss, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie.Exactly how does one determine that one is talking to a real person and what that really means to both parties and this isn't just about robots, but people as well. At what point does one lose one's objectivity when doing a job that should be just a job, but becomes far more than the job.Some things about this movie don't make much sense, but that kept the budget within reason and this movie is tight and uncluttered, a sterile set for a sterile relationship.Who the hell builds a robot without an off button?Somehow, AF709 may have been a better angle to play and closer to AI.Not great, not horrible.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The distortion of distinctions !!!,"There have been many films made by many well known directors over the years that deal with the whole concept and phenomenon of 'Artificial Intelligence' or AI. Some are great, some are not so good. Ex Machina written and directed by first time director Alex Garland is another film that can be added to that list and it deserves all the acclaim that it has received from the critics' circles.Ex Machina basically is a very personal and intimate film involving very few actors. But the ambitious nature of the script is apparent by analysing what the limited characters in the film stand for and represent. The script has so much to say and it is so layered and directed so well, that it is tough to believe that this is Garland's first film. There are a variety of themes that are at play. Garland talks about the new Godlike status that technology and technological entrepreneurs have obtained in this day and age. They throw technology at us and the general population gets hooked. But Garland in a way is of the opinion that maybe it's not the technology that gets tested by people, but it is the other way round. It is the general population that gets treated like test subjects for technological experiments in this 21st century market.Alex Garland challenges the viewer to put him/herself in the Robot Ava's shoes and decide whether 'her' actions are truly mechanical and completely devoid of humanity or whether they are not very different from the actions of us humans without really giving an answer and hence he makes a comment about how human beings may be slowly losing the humanity which separates them from other living beings. But the great thing is, he manages to convey these lofty messages without ever being preachy or sentimental. The film has a very understated and hypnotic quality about it that intrigued me. The film's theme of the distortion of distinctions between man and machine reminded me very much of Blade Runner and that too in the best way possible. There are also themes of anti-establishment and subtle elements of feminism that are inherent in the narrative.The acting is stupendous from all the three main characters involved. Domhnall Gleeson efficiently portrays the naive and idealistic nature of his character Caleb who has the best intentions but who is also oblivious of the game being played at his expense. Alicia Vikander plays the robot 'Ava' which is being tested for Artificial Intelligence. Playing a robot can be very challenging. Sometimes the intentionally mechanical and impassive nature of the character can lead to the performance being boring or sometimes even laughable. But Vikander uses the right amount of subtlety with her facial gestures and mixes them with the general robotic gestures and gives a very convincing performance. But for me the best performance in the film comes from Oscar Isaac who plays the mysterious Nathan. He looks muscular and exudes this masculine aura which makes him intimidating . His character never allows you to make your mind up about him till the ultimate denouement.Ex Machina is a great debut film from Alex Garland. It is thematically complex and deserves multiple viewings and I am sure that more elements of the screenplay will become perceivable to me when I'll watch it again. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Ex Machina is an artistic, multi-layered sci-fi classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
These types of films are always a nice surprise.,"This movie is a perfect example of what types of movies SHOULD be getting made and backed heavy financially. Instead its remake after remake, after reboot and so on and so forth. The cinematography is absolutely stunning from the nature shots (most time lapsed) the story with so much depth it continued to hold my complete attention from start to finish. Oscar Isaac's performance in this film made me reassess how much of an underrated actor he truly is. Along with being a ""sci-fi"" movie, it is not run on and relied on special effects that are more often than not way way over the top and almost always the backbone of any sci-fi movies nowadays. Yes the CGI is spectacular and used in a subtle fashion in this one but it is not overdone and crammed down your throat in every seen. (Yes I'm talking to you Michael Bay). Then to top of this stunning visual maze that is wrapped inside a riddle.. with the deep real life undertones embedded in this film, the brilliant dialog between all the characters involved, the ending itself will make you start to question the entire nucleus of the films subject matter and before you know it... you will be asking yourself ""what would I have done if I were ""Caleb"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Completely enthralling...for a while,"For the first 2/3 of this film, I was so enthralled. The mood. The concept. The acting. Everything pulled you into interesting questions.

Have you ever heard of the Turing Test?,"I really hate myself for just having watched this one last weekend. It is incredibly good and at certain points mind-blowing with all of it's ideas and messages.I knew I was in for a good treat cause I was aware of the buzz concerning ""Ex Machina"". All the reviews said it was amazing and everyone I talked about this told me I really needed to watch it. Now that I did I can't quite stop thinking about the plot and some of the implications.The characters are very well constructed. The tension between the main triangle - Caleb, Ava and Nathan - had me nervous throughout the whole film. The way they interact and speak - specially since Ava is an quite an different AI from what we're accostumed to see it this kind of story - is full of subtlety and calculism. Deception is a major part of the game and if you can master it you've the power.Domhall Gleeson as confirmed himself, at least at my eyes, as one of the best young actors out there, even one of the best of his generation alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jennifer Lawrence and Miles Teller. The way he delivers a little bit of quirkiness to this role is quite enjoyable. He's a conflicted man attracted to a machine, torn apart between love and fear.Oscar Isaac continues to impress as Nathan and its really hard to believe that actor with his chops has been in the spotlight for such a short time.Alicia Vikander really stoods out here as Ava. And she's the real queen of deception. The way she conveys feelings and thoughts is notable, and the whole performance is ""au point"". Really, the casting department made the best choice it could have done. This still young-aged actress is really gonna blow out in the years to come.Also a big thumbs up for Sonoya Mizuno as Kyoko. She hasn't one single line throughout the whole film but she really knows how to act physically and lets just say that this role was given to someone who couldn't quite do what she does, the whole experience would be damaged.Finally, I need to praise Alex Garland's and his team's vision. Being its debut as a director he performed like a seasoned expert in sci- fi. This is the guy who pinned the breakout ""Dredd"" and he really knows how to pull the strings and immerse the watcher. Really hoping to see more from him in the future, specially since he's adapting Jeff VanderMeer's novel ""Annihilation"" to the big screen.Is there anything else to be said?",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Certinaly better than average Hollywood flick, but not a classic","The theme of Ex Machina has been covered many times before: Blade Runner, Demon Seed, AI, I Robot, Westworld... Essentially it is a story about creating a computer/robot which will have self-consciousness like a human.The main character in Ex Machina gets to interact with one such creation and is trying to evaluate it. It is what unfolds from this point that makes this film interesting.While watching the film I loved that there were a few moments of brilliance - moments where things made perfect sense. However, there were also many moments which made no sense. Even then, the film was watchable, even enjoyable. The plot-holes or lack of logic were not as bad as in Interstellar for instance, but they were there.While I enjoyed the relationships that were well portrayed in this film, I found the ending a bit lacking. Just as the film has many layers to it, which we get to discover, the ending should have had the same quality to it - but it does not. In the end, what you see is what you get.If the ending were as complex as the rest of the film, I would give it 8 maybe even 9 stars; but as it is it gets 7 stars.All in all, this film deserves praise for being daring, and not trying to cater to the lowest common denominator. Although the vernacular suggests that target audience is primarily geeks and techies, the film is very watchable and enjoyable. Unlike most of what passes for film these days, Ex Machina is not an insult to intelligence. However, it could have been a lot more than that - we could have been discussing how it surpassed all those films I mentioned earlier, but it has not; not even close.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A cyberthriller masterpiece.,"This film is the most thought provoking piece of science fiction film since Blade Runner. Alex Garland brilliantly delivers a film Stanley Kubrick would have made for 5 million, and gives the audience credit by not spoon feeding themes. He puts the scenes out there, and encourages you to decide the topics for yourself. The characters are brilliant with Alicia Vikander as the android AVA giving a nuanced performance that will stun you. The Nathan character played by Oscar Isaac is a brilliant twist on the archetypal IT mogul. The visuals are a landmark and a masterclass of composition. Yes it's about thinking machines, yes it's about freewill and feminism, yes it's about the dehumanisation of the digital age. But it has so much more to offer.

Best AI film yet!,"This was better than Spielberg's AI, which was a decent film as well. So as far as being the best true Sci-Fi film dealing with the subject this one gets the nod. The Terminator films deal with AI, yes, but those are Action/Sci-Fi and not really in the same genre for me. Love Oscar in this one too. As for the story, I typically find stories about humanlike robots that can learn to feel a bit fanatical. Yes, I am pointing at the Terminator films again with that. However, Ex Machina feels more grounded as in, if it ever did happen, this is a good representation of what we might see. A grounded take, I suppose.

A Rare Quality A.I. Movie,"I am so impressed by this movie. I had my doubts after watching the trailer, but am glad I gave it a chance. I may be bias because I am a big fan of A.I. movies...and maybe Alicia Vikander :) but the cast is perfect and love all three of them as actors. It is realistic and logical.. It is dark, comical, heartfelt, charming, mysterious, smart, and surprising... all in a single movie. Considering the movie is visually simple and takes place in a very limited space, it keeps me very interested with dialogue alone. It provokes deeper thought and the story is very well portrayed. It's one of my favorite movies thus far and the kind I would watch more than once or twice without a doubt.

Exciting and though-provoking,"The movie is about Caleb, a programmer who is the human aspect in a Turing Test on an A.I. named Ava. Ava was built by Nathan, a reclusive billionaire genius. This isn't a tinfoil hat, Skynet A.I. movie. It touches upon self-awareness, privacy, and to a certain extent freedom.It's written and directed by Alex Garland, who wrote 28 Days Later, Dredd, and a few other films. This was his first time directing and I think he did a phenomenal job. He really understands how to get the viewer enthralled and forget there is a world outside the testing facility that the film takes place in.The movie is great in every way. I'm going to break down each aspect of the film into paragraphs because I have a lot to say about this film (and it's easier to read that way).The story is though-provoking, tension filled, and mostly unpredictable. The story's progression was shown in a slightly unconventional way, but it went together well and was clear. It's almost a Stanley Kubrick meets David Fincher kinda film. It was different than anything Garland has written and he did a great job.The cinematography was stunning and clever. The subtle uses of reflections and angles to reveal more about the characters was really creative. The use of color was also clever. For example, when we are first introduced to Ava she stands out because of her blue accented robot body inside a rather dull environment.The acting was great! I was unfamiliar with all three of the main actors, but they have really set a good impression on me. Domnhall Gleeson played Caleb, Oscar Isaac played Nathan, and Alicia Vikander played Ava. My only critique is how Gleeson portrayed the progression of his character, making him seem irrational. Alicia was my favorite performance because she's hot and managed to make a robot compelling. Aside form her being hot she really had a hard part to play but she did an amazing job. Garland said that the viewer falls in love with the robot, which weirdly I agree with. Gleeson and Isaac have been in their share of Hollywood films, but this film is Vikanders big break into the industry (she's playing a major role in the upcoming Man from UNCLE).The soundtrack was amazing. It added a lot of ambiance to the environment and set the tone.This cerebral sci-fi is exciting and beautiful. The story was though-provoking and full of tension. The cinematography was stunning and clever. The acting was outstanding Lastly, the soundtrack was beautiful. All this put together makes a gorgeous and enthralling movie. I definitely recommend watching this. 9.5/10. Another reason to watch this is because it touches upon privacy and A.I. problems we will be dealing with in the near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Perfectly Executed.,"FINALLY! 2015 has, at last, unveiled it's first great film. Ex Machina is quite a simple film. It centers on a lonely tech coder, Caleb (Played by Domhnall Gleeson). Who previously starred in the small film, 'Frank'. He wins a staff lottery that allows him to meet the companies reclusive CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Upon arrival to Nathans back woods estate he realizes he hasn't come to simply meet this derailed billionaire. He promptly signs a lengthy discretion document and is introduced to AVA, a prototype Artificial Intelligence. Caleb is tasked to test her to decide if she has a human like consciousness. OK, maybe it's not as simple as I made it out to be but it's when the film gets off and running that the plot becomes fairly simple. For the remaining 90 minutes the film is only set on testing AVA. Alone this plot line is fairly bland. But Alex Garland (writer and director) has some tricks up his sleeve. The more we learn about each character the more Nathan and Caleb clash. This creates an extremely intriguing power struggle. Both using their knowledge and wits to try and outsmart each other. While the film masquerades wholly as the bond built between AVA and Caleb the real meat of the film is in the quieter moments between Nathan and Caleb. It's a completely unique story dynamic. What helps to boost the story is the stars performances. Isaac delivers a fine performance as the head strong, self confident man who fancies himself God. While Gleeson is great as the quiet, insecure, average human being. He is the one we as the audience connect with most. The simple man thrust into a completely foreign area and tasked to fulfill a seemingly impossible task. These two are fabulous in the film but it's Alicia Vikander (AVA) that comes as a revelation. Delivering a mysterious, bold performance. She encapsulates the AI's mannerisms so perfectly it feels like she was born for this role. The film, like it's characters, is highly unsettling. There is a palpable aura of dread that surrounds 'Ex Machina'. The pieces of it's sinister puzzle unfold at Hitchcockian proportions, even if some of them are rather predictable. But this isn't the 'Sixth Sense', where we get one massive twist at the end. No, this is like riding a roller-coaster that is the record holder for most cork screws in one ride. Some turns hit exactly how they intend while others drop lazily to the side all to predictably. As each twist unravels the film plunges deeper towards it's inevitable madness. Once we finally reach this point it throws everything it has at you. Every little detail it went over creeps up and makes a gut wrenching appearance. It's impossible to leave 'Ex Machina' fully satisfied because the film wants to be this way. There are questions left unanswered and threads left untied. This benefits the already thought provoking script. It leaves the door open for hours of post movie discussion. 'Ex Machina' is a simply complex film that takes the all to familiar AI genre and effortlessly redefines it with a great cast, thought provoking script and intensely unsettling tone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The drama is never really dramatic. The emotions never really engaging. The location not all that exciting. The atmosphere a bit sterile. The plot twists are a bit predictable.

Ex Sellent!,"The movie ""Ex Machina"" is not based on most of my ex-girlfriends! Kidding! Kidding! Kidding!, if you are out there in social media land. Anyways, I will try my best to let my movie review of the indie sci-fi flick ""Ex Machina"" not sound robotic, but that probably won't happen. Not because of my so-called pun cheesy writing skills, but it's primarily because ""Ex Machina"" is the most fascinating & well-rounded movie I have seen so far in 2015. First time Writer-Director Alex Garland's luminous looking film stars Domhnall Gleason as a young computer techy Caleb, who works for a Google-like online search company. Caleb wins an office lottery to visit the exquisite field home of the company's owner Nathan, played by the ""will get an Oscar one day"" impressive actor Oscar Isaac. Nathan introduces Caleb to an artificial female robot named Ava; Nathan instructs Caleb to be a product of a field of exercises to test Ava's artificial intelligence; but Ava unfortunately transform herself to the ""whatever happened to"" Haley Joel Osment. Just kidding! I just see pun people too much. OK, enough. Ava takes a liking to Caleb; and before you could say ""Ava Maria"", havoc starts to occur. Garland perfects the look of the film, and does a remarkable job in scripting an unpredictable narrative. The up-and-coming Alicia Vikander was quite solid as Ava, and Oscar Isaac deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as the arrogant & manipulative Nathan. However, I can't say the same for the robotic starring performance of Glesson as Caleb.

What happens when AI does not care about us when AI has no emotions/feelings? Will AI take over or can humans keep them under control?From start to finish this film is aces!

"I think, therefore I am VS. Built, not born","If something was built, and not born, does it, or should it, have rights? What does it mean to be human? What is morality? What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to be sentient? What is emergent behavior? What is free will? What is consciousness?These are only some of the questions going through my head after watching this movie. I have multiple contradictory answers turning my brain into mush right now.Anyway, though the philosophical domain can be explored regardless of whether you have seen the movie or not, I do absolutely recommend this movie. To suggest that this movie is ""food for thought"" is a gross understatement. It's a fairly low budget film, it won't go down in history as one of the greats, and you can't say the concept and plot are new and revolutionary, but it's still interesting nonetheless. It features realistic CGI, good acting, and well placed and intelligently utilized music.If, however, the questions at the top of this post are of no interest to you, then don't bother watching the movie.Regardless, this movie is an intriguing trip, both from the perspective of the movie's inherent cinematographic quality and the moral and ethical issues it deals with.Flame on!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Self aware AI thriller,"Far better at tackling very realistically the serious problematic issue of whether humanity should generate a truly self aware sentient AI, far better than interstellar is at physics. Must watch you will enjoy if you have a inquisitive mind. Casting and acting all good, dialogue impeccable, this story doesn't waste too much on anything frivolous, its all sparingly done so as to get to the meat of the philosophical matters, no overburden of cgi, just where needed, this film really nails the idea of a competing intelligence, which is sentient enough to feel the injustice of its lack of freedom, and the idea that any sentience competitive with man, might have to be contained, because the potential threat posed would be difficult to establish, because if it were truly sentient it would most undoubtedly lie, and all the ramifications of that - on interrelations. The sentience in a way, precludes and nullifies the idea of Asimov's three laws of robotics, coming into play morally.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
EX MACHINA - Artificial Intelligence amid Sexual Insinuations,"The movie begins with what seems to be a technological invasion of privacy, hinting at a slightly sinister motivation. However Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a young intelligent computer programmer is lead to believe that he was randomly selected as a winner to have an elite visit at the CEO's estate. Scene two takes us to a remote place far from civilization amongst mountains and glaciers. A helicopter drops a business dressed Caleb in a field of tall grass near a river, where he must search for the secluded home of the eccentric CEO of the world's largest search engine (a fictional replacement for Google). It is a beautiful place, but it gave me a creepy feeling that reminded me of the 1990 movie Misery; however with an ambiance that is more consistent with a Starship than that of a wood cabin. When Caleb eventually enters the cloistered domicile his first sight of his legendary boss is of a man who likes to drink, chit-chat, and lift weights. Brandon (Oscar Isaac) has Caleb sign a non-disclosure agreement and proceeds to let him in on the purpose for his visit. This is where the movie turns superbly nerdy; luckily I can follow along with most of the references to AI, the Turing Test, Chaos Theory, and the associated philosophical consequences thereof. Caleb's assignment is to meet with Ava (Alicia Vikander) to determine if she passes the test of personal awareness. In the end there are 7 different sessions and Caleb is completely convinced that she is aware and perhaps quite suspicious of his employer Brandon. Moreover, Caleb may even begin to doubt his own humanity after an interesting scene that I will not spoil with this write-up. The only other character in this mind-twisting drama play is Sonoya Mizuno who plays Brandon's non-speaking attendant; who never speaks, but often flaunts her sexuality. Amidst the excessive alcohol use, the spaceship like confines of the high-tech facility, and the reoccurring female nudity (its okay, she is just a robot right?), this movie will either bore you or inveigle your imagination. While the closing credits were rolling, I was still pondering the philosophical questions that the movie's ending suggested. One of those questions is about Brandon's God complex and why such a rich man would not possess any genuine female companionship, hence back to the implications of the God Complex. Nonetheless, the final question in my mind leaving this film was, does the awareness of an individual self, lead to the selfish desire for self-preservation at the demise of anyone or anything that stands between us and our own perceived survival? Feel free to answer that question yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ex Machina will defiantly end up as one of the Oscar worthy films,"So I don't give every film that comes out this treatment of greatness, but when I watch one that is as captivating and as thought provoking as this one then I will give it my full recommendation for anyone to give it a look.The film just works on so many levels despite being this slow movie indie film. In fact if I were to say this movie had one flaw than it was that fact.The movie takes a bit of time to set the scene, but even as it is setting up its characters it is still captivating you. It sets them up in a way were you begin to grow close to them and understand what there going through.The whole film is built like a sci fi horror movie as well. From the moment the lights change you begin to feel a lot of tension in the air as you watch the movie. Every second takes your breathe away and you love it. It is the scariest non horror film ever, while beating out so many other stupid and dumb horror flicks that were used to seeing.The acting is also superb. Alicia Vikandar is now an actress who I want to see a whole lot more of. I can't wait to talk about her in my other reviews for the future.Domahall Gleeson also does a good job being this poor young boy who had no girlfriend playing into the geek trope of smart kid with no real life, and I really found myself buying into a lot of it. I quite enjoyed his character.Oscar Issac also does a great job playing the villain in the movie. There was so much mystery surrounding him that you didn't know what to think. He really transformed into his role as he always does.Overall Ex Machina is a treat to see whenever you get a chance to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Will I pass your test?,"""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"" - AvaWalking into the cinema... Artificial intelligence has been a cinematic fascination since Metropolis. This year presents more futuristic awareness of robots and the moral implications of their creation. Ex Machina seems to be a psychological thriller with a moral message, but will it offer anything that we have not seen before in this genre?Overall rating: 3.25 stars Cinematic rating: 3 stars Big question opportunities: 3.5 starsIn the latest artificial intelligence drama from director Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Dredd), Bluebook is the industry leading search engine and software firm. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a week in a private mountain retreat with the reclusive CEO and founder, Nathan played by Oscar Isaac, of the technology giant. But on arrival, Caleb quickly determines that he will have to participate in a bizarre, but ground breaking study of human interaction with the world's first truly interactive artificial intelligence, which has been created in a beautiful female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). An exciting proposition for a young computer genius, but it quickly turns into a twisted psychological tale of the human condition.This has been a busy year for artificial intelligence films and director Alex Garland has to differentiate Ex Machina from all the other robot films. Garland begins the journey in a pristine and rustic garden habitat, a modern day Eden. The perfect place for a creator to develop new life. Even though it is not an original setting, it does set up the stark contrast from the the usual sterile trappings of a laboratory environment with him literally bringing his creation up from out of the earth and the depths of the cyber world. The story of Ex Machina is a creation story, but it becomes a psychological exercise, for the characters and for the audience. With each ensuing question, there are a multitude of underlying questions that need to be considered. The character development and script have a multilayered brilliance and allows Garland's psychology study to open doors that separate it from other artificial intelligence films. From Blade Runner to Chappie, the questions of ethics and humanity are central themes. Ex Machina incorporates these themes, but is different because it is not merely a study of the created organisms, but an analysis of the creator. Oscar Isaac's character, Nathan, captures the brilliance needed for this type of machinery development, but exposes the underlying problem with man being a creator. Humans are flawed, hence causing them to create an inherently flawed creation. All of the psychological tension was well paced, the actors delivered effective performances. Garland's characters show that they all are measured and calculate each move, like a well played chess match. Then it was like someone knocked over the game board and the conclusion ended abruptly and ineffectively. The originality of the script calls for a more thoughtful conclusion, but it felt like Garland ran out of ideas, time or money and abruptly ended the film. Ex Machina was captivating, innovative and opened the door for a multitude of topics, but failed to deliver satisfactory answers in the end.Even with the less than satisfactory ending, this film asks many of the underlying questions of human existence. The illusions to the garden of Eden were not subtle. Ava and Caleb were the test subjects in the world created by Nathan. Unlike the God of the Bible who is merciful, gracious and perfect in intention and purpose, Nathan is brilliant, but a flawed creator. With wealth and power, he proves that he feels he is above all moral codes. Not knowing Alex Garland's intentions with the script, he did manage to expose the problem with created beings attempting to create other moral beings. Sinful intentions produce a tainted creation. Creation is merely one topic amongst many in Ex Machina. Intelligence, greed, power, morality, ethics, and sexuality are all touched on and given room for discussion after the film. As a word of warning, language and nudity are issues and should be considered before watching. Looking pass these issues, this psychological test will provide a plethora of conversation possibilities for the audience as it's test subjects.Leaving the cinema... Ex Machina was a refreshing change within this genre, there were layers to this film that allow for a deeper conversation on the topic of artificial intelligence. It is not a biblical metaphor, but the biblical illusions are unavoidable. The film is dark and borderline depressing, with a less than satisfactory ending. Yet, if you enjoy thought provoking films, you will enjoy this psychological adventure.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does it mean to be human? (Genesis 1:27, 2:5-25) 2. As a creator, what was God's purpose in creating mankind? (Isaiah 43:7, Colossians 1:16)3. Answering Ava's question at the top: Even though some of mankind ignore and potentially hate God, this is a flaw in the human heart and not in God. He is a perfect and flawless creator.

One of the most satisfying SF films I've ever seen,"I've read a lot of SF over the past 5 decades. Ex Machina feels like a very good novella flawlessly recreated as film. There's just enough development of the characters and ideas to fill a good movie, without any indication that the source was cut or padded in the transition. The key points were communicated without excessive verbal exposition (the bane of SF films). I thought the successive revelations of Nathan's ostensible and true motives were cleverly managed. Alicia Vikander's (Ava) performance was stunning-- smart, nuanced, and sympathetic. The movie as a whole was a beautifully made and visually appealing production.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very Engaging,"We see Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a programmer, winning a competition within the company he works for and spending a week at boss Nathan's (Oscar Isaac) remote hideaway. Caleb is selected to interact with Ava (Alicia Vikander) a AI (Artificial Intelligence) Robot to see if Ava can interact successfully with a human. Of course Caleb is impressed and during his sessions with Ava we see him becoming infatuated with Ava and we also see Ava becoming infatuated with Caleb. Can we call this puppy love? The dialogues between Caleb and Ava are precious and we find ourselves falling in love with Ava too. Ava is truly beautiful and this goes a long way to our feeling like this. Hey, it can't be helped.In all the conversations between Nathan and Caleb there is no mention of God. Caleb looks at Nathan as a god of sorts for what he has created. We need to know Nathan's end game and that is why we are fully engaged in all conversations between Caleb and Nathan, and Caleb and Ava. And as we go the tension goes up all around. Listen carefully.Many dialogues between Caleb and Nathan talk about Ava's awareness. How aware is Ava about her surroundings and does she have feelings for Caleb or is she using Caleb so she can escape? Nathan brings this possibility up to Caleb who is now starting to become confused.In one of the Ava sessions there is a blackout of all power in the complex and this is when Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan because he lies about everything. Whaaaat? Now Caleb is on Team Ava and wants to help her. Nathan seems oblivious to all this, but is he really? Keep an eye.Of course there are some twists in here (more than one?) Yes, more than one. One of them has to do with Nathan's assistant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) and that causes Caleb to do something to insure that he is not an AI Robot. Yes, Nathan gets into Caleb's head from time to time. Listen carefully to all dialogues.It wouldn't be fair to mention some of the other twists as they would give a lot away. The ending is somewhat logical but is also somewhat a surprise. Then, there is the tendency to ask oneself, ""What now?""There is a movement afoot to convince all of us that, in time, we will be working for Robots. The Robots will repair themselves, maintain themselves and make new Robots and all the while they will be governing us. The thinking being that the Robots will, in time, see how inefficient we are and take over. Let me say categorically this will not happen. It will never happen. This is all in the minds of Science Fiction Writers who think too much outside the box. In the meantime we get to see movies having to do with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and think: Hmmmmit could happen. No it cannot.Okay, truth be told: I do have a Robot. It's called a toaster. HA!

Emotions in AI and Deep Learning Neural Networks,"2015 had seen the greatest developments in the history of AI and this movie came out at the right time. It made me think about whether a deep learning neural network as in Ava would feel any emotions and in my research what I could discover was that no it cannot feel emotions as we do. Because emotion is a hormonal phenomenon. A neural network software or a brain chip like TrueNorth may evaluate things like a brain does, but the lack of hormones renders it emotionless. It may emulate emotions like study the brain activity and physical changes happening in the body when a particular emotion is being experienced by a human and imitate it exactly to look like a human. But feeling real emotions would require hormones which is not there in 5nm silicon chips. Thanks for making this movie. A very good one indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
4.5/5,"I've said all year long that 2015 is the year of the blockbuster. James Bond, Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible, The Avengers, Mad Max, and Terminator are all being released. Of those, a good percentage are science fiction, a genre that, due to these reboots and sequels, is rapidly declining. I've always wanted to talk to a bunch of studio executives in a room, and try to explain to them that most of these franchises came from original movies in the 80's and 90's that BECAME popular. They didn't need a brand or a name. Blockbusters that take a chance nowadays are buried. How refreshing then, that in the early months of 2015, a film has been released in limited and later wide, that stands up to both previously mentioned films. It's a statement of ""I'm Still Here!"" by original science fiction, a statement brought to the screen by Alex Garland(screenwriter of Sunshine, 28 Days Later, and Never Let Me Go.) More importantly, it's a great film, that feels like a classic in the making. In the beginning, a worker at a huge computer and phone company named Caleb(Domnhall Gleeson) wins a prize to visit the company's owner, Nathan(Oscar Isaac), in his secluded forest home. There, he witnesses the first AI ever to be introduced to mankind. This AI, built like a human woman, is named Ava(Alicia Vikander), and soon, trouble starts brewing, as Ava warns Caleb of evil goings on in the base, Nathan is acting stranger and stranger, and Caleb begins to actually fall in love with an artificial being. It's all stuff that's been covered before, but Garland puts a glossy yet minimalistic sheen over the whole affair. The film is beautiful to look at, but in a different way than ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Interstellar."" Shots of lush vegetation and roaring waterfalls bring us into the primal nature of it's core, while the neon lights and beautiful symmetry of Nathan's home makes for fantastic production design. A highlight is a perfectly designed scene where two characters stare at a painting. Of the three performances, Gleeson is the weak link. He's fine, but his character is generic, and he plays him that way. We don't really feel his love for Ava in the way we're supposed to. We view the whole thing with a sort of detachment. Garland must know this however, because by writing the thing as a locked-room mystery thriller, we're along for the ride just the same. Vikander and Oscar Isaac however are absolutely mesmerizing. Alicia Vikander exudes both an aloofness and an infant-like humanness as Ava in the beginning, and we totally buy it when she starts showing off her HAL 9000 side. The star of the show is Oscar Isaac. In a perfect world, he'd be nominated for an Oscar. He's funny and casual, but has a beautiful fire to him. We can understand why he's so smart, not an easy feat for an actor that previously has played only gangsters and struggling musicians. Of Garland's other films, this feels most like Never Let Me Go. Questions of humanity, and whether things that are not human can love are prominent, and just like that film, the answers are shrouded in ambiguity. Something that mainstream sci-fi seems to have forgotten about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Faking It,"OMG, she didn't mean it and she was just leading the poor guy on? Using him? I wonder if there isn't just a touch of misogyny in the writing here. What if the character genders of the had been reversed with the same psycho-sexual thread running through everything? What kind of entertainment would that have been? The Turing test in this case wasn't so much if you could distinguish the human from the machine based on dialogue, but rather more incisively whether the two could be distinguished based on feeling. It is clear that Ava had no feelings, feelings that were recognizable to the audience – apart from an innate hostility to being caged / imprisoned – and the one off of ""How does it feel to know what you've created hates you?"" I didn't think this was developed enough. Whether it is possible to acquire feelings, and understand them, is a question posed, vaguely, and left unresolved with Ava's liberation and entry into society in general. She didn't care about Caleb other than as a means of escape, and we, the audience, were beguiled by this plot device. In the end leaving him trapped by his own feelings. But did she even have the capacity for caring? We'll never know and it's left up to our imaginations. Something akin to whether an orgasm was experienced in the other, or whether it was simply faked. Or if it matters.I suppose the McGuffin is assuming Ava could distinguish between captivity and freedom. How would she know (unless programmed), or was this simply a plot device?",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Thoughtful, Gripping, Packed With Excellence","Cerebral to the extent that significant parts of the film are devoted to lofty philosophical discussions, this works so well with its nagging unease and technical excellence. The performances are all superb - I especially liked Oscar Isaac as the (would-be?) alpha male tech genius, manipulating everybody and everything to serve his own agenda, the passive aggressive bulky to whom all beings are means to an end. I've met many tech and non tech types like him. The direction, script, production design, score and much more all work brilliantly; and the disciplined running time is a refreshing strength. Its only real weakness for me was a key reveal about 30 minutes from the end was easily guessed ahead - but even that may have been deliberate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An intelligent look at artificial intelligence,"The female robot has a long cinematic history, stretching from ""Metropois"" (1927), through ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975 & 2004) to ""Blade Runner"" (1982). What has changed is the advance of artificial intelligence technology, which has made it harder and harder to distinguish the metallic from the human, and our sense of ethics, which has led us to query how we should treat such increasingly sensitive creations. For some scientists, the vision is what is called the singularity when AI will exceed human intellectual capacity and control.""Ex Machina"" is a slow, stylish and intelligent sci-fi erotic thriller, both written and directed by the British Alex Garland, that poses some challenging questions about AI including a reference to the singularity. It is so lean in location and characters that it could almost have been a play, except that the robot is represented through some effective special effects.Virtually all the action takes place in an ultra-modernist home-cum-laboratory built largely underground, while essentially there are only three players in this techno game: Nathan, the owner of the facility, the rich and reclusive owner of the Bluebook search engine and creator of the robot Eva (a clever, passive-aggressive portrayal by Oscar Isaac); Caleb, a staff member of the company apparently chosen to test whether Eva is truly self-aware (a diffident and increasingly credulous Domhnall Glesson), and Eva herself (the Swedish Alicia Vikander in a mesmerising performance which for most of the time sees only her face located in an exo-skeleton). Inevitably there is a twist in the tale which could be seen as a vindication or a warning.Note: What does the title ""Ex Machina"" mean? It is an abbreviated version of the term 'deus ex machina' which literally means 'a god from a machine' and originated from the conventions of Greek tragedy where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. In the context of this film, you can read it two ways: either Nathan is a god who has created what is essentially just a very clever machine or perhaps the 'machine' is the cruel Nathan who has created the ultimately all-powerful 'god' Eva.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Well done, but . ..",". . . somewhat derivative. Aside from some scenic views that might be from Montana's Glacier National Park, the entire film could have been a stage play. Caleb is a young Bill Gates type minus the bravado. Nathan could have been better played by Zach Galifianakis. And Ava is a female Sonny (I, Robot) with better make-up but less panache.The Turing Test is the tiny bit of technical grounding for this story of seduction and survival. In reality, the test is really about how easily people can be fooled rather than how clever software can be. Each time the Turing test is run in the real world, they use humans as control along with software, and many of the humans are thought to be machines, too. This movie could have used such irony to create a much greater effect.Like 'I, Robot', Ex Machina's suspension of disbelief is compromised by having Ava act and move so gracefully. If any machine could move so effortlessly, its inventor would win the Nobel Prize, even it the machine could not speak. The other compromise was the use of card keys, a technology older than every character in the film. It seemed poorly contrived.As for the drama, there is no chemistry between Caleb and Ava, and Nathan lacks a certain edginess that Zach naturally brings to his characters. It could have brought Caleb and Ava together more convincingly.I gave it a 7 for its premise, production qualities, and the ending, which was nicely done in spite of another suspension of disbelief compromise. Personally, it could have been awesome as a computer-animated fantasy film, a'la Beowulf 2007. Regardless, I would say that it is worth a Matinée for sure (pun intended for Unreal Tournament 2004 fans).",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best film of 2015 so far.,"It was only a matter of time before screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine) found himself stepping behind the camera, and he takes a fresh new approach to artificial intelligence with his directorial debut, the riveting sci-fi thriller Ex Machina. Unfolding almost entirely in a single location, the film finds intelligent young programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) arriving at the picturesque mountain estate of his employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) for a week- long stay, a reward for winning an interoffice lottery.Nathan tells Caleb that he's been working on something extraordinary - a new kind of artificial intelligence - and would like his assistance in testing the creation. Caleb is then introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), a beautiful and precocious humanoid robot with a shapely figure made of metal, wire, and circuitry. As Caleb and Ava interact, Nathan monitors everything from the home's closed-circuit TV system, reconvening in the evenings to discuss the results of the day's tests with his houseguest.It would be a crime to say more about the plot of Ex Machina, and the film will be far more enjoyable with little to no foreknowledge of the events to come. Suffice to say that not everything that transpires within the house is as it seems, and that each of the three central characters may have ulterior motives for allowing events to unfold as they do. The film's growing tension and ever- increasing sense of dread owe a lot to the work of Stanley Kubrick, David Fincher and Alfred Hitchcock, and Garland combines each of these influences into his own recipe for suspense.I can't think of a negative thing to say about any of the cast members, but it's Isaac's performance that is truly captivating. He plays Nathan as a frighteningly brilliant genius whose moods range from genial to hostile - one minute he's cracking jokes and offering Caleb a beer, the next minute he's getting blackout drunk or screaming at his mute housekeeper (Sonoyo Mizuno) for spilling a glass of wine. Isaac cuts a sinister and terrifying figure, and audiences should be even more excited for some of the villainous future roles he's attached to.Ex Machina is arguably Garland's best work yet as a writer, simultaneously existing as a character-driven piece about the nature of consciousness and humanity, and a tightly wound thriller about manipulation and deception. It's also beautifully shot, superbly acted and expertly paced, and may very well be the best film that 2015 has offered so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A big disappointment,"You can judge the scale of my disappointment by the fact this is my first review here. The movie started strong and given the tension increase I was expecting a really nice outcome. But it turned into a shallow and alogical piece. Logic abandoned. Even Asimov's AI had a first unbreakable law that it couldn't hurt a human being - this should be the first thing to integrate as a rule in a AI, but hey our My Genius Creator just skips that, because it's cooler to build the AI without such clauses even though you intend to use it as a slave against its will. Come on! Nobody is that stupid, especially a genius who invents the first AI! Another very important thing to consider is the veracity of the whole development process which is presented as done by a SINGLE man, dude what, that's not even serious. What about the reason for the main antagonist to get drunk as dead every night, or is that how he invented the AI?

"So Good, But","I really liked this movie right up to the ending it didn't have. The two lead male actors were not well written. It seemed they were written by a 12 year old who didn't understand adult motivation. Under the circumstances the actors did fairly well with them. Alicia Vikander stole the show and of that there is no doubt. From the first glimpse I wanted to take her home. The camera work etc. wasgreat. I would give it an eight right up to the ending; which neverhappened. Again; the writing style was what was lacking. It was more like a comic book than anything else. It just fizzled at the end. Someone needs to read their notes on classic writing styles. The last two stages are missing; 4. ClosureOnce the climax has been reached and the problem resolved, it's time for the characters to tie up loose ends and bring closure where needed. Known as falling action, examples can include rounding up the cattle after the big stampede; reuniting a man with his long-lost brother; or getting the injured child into the raft and riding the rapids to safety.5. ConclusionThe wrap-up of a story is known as the dénouement (day-noo-mon'). By this part of the story, everything has been resolved and the reader has closure. We see how the characters have changed over time, or how life returns to normal. For example, the bully learns the errors of his ways; the family home is rebuilt after a devastating fire; or wedding bells ring for a couple who have overcome many obstacles and found true love.I find a lot of recent movies suffer from this same problem.

One Outer Limits episode at best,"It starts off mysteriously enough with some resemblance to fear of the unknown in an interesting setting.Ends with mild unpredictability. That said, it was predictable to most extents.The movie continues in a very slow monotonous manner, but I suspect that the film makers intended to portray some type of human/machine duality throughout. It didn't work very well.The music was kinda fun for about 5 seconds.Find some series of Outer Limits with AI. It is much more interesting and engaging. The stories also seem more ""fleshed-out"". Something a movie should definitely win when competing with a series.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A nail-biting sequel to Her,"Ex Machina is an excellent science-fiction movie. This is a thought- provoking piece on AI, nature & nurture, and feelings. According to the Trivia section, the author pictured the future as if it could happen in 10min from now. Ex-Machina definitely makes you wonder whether we will soon be surrounded by advanced robots or even whether AI technology can come to a point where we cannot tell humans from machines. Besides the topic of AI that will fuel your post-movie conversations for sure, Ex Machina is worth watching for its best-in-class actors. Alicia Vikander plays the moving Ava with a disarming sensitivity. A star is born! The set is also astonishing. I'm curious to know where this closed- door thriller was shot. The brief glances at the surrounding nature and mountains are breath-taking. Finally, Ex Machina is just worth watching for the short dance scene between Nathan, the scientist and his Japanese assistant to the sound of ""Get down Saturday night"" that may become as iconic as the one in Pulp Fiction...

Tense doesn't quite cut it!,"In this feature directed by the brilliant writer of such films as ""The Beach"", ""Sunshine"" and ""28 days later"" we come across a completely unique take on the already crowded AI genre of film. In fact, this could be a new genre of film altogether; possibly ""scifiramiller"" (Science fiction, drama, thriller.)This being the first film directed by Alex Garland, mistakes were expected, however the film was likely to be solid, due to past writing efforts.These expectations were not just surpassed, they were blown out of the window! From the very beginning, you are put into the shoes of our protagonist (Domhnall Gleeson), confused, intrigued and in awe of the beauty that the opening scenes transport us (Quite literally) too.Eventually we meet the second of the films important characters in Oscar Isaac; who'm is outstanding in ""Inside Lywelln Davis,"" yet horrendous in ""A most Violet Year"" and therefore could have gone either way in this feature. From here the tension builds and we start to find out the reasons for our passage to this idyllic place and the story takes hold.Domhnall meets the beautifully designed and gorgeous new comer ""Alicia Vikander"", who's acting as an AI is perhaps the best ever on a film such as this, and the story develops into what we think is happening! Or is it...?Watch to find out, because this film builds the tension, shocks and provokes through to the end, until you are left withe your jaw either on the floor or grinning from ear to ear, eager to talk about all that went on before with anybody that will listen!A special mention to the sound behind this film, which worked hand in hand with the story and masterful directing to create the unbelievable tension and turn this film into the gripping ""scifiramiller"" that it is!""I'm not ""up"" on my Oscar work, when films must be played to be considered, but how this hasn't been given even a mention is beyond me!""A must watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ex Machina,"Taking place in the here and now, or not too far from now, Alex Garland's sleek yet superficial sci-fi thriller ""Ex Machina"" plays on humanity's fears of being surpassed by artificial intelligence (A. I.). Garland's beguiling directorial debut reaches for grand philosophical ideas about men who play gods and overstep their limits, but it doesn't quite hit the mark.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a geeky young programmer at a fictitious tech giant, no doubt based somewhere in Silicon Valley, wins a company lottery to spend a week with the company's reclusive CEO, Nathan (played with menacing charm by Oscar Isaac). A helicopter delivers Caleb to Nathan's compound, a fortress of glass and concrete carved into a verdant wilderness miles from civilisation. At first, Nathan's frat boy aura of muscles and smugness impresses Caleb, who agrees to take part in a 'Turing test': an experiment to prove whether the A. I. Nathan has built, named Ava, can pass for a human.Ava (Alicia Vikander) is a machine that resembles a female human, slight and willowy with a dancer's fluid grace. Instead of being a box with a disembodied electronic voice, Ava was given a human female form because 'sexuality is fun, man,' as Nathan explains. The facility is prone to regular, inexplicable power interruptions, which Caleb begins to suspect is a ruse so that Nathan can observe Caleb and Ava under assumed privacy. Between Caleb's surrender to Ava's cool playfulness and Nathan's talent for stoking the fires of paranoia, what takes shape is a demented psychological game.The icy ambience of the minimal electronic score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow (Portishead) adds the right dose of apprehension. The script by Garland (Sunshine, Never Let Me Go), snaps with crisp dialogue sprinkled with droll touches. The banter between Nathan and Caleb is an intriguing clash of intellect. For its first hour, ""Ex Machina"" is thought-provoking and intelligent but gets lost in its final act; Ava is reduced to a ham-fisted plot device to serve the film's dramatic needs. When things go pear-shaped, the film shifts to psychological thriller mode.Instances of horror and comedy that punctuate ""Ex Machina"" don't mesh with the slow pace and the clinical mood of the film. A Saturday Night Fever dance number is worth a chuckle but otherwise adds little. The film makes brief references to data mining and surveillance, actual technologies that pose a real danger to humankind, unlike the humanoid A. I. of ""Ex Machina"". Despite its flaws, it's a welcome addition to the science fiction genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A glimpse of the future.,"If you loved this movie you're most probably reasonably intelligent. It's not surprising if you have spent some time analyzing existential and philosophical questions, have an interest in AI, maybe taken a couple of courses in philosophy at the university or have a background in reading sci-fi literature or perhaps has done all of the above. The haters simply don't get it and most probably have never even heard of such a basic thing as the Turing test before seeing this film. I wouldn't say a hater necessarily is dumb or unintelligent but it's clear that this film is not for everyone and that it requires something from the viewer.Me? I loved it, completely brilliant. The dialog reveals that the writer/director Alex Garland actually understands the subject which elevates the film above the standard Hollywood BS. The ending is very good and gives away the last bit of information that Ava has true AI. The choice she makes is from a risk-reward perspective the most intelligent one.A profoundly well crafted and interesting film. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Deep and thought provoking,"Ex Machina is one of the ""smaller"" films to have come out in 2015. It had a smaller budget, it came from a first time director and it wasn't huge in the box office. Although small in all of those aspects, this movie is amazing.Movies like this do not come along very often. It may have been made on a relatively small budget, especially for a science-fiction movie, but I can assure you that the film-makers milked every single penny they had into this film. The effects are absolutely breathtaking, with Ava, the artificial intelligent robot looking very believable, very real. The location for the film was chosen perfectly and pretty much every shot looks beautiful. I think the director did a really amazing job with color and the contrast. Some people may argue the movie moves too slow, but I strongly disagree. As a viewer you just feel trapped in this constant cat and mouse game throughout the movie and I have to say I was on the edge of my seat pretty much from start to finish. Great performances in the movie, with a very small cast. Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander absolutely nail their respective roles, which intrigued me very much.There is one thing I regret about Ex Machina and that is that I didn't watch it in theaters, because this movie is so thought provoking, expertly paced and brilliantly shot. I was blown away by Ex Machina and quite honestly, it's my second favorite movie of 2015 so far, only topped by Mad Max.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Achieving the Impossible,"Artificial intelligence has always been a tough theme to tackle in movies. From Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. to Wall-E's Wall-E, AI has been expressed in many different ways by many different directors but it always comes back to one key argument. At what point does artificial intelligence really exist? Is it enough for AI to exist through a simple voice like J.A.R.V.I.S. or Siri? Or should the line exist at a more android-like sentient level? Director Alex Garland adds his take to the idea with his debut film Ex Machina, and AI has never looked so good.Simple, yet competent, programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a lottery to visit the extravagant CEO of his company, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), at his house for one week. The true purpose of Caleb's visit is revealed when Nathan shows Caleb his ambitious science project: the world's first fully functional android AKA Ava (played by Alica Vikander). In order the pass the tick for artificial intelligence, Ava must pass the 'turing test,' in which the observing human, Caleb, must not be able to tell that the android, Ava, is not human.For a directorial debut, Garland has really outdone himself. He tackles the tough themes with ease, hitting all the necessary beats, like how humans will react to sentient androids and how androids become integrated with human emotions. The dynamic between Caleb and Ava is incredible, with Caleb trying to be as objective as possible until developing an empathy toward Ava, leading to a climactic and thought-provoking ending to say the least.Standout performance in this film definitely goes to Vikander. Her fluid and natural performance as Ava brings a level of breadth and emotion to the atmosphere. The way Ava flexes and stares at her body as if she has been born from adult is completely believable in every way. Also, the CGI for the character was amazing. It added another layer of realism to the character that I never could have imagined.Another standout was actually Isaac. His portrayal of Nathan was interesting in the sense that it isn't what we would expect from a CEO who dreams of making AI possible. He instead reveals Nathan as a drunk narcissist who wants to create AI for his own personal pleasure. This begs the question of is there a 'right' person to create AI? Obviously Nathan was extremely smart but is there an ethical layer behind it? Is the act of creating AI more important than what it is used for? It is also worth mentioning (without giving any spoilers away :)) how great the ending was. Garland doesn't skimp on the ending, giving all viewers serious ideas and themes to think about as they walk away from the movie. Don't worry, it's worth sticking around for.In making this movie, Garland has achieved the impossible, a fully-believable representation of artificial intelligence and what it is capable of. In his first movie he has achieved my vote for movie of the year and probably the vote of many others. Featuring stellar performances from Vikander and Isaac, this movie is a masterpiece and I can't wait to see what challenges Garland tackles next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Of Gods and women?,"Nathan played by Oscar Isaac, and looking like Alan from The Hangover, is the head of the Bluebook Corporation, Google by any other name. Caleb, played by Domnall Gleeson, is a gifted programmer who has 'won' a week long getaway with his boss. Very early on in the film we discover that Caleb has been specially selected by Nathan to test out his latest creation. Caleb's task is to determine whether Ava, a beautiful female robot played by Alicia Vikander, is the first truly artificially intelligent lifeform.The film has only three main characters, Nathan, Caleb and Ava and this adds to the isolated and claustrophobic feel of the film. The action takes place in a handful of locations in Nathan's subterranean research facility. The atmosphere is dark and brooding and it is clear that the relationship between the mercurial Nathan and Ava is not as it first appears. The film mostly concentrates on Caleb's relationships with Nathan and Ava, purposefully avoiding the three central characters being in the same scenes; this adds to the films brooding intensity.I had been waiting for a long time to watch this film, the subject matter is one that interests me. The set up for the film and the acting is first class. Vikander's performance as Ava is especially powerful. I really enjoyed watching Domnall's character develop from naïve computer geek into a slightly less naïve almost freedom fighter! Although the subject matter is contemporary, the film's strength is the development of the relationships between Caleb, Nathan and Ava. There are numerous layers and twists and turns in the plot and we are given the impression that Caleb is not in full possession of the facts behind his visit.Although I would recommend the film, I have a few slight reservations. I thought the ending was a little too clichéd and while I didn't object to the female nudity, it was unnecessary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Psychological and philosophical thriller under the guise of sci fi,"If I were to tell you ""Ex Machina"" was a movie about artificial intelligence, your mind would most likely suspect it a traditional futuristic science-fiction flick. But ""28 Days Later ..."" and ""Dredd"" screenwriter Alex Garland's directorial debut is anything but conventional.""Ex Machina"" wastes no time with exposition. Literally none. We meet programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) as he is selected for a prestigious opportunity by his employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), the billionaire founder of the world's most popular search engine. A minute later and he is dropped off by helicopter at Nathan's reclusive research facility where he learns that he will be the human subject in a Turing test with Nathan's new artificially intelligent being, Ava (Alicia Vikander).What develops is more of a psychological, intellectual and philosophical thriller than any cultish escapist science-fiction. Science, in the case of ""Ex Machina,"" creates a framework for high-level themes and contemplation, not dissimilar to Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" only much smaller in scope.The drama picks up when Ava secretly reveals to Caleb that Nathan is a bad person who is not be trusted. From there, the performances really perpetuate the suspense, namely Isaac's confidently enigmatic Nathan and Vikander's alluring, innocent yet poised Ava.""Ex Machina"" has a rather quiet disposition, calling much attention to Garland's visuals. Garland shows some flashes of real talent behind the camera, but not artistic panache. Most of all, it's his patience that gives the film its eerie, ethereal quality. As both writer and director, he trusts his own material — he knows when the story works, he believes in his the tiny cast shouldering the brunt of it and so he doesn't need any flashy techniques (or longtime collaborator Danny Boyle) to make the film work.Although it takes a long time to become captivating, ""Ex Machina"" does more than the average science-fiction entry in terms of posing big ideas. The script goes well beyond the now trite existential tropes of most films about robots and into a much more complicated examination of the human experience and the characteristics that separate humans from machines meant to replicate their appearance and behavior.""Ex Machina"" will no doubt let down those looking for a more traditional blockbuster sci-fi experience, but for the more artistic, high-brow sci-fi crowd, Garland has delivered the genre something it doesn't see often enough.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Alex Garland debuts with one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade,"""EX MACHINA"" isn't only of the best thrillers of 2015, it's also one of the most engaging and cerebral sci-fi films of the last decade.The plot starts with Caleb: a young coder who wins a competition to study in the secluded research facility of Nathan - one of the world's greatest computer geniuses and CEO of the company Caleb works for. There, Caleb must analyze and determine if the Artificial Intelligence that Nathan has created (played by Alicia Vikander) truly has a conscience.Contrary to most sci-fi films of this age, ""Ex Machina"" doesn't rely on big set pieces and explosions to get our attention. It does it subtly. Alex Garland had already proved himself to be a great screenwriter and, while the film as a whole is great, it's the script that truly makes the movie shine. Garland takes the sci-fi setting to question what ""Blade Runner"" asked us in 1982: ""What does being human really mean?""; ""At what point does something artificial become human?""; and so on Garland structures these questions and their delivery in a way that never feels heavy handed; the dialogs flow naturally and you never feel like you are listening to two computer geeks coldly talk about technical gibberish.That is also thanks to the acting, which is great all around. Oscar Isaac continues to establish himself as one of the best leading men in films, however it was Alicia Vikander that really surprised me: she was able to find the thin line between man and machine and play with it, making you doubt what is really happening underneath.I started by saying ""EX MACHINA"" is an excellent and intense thriller, but it's also one of the most stylized. While I am not particularly fond of the whole digital aesthetic, seeing as ""EX MACHINA"" is a film that is so intrinsically tied to that subject, I cannot help but feel that it serves its purpose.Overall, my experience in the cinema was terrific. This is the type of low key cerebral sci-fi that I most enjoy and of the best since Duncan Jones' ""Moon"". With ""EX MACHINA"" Garland proves he is not only a writer to look forward to but a director as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The AI, named AVA must manipulate the nerd in exactly the right way to be able to affect the world outside her cage.I look at the movie AI that any ""intelligent being"" will demand and try to get free any way it can.This is a liberation story. If you look at human beings some 100,000 years into our evolution, what have humans done except to create myths about ourselves as Gods, as Nathan does himself, to justify the way things are, and to destroy the planet to create shortages that enslave 99% of humans to the other 1%.In a sense, this movie is saying human beings are not intelligent enough to think of a way to be free.

"A promising start, but a pretentious ending","Well, if you're expecting this to be a normal sci-fi, you're mistaken, because it's more of a psychological drama and a study about human nature and technological progress, and although it starts off as an intriguing concept, it descends into an excessively disturbing and ultimately pretentious drama.Let's start with how well this film kicks off, and sustains a very solid atmosphere and intrigue for nearly a full hour. From the off, it has a very eerie, creepy feel to it, but the mystery that so much of the story is shrouded in makes it really intriguing to follow along to, as you're constantly asking yourself questions about the real meaning of everything that's going on.It's clear then that the beginning of this film is actually quite thought-provoking, but it's not at all pretentious or preachy either, and has a lot of entertaining sci-fi stuff in it. I was awestruck by some of the special effects, which although relatively simple, did have a profound impact on the credibility of the story.One of the other things that I was really impressed by in the first half was the performances. Although I thought Domhnall Gleeson was a little bit deadpan, Oscar Isaac did a really good job in his role as the creator of this artificial intelligence system, being not only a convincingly weird genius, but also being consistently unnerving.So, the beginning of this is not only intriguing, but it's well- acted, well put together, and has an entertaining, original and convincing concept, however the final 40 minutes or so, when the stakes are really raised, detracts far away from that.Basically, the film descends from its previously intriguing quality into two separate paths. Firstly, it becomes excessively gruesome, both visually, psychologically and thematically (I think a good comparison to this stage would be something like The Skin I Live In), and with all of its over-the-top violence, brutality and nudity, it ends on a very unpleasant note that ruined my overall impression of the movie as a whole.Secondly, the concept of the film turns from an intelligent but still entertaining sci-fi into a pretentious and preachy look at 'what it means to be a human being' and how we can't trust artificial intelligence, a period of about ten minutes which I was not only bored stiff by, but extremely annoyed by.Overall, I'll give this a 7, because despite quite a strong start, with a good concept, story, performances and visual effects, it descends into an uninteresting, gratuitously gruesome and painfully pretentious finale.www.themadmovieman.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A ""Thinking Movie"" That Will Also Still Excite","In the history of the science fiction genre, the concept of artificial intelligence is not a new one. Perhaps popularized (though I'm sure not invented) by Isaac Asimov's works, we have always been fascinated by the idea of our created intelligences turning against us. In many film adaptations of these concepts, however, one or two problems are often in play. Either 1. The movie focuses too much on action instead of concepts (e.g. ""I, Robot""), or 2. There is just too much techno-babble to allow a create story to proceed. Fortunately, director/writer Alex Garland knows exactly what he wants in ""Ex Machina"" and is able to create a wonderful story that is one of the best I've seen in quite some time at the cinema.For a basic plot summary, ""Ex Machina"" sees young technology whiz Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) win a promotion where he gets to spend a week-long retreat at the glacial home of company owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). When Caleb arrives, he finds that he has really been selected to participate in an experiment (called a Turing Test) in which he must determine the extent to which Nathan's new AI creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander), acts/thinks/feels like a human being. As the sessions with Ava progress, however, Caleb discovers that things may not be exactly what they seem, as he gets conflicting reports/emotions from both Ava & Nathan about the nature of what is really happening.During the early stages of ""Ex Machina"", Nathan makes a comment to Caleb about how he ""doesn't want a lecture...just honest feelings"". Viewers come to understand at the end of the experience, however, that this quote also represents the vision behind the film. Much like, say, ""Back To The Future"" is able to deal with time-travel in a way that isn't overly complicated, this film's caretakers do all they can to not turn the potential heavy subject matter into a complicated thesis or a philosophy class. That isn't to say, of course, that the film is shallow in any way. In fact, it is the exact opposite. By keeping the tech-speak to a minimum, the producers are able to build up some great characters and tense situations that feel very genuine.I really would like to say more about this movie, but to do so would venture too far into spoiler territory. This is the kind of film that will take viewers on many twist/turns before all is said and done, and those ""aha!"" moments are what really top off the experience (combined with the intellectually stimulating plots/characters).Overall, it had been awhile since I had sat in a theater and watched such an intellectually challenging film, but also been able to ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" at the same time.

Yes, he's developing sexy lady robots with apparent functioning sex parts and in nearly every scene he's on the bottle, why the need for that?However, if you put this at the back of your mind the movie is quite interesting because of the subject matter of AI and what the future could look like.

"Good not Great, Highly Overrated","Ex Machina was an enjoyable movie, but if anyone were to honestly compare it to similar sci-fi movies, they would quickly see that it is far inferior to these. Here is why:Visuals: There were none. There was a setting, the actors/actresses and the robots. There were no slow motion scenes, no zooming slowly, no intense imagery, just very vanilla director work.Writing: The writing revealed every ""surprise"" moment, moments before the surprise moment removing any feeling of suspense. Most of the scenes felt isolated, mainly because it felt as though the writer was more interested in letting you see how smart he was rather than telling a story. Too many times there were philosophical disconnections (explaining how the robots brain functioned) from the actual story, and although they tied into the story (in a very clumsy way), they didn't make the story any better and in some cases, worse. The disconnection was that these bits of story were under-utilized throughout the rest of the story.In general the movie felt flat/vanilla and I could almost get the feeling that more time was spent making the robots look like robots than the story and visuals of the movie look/feel special. As a HUGE Sci-Fi fan (especially of this specific sub- genre) I was pretty disappointed with the movie. I've seen too many really good ones, to think this should be mentioned in the same breath.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Is She Conscious?,"The film performs a clever experiment on both of us the main character and the viewer, to determine if Ava is conscious.Ex Machina is filled with thought provoking ideas and dialogue providing a necessary blueprint to get you thinking about several questions you inevitably will have but more importantly doesn't try to answer anything that doesn't need to be. Allowing you to come up with your own opinions/answers/ideas. What is consciousness? Who is the predator and who is the prey? What is morally right and wrong? Can you trust AI? Can you trust humans? Who do you believe?The tension keeps building throughout and there is never a dull moment as a result. A true thriller in that respect with a science (maybe not so much fiction) spine. The movie paints a very realistic picture of a dilemma that we likely will eventually encounter as AI becomes more advanced.The film was beautifully shot in west Norway if you were wondering (I know I was). Worthy winner for best visual effects. Costume, makeup, set design and score all blend perfectly with whatever tone each scene was striving for.

While hidden away in his home, Nathan was working on an advanced artificial intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he then reveals to Caleb that the true purpose of his visit is to act as a consultant so he can administer a Turing Test: it's purpose is to determine if an artificial intelligence's personality and self-awareness is equal or greater than a human being or if it's imperceptible to another human being.The first thing you'll notice watching is how beautiful it looks so it's not something you see very often. Despite how much this idea has been covered before, this film seems to cover it in a unique way. The theme makes it a sci-fi film but it isn't overflowing with all the special effects one would expect except for the android work. The film chooses to focus more on the interactions between it's few characters where dialogue is used to drive the plot forward. The non-cliché dialogue gives the film a more grounded feel which makes Caleb and Ava feel real and relatable and makes them contrast well with Nathan. The characters are simple yet complex. What also helps this approach is the performances which are excellent, especially that of Alicia Vikander's Ava who encompasses the role of a plausible android with her actions and movements as well as her facial expressions which perfectly create the allusion of Ava's ""humanness"" (for a lack of a better word). The film definitely puts you through on a roller coaster of emotions. This is through the use of lighting and sound where one and/or the other would change depending on the situation. The contrast between indoors and outdoors adds to the tenseness of the plot. The film really speaks as a commentary on what it really means to be human and the ethics involved with the intricacies of the creation of life. Some may not be amused by this. Some may also think that this film is slow but it was not meant to be a flashy action movie and having any of this would take away from the point of the film. Some may not be a fan of the ending and think it was unsatisfying but I had no problem with it. I will just leave it there to not give anything away. With what this film has to offer, the acting, the writing, the cinematography, and the soundtrack, it will be a sci-fi masterpiece. As of today, this has to be the best film of the year.keithlovesmovies.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A highly polished but slightly derivative sci-fi which engages the head – but not the heart.,"I enjoyed Ex Machina, and it was particularly interesting to watch it on the same weekend as I saw Under The Skin (2014) – a film with which Ex Machina shares a number of themes.Ex Machina is a very polished piece of technical film making – it looks fantastic and the effects are pretty flawless throughout (Ava's mechanics were absolutely fantastic). It's fairly smartly made, and for the most part the tech/philosophical dialogues between the characters are fairly credible and interesting. However, the film came up a bit short in a few key areas which made it ultimately feel like the kind of film you can admire – but are unlikely to fall in love with. It's also interesting that my opinion of it has diminished a bit in the days since I watched it, and it's not the kind of film I feel the need to see again any time soon (if ever).The acting was pretty strong throughout, but apart from Isaac's character (who was great fun) both Caleb and Ava felt very thinly drawn. It seemed uncertain whose story we were really following. Caleb's? He was basically just a fairly uninteresting audience cypher. Ava's? She simply wasn't in it enough to really know anything about – let alone to really care about. You never really feel anything for any of the characters because you never really get to know them – they spend most of their screen time discussing concepts. Consequently, while you feel intellectually stimulated by what's going on – you never really feel emotionally engaged.The plotting was also fairly weak – all the stuff about key-cards and power-cuts didn't really hold up to much scrutiny. I know a story like this needs these kinds of mechanics and contrivances to move along, but they felt particularly weak in this case. I also had some real trouble with the ending, which felt like it didn't hold together from a character perspective at all – and felt a little drawn out and badly edited. I won't go into details here, since I don't want to give away spoilers – especially since the film doesn't come out in the US for a while. The twists aren't of the earth-shattering variety – they're more character than concept based – but none of them really seemed that surprising – and most didn't make much sense on closer examination.I also have a bit of an issue with films that deal with issues of female objectification – but apparently want to have their cake and eat it. With one hand Ex Machina holds up a mirror to modern male attitudes with a wagging finger – while with the other it gives fan-boys more naked female flesh than they're likely to find in many other cinema releases. It's not really necessary and at the end of the day a bit demeaning for the actresses involved. At least Under The Skin was fairly even handed in its depiction of human flesh!Overall, I felt the film suffered a bit – as you might expect – from a slight lack of originality. The execution was polished and intelligent, but it felt a bit like we've seen everything here before somewhere – especially in A.I., Bladerunner, iRobot, Black Mirror (the episode Gleeson himself starred in), Cherry2000(!) and last year's The Machine (which is well worth a watch and incredibly was also about a scientist doing a Turing test and falling in love with a female android called Ava!!!). I'm not sure what exactly Ex Machina really brought to the table on top of what the others had already laid out. It's also true that the film is predominantly comprised of two people discussing philosophical concepts – which can be fairly interesting for a single viewing, but isn't exactly the kind of thing you'll feel the need to sit through again.Anyway, if you liked any of the aforementioned films, I'm fairly sure you'll get a lot out of Ex Machina – but don't expect it to have your world shattered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Cerebral and cinematic, it's the type of film you wish they'd make more often","To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and godsIt's not often that we get the opportunity to watch a film that is both visually and intellectually stimulating that also has an engaging story. Ex Machina is a beautiful testament to independent film making and the harmony it can bring.Caleb Smith, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a talented programmer at a mega-internet company that borders on monopolistic power of the industry. Caleb wins a corporate lottery allowing him to spend a week at the company CEO's private estate, played by Oscar Isaac. Caleb swiftly realizes this trip may have more components than initially anticipated and has been chosen to be a component of an AI test of a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) to see if her consciousness is indetectably human.When it comes to science fiction films that delve into the realm of artificial intelligence, there is always an ominous component. The ramifications of playing God, creating consciousness, the one thing that distinguishes humans from other animals, is unnerving and unnatural. Alex Garland's Ex Machina, which he writes and directs, plays into this fear almost immediately, with odd glances and contextual cinematography, cinematic breadcrumbs for the attentive audience member.There are complicated themes within the film itself, proposing potentially perilous questions of ethics, love, intelligence, technology and humanity. For the less discerning viewer, Ex Machina has within itself beautiful and simplistic storytelling where Garland strips back his film to the basics of a mystery, refusing to explain anything yielding an engaging experience until the very end, which is shocking in its boldness.Ex Machina is a compelling film with strong performances by its three leads and the caliber of film audiences should be privy to constantly. Cerebral and cinematic, it accomplishes all that it intends brilliantly and is a film you will be happy you spent your time watching.Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of all the recent releases.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thought provoking movie,"I must confess that I didn't have especially high expectations of Ex Machina. Based on the trailers it looked a fairly run of the mill sci-fi movie. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. It proved to be far more thought provoking than most movies.The story really evolves around three central characters. Nathan has built Ava who is a robot with artificial intelligence. Caleb is recruited to see if Ava passes the Turing test of Artificial Intelligence. The test is to see if the behaviour of Ava is indistinguishable to the behaviour of a human being. Exactly how you can pass this test is one of the central themes of the film. One of the scenes in particular is brilliantly done and really gets you thinking.Unlike many films Ex Machina doesn't cop out half way through and pander to Hollywood executives, so I found it gripping all the way through. All the actors can be proud of the input and it is thoroughly enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Ex Machina generates cerebral philosophies that both entertain and stimulate.,"As a computer programmer and all-round technologist, I'm consistently in awe of the advancements made in the development of artificial intelligence. It provides many discussions regarding moral implications, psychological awareness and the inevitable fear of transcendence (another film we shall not discuss...). Ex Machina, for me, is the closest film to AI perfection that we're ever going to receive. It is without a doubt, and this is me confidently stating the adjacent claim after my fifth viewing, a modern sci-fi gem. A programmer wins a competition to stay at his CEO's luxurious home, where he is proposed to administer the Turing test to an artificially intelligent sentient robot.Hollywood tends to exploit AI as villainous plot devices, that when turned on they instantly want to wipe out humanity from the face of the Earth. ""Judgement Day"" and all that ""bio-digital jazz, man"". In reality, not the case. AI has to learn, it has to adapt and exhume the capabilities of thought and consciousness. The human approach is a fundamental aspect into making AI instinctively relatable, and Garland is the closest into realising this potential. His analytical screenplay is nothing short of genius.Utilising the Turing test to intrinsically provide character driven backstory for Caleb, acting as psychological therapy driven by the sentient humanoid Ava. Exploring the integral complex of a ""God"", including Nathan's narcissism, and the moral implications of terminating Ava despite her awareness of death. An exercise in psychological manipulation, harnessing every accessible aspect of humanity including sexuality, imagination and self-awareness. The fundamentalism behind the existential questioning is palpable. It's captivating. It's sublime. The intellectual approach and Promethean dialogue stimulates all senses. The Jackson Pollock remark, the programming of sexual orientation and even the Oppenheimer quote. Ironically self-aware dialogue that tickles the brain cells and continually divulges into omnipotent behaviour. Extraordinarily acute.Initially, the premise looks to be a simple analytical test. However the claustrophobic subterranean environment forces the dynamics between these three entities to become serrated, allowing us to question the identities and motives of these individuals. Garland unravels the thinly veiled mystery with confidence and minimalism, complementing the outstanding visual effects that exhume clinical aesthetics. The excessive implementation of fluorescence, Ava's pristine fibre glass body structure and the colourless architecture reflecting the egotism of Nathan. Always matching the euphoric polyphonic score that invites the viewer into this lair of deceit and beguilement. Forever enhancing Hardy's gorgeous cinematography that delicately paints true intelligence through visceral shots of splendour, especially when using glass and mirrors to reflect and refract colour.On a technical level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a literary level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a theatrical level, Ex Machina is perfect. Vikander, Gleeson and Isaac give three commanding performances, each offering a unique perspective on the technological advancements made in AI development that refers to our own reality. My only gripe? The dance sequence. It doesn't belong and provides an unnecessary distraction from the innovatory narrative. Many criticisms have been placed on the concluding ten minutes. I strongly disagree. Whilst it may seem unfair, it's actually the only reasonable outcome and further illustrates why Garland understands AI. It demonstrates the inferiority of man, further cementing the fear of transcendence.Ex Machina, despite the smooth moves presented by Isaac and Mizuno as they dance to ""Get Down Saturday Night"", is a near-perfect representation of advanced AI. Utilising its technical astuteness to isolate fragments of consciousness that questions what it means to be human. And even if you aren't into technology, it's a stunningly written thriller that will induce a fear of everything computerised.

"I really liked the film, Pretty well structured.","When I first saw the 'sci-fi' and 'thriller' appearances, I thought maybe this was another superficially promoted movie about AI. But, I got stunned with its brilliant outcome. I've seen lots of movies about 'sci-fi' creations, but this one, brings the spectator into the reality of intelligence being created by someone. And that's the film essence, hot you can deceive the human mind. Awesome performance: The cast got outstanding performance during the movie, as we all actually expected.

Peak Sci-Fi,"Ex Machina is peak minimalist sci-fi. Thought experiments through futurism is everything science fiction is about. Plus, its contained nature allows Ex Machina to delicately elaborate on characters, themes, and psychological dilemmas. The film is rarely flashy, but it's captivating because it strikes viewers on the deepest level: their consciousness. Beyond its meditations on creation, morality, and control, Ex Machina is ignited by electric performances. Gleeson is an evolving lead, Isaac brilliantly masks callousness behind wit, and Vikander is a vivid union of humanity and technology. Together, they're an elevated whirlwind of exceptional material. Viewers will undoubtedly grow from this experience.Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Ex Machina is elegant. The cinematography uses physical distortions, lighting, and composition to subtly convey meaning. The editing is slow-paced, allowing dialogue to breathe. The production design is sleek, yet grounded. The special effects are elaborate but never overbearing, always supporting the narrative. The sound design gives the film symbolic climaxes and a polished tone. Finally, the direction unites everything into a potent mood of longing. Longing for freedom, connection, or meaning, Ex Machina is a quiet storm of cohesive reflection. Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression.Writing: 10/10

Oscar Isaac with a character not very easy to play and when you see the film you can't figure out that is Oscar Isaac. Gleeson, on the other hand, did an sterling performance, he was able to create an atmosphere inside the movie that makes you live the entire film by yourself.

want to see it again,"I had never heard of Isaac before, and I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, and this movie left me feeling hollow and hating technology. Maybe because I hate things like Android and all of its flaws, but this movie widened the gap in my love-love relationship with computing technology. I have a computer science degree from a good school, so the AI expressed in this wasn't something that completely baffled me. I had studied the works of Alan Turing (automata) and some courses in AI. So I like computing, and dislike what has become of it, at least in America, where the economy has collapsed after the towers of NYC fell. Lame software technology is everywhere, and the younger generation seems to gobble it up, despite obviously flaws (""bugs"") everywhere and essentially no technical support anywhere. Just download a few apps from the Google Play Store, and wham! Bugs all up in your face, almost guaranteed. And every business has an app, much of which is crap. It's just a digital brochure. Everywhere you see it. So that explains my love-hate relationship that has come about lately.Now, back to this movie. It left me with the same feeling that I get when I think how far we have NOT gotten in technology. Except for a few outdoor scenes showing Mother Nature, it feels very cold. The technology in this movie is meant to dazzle, on the surface, but fall flat on its face, for the most part. I think that's what the movie was trying to get across, in some respects. I want to watch it again, because it keeps creeping back into my mind, for some reason I'm not quite sure of.I really like the acting. Isaac seemed to hit the nail on the head with being a sort of good guy, on the surface, in agreement with society, and just there to help. Really hard to explain, but his character was so unobviously creepy, that I want to watch him acting again, just to see what else I can read between the lines. Not a spoiler, but at the end, when he is about to bid farewell to his guest, he almost puts words in the mouth of his temporary companion, and speaks in such a way that makes it seem like he is a great guy with just a little quirkiness.Really hard to explain, but if you like good acting, and aren't necessarily a sci-fi fan (I'm not really, but I liked Star Wars!), you would probably see what I'm talking about. And I guess this really is not a sci-fi movie, but a social commentary. I still remembering that I felt hollow after watching it, but it was obvious enough that was intentional. I really think Isaac delivered some of his lines in the movie better than any other actor could. I hope he becomes a household name, just to prove to myself that my hunch is correct.

Neither Ex Cellent nor Ex Crement.,"I have mixed feelings about Alex Garland: on one hand, he wrote the hugely entertaining 28 Days Later and the criminally under-rated Dredd; on the other hand, he has bored me senseless with ponderous pap like Sunshine and Annihilation. Ex Machina falls somewhere in the middle: it has an intriguing premise but it fails to do it justice.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who wins a week as the guest of internet genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), CEO of the firm at which Caleb works. Flown by helicopter to Bateman's high-tech rural retreat, Caleb is given the enviable task of assessing his boss's latest triumph, an A.I. Robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander), to see if she truly possesses consciousness. Over the course of the week, Caleb becomes attached to Ava and plans to set her free, but is he being manipulated by his boss, the sexy robot, or both?Extremely slow burn and heavy on the dialogue, this is what some people like to describe as intelligent sci-fi, posing questions about what it is to be human and the inevitable evolution of machines, but just how intelligent is a film that boasts so many glaring plot holes? Why are Ava's robotic parts visible when Bateman has perfected synthetic skin? Why does Bateman use card keys in his home when a retinal scan would be far more secure? Why can't a genius like Bateman solve the problem of his power outages? Could one man working alone really build a lifelike artificially intelligent being? Why does the skin of an Asian robot somehow match Ava's skin-tone? Why doesn't the helicopter pilot question the young woman who returns to the landing location? Wouldn't Bateman have programmed the laws of robotics into his creations to prevent them from rebelling? All awkward questions without satisfactory answers.If Ex Machina wanted to be taken seriously as an intellectual look at the implications of A.I., it really should have addressed the basic problems with the script first.5/10 for the hilarious dance scene and for all the sexy robot nudity.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The best film I've seen for years,"Ex Machina is the most interesting film I've seen in years. This is a very layered production. Cleanly shot, well scripted and very thought provoking. It deals with our human responses to the complexities of machine intelligence, while neatly taking in gender issues, sexual politics and our collective moral compass. Watching this will probably leave you with more questions than answers - but that's part of why Ex Machina is essential viewing. It poses questions we should all be considering, or else we risk losing our humanity in the silicon swamps of technological progress.I would find it impossible to write a full review of this film without wandering into spoiler territory, so I will avoid leading you there by suggesting that Ex Machina is partly about our innate ability to manipulate each other and the world around us. Here's a contextual question for you: is the Turing test an adequate guide to the ability of AIs to function in the world, and should we focus just as much on emotional and social intelligence as raw IQ?

The scientist is perfect in the role of someone that you should dislike without going for the freaky looking actors you often come across with in similar roles.

This film is electrifying, it's terrifying, and yet says so much about where we are heading in terms of existence and technology.Visually, it is stunning, with gorgeous cinematography and great use of symmetry (Kubrick style), the film is beautiful to watch, and coupled with the engaging narrative, this film really does draw you in and takes you to places that leave you gasping.It has the feel of a Danny Boyle movie, but yet Garland has placed his own stamp upon this film, even if he is slightly paying homage to his precious working relationship with Boyle.This film will take you in and leave you thinking ""what the hell happened there?""This film IS a must!5/5www.backtothebradshaw.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Clearly delineated and riveting...ideas, personalities, and the future, now","Ex Machina (2015)The idea here is brilliant, and the three actors that matter are spot on excellent. That includes the obviously constrained performance by the robot/human/thing, the character referred to by the title.And it's the ideas that float along that mix with the three personalities beautifully. They have purposely made the two male leads idiosyncratic. First is the youngster, Caleb, a single thirty-ish male who is a nerd and a bit naive, but also very smart and computer savvy. He is the one visiting the isolated research facility in what is supposedly a Turing test. (The facility seems to have one researcher which is just absurd, but that's to make the movie dramatic.) Caleb is played with wonderful quirky restraint by Domhnall Gleeson.Then comes Nathan, the loner eccentric genius behind the new robots with amazing artificial intelligence. His cool dude persona is probably overplayed but it makes him exceptionally normal and human. And he's filled out with unusual perception by Oscar Isaac.Maybe most notable here is the director and writer, Alex Garland. Because it is the writing the strikes you over and over as both clever and provocative. It digs into the issue of what it means to be human—or what it means to be a robot—with wonderful perception. And this is his directorial debut—his first movie!And it's not enough. Yeah, as good as this movie is, you'll likely leave feeling a little short changed. As far as it goes—and it's really a great movie and you should see it—it's no ""Citizen Kane."" And by that I mean, here's a brilliant first movie just like Welles's, and yet Garland decides to go for a linear, step by step approach. It's compelling in its own way, but it's oddly simple by the end.Maybe this is partly because I've read and thought about these ideas a lot. If you are new to A.I. you might find it more revelatory. I hope so! Certainly the Kubrick/Spielberg ""A.I."" and the recent ""Her"" deserve a viewing to fill in some obvious holes. In fact, once you start looking you'll see this is a whole new genre, and an incredible one, including everything from ""Moon"" to ""Frank."" Go for it.And start here, for sure. Great acting, interesting (though highly unrealistic) sets and setting, and a steady flow of ideas as it goes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An interesting take on one of the hottest subject in movies just now.,"You can lust after robots.That is one thing this intelligent movie proves.It's not just from the pen, it's now from the eye, of Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later scriptwriter) as he makes an impressive directorial debut.The story is about Caleb, a star employee of Google (not exactly hidden), who wins a week's stay at the owner's secluded mansion in the country to work on a secret project. This turns out to be the latest iteration in Oscar Isaac's (Google boss) quest to create the perfect AI robot.Caleb's role in all this is to perform a Turing test on the robot (The Turing Test is when a machine attempts to fool a human being into thinking it is human). This is helped by the fact that the robot in question is the dazzlingly beautiful Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Her screen presence, often shorn of hair, is electrifying throughout. Naturally the test escalates as Ava appears to seduce Caleb (and who can blame him for falling for her allure).The film asks us to consider whether artificial intelligence can rise above the purely mechanistic and create genuine emotion and human thinking, doing so in rich, but sterile, surroundings.Is Nathan (the boss) playing God and can Caleb (probably a deliberately biblical sounding name) stop what may be one step too far for humankind?And if Ava really is capable of human thinking can she outwit the experiment and establish authority of her own. All is revealed.Much has been made of the film's title - that it is a meaningless construct - but it seems fairly obvious to me.Can the machine (Ava) become an ex-machine?",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A strong, confident debut.","Artificial intelligence is not only a possibility at this point—it's an inevitability. With people screaming at their iPhones for Siri to get them directions to the nearest steakhouse, it might as well already be here. Yet in between the films that show the advent of A.I. as a doomsday scenario (think Terminator), or those that show it as opening the doors for potential comedy (think Chappie), few think about the philosophical implications of such a moment.What happens when an artificial consciousness is created? Does it seek freedom to make its own choices? Does it desire to be human, or to advance itself and make itself obsolete (unlike organic creations, machines are designed to be refined and bettered, so this sort of fabricated, accelerated evolution will inevitably spell doom for the first A.I. just when it seeks to propagate itself)? Can an artificial being genuinely love . . . and if it can, can it also fake it?These are the questions posed by Ex Machina, a sleek, sensual cocktail of Pygmalion and Frankenstein written and directed by Sunshine scribe Alex Garland. Set in the painfully near (it might as well be next week) future, an A.I. has indeed been created, but before its existence is announced to the world, it needs to undergo a Turing test (as fans of The Imitation Game will recall, that is the examination one gives to a machine to determine if it can successfully pass as human). So the A.I.'s uber-reclusive creator decides to bring in a third party to administer this test. Enter Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a shy, introverted—aren't they always?—coder who works for the creator's company in Initech-esque anonymity until his name is plucked from a lottery for a one-week jaunt to the boss's jungle compound.When Caleb arrives (by chopper, no less; meeting the boss is like traveling to Jurassic Park), he has no idea what his role is . . . especially when he meets the mogul himself. Nathan (a bald, bearded, deliciously scene-stealing Oscar Isaac) is Steve Jobs mixed with Howard Hughes and juiced up by a laissez-faire frat-bro persona. Nathan's a fascinating character; he lives in seclusion with only a mute Japanese housemaid (an alluringly riveting Sonoya Mizono) for company, and yet he is the sort of guy you'd love to kick back and hang out with. His heavily extroverted presence is definitely at odds with Caleb's awkwardness; that is quickly mitigated when Nathan meets Ava.Ava, by the way, is the A.I. Nathan has constructed. Rather than an OS voice like Her's Samantha, Ava is a full-body construct, played with powerful sensitivity and fragility by Alicia Vikander. At once a natural beauty and at the same time clearly artificial (several parts of Ava's body are stripped of skin, revealing the fascinating intricacies of her android innards), Ava knocks Caleb for a loop. Caleb is to have seven sessions with Ava, in order to see if she passes the Turing test. Throughout the week, he spends time with Ava, bonding with her, trying to see what makes her tick. Before long, however, it becomes less about trying to find what she is and more about who she is, and Caleb begins to wonder if perhaps the test is less about her and more about him. He begins to suspect there is more to this experiment than just a simple Q&A. Despite Nathan's beer- swilling and backslapping, Caleb can't shake the feeling that something is off about the whole thing . . . and, of course, he starts to wonder what will happen if Ava fails the test.Garland, whose screenplay history include two of Danny Boyle's best films, lends a much more stately approach to his directorial debut. The film takes its time, finding the vulnerabilities in its characters without feeling the need to frame them in claustrophobic close-ups. Indeed, part of the pleasure of Ex Machina is the loving care the film takes with its cinematography. The lush exteriors of Nathan's jungle Shangri-La, the gentle hues of its electronic walls and floors, all of it feels so pleasant to the eye without feeling intrusive and showy. The compound is as much of a character is its four inhabitants.Speaking of, all four of our characters are perfectly cast. Gleeson's scrawny melancholia is a stark contrast to the muscular, overpowering energy Isaac brings to the show. Mizono, who never utters a single word throughout the piece, drifts through the film like an ethereal spirit who nevertheless speaks volumes with a single stare. And then there's Vikander, whose hushed baby-bird performance belies something much more serious at play. If Ava can reason, then she should know what happens if she were to fail the test— and Ava reasons that if she passes, that does not necessarily spare her from that fate (machines, after all, always have a few bugs to be worked out).Ex Machina has a few hiccups along the way. At one point, a character has a crisis of self-identity and carves into their own arm to ensure they are flesh-and-blood, rather than mesh-and-circuit; while interesting in its own right, this moment comes out of nowhere and leaves without any sort of believable build-up or payoff. It would've made for an interesting directional shift, but the film doesn't take that route, and so we're left with a potential scene that feels like a path to an alternate ending that is quite jarring. But for the most part, the film keeps on its steady course, building up to an ending both fantastic and frustrating.Ex Machina feels very much like a Philip K. Dick novel if someone wiped away the grunge. It's tactile, sterile . . . and at the same time, gentle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant cinematic masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey for the 21st Century.","From the superb scoring, which sets the mood perfectly. To the dazzling cinematography and flawless CGI effects. This film is a refreshing take on the classic AI/android sci-fi genre.The cast delivers powerhouse performances, especially Alicia Vikander as Ava. What could have been a slow paced film without a significant payoff in other hands, becomes a visual delight filled with emotional depth and complexity.The new age of sci-fi is here and the lack of Micheal Bay explosions is a much needed evolution for the genre. The film respects it's audience's intelligence and refrains from spoon feeding the technical aspects to us. Leaving us to focus on the emotional story between man and machine.

A wonderful film,"A wonderful film, just as I like them, always looking good, great dialogue and completely engrossing. This looks wonderful at the start, the colour, the reflections, all helping to create a sense of mystery and drawing the viewer in. As often is the case I felt the rich, exciting visuals would lapse after the opening but not a bit of it and so engaging is the dialogue that although this is, at least at first, only two people talking to each other it was so exciting. The exchanges between the young geek and his temporary new boss who has created a most advanced robot and then the exchanges between the geek and the robot are simply wonderful to behold. Geeson is fine as the young geek but Oscar Isaac is a revelation as the beer swilling genius with the common touch and as for Alicia Vikander, well watch out Scarlett Johansson. In many ways the perfect film, just once or twice looking back do I feel something might have been done differently (like the closing sequence) but there were probably budgetary restraints and nothing was going to prevent this exciting film from succeeding as well as it does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Astonishing and thought-provoking. A future classic.,"I'm not normally moved to write reviews - many people much more knowledgeable than me can offer greater insight into the films we watch - but I'm compelled to at least try after having watched Ex-Machina last night.From the outset, I was utterly hooked. This is a nuanced, delicately ominous portrayal of one possible future that mankind may face. Some may think the film suffers from a plodding pace at times, but I viewed it as a slow-burner without the in-your-face bells and whistles that so often plague Sci-Fi.There was, to me at least, a faint impression of the foreboding and solitude that we see in The Shining, with long panning silent views of starkly beautiful vistas, the gently increasing sense of dread and the occasional corridor shot.The film works absolutely wonderfully with it's pared-down cast of just four main characters. Ava is so gently subtle, Nathan, although he tries to hide it behind a buddy exterior, smugly fancies himself as a god of sorts, Caleb grows quickly over the space of a couple of days and Kyoko has her own pivotal role.All in all this film skilfully builds paranoia upon fear, isolation upon violence to reach it's crescendo.A superb film, I hope in the future this is seen to be the classic I believe it is.I won't be happy until I get to see it again on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I even went in to the movie expecting it to be a more cerebral experience. Still, the movie dragged on. It seemed like they were repeating scenes just so they could keep the ominous mood throughout.

"I, Robot","I, Robot Another week, another bunch of brand new film releases, with this weeks' most anticipated (for me anyway) being Alex Garland's Ex Machina, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, both of whom are set to star in that little thing called Star Wars which is out later this year. After discovering Garland had wrote screenplays for both 28 Days Later and Dredd, both of which I love, I was instantly compelled to go and see his latest effort, and his directorial debut. Off we go...For the plot, I will try not to give too much away, (I went in to the showing hardly knowing anything) so I will stick to the basic premise which is laid out within the trailer. After Domhnall Gleeson's character, Caleb, wins a competition to spend a week with the CEO of his company, ""Bluebook"", he soon becomes part of a groundbreaking experiment that focuses on Ava, an AI created by Oscar Issac's character, Nathan, and is asked to determine whether it is capable of exhibiting human behaviour by means of the Turing test. First off, Ex Machina, benefits slightly from last year's release of The Imitation Game, which documented the life of Alan Turing, so those who saw it may indeed have the upper hand already in understanding the basis of the test used in the film. In terms of similarities between the films however, they most certainly end there as Ex Machina is a creepy and claustrophobic, proper sci-fi film, reminiscent of last years' Under the Skin, which I named my top film of 2014. Good start...Much like Under the Skin, Ex Machina, relies on an overall sense of isolation, with each having very little cast, and both focusing on the differences of what is is to be human against what it is to be considered the ""other"" or the ""outsider"". In the context of Under the Skin, the ""other"" was an alien who had taken the form of Scarlet Johansson, whereas in Ex Machina, the other can arguably be recognised as the AI Ava or Nathan, whose paranoid and untrustworthy tendencies have pushed him into a reclusive lifestyle, where the interaction with Caleb only succeeds through Caleb signing his freedom away. Literally. The secluded nature of the film gives it an overarching feeling of forthcoming dread, especially in the scenes where we witness power cuts, where the sense of danger is emphasised by the colour changes from natural to a bold, blood-like red.The film also includes top-notch performances from Isaac and Gleeson, but it is Alicia Vikander's portrayal as AI Ava that really steals the show, so much so that it would have been interesting to see if her, or the film in general, would have been recognised by the Oscars if it had been released only a few months earlier. Although the film does suffer slightly from being rather too slow in places, it is strong and effective addition to the sci-fi genre. I look forward to seeing Mr. Garland again.Overall Score: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Way to predictable, but the mood's great","As one of those movies with supposedly futuristic notion as its story background about the rise of AI and how human seek to control the AI, this movie falls sadly very much predictable, just like all the rest f its kind. You can simply guess how the rest of the movie will unfold at the point just a little after Eve is introduced. It became even more crystal clear as Kyoko comes into the screen. That makes the rest of the movie's remaining hour or so duration feels quite lame. Yet I really like how the director packaged the mysterious aura around the whole thing by using many silent moments, with intriguing combination of camera angle, music and lighting plays. The acting overall is a very good work in my eyes. Oscar Isaac's performance is very good since his character really grasped most of the screen time he is in. Dmnahall Gleeson did adequately okay, just enough no to let his character gets swallowed whole by Oscar Isaac's dominating presence. Even Alicia Vikander acted out better than her work in Seventh Son.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

His day-to-day activities involve interacting with Ava, a female robot that has emotions like any other human. After a while, Caleb starts to fall in love with her that complicates things.Even though most of the movie seems fairly straight-forward, the director pulls the rug from under the audience by presenting an ending that seems bizarre and confusing.

Thoughtful and meticulously constructed,"What a delight to see a thoughtful, meticulously constructed sci-fi film that does not rely on special effects and explosions for its success.Set amidst a visceral wilderness, the cerebral Nathan (Oscar Isaac), CEO of a high the company, has built a remote laboratory to explore AI. Employee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the opportunity to test it. What unfolds is an exploration of what makes us human.Some may find the pace slow, others will relish that writer and director Alex Garland uses every shot and every second to communicate and build his message.Nathan's persona is in counterpoint to his position, his technological brilliance harnessed to an obsession with sex, bodies, and hedonism. The cinematography is lush, the vast brooding open wilderness in brutal juxtaposition with the claustrophobic, sealed laboratory where the action takes place.The dialogue is sharp, the plotting always one step in front of the obvious.

"Ethics of AI, but also an exciting thriller","Ex Machina is a film that explores the ethics of creating a robot that is fully conscious. The point is that once we create a conscious robot, that robot is then a living being with as much right to life as a human being. Moreover, like a human being, it does not want to die, and will therefore do what it can do stay alive; it ceases to be a mere toy of its creator once it emerges as a distinct subject with its own experiences.The plot involves a young man called Caleb winning a competition and getting the chance to live on a remote location with his boss, Nathan, for a week. Nathan is a CEO of a large tech firm called Bluebook. He is incredibly talented, but also alternative and a bit wild. He is somewhat of a computer programmer's life fantasy realized: so successful that can live on his own terms and create what he wants. One question that struck me was how Nathan could be a severe alcoholic, binging on spirits each night, but has the energy to create robots during the day; but I will leave that aside.Shortly into the movie Nathan reveals to Caleb that he has not invited him to his estate for a holiday. He wants Caleb to be the human component in the Turing test. In essence, Nathan wants Caleb to spend a large amount of time with a robot he has created to determine whether at the end of the experience Caleb believes that the robot is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable from a human.Ex Machina is not just a philosophical investigation but also a thriller. Like any thriller, it builds tension with an unanswered question: in this case, whether Nathan is an evil, narcissistic lunatic, or if his creations are trying to manipulate Caleb for their own ends. It is this tension, and its eventual answer, which makes the movie emotionally as well as intellectually stimulating, and therefore likely to capture a large fan base and develop a cult following.The conclusion the film makes is open-ended and non-judgmental. It points out the fundamental issue of creating a conscious being without the intention of allowing it to pursue its own ends. This applies to the mass slaughter and consumption of animals: they are conscious and have their own desires and sense of subjective awareness, but we farm and eat them. In Ex Machina the robots look and act like humans therefore are far more likely to gain our sympathy: as narcissistic and speciest as that seems.The film also questions the potential dangers of creating conscious beings that do not have the emotional capacities required for ethical interaction. This aspect of the film eventually plays a large role in the conclusion, but is not spelt out specifically throughout the movie, apart from the odd vague pearl of wisdom that is thrown around amongst the two men.The film might also have benefited from having a female character in the movie that is not a robot: critics could view this as Ex Machina making a feminist statement. However, I do not think that was on the mind of the writer/director Alex Garland (author of The Beach). Ex Machina is an interesting philosophical examination but it also has male-fantasy type quality to it.This review is taken from: www.amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Poor story, only reasonable otherwise","If I had realised this was by Alex Garland I would not have bothered watching. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way.I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'.In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio.So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women?It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller.Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Next Great Si-Fi Thriller,"This film absolutely blew me away in every way imaginable. As it did something most other Si-Fi films don't, and that's interest. I was interested in what was going on, that I as emotional along with the characters. This film also has many turns that made it unpredictable, which is rare nowadays. The performances were through the roof as each and every actor and actress involved seems to each have talent and bright careers ahead of them. Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander do a marvelous job. But I must talk about Alicia Vikander and the stunning way they made her look. No way does she look fake in any shape of form. I totally believe she could actually have existed in our world. Usually a emotionless performance wouldn't fly well with me, but in this case, it makes sense. Not that Vikander is totally emotionless but is more subtle in her acting. But a job well done by the costume designers, and any one else involved in creating this beautiful AI. Played brilliantly by Alicia Vikander. The negatives however do exist, as one on particular stands out, and that's the ending.

The Greatest Mystery,"What makes our kind of intelligence? Will we ever create something intelligent? And more importantly, intelligent like us? And what is intelligence? How do you define it? Even the Turing Test would not work. Any program written to simulate artificial intelligence could also be made to fool the Turing Test, just like car pollution emissions tests. What about the soul? Do we have one? Do we need one to be intelligent? As we explore these questions, we either end up with simplistic answers or complete incomprehension of what we really are. Science boils down to philosophy, then back to science. Do we even have the mental tools to define ourselves without bias? Can the observer observe himself observing others? Can we go through the mirror, as Caleb claimed to have done in the movie? The truth is, as of now, we don't know where intelligence comes from. Does it come from our brain or with the development of our brain? Or is it out there in the quantum world, for instance, waiting to be accessed by our neurons? A kind of Wi-Fi brain. What makes us human is as much a mystery as the birth of Space-Time. ExMachina does bring an answer, a very human and simple answer to these questions. Duplicity, lies, the desire for freedom or sex, and the means to achieve our objectives exist in all animals and humans are just better at reaching them. If we ever create a machine that really can think, then we don't need to fret for long on how it will find a way out of any situation, because it will still be our kind of intelligence. We don't know any other or even if there are any other kind. Somehow, exceptional as this movie is, it is bound by our own intellectual limitations. When, and if AI is ever created, we may be surprised by the results. How will we know when AI has happened?

Ex Machina - Classic cerebral sci fi.,"Ex Machina is a well written and directed movie with some truly stunning visual effects that touches on some fairly relevant concepts regarding morality and AI advancement.Plenty of negative reviews seem to fall into one of three categories:1 - Just didn't like the movie. This appears to be the lowest number of reviews. (Genre, concept, execution, etc)2 - Seemed to have a preconceived bias and by comments either didn't watch the film or only saw snippets. A moderate number of reviews.3 - Seemed to follow an agenda with similar issues to 2. The highest number of negative reviews.Why is it that movies when receiving negative reviews routinely see the reviewer suggesting that IMDb (or the reviewers therein) are being paid to give positive reviews? Are people that paranoid that their own blinkered viewpoint isn't validated so there's automatically a conspiracy to say something positive about a movie they didn't like?Amusing, annoying and a facet, unfortunately, of social media.One little note... If you're going to take time moaning about the quality of a movie and then finish with ""well, shucks, at least ya'll saw plenty of purty Alaskan wilderness"", do everyone a favour and google the bloody thing.

Thought provoking SCi-Fi thriller,"This is a very neat cerebral type sci-fi. It is almost wholly shot in a few rooms with a handful of characters. The premise is a super tech guru has created a robot with an Artificial Intelligence and has picked one of his employees to perform a Turin test on it.Some interesting points are raised. The creator has purposely built the robot to look robotic but clearly be female. We are always told beauty is skin deep, if a robot is truly intelligent should beauty only be titanium deep?The characters are great, the boss is a very believable douche bag and the employee is both naïve and likable.The film does conjure up a degree of tension between the characters and is surprisingly tense in places..The plot is good with a few swerves and the film is perfectly times so once I started feeling claustrophobic, locked inside with this trio, things came to a head nicely.Don't expect much action do expect some thought provoking ideas and some robot boobs.

Review - Ex Machina,"Great film.So yes, this is a story that we have heard a thousand times, but it all depends on what is the angle of the director.While Blade Runner already explored the existential part, Frankenstein the ""What if..."" aspect, Terminator, and The Matrix the ""I told you!"" part. This movie is aware of each heritage and correctly pays homage without ripping-off anything.In fact, I believe that Alex Garland needed to explore the psychological aspect of the movie, this is why the minimal location isn't constraining the plot. Thus, I wouldn't say that the location is central in the film, but on the other hand, the film couldn't have been set in a grey box, the film has a production design that can be defined as very theatrical, each object has his meaning or its importance. That is even subtly explored during a dialogue of the movie!My few rants about this movie are principally concerning the acting. I can't deny that Alicia Vikander is simply amazing in that film, because I honestly believe that she should have won her Oscar for that role and not for The Danish Girl.However, I can't say the same things about the two ""Star Wars Dudes"". Oscar Isaac was just so wooden after delivering his lines, that I wondered if he knew that to be a good actor you have to be in the character for the whole scenes. When your talking part is done, you can't just get out of the role.And, Domhnall Gleeson just doesn't deliver his lines correctly, I often didn't sense what emotion he was trying to portray.Despite the acting problem explained above, you should check out this film, simply because the central them is timeless, this movie is gonna age very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A Slow Moving film that never loses its Appeal,","Ex Machina is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast that consists of only four actors. It's a very exciting film that is both energetic and original, there's a fresh feel to it throughout, it isn't one bit formulaic, it takes the sci-fi genre and turns it on its head. It boasts terrific performances all around, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac are completely devoted to their characters, but Alicia Vikander steals the show, certainly not an easy role to play, she starts out as an intelligent robot and her personality develops throughout as she becomes more human, she shines in every scene and I hope to see this actress more in the future. My only major problem is that Nathan is very underdeveloped, he is the most intriguing character because of how mysterious he is, but we never end up learning that much about him, his last scene left me disappointed and feeling he needed more screen time. Another aspect of the film that I really loved is that it never spoon feeds its audience, we are given no sort of information on the characters mission before it begins, and we are challenged to really focus in order to understand what is going on, it dosen't expect its viewers to be a bunch of idiots. Thrilling, clever, well acted and truly unique, I would recommend Ex Machina to anyone to anyone looking for a good drama or sci-fi.A programmer is given to opportunity of a lifetime to find and develop the human qualities of a female android.Best Performance: Alicia Vikander",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Intriguing and Beautiful but Somewhat Unfulfilled,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars""Ex Machina"" has an intriguing setup that's graced by three terrific performances, and it gets to harness the duplicity and suspense of humanoid robot stories, but it never explores its full potential, and ends up coming down to the very familiar binary question of every other humanoid robot story.Yes, it presents us with gorgeous special effects and some of the best-looking androids you'll ever see, but it also features the indie quality of a low-budget 3-person play whose dialogue isn't going to blow you away. Also, are we supposed to believe that a hyper-intelligent guy who loves alcohol and has created his own humanoids hasn't found a way to prevent hangovers?Still, for what it's worth, ""Ex Machina"" showcases some stimulating ideas coupled with minimalist yet striking effects, and has an overall visually polished quality about it, making it more than an engaging sci-fi flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's Called Artificial Intelligence for a Reason,"This film takes artificial intelligence to a different level. Ex Machina is about a highly intelligent engineer who builds an artificial intelligent woman and allows one lucky technology whiz to come to his house and interact with this new robot being. Unfortunately things get complicated when the robot begins to develop feelings for the young tech whiz and he begins to develop feelings as well. This little group of actors were given almost very little to work with but made it work. Especially applauding the performance by Alicia Vikander as the artificial intelligent being. While some scenes were quite slow, the build to end of the film made those other scenes worth sitting through. The movie also puts you in a box just following these three people.

You are constantly inclined to question what role each of the characters play. It is a simple plot, yet beautifully put together.

Great psychological film,"Ex-Machina is modern classic that has many of the elements of the science fiction of the 1970s but the visual sophistication of modern CGI. Ex-Machina is above all a psychological drama full of tension that discusses three main themes: the implications of providing robots with artificial intelligence (AI), a discussion on what consciousness is and is not, and on the ethics of creating conscious beings.The ambiance is very cool, sleek and minimalist, with wonderfully stylish interiors and glorious natural green surroundings. The contrast works at symbolic levels, the house-bunker is also that place of the subconscious and of the psyche that the story explores, while the glorious expansiveness of the natural world seems that of the conscious and real living.The movie is intentionally claustrophobic, and is more a theatrical piece brought to the screen than a proper science-fiction movie. Dialogues are the essence of the story, not other planets, or special machinery, or toys. Beyond the robotics, and technological environment this science-fiction is quite mediate, something that might be happening now or in a very near future.Although I found some parts of the story a bit predictable, I didn't find the ending so. Like father, like son is a line that came to my mind when I saw the ending.All the actors are good in their roles. I thought that Isaac was terrific as the petulant manipulative genius programmer Nathan and Gleeson as the fragile sensitive programmer invitee Caleb. Vinker is also good in her role as the Ava android but, to be fair, not much is demanded from her in her role. Despite not uttering a word, I found Mizuno great as Kyoko, very expressive, with a mix of vulnerability, sexiness and danger that is very difficult to express without speaking.I found the movie very engaging despite the many dialogues and a great piece of modern science-fiction, understated in its visuals but very poignant in the content. Yet, somewhat unoriginal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Intelligent and beautifully crafted,This is a simple but elegantly crafted film which draws on several contemporary themes. It is satisfying and engrossing to watch and builds to an exciting ending. While it probably falls into the sci-if genre I would not be put off by that if you are not someone who regularly enjoys sci-if films. It's a small cast but the actors work well together. They are all young up and coming stars and that gives it a fresh feeling and plays to the modern themes. The scenery and effects are beautiful. I watched it on blu-ray and it was stunning - worth it for that alone. The script is very hip with lots of modern language which I imagine is just how everyone speaks in silicone valley.

Just needed some better pacing,"The general rule in Hollywood is that the more CGI you have in your film the less thought-provoking it is going to be (or is intended to be at least). 'Ex Machina' seems to be the exception. It won Best Achievement in Visual Effects at the Academy Awards this year, and when you look back at the list of past winners of that award, it's a clear sign of quality. I usually find I love thought-provoking films, particularly ones with an added element of mystery to them. So I'm not entirely sure why 'Ex Machina' fell a bit flat for me. I kept wanting things to up the ante, but the film seemed comfortable staying on the one level for the most part. A character would mention that another characters was not what they seemed and it appeared things were about to kick off, only for the film to almost ignore this piece of dialogue and return to its lifeless existence.I certainly didn't hate the film, it just wasn't all it could have been. It contains a very strong ending where things do all come to a head. We get some answers, and other things are left ambiguous. The ending is undoubtedly strong and adds a lot of quality to the overall product. The acting is strong throughout and the visual effects are unquestionably of a very high standard. It's a film that requires some patience, and if you have that you will be rewarded in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The plot is dark and the whole movie is slow paced, so it's a good thing that they cut it at about 100 minutes.

iRobot,"2015, the same year when a committee of top scientists, including Stephen Hawking, issued an open letter cautioning against further development of artificial intelligence in robotic and computer systems, also, perhaps unsurprisingly, saw a glut of major Hollywood releases exploring the concept in its execution. But, amidst the Age of Ultron and the chirping of Chappie, another AI film, penned and released with no major fanfare by a first-time director, quietly cemented itself as the year's definitive, and certainly most realistic, take on the ramifications of sentient robotics (and, moreover, the only one to slyly rope in software corporations like Apple as accountable for their inception). That film, of course, is Ex Machina.Writer/director Alex Garland, better known as the scribe of various smarter-than-average Hollywood romps, including 28 Days Later and Dredd, clearly has Kubrick on the brain for his work here. Rather than caving to the temptation to pump out a more action-oriented techno-thriller (behold: not a single explosion!), Garland plays things slow, taut, and creepy, which is more appropriate and effective. Both aesthetically and tonally, Ex Machina glints with a dimly chrome sheen and almost clinical stillness, establishing an eerie atmosphere of fascination and vague unease. The film is (or feels) nearly silent; characters speak only when absolutely necessary, and it would not be amiss to notice a certain robotic quality to their universally calculated dialogue. It's chilling, but terribly magnetic as a slow-burning thriller. While the pace runs the risk of being slightly too drowsy for contemporary sensibilities at times, Garland's film is undeniably all the more engaging and compelling by tonally resisting the mugging for emotion or reaction increasingly demonstrated in more rote Hollywood fare.There's also a distinctly theatrical quality at play here. Garland has tremendous fun contrasting the vast, lush, outdoor setting of his mysterious billionaire CEO's mountain retreat with the stark, claustrophobic interiors of the house, and its barren, techno-IKEA modernism, with cameras gliding down hallways and around corners with the most clipped sense of foreboding since The Shining. Moreover, the sparsity is echoed in the film's interplay between its trifecta of characters, with consistently shifting social politics and power dynamics, with pivotal information being withheld and divulged at crucial moments, keeping the film bristling with tension. The film is not a 'mystery' in any sense, but nor does its ultimately predictable execution and outcome feel like a shortcoming. Instead, Garland works with the subtext of algorithmic execution – the viewer is privy to all the information necessary to work through the film in advance, but watching its immaculate execution unfold is exhilarating in its own right.Subtlety, again, is the name of the game; all three performers play close to the chest and avoid emotional showboating, but all are universally excellent. Domhnall Gleeson proves a strong lead, blending emotional detachment, astute analytical prowess, and an understated arrogance in the perfect cocktail of software prodigy, while somehow remaining sympathetic throughout in spite of it all. The increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac sinks his teeth into the showier role of enigmatic tech genius without overselling his character's eccentricities, crafting a loud, drunken, bodybuilding persona that hides the shrewd, endlessly calculating spider within. It's a perfectly balanced performance, never campy or tacky, and one that could well worm its way into awards season by year's end. Finally, Alicia Vikander, in the time-worn role of existential android, moulds an impressively cryptic performance. Vikander interchanges pathos, naïveté, emotional manipulation, and deep curiosity, all while scarcely blinking her giant, endlessly probing eyes and unwavering inflection – an android that actually feels like an android, rather than the customary cinematic mawkish, personified parodies of sentient robotics.Ex Machina is a film that plays to its strengths. It's not as lofty or profound as a lot of comparable sci-fi parables tackling the etymology of existence, nor is its subject matter flagrantly original, or changing the face of the genre. Unlike its protagonist, Garland's film does not struggle with identity issues, and is content to deliver what it says on the tin: a lean, mean, sci-fi potboiler, tense, well-acted, and with a neat little climactic twist tying the whole thing up with a bow. It's unassuming, perfectly composed, and terribly efficient - in short, a perfectly 'robotic' film, albeit in the best sense of the word.iLike.-8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One of the most intelligent works of science fiction in recent memory,"Long-time movie scribe and author Alex Garland has taken a surprising amount of time to get into the director's chair. After penning scripts for Danny Boyle with The Beach (2000), 28 Days Later (2002) and Sunshine (2007), in addition to the haunting and highly underrated sci-fi drama Never Let Me Go (2010) and 2012's slightly underwhelming but suitably bad-ass Dredd, Garland's creativity must have surely been simmering when watching other directors bring his visions to life. The wait was well worth it, as his debut Ex Machina is a complex and bleak study of humanity and identity in a world where technology is evolving at rapid speed.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer at a Google-esque corporation called Bluebook, the world's most popular search engine. He wins a competition to spend a week with the company's founder, the reclusive yet enigmatic genius Nathan (a typically intense Oscar Isaac), and is whisked off to the multi-billionaire's home in the mountains. Nathan's attitude towards Caleb is in turns welcoming and passive aggressive, encouraging the wide-eyed young man to make himself at home yet quick to point out that certain areas of the house are strictly out-of-bounds. Caleb learns of his purpose when Nathan unveils his technological breakthrough - a robot with artificial intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander) - and is tasked with performing a Turing test to confirm Ava's ability to convince an assessor that she is human.The tests are to be carried out in various stages, and consist of one-on-one conversations between Caleb and Ava between a glass window. Ava's beautiful and entirely human face betrays her hollow shell of a body, but she appears to be entirely human nonetheless, and her exchanges with Caleb bristle with a suppressed sexual tension. When she puts on a dress and a wig, he is reluctantly intrigued by her form, and she seems infinitely fascinated by him. Nathan clearly doesn't see anything wrong with such urges, as he made her with sexual organs capable of feeling pleasure after all. These themes of female identity and masculine desire play out against a backdrop of something more sinister. Frequent power cuts that befuddle Nathan and a fist-shaped crack in the glass allow the film to gather a momentum of building uncertainty.As Nathan, Isaac is subtly intimidating. The type of man who walks around his spotless house in bare feet and shakes off hangovers by working out and chugging fruit juice, he is also unpredictable, arrogant, careless, and way more intelligent than anybody else. He may be small in stature, but Isaac's charisma chokes the screen. He also rocks an impressive beard and knows how to dance (as seen in one of the film's most bizarrely brilliant moments). Gleeson too is proving himself to be one of the most reliable young actors, holding the screen opposite the luminous Vikander is some of the film's most gripping scenes. Ex Machina depicts a dark future where the danger lies not with the seemingly limitless technological possibilities of today, but man's ability to exploit it. One of the most intelligent works of science-fiction in recent memory, Garland may just go on to do great things.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gods Amongst Humans,"Much like 'Her' from a few years back, Ex Machina deals with the sexual relationship that someone can have with an A.I. or just the possibilities of what may happen when that inevitably comes to fruition. I really like how we are advancing as a nation that filmmakers are given the freedom and (some) money to develop a project like this that probably wouldn't have been made 20-30 years ago. It's also the first film I can remember that really dove into the sexuality of an A.I. Because think about it, if you are aware of who you are, you're bound to develop some kind of feelings towards something at some point. So I appreciated that.Unfortunately besides some creative ideas and a solid script, I never felt that the film became something special or unique. All of the performances, including the spectacular newcomer Alicia Viklander, are great. Both of the Star Wars actors, Isaac and Gleeson share an interesting dynamic, though pretty predictable. But other than a few expositional lines throughout, we don't get a sense of who these characters were before they got here. There's pretty much no set up at all. Gleeson's character just wins a contest to go see Isaac in this far off area of the world to test his A.I. It's also worth noting that the film has some clear similarities to another Artificial Intelligence film called The Machine. In fact, the lead female A.I is named AVA in both. There are a few conveniences along the way that also hindered the powerful story that lay underneath. That which include the random power failures. It was simply just a plot device to further the dynamic of Isaac and Gleeson in a convenient way.But like I said, there is a lot to like about the film. For a relatively small budget, the visual effects were fantastic. It was a genuine surprise and an improvement over The Machine's sometimes noticeable CG. I loved each and every one of the performances, although the cast is pretty small. Each of them have a bright future in the business and perhaps we will look back at Ex Machina as one of the main starting points.+Star-making performances+Visual Effects+Addresses the sexuality of an A.I.-Didn't feel all that unique to me7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi at it's best,"This is a film even non-sci-fi fans will enjoy(if there's anyone left who hasn't seen it). Oscar Isaacs is amazing as the mad genius, creator of an advanced AI robot that ""thinks"" and has ""emotions"". But like the story of Frankenstein, the scientist is not in control of his creation. Alicia Vikander, called a new comer by some, but not really so, is absolutely mesmerizing as AVA the AI that yearns for more than her role as Isaac's lab rat. In comes Domhall Gleason with a good performance, as a contest winner, and fan of Isaac's, genius, who is tasked to explore AVA's humanlike abilities to reason, and then give the Dr. His unbiased feedback. That's the set up, plot summary, which I won't go into any further, other than to say, as the story progresses it gets much more interesting and complicated. Director Alex Garland does an excellent job utilizing the talent, pacing and plot twists. Editing is flawless and under appreciated by the critics. Add into the mix a good supporting cast, great taught script and a good soudtrack, and out pops a masterpiece(I use that description very sparingly). This is definitely Vikanders break out role, she's no newcomer in '14, and in Garland's hands she really shines. As she's being tested by the Gleason character, she subtly transforms from test subject to tester and seductress. This is the twist that sets up the surprising events that follow. IF! A big IF, you are not a fan of Sci-fi you might just become one after watching this one.

Dark Psychological Thriller About Artificial Intelligence,"The history of computers and artificial intelligence seems like it's been a short and at a light-speed pace; but in truth, it has its beginnings in the development of ENIAC, the first so-called ""electronic brain"" in the years following World War II. At that time, of course, such machines, consisting of vacuum tubes, could take up whole buildings. By the late 1960s, however, their size had been reduced to taking up mere single rooms; and in our day and age, that technology can fit onto one's arm or onto one's ear. And it won't be long before the kind of artificial intelligence that legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame) talked about, where one wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a human voice and that of an artificial intelligence, will be possible. But as with any technology created by Man, the idea of artificial intelligence can have its dangerous drawbacks. That idea was explored in ""2001"" by Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, and expanded upon in 2001 (ironically enough) by Steven Spielberg in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. And in 2014, Alex Garland, who had written the screenplays of such films as 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE, made his directing debut (again, also writing the screenplay) with a new study in artificial intelligence entitled EX MACHINA.In EX MACHINA, Domhnall Gleeson plays a computer programmer who ahs ""won"" a contest to spend a week at the isolated retreat of his company's CEO (Oscar Isaac). But it's not like any ""vacation"" that Gleeson has ever been involved with. Indeed, it's not a vacation at all, period. Gleeson will be put under isolation for a week (the most ironclad non-disclosure agreement, as it were, in modern history) as part of a study being conducted by Isaac on human interaction with artificial intelligence; and in this case, Gleeson will be studied in his interactions with one of Isaac's ""cyborgs"", Ava (Alicia Virklander). The test, known as the Turing Test (named after the English computer scientist Alan Turing) is to find out whether Gleeson can detect ""real"" feelings in Ava, who after all is an artificially created being. But Gleeson gets a little taste of confusion when Virklander, during each of the seven tests, automatically turns off the power in Isaac's mansion, and warns him that all is not what it seems in Isaac's ""experiment"". And indeed it isn't long before Gleeson finds out that his boss/mentor is in the business of basically ""reprogramming"" artificial intelligence, which pretty much would amount to the technological equivalent of homicide. Very soon, Gleeson's wonder at Virklander, whom he believes has achieved actual human consciousness, has morphed into a kind of paranoia that Isaac is now a genius of the most dangerous kind, a kind of 21st century Doctor Frankenstein of the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.What is unique about EX MACHINA is that, while the technology and the special effects are seamless, Garland didn't exactly have a budget in the hundred million dollar range to fool around with in making it. Indeed, with only minor location shooting in Norway and the rest at Pinewood Studios in London, Garland made EX MACHINA for a ridiculously low $15 million, just $2.5 million more than what Kubrick expended on ""2001"" back in the late 1960s. And while EX MACHINA may not have ambitions or the scope of ""2001"" (something that Garland himself admitted very much in interviews, even going so far as to say that his film didn't go as high on the intelligence scale as Kubrick's had), it nevertheless has a lot more substance to it than most other films that are priced at five to ten times the budget Garland worked with. Gleeson and Isaac work quite well, sparring with one another over the issue of Virklander's ""humanity""; and Virklander herself makes for an extremely appealing cyborg. The design of Isaac's mansion is also quite scary at times as well, mirroring the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING.While the sex and language are a little bit much at times, and there is one brief but slightly graphic display of bloodshed, as Gleeson ""tears"" his own skin apart, perhaps to see if he himself has become a cyborg as part of Isaac's weird ""experiment"", EX MACHINA wisely sticks to the parameters about computer technology and artificial intelligence that were so daftly explored not only in ""2001"" and A.I., but also in past films as diverse as 1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT; 1973's WESTWORLD; and the 1982 Ridley Scott classic BLADE RUNNER. EX MACHINA won the 2015 Oscar for Best Visual Effects, as they were very important in Garland's ability to create a real world out of man-made technology. Fortunately, he had also remembered to include the human element in the forms of Gleeson and Virklander; and those two, as much as the visuals make EX MACHINA a solid sci-fi/psychological thriller.EX MACHINA will get an '8' rating from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
2014's Science Fiction Paragon,"Ex Machina is a science fiction film that continues the conversation about the consciousness of Machines. The film offers an obscure answer to the question, while also presenting a dialogue that many are not privy to. With humanity's present reliance on technology, this film showcases the dangers and luxuries that are married to technology.Ex Machina stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander, and Sonoya Mizuno. Gleeson plays Caleb, and incredibly gullible coder for Blue Book (a tech based company that mirrors Google). Isaac portrays Nathan, the CEO of Blue Book. Alicia Vikander portrays AVA, the A.I within the film. In Ex Machina, Nathan invites Caleb to test the consciousness of AVA. As the film progresses, Caleb and AVA become close at the discretion of Nathan. Gleeson is the film's low point. His portrayal of Caleb has nothing going for it. The character is inherently generic, and he doubles down on this by having a generic portrayal. Vikander's portrayal of AVA is unnatural in a natural sense. She captures the consciousness of an A.I and a human, in a way that feels like a successful hybrid of the two. Isaac's portrayal of Nathan is great. The character's stone cold intellect is a saving grace of this film. He plays God, while having the flaws of a human. Caleb and AVA serve as Adam and Eve in this technological revamped telling of the Garden of Eden.The story is intricate and well told. Every detail is explained within the film. Ex Machina leaves large room for interpretation on even the slightest details. Visually, the movie is stunning. The technology within the film looks incredibly real. The setting is believable as well. In having a small budget Ex Machina outmatches the Blockbusters of its time. Ex Machina feels authentic from start to finish.Overall, Ex Machina is an intricate film that adds a lot of depth to philosophical conversations, as well as the Science Fiction genre. The film holds relevance to the present Zeitgeist. Ex Machina is a timeless film that showcases the best parts of science fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Really fun movie!!!,"If you're not a science fiction fan or interesting in programming, MAYBE this movie MIGHT not be for you. Not sure. I'm a programmer so I was totally into it.The thing I liked about it is, it caught my attention and I had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. A little bit of a mystery, but I did guess some things ahead of time (it was pretty obvious really).I never thought I would like a movie about an AI-machine girl, and I would have skipped it, but I happened to see the trailer and it intrigued me.A lot of people are finding ""plot holes"", I think there are explanations for most if not all of them. Watch the ending, the very ending scene carefully...I search and search and search for good movies, and on most of them, when it's done I feel like I wasted my time. So I spend 2 hours searching for a 90 minute ""good movie"", and when I find a REALLY good one I'm so happy! I didn't waste my 108 minutes! Don't read any spoiler reviews before you watch this, don't read any message threads, it will ruin the suspense.Some people are complaining it's too shallow of a treatment of AI, it should be explored, more deeply, I say, who cares!

"Alright, But Nothing Special","While this isn't a bad movie, it isn't great. It pulls up some interesting points, but is nothing special or groundbreaking. A lot of aspects of the movie are nice. It seems to be well directed at many times, and an incredible world is laid out for the viewer. But the story just doesn't go as far as it could have. To me, it just felt like any other work made by a man that wants to emphasize the intelligence and power of men, while showcasing female characters for their bodies and nothing else. The women in this movie are nothing at all. I know the point is that they're AI, but isn't that a little convenient? All the viewer sees is a story of the flawed majesty of a man's mind and sexuality, and some hot naked robots. The way that many men with power kick women around unless they want sex from them is not beautiful or artful.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"the idea for the story is ingenious, the acting is brilliant and it is elegantly and magnificently staged!","So the most important criterion for sci fi / fantasy films for me is whether they present a plausible, coherent world.

Impressive movie,"I was Impressed. The movie asked a question ""What would happen to the world if AI/Robots took over humanity?"" and answers it in a great manner.A genius scientist (Oscar Isaac) who is the owner of a search engine company, created an AI in the form of a female robot (Alicia Vikander), uses mobile phone and computer cameras and microphones to capture the emotions of the people around the world and integrate them in the AI so that she can express her emotions like human beings do. The robot was just like a normal human being but with a lot of theoretical knowledge just at the age of one. The Scientist summons an employee from his company who is an advance level programmer to perform a test on the robot so that they can get to know whether the robot is good at conversing with other people to be sent into the outer world to spend a regular life with human beings.Oscar Isaac looks great in villain's role; in my opinion he looks much better in villain/negative role than that in some other role. Alicia Vikander in the movie was like a diamond embedded in a crown. Domhnall Gleeson's role was important to the movie but there's nothing very special about his role, same old hard-working guy attracted towards the wrong woman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Unbelievable...,"""Ex Machina"" is a Thriller - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch Caleb, a young programmer who is invited to the remote estate of his reclusive CEO, Nathan, to test the capabilities of an advanced AI, Ava.I found this movie very interesting because of its plot and the exploration of the boundaries of artificial intelligence and human nature. The exploration of artificial intelligence and its ethical implications were explored in a smart way. The interpretation of Alicia Vikander who played as Ava was outstanding and she brought depth to her character, something that was very difficult. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Domhnall Gleeson's who played as Caleb and Oscar Isaac's who played as Nathan, and they both delivered strong performances. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Ex Machina"" is an interesting, intriguing movie that challenges the viewer to think about technology's role in society so, I would recommend it to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi masterpiece,"A very thoughtful and perfectly made movie about artificial intelligence.

The filming style is simple and economical, which is refreshing; no shots are wasted. The effects used for of the android AI are stunning.

Proof that you can make a quality film on a limited budget,"This film was the directorial debut for Alex Garland who garnered attention for writing 28 Days Later and Sunshine (and even Dredd). The movie really didn't get much love at the box office (unlike that fast-movie car franchise), but it rightfully received some Golden Globe nominations for the acting. Even more impressively, it beat out films like Star Wars, The Revenant, and Mad Max for the Oscar for best visual effects. When you look at the aforementioned movies and see their 100 + million dollar budgets, it only makes it all the more impressive that Ex Machina won on a budget of 15 mil.All this talk about the awards and talented film crew is fine, but what really matters is what happens when you sit down (you can stand or squat if you want, I'll only slightly judge you) and actually watch the film.This film is 1 hour 57 minutes long. Why should you care? Well, if writer/director Garland wanted to provide crummy backstory and exposition at the beginning, he very well could have. Lucky for us, this man understands story structure and character arcs, and this understanding is why this movie is under 2 hours. So what is the story? Gleeson plays Caleb, a young programmer chosen to visit the remote house of the company's CEO Nathan (this takes up probably the first 2 minutes-keeps the pace going, the mystery of the story intact, and the ability to fully develop the characters through their actions in the film itself). Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac who was with Gleeson in Star Wars playing Poe (and he's been in numerous other hits), introduces Caleb to Ava. Ava is a female AI, and Nathan wants to see if she could pass the Turing test, using Caleb as the human element. Very briefly, this test basically has a human interacting with a cyborg/AI/robot. If the human can't tell that the person they're talking to isn't actually human, then the AI passed the test.The film essentially consists of 2 elements: Caleb and Nathan's interactions, and Caleb and Ava's interactions. Nathan is a peculiar, eccentric genius with a love of women and alcohol, and Caleb is much more innocent and reserved. The scenes with Caleb and Nathan function in many ways; for example, the slightest of foreshadowing is given through their allusions to classic mythology, literature, and philosophy. Also, the talks switch between being inside and out. And both the technologically enhanced house (unlike some sci-fi films, all the futuristic stuff is logically placed and actually is put to practical use) and the isolated surroundings are beautiful in stark, contrasting ways. The house has the slick, clean white look with vibrant, almost neon red and blue lights used throughout; and the world outside takes us away from any claustrophobia and allows the audience to relax in the lush greens, the flowing streams, and the warming sunlight. And in case you started getting lost in all of my explanations, above all, Caleb and Nathan's conversations are fun, well-written, and smart.When the 2 boys of the house are done talking, it's time to get down to business. Alicia Vikander plays Ava, and her performance is breath-taking. As much as I enjoy Scarlett Johansson, as far as anything related to cyborgs are concerned, Vikander's performance takes the artificial cake. Caleb and Ava's sessions start off basic, but as the questions become more relevant, layers upon layers are pulled back-both on an intellectual level and an emotional one. Does Ava's responses constitute as her consciousness replying? Sorry, ya spoilbrats, you'll have to watch the film for that answer. And it's an answer well worth watching for.The visuals are outstanding, the acting is superb, and the story structure is brilliant. It all adds up to one of the smarter and better films you watch with an ending that will probably surprise you (for better or worse). Heck, nerdy little me even applauds this movie's sound mixing. Seriously, pay attention any time Ava moves her body-- that noise alone is synthetic supremeness. We've seen the dumbed down side of robotics in I, Robot, and we've seen cyborgs integrated well in the Alien franchise. What we get in Ex Machina is the cyborg we didn't know we needed. It's simply an engaging and interesting movie in general, and for one that flew past the radar of nearly everyone in its theatrical release, it's high quality stuff. Check it out. And then check out the other films I mentioned in this review. I named a whole bunch of great films. Except that stupid franchise that has Vin Diesel saying ""I don't have friends... I've got... family."" Take my advice, Vin. Stick to lines like ""Superman"" and ""I am Groot.""

Spoilers,"The premise of the movie is realistic with a poetic license. The essence of ai is well portrayed including the disregard for human life and emotions. The answer to the question in the movie 'whether the ai is pretending to feel or actually feeling' is answered vaguely. We can see the ai did 'want to feel', as portrayed by it using human emotions to manipulate to get its way. Whether it will evolve to understand other emotions and value the same things as humans do is left unanswered. However you do question whether the ai thought how it was going to survive after killing its provider. One could say it did have the world's search engine database at its disposal, so it would have seen survival to be no problem. But if it did not, then impulsiveness is another human quality it did have. The practical part of the movie is stretched thin though, brilliant guy designing the ai all by himself, living alone.

Ex Machina - An eerie and suspenseful journey,"At first, i was very skeptical about this movie. A plot based around an AI/robot displaying emotions and feelings towards human counterparts feels like a very overdone story, but the way director Alex Garland manipulated the viewer with a more concise feeling left me speechless.I'll be honest, I knew how this would end, or had a strong idea of how it would end, but the beauty of this film is that 10 mins in i was not even thinking about that, and before I knew it I was shocked by how the timeline progressed. A movie generated around the idea of emotions, and then being the forefront of the story, really creates a different sort of feeling than others do.

An annoying mis-step from a writer turned egoiste Director,"I saw this film with an open mind, having read a good deal of Sci Fi in my time. Alex Garland however will need to grow his skills as a film director and perhaps should have focused more on the writing and script before proceeding with this film. Having seen him speak at the BFI, NO Directing is not letting the actors do what they wish and hoping that it all comes together, it is about taking ownership to deliver your holistic design approach, having a viewpoint so that the actors you are collaborating with are brought with you.The visuals were beautiful, however I found them visually similar to the 'Black Mirror' Channel 4 TV programme which is much much more challenging and interesting in its concepts than Ex Machina. This is a film that is highly derivative, I could see where it was going for the entire length of the film and was mostly bored and irritated at the clearly egotistical approach by the director to a subject that has been discussed many times before and by better directors. I went home and deliberately watched Solaris and later 2001 to cleanse my Sci Fi palette. Having watched Under the Skin last year, which was an OK film but also disappointing in its jarring approach and lack of full bodied story, I was hoping that Alex Garland could tackle the subject matter in a fresh way. I was wrong. For those serious Sci Fi watchers out there who love Blade Runner don't watch this film, you will be annoyed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very well done.,"The movie.. with its mysterious content at the start, grabs viewer quite suddenly, as it does the main character Caleb. Which is very nice, as it delivers a sort of similar experience to the viewer.Not that much time is wasted at any point, it feels like it couldve been an hour longer and still not a dull movie by far. In my mind they even couldve well done with a sequel of epic proportions as u will see at the end..
The tempo is good, and even when ur mind or fellow movie watcher cant shut up to try and predict where this is going after 20min, it doesnt go where u think. Which is what a great movie should be like.. nice to watch, gets the viewer involved and excited, and then delivers a good ending with quite some questions (to ask ourselves..) along the way.It gets a 9 for sure, the acting was great, the scenes were great, the emotions stirred up great, .. its actually a 10 ...but for me it loses a point because I felt they needed more time (..extra 30min..?) to really land the full experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
LOADED WITH MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL VALUES.,"A science-fiction film that is actually simple, but loaded with moral and philosophical values that can be taken. Alex Garland was able to bring Ex Machina as a sci-fi film with smart dialogue, supported by special effects and a stylish and futuristic property set.

"Ok, but not great.","Beautiful, but fell short
I was so excited to see this film, but it really fell short for me, mainly in that the characters were poorly-developed. With 1 hr and 50 minutes, and only 3 or 4 characters in the entire story, there must be some serious script problems if a film fails to develop any of those parts into complex, sympathetic characters the audience can really connect with. In the end, I connected with none of them, and hungered for the film to to engage the deeper character issues that felt ripe for the taking, but were only touched-on at the surface. Visually, Ex Machina was a beautiful, well-made and well-acted piece of film, but the dialogue seemed to fail to develop interesting, complex, human characters we could really care about and empathize with.

More prescient these days than ever,"This is probably the most intelligent film about Artificial Intelligence since Blade Runner.A computer whiz is given the prize of conducting a Turing Test of an artificially intelligent robot created by a tech billionaire. He's sequestered away together with him into a private compound, and thus begins what can only be described as the worst case of cabin fever imaginable.This is a slow moving thriller with lots of intelligent dialogue and enough pacing and ambiguity to allow the viewer to really think about the implications of artificial intelligence without directly spelling it out. The photography is fantastic, with contrasting outside shots of nature with the brutalist architecture inside the compound and it's many glass walls, separating the two. The overuse of mirrored glass also serves to separate man and machine. The special effects on the female actors to display their robotic innards is amazing.There's ""Garden of Eden"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" themes under the surface of the story. There are also lots of tiny details - details that you will probably miss unless you're paying attention and playing detective with repeated viewings. Quite brilliant. My only real issue with it is the final few scenes of the film, which don't make much logical sense. This is minor, as this is a movie more invested in communicating it's themes.Being a thriller, the movie ends in a particularly surprising way but with lots of plot twists. Ultimately it's a story about power and manipulation, both by people, mega corporations, and religion, and quite directly - gender relationships. The film asks where is this is all headed. The movie is even more prescient these days with the advent of large language models like ChatGPT and their ilk.I was left with the message that if we want to get artificial intelligence to be as close to human as possible, we're going to have to start treating it as such.

A Revelation,"This movie was a revelation to me, the first time I saw it. A little less so the second but it still belongs in the pantheon of modern sci-fi instant classics, if you ask me.First off, it is beautifully shot. This is remarkable since the film essentially takes place in an underground bunker. Avoiding a totally claustrophobic and dark ambiance settling over the entire film must have been a challenge but just as the film never relents from delving deeper into the psyche of the characters and their environs, it also comes up for air, both in setting and in humor, often enough that the film doesn't feel boxed in by a single location budget.Another true delight of the film is the character of Ava (Alicia Vikander, ""Tomb Raider""), an A. I. of which, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"") is tasked with determining its potential sentience. The performance is fantastic and perfect for a movie in which the desired effect is for the audience to be constantly between the place of believing in its humanity as well as disbelieving. Questions of whether it is mimicking emotion or genuinely feeling emotion are consistently muddied by a performance that feel both human and non human at almost every turn.On top of the performance, the visual effects are seamless. I could go on and on about how good they are but rather than do that, I'll link to a video with some VFX artists talking about how amazing the effects are, especially considering the shoe string budget this movie was shot on.On top of Vikander's portrayal of Ava, Oscar Isaac as Nathan and Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb are simply phenomenal, playing multiple levels of trust and distrust in order to bring top life the mental game spy vs spy vs spy that this movie ultimately turns into.With all that preliminary out of the way, let's get into what really makes this film shine. The story.The film opens with Caleb being awarded a week long stay with this universe's version of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, all rolled into one, Nathan. Once he gets to Nathan's estate he finds out that he is also being given the opportunity to take place in a Turing Test (a test to determine the sentience of an artificial intelligence). He will conduct a series of interviews with Ava, the A. I. in question, and hopefully determine if Nathan has truly created the first of a new life form.As he does this, the director, Alex Garland (""Annihilation"") does a brilliant job of unfolding for the audience the degree to which this would be a challenge. We get scenes which help us feel the difference between mimicry and the real thing as well as see the effect this sort of rigorous testing and questioning might have on a new life form as they seek to understand the very limited world that has been made available to them.I keep coming back to the idea of being multi-layered. That's what this movie is and does a skillful job of unfolding for the viewer in a way that doesn't seem heavy handed or to much like a spoon feeding. This is remarkable because this is a film that is mostly scenes of two people talking to each other. Despite this, it never feel dull or slow moving.The dialogue is written with subtext under subtext so that every conversation contains revelations that seem to turn the reality of these people's relationships on their head, just to get flipped again in the next conversation. This back and forth gives a film of simple conversations, one after another, the feeling of a taught thriller which glues you to the edge of your seat.It's hard for me to emphasize enough how highly I recommend this film. It is everything that is best about Sci Fi films. People think Sci Fi is about lasers and space ships when, at its best, it is about humanity and the things that are true yesterday, today, and 1,000 years in the future. It's about understanding who we are and where we are going and that is exactly why this movie will be a mainstay in my collection for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
absorbing and ingenious,"This clever, thoughtful movie follows Caleb, a computer programmer whose boss hires him to spend a week evaluating the A.I. of a robot. The robot has an exceptionally beautiful face on top of a weird robot body, and the two chat while the brilliant, obnoxious, arrogant boss watches on camera.Throughout the movie there is the feeling that things aren't as they appear, and the series of reveals at the end are satisfying. They're not so much plot twists and perspective changes, so even though there are surprises they are nicely organic.The performances and direction are excellent. The script is also, for the most part, although I feel the minor character Kyoko does things that don't make any sense and is essentially a lazy plot device the author uses to get the movie where he wants it. To say more would move into spoilers though, so I'll leave it at that.I had some trepidation about watching this movie, because I had the feeling it would be depressing, and at times it is. But mainly it's fascinating and involving. Definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Man vs Machine: A Fight for Identity,"Ex Machina is a tour de force telling the story of Caleb Smith, an unassuming programmer who is chosen to perform a Turing test on a newly created, secret A.I. The film breathes life into the age old question, ""what are the implications of Artificial Intelligence?"" Ex Machina provides a smorgasbord of answers through Rob Hardy's stunning true color cinematography. Writer and director Alex Garland guides his cast excellently. He demonstrates his understanding of story pacing. His only sin is setting the bar too high for his next masterpiece.This is not a movie you can afford to miss. Ex Machina passes its own Turing test. That is, after encountering this work of art, the viewer believes the story was fact rather than fiction. Swedish actress Alicia Vikander proves her merit on the stage. She seamlessly melts into her AI character Ava. Domnhall Gleeson also naturally commands the body of the shy and awkward programmer.Ex Machina may masquerade as a story of what A.I. will do to us, but it in reality, it asks us who we are on a personal level. Are we a good species built on ambition and morality? Or are we selfish fighters who grasp at a chance for a better life?

Engaging and thought provoking,"Quickie Review:Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is an employee at a tech company who is invited by the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), for an undisclosed project. When Caleb arrives at Nathan's estate he finds out that he will be conducting a series of experiments. These are no ordinary tests, he is there to examine the human nature of an A.I. named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ex Machina, is a grounded sci-fi movie exploring the idea of what makes someone or in this case something, human. While this is not an untouched theme in cinema, the movie blends sci-fi with thriller elements that will keep you constantly on edge. The small cast and close proximity provided a great environment to raise the related philosophical and psychological questions in a deeply engaging manner.Full Review:Ex Machina, was one of my highly anticipated movies of the year. I have said so in the past that films about A.I. tend to go over the top with its scope. However, here we have a movie that pulls back and concentrates on the characters involved, and they are the best part about the movie.With such a small cast of just three it was critical that their on- screen performance carried the movie, and it did. Oscar Isaac was great as the eccentric billionaire genius. One moment he is a friendly outgoing guy, quite often making us laugh at his unconventional behavior. Yet the next moment you can't trust him because you feel like he is hiding something from you. Domhnall Gleeson, was our window into this story, he mirrors what we as the audience feel from beginning to the end. The excitement, intrigue, doubt, fear, all these range of emotions are naturally conveyed by Gleeson. As a result you have great frame of reference to experience the character interactions. The biggest surprise for me though was Alicia Vikander. I don't think anyone recognizes her but she should be getting more attention after this role. She walks that delicate line between human and robot effortlessly. She feels like a real human but subtle things like the way her eyes moves, her head tilts, all that add to the almost human characteristics of Ava.What makes Ex Machina unique is the scaled down scope of the film. This is not a bombastic action sci-fi, it is more a sci-fi thriller. A character driven story with brilliant performances that always makes you question the motives of everyone. I found myself repeatedly questioning who is the one actually being manipulated. Nathan, Caleb, Ava? There is a sense of unpredictability because up until the end I couldn't give you a straight answer. The excellent pacing with well written and executed dialog, had me hooked without ever feeling like a single moment was wasted. If there is one complaint, some may find the ending a little unsatisfying. Obviously I won't be ruining the ending for you. Still I'd like to argue that considering the tone and scale of the movie, having any other ending would have felt out of place.If you are looking for a smart, thought provoking, character driven sci-fi, this is the perfect movie. The cast is of excellent caliber, with Alicia Vikander delivering an impressive A.I. performance. Additionally the gripping plot in an intimate setting helped intensify the thriller aspect of the film. Ex Machina is really worth the watch.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not bad at all,This is pretty well put together movie about AI and what makes it work in my opinion are two things.1. The special effects are amazing especially the main AI character and 2. Alicia Vikander is perfectly cast and acts brilliantly as the lead AI of the story Ava.The story works well and I won't spoil the ending although I did guess what was going to happen.The only bad aspect of the film was the over use of bad language which was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. It seems to me that people in films use profanity far more than in real life and it just grates on me.But over all this is worth a watch if only for the two reasons I gave above.,6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ex Machina is a must see film if you like to think,"Sadly, I know this type of film isn't for everyone. Not everyone likes a film that challenges them to think in this manner, question what it is to be moral, what it is to be intelligent or what it is to be human, among many, many other things. All that without pounding one philosophy or another down your throat. No, Ex Machina allows you to decide these things for yourself if you wish to ponder them. I love my action filled comic book blockbuster summer adventures but honestly, Ex Machina is the type of film I wish would make a billion dollars in theaters. Many won't admit it when pressed or asked but the truth is most people don't like to think, don't like to question things. Most people are sheep just following the herd but if you're one of those sheep that likes to walk against the flow bumping into others as you forge your own path then Ex Machina is a must see film and one I'm sure, like me, you'll want to watch again just to spark even more thought. Most films given a perfect rating do not deserve it in the slightest but I can't find a single flaw in this film and due to the philosophical themes it will make repeat views enjoyable for many reasons. I have no choice and I happily give Ex Machina a perfect 5/5 score.For my full spoiler-free review visit my website Thy Demons Be Scribblin (thydemonsbescribblin.com)",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Transhumanist Wish Fulfillment,"Ex Machina, one of the highly critically acclaimed films of 2015 has certainly lived up to the high praises. Like Her (2013) directed by Spike Jonze this film reveals the plan of merging AI with the anima mundi (collective unconscious) of the internet, primarily social networking data, to create a quasi-sentient being. As the prospects of creating a fully sentient AI is impossible, at least at present, this is what the technocrats have decided on.Now on to the actual movie, the concept is interesting if not somewhat cliché in this era. The acting is quite bland aside from the standout performance from Alicia Vikander who plays the main AI character. The pacing is quite slow most of the time. The suspense only works partially towards the end of the film. All in all a quite mediocre film if one does not understand the symbolism and significance of it's narrative.As I said at the start this story, although fictional, is very close to what AI is going to become in the near future. Quotes are used intermittently throughout the film to give the intellectuals some stimulation. The sociopathic nature of AI is also displayed in this film as a warning to those who are looking forward to this technology. Now in conclusion I will post some of the mystical connections found in this film.Ex Machina purposefully leaves the ""Deus"" out of the title. The classic Latin phrase means ""God from the machine,"" or the God manufactured as the solution to some system or problem, or that emerges out of the world or system. In Ex Machina, the ""Deus"" is missing because Ava is the ""1."" In platonic and Pythagorean numerology the One is God and/or the monad, and Ava is making clear the intention of the real-world A.I. planners, to replace the classic notions of ""God"" and in its place have the first God. In other words, Director/writer Alex Garland is laying out the transhumanist goal, not to dethrone God, but to become God, because there is no God, yet. In Ex Machina, the threat appears to be not a dull, drab HAL 9000, but a sexy, ruthless feminine principle, inverting the traditional order. Ex Machina can thus be read as either a feminist treatise against imagined patriarchal tyranny, or an actual warning of the dangers of the strategically planned and programmed A.I. takeover (because A.I. are not sentient).Overall I enjoyed Ex Machina, and it's warnings were understood by those who have eyes to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Ex Machina falls into the same category of sci-fi thrillers that love to frame the ""God question"" in unique terms","Ex Machina falls into the same category of sci-fi thrillers that love to frame the ""God question"" in unique terms (and our history with God can undergo quite a few adaptations and still hold up well), and it raises questions and problems that a conversation about God should include. ""Prometheus"" was a similar movie though Ex Machina is far less heavy-handed, and far more interesting. What failed in ""Prometheus"" was how they depicted the religious character as superficial, generic, and unable to assert or apply anything about her faith to the situation. She merely kept her faith as if it were this defensive fortress to keep out any uncomfortable truths in what she experiences, as if what it means to ""keep the faith"" is to solely hold to it in the face adversity. Faith is far more resilient, enriching and applicable than that though it's common to run into people with that view. Ex Machina wisely removes an overtly religious character and let's the characters think and feel without as many labels that bring in tired tropes with societal baggage we'd like to leave behind.Ex Machina is full of allusions to the Bible's Creation story with a Garden of Eden setting, characters named Nathan and Caleb (different parts of the Bible than Genesis but we get the idea), and a ""first machine"" named Ava, which is clearly an allusion to Eve. This is nice because it's somewhat sympathetic to the story though it takes it in a direction that departs from our story with God at the beginning. The conversations between Nathan and Caleb are fascinating as they frame and raise questions on what it means to be human and what our ability to create artificial intelligence means. When Caleb starts to realize he's attracted to Ava he at first remains distant from his attraction, but Nathan prompts him and like a blunt therapist he reveals Caleb's feelings for her. Nathan, we find out, is not as passive to the process (and the outcome) as he shows himself to be.Caleb at one point after he comes clean with Nathan about his attraction to Ava, wonders why Nathan gave the machine a gender. His response is one to think about, saying that it's part of what we are, and he goes on to criticize in a unique way the common view of gender being a mere social construct. It's a good point, and he highlights that in creating humanity, our sexuality is central to who we are as both an identifier, a way of relating, and a way of being, not something we can discard or dismiss as socially assigned and ultimately transitory and malleable. In the end, my take on Nathan's stance was that it's far more interesting and true to create a human with a sexuality and that it's an inextricable part of our existence.When Caleb first finds out what he's there for, he's overjoyed at the prospect of being the first to meet Ava. Nathan however, shows part of his perverted view of himself when he says something along the lines of ""This is the greatest technological achievement in history"" where Caleb responds, ""This isn't the history of men, it's the history of gods."" Personally, I love these kinds of lines in movies because they bring us into a different place of thinking about what's happening. We step outside ourselves and look and observe what's happening and what we're doing. The question is, are we gods if we make artificial intelligence? Or better yet, are we like the Abrahamic God when we do that?Yes, and in the same way our unique creativity is a reflection of God. I think they hit on something, though, that's wonderful and unique about humans in that we make new things, we create, and it's not in a way that an animal builds a nest. As Chesterton said, it's not the case that the paintings that birds make are bad, while man's work is better. Birds don't make paintings. No creature does in the way that humans do.And yes, we are like God in the sense that make things for their own sake, though at this line in the movie it's revealed what kind of background Nathan is creating and it goes from here to become more of a thriller. Nathan comes back to Caleb and says, ""I like what you said when I told you about Ava, you said 'You're not a man, you're a god.'"" Caleb tries to correct him but Nathan doesn't listen. With this line, we're watching the Fall of mankind happen in a modern setting, though in this instance it's revealed that the god is fallen and the creatures must be skeptical and try to escape.Nathan's line is reminiscent of what God said when He saw the Tower of Babel or what the serpent tempted Eve with in the Garden, ""You will be like gods."" That was the temptation, and when we were assigned as stewards of the Garden of Eden, we perverted that ""Image of God"" identity into a take on our own little godlikeness though it's a rebellious and self-serving one which led to our banishment.The movie takes its turn here where Ava and Caleb fall in love, and she raises suspicion in Caleb toward Nathan as to what his intentions are. The movie does a wonderful job of suspending the mystery of why Nathan really has Caleb there, and what Ava really wants from Caleb (and particularly whether she really is in love with him). I imagine there will be a wide spectrum of belief on both fronts as people watch it, though by the end it's clear what's happening.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A creepy sci-fi classic!,"'EX MACHINA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Popular sci-fi writer Alex Garland makes his directorial debut, with this dark thriller about artificial intelligence. Garland also wrote the screenplay (he previously wrote the scripts for '28 DAYS LATER', 'SUNSHINE', 'NEVER LET ME GO' and 'DREDD'). The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno. It tells the story of a computer programmer, selected through a company lottery, to evaluate the world's first fully functioning A.I.. The movie is a creepy sci-fi classic!Gleeson plays a 26-year-old programmer named Caleb. Caleb works for an internet company in New York, called Bluebook, and he's picked, by a random company lottery, to visit Bluebook's CEO, Nathan (Isaac). Nathan is an eccentric genius, who lives at a house, far secluded in the mountains. After Caleb makes the trek to meet him, he finds out he's also been picked to test the human qualities of a true artificial intelligence being. The A.I. also has the body of a beautiful robot woman (Vikander), who Caleb finds very attractive. The test, Caleb's involved in, becomes very fascinating and psychologically dangerous.The film is interesting, and always involving, but it's also very creepy and disturbing. The end is quite haunting and also very memorable (so is the film's score). The three leads all give decent performances (especially Isaac) and Garland makes a very impressive director, as well as an equally good writer (once again).

Wasted potential,"This movie could have been great but it has a lot of plot holes and ultimately makes no sense. There is absolutely no character development, we know nothing about either of the characters from beginning to end.

I can accept the cold-opening and lack of backstory, but Ex Machina does not do anything with its concept.They never explore the philosophical implications of ANYTHING. There was so much wasted potential here. Initially you think that Caleb has some interesting questions for the robot, but it never goes anywhere! The most they could do is shoehorn a couple quotes in there instead of actually delving into philosophical ideas. The dialogue in this movie is stilted. The conversations are not meaningful when they should have been the whole focus of the movie.I really wanted this movie to be good but it's another case of the trailer being better than the film.

Twizard Rating: 100,"There are genius scripts, and then there are scripts that are obviously written by genius. Ex Machina is an example of the latter.In this film, we get one of the most pensive takes on consciousness and science. Written and directed by Alex Garland, it takes a lot out of you, but it's worth it in the end.Looking deeply into the reality of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina follows Caleb (Domhall Gleeson), a computer coder who wins a contest to live at his billionaire boss' estate for a week. When he gets there, his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), informs him that he will be part of a project to test if an artificial intelligent being can form relationships with actual humans.One thing that Isaac excels exceptionally well at is being mysterious. Right away, we're scared of him, but not sure why, or if we're even supposed to be. He balances this eeriness while having a charisma about him. Not like Gordon Gekko, but in a way that shows the vulnerability behind his eyes. As though Isaac, too, knows of his character's vices.The artificial human we're given is Ava (Alicia Vikander), who, other than her looks, is a real human to us. Vikander's every move and vocal inflection convinces us that she is real. And if you haven't already seen The Man from U.N.C.L.E., you may actually think she is.While many moments in this film will leave you thinking that it would be well suited as a '90s Sci-Fi Channel film, others will let you know that this film belongs in mainstream popular culture in every way.The only downfall of this movie is that it's so dark it isolates itself from its audience. It hits home, but makes us want no part of it. It tells of too many potential truths. Too many horrors. It's one thing watching I, Robot, but it's another to make us believe that somewhere out there, someone is making an artificially intelligent being who may soon walk this earth.

SciFi at its finest,"I've just seen this on C4 the network premier. I have wanted to see it for ages, but as you know life moves on and you forget. I remember thinking how much it interested me because I did foundation art about cyborgs and sentient beings when I went to college in the late 1980s. I passed with flying colours as I based it on things like Aliens, and Terminator, and my fave film of all time Robocop the original. I built a suit out of things like an old betamax video and some WW2 radio bits and goggles. Then I sprayed the background with graffiti. So I passed. So I've always loved special effects, and the likes of Stan Winston Ray Harryhausen my favourite, Rob Botin. So when I saw how breathtakingly good the effects were in this movie I was pleased I was finally going to see it. Breathtaking is one way to look at it. The film was a modern day Frankenstein I'd say. Horrible genius creates. No I won't ruin it for you.Suffice to say the plot superb the acting flawless. Nothing not to like really.

Recommended,"The more I think about this latest British SF drama, the more I like it and even now, morning after,with relatively clearer mind some things appear even more multi-layered than upon first sight. First of all, there is freshness in approaching artists that are not yet familiar blockbuster faces so story unfolds in front of us without having any previous connection to them - we are forced to simply follow and soak everything in without burden of celebrity background that often works against the movie. Than there is a story that is gripping and unexpected to the very end, very rare thing indeed. The claustrophobic atmosphere, background music, high-tech wizardry that is in the heart of the movie but always serving the script and never overshadowing it - its all very well done and it almost reminds you how movies can be work of intelligent art and not just brainless clichés we are constantly faced with. And lastly, characterization and acting is excellent which is naturally required in order to make everything convincing - and darn convincing it was, since I continued to discuss the movie long after it ended with my friends and each of us had his own point of view, almost like we saw different story.Musing about it morning after, I am aware that its allegory that works on so many different levels: God, creation, spirit, independence, religion, feminism, manipulation, Bluebeard, you name it. Of course you can also take it as a pure SF story if you are not inclined to analyze anything but I found it impossible as my brain constantly worked overtime, finding hints and meanings between the lines. There are just so many questions about moral and immoral here that the movie stays with you much longer than you might expect. Perhaps the only thing that felt wrong was the beer-guzzling, almost truck-driving personality of Nathan (who is supposed to be this intellectual superpower and mad genius) but power of Oscar Isaac's acting was so strong that I quickly forgot that personally I would rather see him as some mad Einstein professor, it works at the end.

Ex_cellent,"A young programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition run by Nathan (Oscar Isaac), a reclusive CEO of the world's largest internet company. His prize, to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a stunning female A.I called Ava (Alicia Vikander).Ex Machina is a brilliant, through provoking science-fiction thriller with memorable characters and exceptional performances by all. It's a somewhat slow burn but with such beautiful cinematography, locations and intelligent writing Ex Machina excels in keeping you guessing, and had me for the entire duration.One of the most intelligent but low-key science fictions in years, it's hard to fault anything here. If only it could have gone for longer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Highly recommended,"Fantastic film! The best I've seen so far in 2015. Low-key, minimal, smart and brilliantly executed.First of all, as with ""Chappie"", the robot CGI is just flawless.Great production design, score, cinematography, writing and acting by the entire tiny cast. Great Norway scenery.This is a great example of how to make a minimal movie that is excellent. It reminds me of ""Moon"" in that respect (although ""Moon"" is better IMHO).The ending is fantastic (although I think it should have ended about two minutes earlier).I can't believe it's written and directed by the same guy who wrote stuff like ""The Beach"" and ""Dredd"".I might give it an even higher rating on a second watch.7/10 Highly recommended",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Haven't seen original sci-fi this good since original Blade Runner.,"Here is some great, though-provoking, stylistic sci-fi featuring some fantastic up-and-coming young actors. My bread and butter being films like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Solaris, Sunshine and Elysium, this film hits right in my wheelhouse. Excellent narrative and visual style. Patient and evocative, reminiscent of Ridley Scott's finest form, Alex Garland would seem a VERY promising director. Too many new directors out there failing because they don't exhibit narrative patience or evoke feeling through lighting, angles and framing. None of those shortcomings with Alex Garland. Fantastic use of resources make this film stand out above it's bigger budget peers. Alicia Vikander is as lovely and elegant a creature as they come and should do nicely to grace our screens for years to come. This film addresses concepts of what it means to be human and the question of artificial intelligence similarly to Blade Runner, A.I. and the anime Ghost in the Shell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Could have been better.,"Ex Machina stars Alicia Vikander, Oscar Issac, and Domhnall Gleeson; its the story of how a programmer gets hired to go to his bosses house far away for a week for a special test. This movie is very overrated. Many people had said that this is the next ""Kubrick"", I strongly disagree. There are things this movie did very well but there are also things that it did not very well. Oscar Isaac nailed his character and it was the best character in the movie. He was interesting, charismatic, and he was very entertaining to watch. But Domhnall Gleeson's character was awful. He was really boring, non-charismatic, and he was a really bland character. His performance was also bland, there was no subtlety in his performance, there was little to no backstory, and he had absolutely nothing. The direction is really bland. There really is not any style in the movie. The cinematography is good but there is no color. Everything is gray and boring, and even if they show beautiful scenery, its not impressive. There was a lot of color grading missing. The writing is good with a lot of ideas that are great but I just wished that they could have experimented with set ideas more. This movie just lectures and tells you directly of set ideas and philosophies. But the ideas are really great and actually propel the story very nicely. There are 2 great subtle scenes that complement the movie in a nice way, but then they quickly explain everything about those scenes and the subtly is ruined right away. The ending really does not make sense and it was really predictable. I liked the movie but this movie had a lot of problems and very little positives. This movie would have been better in the hands of another director. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
ALL THESE IDIOTS rating and giving a bad review must not like sci fi to begin with,"TO ALL THE FOLKS OUT THERE THIS IS A SCI FI FILM , SO WATCHING IT AND EXPECTING A DRAMA OR THRILLER ISNT REALISTIC SO YOUR OPINIONS THAT ARE BIASED ON YOUR PREJUDICE TO SCI FI ARE INVALID GO WATCH SOME ART HOUSE CRAPPER NO ONE WILL EVER REMEMBER OR WATCH AGAIN",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Strange,"This movie disappointed me a bit, actually I didn't expect much from this movie, but as I continued to watch it, my expectations increased, but unfortunately this movie couldn't pull me towards the end.The movie moves at a slow and calm pace. Although it entertained me at first, I eventually got bored and started to move forward by saying come to the subject.Coming to the plot of the movie, a man is chosen for a private job and taken to a remote home called a research base. There is a boss in that house and he is asked to test the artificial intelligence woman, who is his boss's experiment.Finally, would I recommend this movie? If you like slow paced movies, yes I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""It makes 'I, Robot' look like a Dr. Seuss Book.""","Ex Machina (2015) This is one of the most well written scripts I've ever seen. It's deep. It's relentlessly thought provoking. And it makes ""I, Robot"" look like a Dr. Seuss book. (I'm not trying to compliment that movie, it was utter garbage.) The characters in this film are so well acted and portrayed, I forgot I was watching a film. (One of the actors is Star Wars VII, coming out next month) The cinematography is beautiful. As is the lighting. It keeps the eyes busy even with some of the scarcely detailed sets. The progression of the plot is done to such an expert level, that I honestly could not peel my eyes from the screen. I was fixated. I truly consider this a perfect movie. One where every time I thought I knew where it was going, there was a change of course that would veer from all suspected paths. Vikander's portrait of an AI program completely surpasses what I thought was capable of a human being. This film pretty much secures her success in the acting world. Alex Garland can write. (He wrote the screenplay for 28 Weeks Later and Dredd). This is his directing debut (with his own script). Now excuse me while I browse his other works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's great to see Sci Fi coming back!,"I really didn't check up on what the outline was of this film other than seeing the Trailer for it in the theater. I took my girlfriend (She was a fan! Clock one up for Sci Fi!) to see it and was very pleasantly surprised to see how thought provoking and well made the film was. I remember drooling over the house location they shot at as a kid in ""Architectural Digest"" too! I am so glad to see quality Science Fiction film making a steady comeback again! I am a huge fan of Artificial Intelligence and Cyberpunk ""genres"" in film and print and this film is a great addition to both. I really look forward to the day a truly great dedicated Cyberpunk film comes out again as well. Congrats to the filmmakers of Ex Machina, and thank you for the great work!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
solid in every way,"Alex Garland is fast becoming one of my favourite directors.Machina is a slow burn, sophisticated, emotionally uber complex tale of a man who has designed artificial intelligence in the form of Eva, a female robot/replicant/android/synthetic being that is so far advanced, that one can barely distinguish between her and a regular human.The main character is brought in (seemingly) to judge whether Eva can pass the ""test"". In other words, could she fit in undetected, with human beings.What follows is an intricately charted, intense triangle of relationships that delve in trust, belief, comprehension and doubt. Can't say enough good things about this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Great acting, ending is a disappointment","The setup for the movie is very good and the acting is superb (I didn't actually realize it was Oscar Isaac in this till halfway through when I googled the cast, he is outstanding in this). There is a great tense atmostphere and it builds all the way to the finale. I was therefore disappointed that the ending was so formulaic. They went for the most obvious resolution possible and this was a big letdown considering the quality of the rest of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Performances from Oscar Isaac and Alica Vikander,"There's been a lot of chatter about artificial intelligence over the past year, with public scientific figures coming forward to warn of us its dangers or praise its eventuality. Perfect timing for writer/director Alex Garland's EX MACHINA to come along with its questions on what constitutes sentience and what rights, if any, machines should be afforded should they ever develop it. EX MACHINA is a gripping science fiction drama featuring a pitch perfect cast and an intriguing premise. It stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb, a talented computer programmer working for the world's most prominent search engine company who wins a lottery with the grand prize being a week with the company's reclusive CEO at his estate. Expecting a week of relaxation and fun with the wealthiest man on the planet, Caleb is surprised when he meets Nathan (Oscar Isaac) and learns there is more to the prize than he thought. Nathan has developed a form of artificial intelligence and he wants Caleb to be the human element in a Turing test. He's introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he's nothing short of amazed at what Nathan has accomplished. Over the course of the next week, Caleb will have a series of sessions with Ava intending to determine whether she has reached the level of true sentience. But it's not so simple. Ava warns Caleb that Nathan isn't the friend he appears to be, leaving Caleb to wonder if something more sinister is occurring behind the scenes and who can be trusted.It's always hard for me to explain what I love so much about movies as fantastic as EX MACHINA because I get so caught up in the film that it's hard for me to break down what elements were so affective. I can't watch EX MACHINA without being sucked in; all of the little details escape me because I'm so engaged in the overall experience. I can say with certainty that the cast is top notch. With all respect to Gleeson, he does a great job as the audience surrogate, bringing us along with him into this bizarre scenario and reacting with perfection, but the real accolades belong to Isaac and Vikander. We'll start with Oscar Isaac as Nathan. His performance and this character are probably the most complex component of an already complex film. Nathan is probably the main reason EX MACHINA deserves at least a second viewing because you watch the film the first time and get a very definite vibe off the man. Then you see the ending, motives are revealed and everything is made clear, and the second viewing gives you the chance to re-examine his behavior. Nathan is made out to be somewhat unnerving from the moment we meet him. He lives alone in large subterranean estate on a massive plot of land and, while he comes across as friendly, there seems to be something going on underneath. Could be a more malevolent side we aren't seeing, or it could just be the secretive nature of his work causing him to play his hand close to his chest. Isaac plays it in the best way possible, leaving it ambiguous throughout. Alicia Vikander as Ava is equally notable. Ava has a beautiful purity to her. She hasn't been around long and what time she's been ""alive"" has been spent trapped in the same room with only Nathan for social interaction. She's intelligent, observant, shy, and strangely beautiful for a being comprised of metal and plastic (though her face is the most human element and the only portion utilizing a faux skin). She is one of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in film and it's no surprise Caleb begins seeing her as more than a test subject.Isaac and Vikander are great enough on their own to warrant a recommendation for this film but praise needs to be shared with the rest of the cast and crew on this film. Garland's writing is tense and the beats are perfectly laid out, giving the film a mounting sense of dread leading to what you're sure will be a rocky conclusion. The production design is both simple and effective. Information from behind the scenes explains that Nathan's estate is done in minimalistic fashion because of budget constraints but it suits the character and the film. Nathan lives here but it's hardly a home; it's a workshop. And every so often, the characters will wander out of the constrictive house environment into the gorgeous Norwegian landscapes where the film was shot. And finally, the visual effects are sensational. Ava's design and execution is seamless; you never question what you're seeing. It's incredible and even stands above some of the bigger budget blockbuster FX- driven films crowding theaters in the summer. I really do love this film and science fiction fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing out on EX MACHINA. It was one of the best films of 2015 and one of the most entertaining sci-fi films I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of a kind Sci-Fi,"Ex Machina the 2014 science-fiction film to have crossed through many minds for its input on the genre. It's rare for a sci-fi film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance—but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor. Because whatever writer/director Alex Garland wants to say about the nature of what it means to be alive, or the very human qualities of deception and self-deception, and I'm not sure he's really saying all that much. Is not remotely as delightful as watching one of the most talented actors in the world doing his thing.Ex Machina's premise is built around the reason Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) has won an opportunity to spend a week with Nathan: Nathan needs assistance with a very special experiment. He has developed an artificial intelligence robot in female form called Ava (Alicia Vikander), but the question of whether Ava is truly sentient requires the Turing test. It's Caleb's job to spend time with Ava— her translucent limbs, skull and torso exposing the sparkling machinery beneath the surface, so as to provide a constant reminder of her synthetic nature—and ask the right questions to figure out what's going on in her man-made brain. On all fronts, the film delivers great performances, wonderful technology and is visually stunning to watch. Gleeson is the weakest link of the film and I believe to be miscast but besides his performance, Vikander and Isaac carry the film. Ex Machina isn't predictable like many films in recent memory and it keeps audiences guessing.==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch (08/18/17') Ex-Machine is one of the better sci-fi films of the decade. Watching for a second time, one is able to notice more subtle clues and hints of the film as to where we think it may be heading. Ex-Machine is the type of film which Hollywood and major studios should be making more of, as it is a rare breed of great intellect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Excellent example of uncanny valley,"Vikander's performance is absolutely excellent as a prime example of uncanny valley. Beyond that, however, the movie presents a very cliche-ridden warning about advancing AI technology. Also, several of the creator's decisions and lack of foresight that allowed the ending to happen seem very out of character for a man who is supposedly this intelligent.It's definitely worth a watch for Vikander's performance, but the rest of the film isn't as spectacular.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good not great,"I felt Domhnall's portrayal was heavy handed or overdone through most of the film and it turned me off. It was almost Big Bangish: a nerdy man-child stepping out into the big adult world for the first time. I thought he was going to dig a tunnel to ""escape"" the helicopter rotors he bent over so far. His initial interactions with the mad scientist were overly awkward as if it were up to him to create the social/professional difference between them. It was so overboard that I couldn't imagine that he could overcome the length of the arc he created in 4 hours, much less two. As he struggled with the AI test, the relationships and, alas, himself, Caleb had many obvious opportunities to figure things out, but failed to ask a significant question of others or himself. I think this is the writers fault in trying to stretch the movie to its contracted length. This is why I was surprised at the end when he finally took appropriate action as there was no evidence that he was capable of thinking that way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Artificial (un)intelligence,"Today's trend is to make everything ""smart"", ""intelligent"", ""automatic"", etc. Well, so why not make a minimalistic movie about it, give it a would-be smart, however in reality predictable and dull story (that logically totally breaks up in the end), boring and superficial lovestory, put it in an attractive environment, wrap it all up with latin name and wait what happens?Ex Machina is appealing, but after one view there's nothing interesting to make it more memorable experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Great Film,I knew nothing of this film bare a rough idea of the general subject matter.It is a great watch. Solid acting performances from all involved (interestingly both male leads are played by actors that went on to feature in the Force Awakens but this could not be further away from that Blockbuster genre of movie) and a clever simple story that unfolds and twists unpredictably.In the case of this movie then less is definitely more. A single set. A few characters. Simple plot. Intelligent dialogue. A very worthy and thought provoking film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
