Rebel Yell,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible Scottish nobility, in particular the treachery of the future ""try, try again"" hero - King Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
My favorite Mel Gibson film,"I'm a fan of super intense acting performances. Intensity to me is what I think people call star power or charisma. Lethal Weapon is one of those movies where his intensity is on full display but he has a different kind of thing going on here. He's a tad older, wiser, gets accosted personally and his livelihood, so his intensity is of a different ilk. He's crazy in Lethal Weapon but in Braveheart he's completely intense while being completely sane at the same time. All of his actions in this film are justified. You're rooting for him from frame one. This is the best film he's ever been in and possible ever will be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Your Heart is Free, Have the Courage to Follow It...","A simple message but even today, over seven hundred years later, there are far too many captive to their cultures, governments and institutions. They take a large slice, sometimes all of the freedoms William Wallace and so many others fought for. Keep up the fight because, like the tide, those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema, you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope, although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed, power and control.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"""Every man dies, not every man really lives.""","The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best movie ever,"Most on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but this is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Simply amazing,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time in late 2003, and I was impressed. I saw it again last night, and I was even more impressed. The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don't know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Very Fast 3 hrs,"What to say about Braveheart?This movie holds up against the challenge of aging, its exciting, adventurous, funny and passionate.
The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible.Is it violent? Sure but what war isn't. I think Mel makes violence as much a part of the story in all his (relevant) films. The characters struggle through great violence and the impacts that is has on them, by not shying away from it we are allowed to get a small appreciation of it and them.The movie isn't OTT but delivers great action that serves the story and entertains the viewer.Its considered a classic film and so it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Je-ne-sais-quoi-ly great!,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Braveheart till 2003 when it was on TV. However, the lack of theatrical effects never stopped me from being mesmerized by this epic for one moment. So mesmerized, I literally sat motionlessly on the couch for two minutes after the movie. Any normal audience would likely to cast his/her sense of reality away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga.Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more importantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry, vivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history. Along with the unforgettable 'Alba gu bragh!' and the unprecedentedly heart-stopping 'Freeeeedom', Braveheart unquestionably is one of the greatest movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I don't penalize it as much as some people do for being historically inaccurate, I just had to point it out.

A decent enough film but a historical joke,"I am a fan of this particularly period in English History and when I initially saw Braveheart I recognised that this whole story is a complete fabrication and bears no resemblance to the truth at all. But I didn't worry too much - surely everyone would recognise that this is just a film? But no - it seems that a lot of people have swallowed this drivel and think that its all true.This film is not just a little bit inaccurate, its a complete and utter joke historically. Just because Edward I (or Longshanks as the film constantly refers to him) died nearly seven hundred years ago is not an excuse to assassinate his character and to depict him as a coward is a complete disgrace. Edward had another nickname apart from Longshanks - The Lion of Justice - now I doubt he got that from being a tyrant!!!! This film makes the classic mistake of judging historical events and characters by todays standards rather than the context in which they existed. The political and social environment of medieval Europe was a lot different to modern-day USA, and do not be thinking that the Scots themselves were averse to invading weaker countries - they attempted to invade Ireland while Bruce was on the throne under the pretence of 'helping' them (they lost!). Now, I have the utmost respect for Wallace, but to depict him as a moral crusader is way off the mark - he was certainly capable of acts of brutality and barbarism himself. The character of Robert Bruce is equally inaccurate - being depicted as feeling guilty over changing sides when in fact all of his actions were for his own gain - and this is a man who murdered another Scottish claimant to the throne in cold blood - hardly a nice guy!The storyline and characters in the film are also terribly one-dimensional. Every single Englishman in this film is evil and cowardly - there are no good English people to create a conflict in the English camp that would have made things more interesting. The English, like all European and World powers have been guilty of their fair share of atrocities in the past, none of which I am proud of, but to cast us as complete villains is clearly racism.  Also, the plot has far too many holes and the characters do not behave logically - for example a royal French princess (Isabella) falling for a common Scottish peasant (although in reality Wallace was not a peasant and Isabella was only a child when Wallace died anyway and she certainly never met him). Edward also behaves illogically - loosing arrows on his own troops and throwing a young nobleman out of his castle window. The barons in England were immensely powerful at this time, and the king could not just do as he pleased without repercussions. However, perhaps the best joke of all in this film is the suggestion that Wallace was the father of Edward III. Apart from the fact that Edward III apparently looked very similar to Edward I and every bit a Plantagenet, he was born about 7 years after Wallace died anyway. There are enough historical inaccuracies in this film to fill a book.As a piece of cinema this film is highly entertaining, if a little simplistic in plot. The battle scenes are exciting (although not accurate re-enactments of the battles they represent) and the story interesting enough to keep you watching. So, watch it and enjoy - but please treat it as a work of fiction, as apart from the names of the characters this is clearly what it is. History has always contained more exciting stories than fiction ever could - but the fact that the scriptwriters of this film needed to be so economical with the truth tells its own story - Wallace's life, although historically important, wasn't that interesting at all in reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
For he had only one life to give for Scotland.,"On my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told.  Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on.  The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace.  It historically never happened.  This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES!The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling.  He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.Out of ten............10/10!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
You should have courage to make this movie. ⭐,"Most of the times Hollywood movies is sided. I don't know what you believe but sadly this movie based on the truth.

Sometimes it's hard to be a Scotsman,"There are times when a movie can be watched for its pure entertainment value, but it's usually when we're talking about epic scale fantasy-land type stories. With historical adaptations, it would be a refreshing change if movie studios, writers and directors could actually stick to facts for once in a while.Too often, we get served a mishmash of explosions and/or overly dramatic performances trying to make up for the lack of any real acting talent. Braveheart is one of those ilk and as a Scotsman and student of history, I can't get past the blatant revision of important events in a vain attempt to make up for a terrible script, distinctly average direction and an accent that would get you killed if you used it in any bar in Scotland.This film is rescued by some great cinematography, but there is really no need to redo the story of William Wallace, as the truth is every bit as dramatic as this pandering to an American audience's need for the hero to be a glorious warrior for justice and almost without sin. It seems to be that 'Hollywood' can't seem to realise that anti-heroes, as the real Wallace was, can be every bit as entertaining, if not more engrossing for their character flaws, than these sanitised, lily-white warped reflections could ever be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Wallace's courage is inspiring,"This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music, and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace, involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood, we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran, a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage, as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately, one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in, but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon, other clans join Wallace, then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell, the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace, Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes, or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far, but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

If this is the best film you've ever seen - See More Films!,"Honestly, it's not that good. It's too long, too trite, too formulaic and too revisionist.Wallace WAS seven feet tall (more or less), but as far as I can tell he was a racist thug - the film conveniently skips over the fact that he had an argument with an Englishman who he murdered, along with five or six others, and then ran away. So much for 'Freedom'. More like ""I can't control my temper and the English are after me,so I'd better get some help"". He was about as popular with the Scots nobles as he was with the English. Oh, and he wasn't a peasant either.Anyone saying ""it's only a movie""-well read how many comments are praising this film for its historical accuracy.

"Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.","So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Historical war par excellence,"One of the early ""historical epics"" to set off a still-current wave of ancient adventures, this is epic, grand stuff spoiled only slightly by a twinge of Hollywoodian uneasiness and a little overloading of sentimentality. It isn't as bad as in something like, say, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred, this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.War is hell here, literally; bloody and violent, with limbs flying and bodies torn asunder. Yet for a film chock full of gruesome violence and obscene torture, it's remarkably good-natured, focusing on the characters foremost and being successful with it. Gibson is fine in the leading role – if a little too old – and the supporting cast are great. The plot is complex and wide-reaching and the characterisations and script are both spot on. A perfect blend of heroic escapism and back-stabbing politics, this is a modern classic of the genre and it proves Gibson's worth not as a star but as a director because his direction is exemplary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Timeless favorite,"OK, so it was not 100% accurate in content or historical detail but that aside, it was one of the greatest films that has yet to be truly matched. The cast performed very well as this well written tale was told. Even though it is over 10 years old now, it still holds a place in my heart as one of the best. The accuracy of the battle scenes are only eclipsed by the expressions of the actors faces as they share this story. Stephen the Irishman steals the show with his plucky comic relief. Hamish the sidekick does a great job playing against the over the top performance of Mel Gibson. The predominantly European cast does a great job of not needing to fake accents and mannerisms.

Scots Missed,"Someone really missed out on a good story here.

And why demean the hero by having him up against such a pantomime villain - sure Edward was a twisted b*****d, but the filmmakers might as well have given him a sidekick called Igor and have him cackle at choice moments throughout the film, he was that unsubtle. Most importantly, however, it seems a real shame that it should be this film that should have captured the hearts of the Scottish nation, they deserve so much better.

Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I,"In 14th Century Scotland, when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her, William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant , the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time , Edward I was at least 6 feet, 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself , ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales, although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308, after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling , York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie ,Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I, who decisively defeated the Scots , the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce , though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) , who is considered a National Hero of Scotland .This epic movie contains thrills , emotion ,romance , breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However , some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90% of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys , the Scots , versus bad guys , the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clichés , being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace , this screen-writer had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle; he had never heard of the 14th-century figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about ""Scotland's greatest hero"" to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes , he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design , including thousands of extras , a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish - members of the Irish Army - although they are supposed to be Scottish or English, as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal , including bloody battles , strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia , the lover was based on Piers Gaveston, who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll , showing marvelous outdoors , including glamorous opening shots , snowy peaks , silvery lochs , dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner ; despite the film being set in Scotland, and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero, the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack -most notably at William's father's funeral- are the Uilleann pipes, which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director ; though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks , among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct ""Braveheart"" were Polanski's ""Macbeth,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Chimes at Midnight,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" and ""Throne of Blood"" . Rating : Better than average. Worthwhile watching . The picture will appeal to Mel Gibson fans .",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A masterpiece.,"William Wallace leads a rebellion against King Edward I of England.Is this the greatest historical movie of all time? It's surely a contender, it's one of my top twenty greatest films of all time.It's an incredible story from history, it's perfectly brought to life in a hugely credible and successful manner, it's almost as if you're there with them, witnessing the struggle first hand.In the hands of a lesser Director, this could easily have been a gore fest, and don't get me wrong it has its moments, but the balance between blood lust and story is perfect.The scale of this film is quite something, no wonder it is still loved by so many fans.The visuals are sublime, this is one incredible production, it looks phenomenal from start to finish. It's a long running time, but never at any point does it feel long or dull, it holds your attention from start to finish.The only criticism I ever had, there are some incredibly white teeth, I was asked to find a flaw, that was the only thing I could ever come up with, in every single aspect, this film delivers.It doesn't perhaps have the same sweeping score of a film such as Gladiator, but the music works incredibly well, it's subtle, and the film doesn't need heavy music.Mel Gibson has delivered for so many years, a multitude of incredible performances, for me though, I'll always consider this his greatest achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"good movie, but it panders to Scots-Irish socio-politics of America","This movie is a well made and rousing movie. It is a gritty movie.And it taps deeply into the Scots-Irish socio-political background of America. And I would know--I am an American of mostly Scots-Irish descent.The Scots-Irish socio-politics is maybe the biggest single problem with America, and the biggest problem with the world, at least right now.There is a massive reservoir of cultural stupidity in the Scots-Irish culture. You can see it ALL OVER this movie. It is central to this movie. What it is, is the idea that fighting and dying for this ephemeral concept, freedom, is a Good Thing. What a sad sad idea that really is. Better to live and sabotage and fight a low profile cultural fight, rather than fight and die as they did in this movie.Unfortunately, the Scots Irish has bought into this fantasy time and time again. But throughout history, it has never been the brave warrior-patriot-citizen who has exhorted the Scots-Irish and the American people to war for fight for ""freedom."" No, indeedy. Instead, it has been the rich, the powerful, and the corporations who have used this subterfuge in order to persuade the SCots Irish to fight and die. Corporate profits and more riches and estates for the wealthy have almost always been disguised as ""freedom."" Those Scots Irish wound up immigrating to America, and now they form the base of the Republican party. And now we have yet another faux warrior-patriot-citizen in George Bush, exhorting the Scots Irish to die for freedom. And once again, they are falling for the manipulation. Well, at least most of them. But not this old Scots-Irish....",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
For Braveheart,"An enduring epic story
A film that is free for every person and every person who is concerned about happiness, growth and excellence should watch this masterpiece.It may always fail, get killed and die in the right appearance, but the blood is holy and it finally wins over blackness and oppression, and this movie expresses this truth.This movie is always fresh and new with its dialogues
I have watched it many times since I was 10 years old, and I have practiced epic and bravery with its unique song.For me, who lives in the Middle East, this story is a bit repetitive, because the history of my country is full of epics and arrogance, and when I see that epics and efforts to save our countrymen are sacred everywhere in the world, my hope for the future of human life increases, we are not supposed to destroy the world. Let's blacken each other, but we are going to establish the best kind of human life on earth one day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
My favorite movie of all time.,"Personally, this is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not going to ramble on and on about this movie...I'll just lay it on the line for you. It's great. Most importantly, it has a little bit of everything.In my mind, it's the ultimate movie, it has all aspects of humans. Violence, courage, betrayal, love, death, comedy, it has it all. It's more action based than anything, but there is a love plot and friendship plots and everything. All in all, it's a very deep and touching movie with large amounts of killing.If you like action movies or just great movies in general, then definitely check this out, it shouldn't disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love","I recently revisited Braveheart (1995) on Max. The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom.Directed by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull).Every aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film.In conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love. I would confidently rate it a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Overrated,"I was very surprised when this won the Oscars for best picture and director. It's a fairly standard action movie.  The battle scenes are gory but not very realistic -- somehow, long, drawn out affairs are over in about 15 minutes, the good guys are super killing machines, etc.Gibson is a good at playing cool, restrained characters like Mad Max, but not good at playing a romantic lead or inspiring leader -- he was trying to be Kirk Douglas in Spartacus, but ended more like Graham Chapman in Life of Brian.The entire portrayal of the agonized Robert Bruce was very dopey.The direction is flabby, and uncertain, the pacing off, and the costumes aren't even terribly interesting or authentic.Historical dramas tend to work best when they don't try to turn their stories toward universal truths, but focus on the characters and situations at hand.  Gibson tried to turn Braveheart into a rousing statement about honor! truth! passion! freedom! but ended up just parroting the standard Hollywood line.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A Memorable, Powerful, Oscar Winner!","An incredibly interesting story and many moments of rich dialogue Braveheart was film that not only kept you entertained but kept you feeling for the characters (This is mainly due to the directing and acting from Mel Gibson). The film really showed the true evil and good of the world (Which some films of good vs. Bad struggle to do). I don't think they ported the battles or William Wallace very well (It wasn't historically accurate). I think their use of humor in some scenes just felt out of place and while many people are against violence in movies I think for this film they easily could've had more to emphasize the brutality of the story. The score was fantastic one of the best I've heard it was fitting to the film it had a calming, Celtic and warming film yet you knew it was brutal. Hearing the score in my opinion was like looking at a battlefield after the battle it's quiet and its peaceful yet you know what really happened there. Overall it's a great film that I think most people should see the plot is great though some of it isn't true, the score is great and the ending is great (See for yourself).",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Rip Roaring Fun,"William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.Director Mel Gibson is pulling all the stops to create this epic historical melodrama. It is rip roaring fun. The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love, to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun.

Braveheart,"I am afraid that as a Scotsman, I had way more problem with the factual elements of this than perhaps I ought to have had. We have this history drummed into us as bairns, and so when a grand-scale depiction like this comes along, I excitedly expected more. It doesn't matter a jot that the eponymous Mel Gibson isn't a Scot - that is the acting equivalent of a red herring. What matters is that the story is largely a work of fiction. Gory, beautiful, authentic looking, certainly - but fiction nonetheless. Taken on that basis, then, it is still an entertaining mediaeval drama depicting the struggle of the king-less Scots against the oppression of England's King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Using a panoply of familiar faces, it gradually demonstrates the brutality of the English over these vassals, and introduces us to ""William Wallace"" (Gibson) who is one of the few who wishes to fight back. The killing of his wife at the hands of his local magistrate (Malcolm Tierney) is the last straw, and soon he is working with his kinsman Argyle (Brian Cox) to formulate a plan. What now ensues is a well produced, stylishly filmed drama offering us plenty of scheming and plotting and some seriously gory battle scenes before it all culminates in the unavoidable denouement. It takes it's time to get underway, but once it is up and running it is well paced, there is a minimum of romance, plenty of swordplay and lots of unadulterated freedom-fighter jingoism. Why not? It is a film about a man who fought for the freedom of his people against the tyranny of an interloper, and is effective at that. The historical timelines are a bit all over the place, as are many of the characterisations, but again that's another matter of fact that we have had to ditch at the opening titles. ""Braveheart"" is exciting, fast-moving and bloody - just what it is meant to be, and for that Gibson ought to be commended. Just a shame it couldn't be just bit more rooted in fact.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Offensive in every Sense,"Mel Gibson, instead of stirring up trouble in the UK, should instead go back to his own country and perhaps make a film about Aboriginal oppression and their struggle for land rights. The Americans love this movie because it is a simplistic and factually incorrect representation of freedom fighting that they think fits in with their own struggle against the British. Why are we always the bad guys?Britain abolished slavery before America, Britian has the oldest democracy in the world, yet we always represent the evil West so the Americans dont feel guilt. Anyway, onto the film... Factual inconsistencies: The English king outlived William Wallace and the Queen only gave birth YEARS after Wallace died. The portrayal of the homosexual prince as weak and incompetent is completely offensive and probably inspired by Gibson's sense of machismo. The homosexual men of the Roman Empire were weak, weren't they? No, no they were not. Much is made of English cruelty but when the Scots sack York no mention is made of English suffering in the film. The fact is, life in those times was cruel, and the Scots would gladly have enslaved the English if they ever got the chance (Mary Queen of Scots, anyone?) This film is over-sentimental, predictable and depressingly obvious. I gave it 1 out of 10 and was thoroughly bored when watching it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Braveheart: An Evaluation of an Epic Historical Drama,"The film effectively transports the viewers to the atmosphere and historical details of 13th-century Scotland.

These scenes provide unforgettable moments with stunning visual effects and action.However, the film tends to play with history and deviates from some historical facts. The real-life of William Wallace might not have been as romanticized as portrayed in the film.

One of my favorite movies for 8 years. It makes me feel like to be in the middle of the battlefield with a sword in my hand and blood on my face...,"It has it's reason, that I'm writing my first comment about this movie: I was 9 when I saw the Braveheart for the first time- now I'm 17,and I still like it. Why? I think everybody who saw this movie knows whether he like it not; I just want to say some words about that.The movie is not just about showing the lifestyle in the 13th century; not just about showing the pain...-how much does it hurt, how hard is it to take,when something happens to our love, when we can do nothing to help her when she is dying; how cruel is to fight a war; how BRAVE it is to stand the torture-it's not just about these things...What we can see in the movie,or what we can FEEL the feeling inside our heart, how are we just falling apart when we are watching it,just watching the people dying for FREEDOM. We can be there,stand in the middle of the battlefield and feel the warm blood in our face and passion in our soul,because we are fighting for our homeland. We see the pain in the eyes of our friends, who are watching us dying....and the last word...FREEDOM. Everything what's important in the movie is inside that one single word,all the feelings; everything.In the last battle,in the end of the movie we cannot even sit in our chair.We need to stand up,or do something with our hands (we are just so excited) ,because we haven't seen the movie yet but we can feel it, feel the incredible power of people who want to be free,and we know who's going to win the battle.That the reason why I like that movie so much.

Anyway, in my opinion ""Braveheart"" is the most complete epic film in living memory and those who have not seen it, do not know what you're missing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Made huge mistake; must warn others!,"First of all, I have to say that the first time I saw Braveheart, I loved it, unequivocally.  Too old to remember what I once knew of Scottish history, and therefore entirely unaware of any historical inaccuracies which I've since heard others put forth, I saw only a long, lush, romantic, dramatic, cinematic war poem, the sort of thing that would have become required reading in English literature courses had it been created by a troubador a few centuries earlier.  It didn't even bother me that Mel Gibson, despite his usual exceptionally strong acting, was far too old for the hero's role.  I was enchanted and deeply moved.Let me also state my opinion that, no matter what, Braveheart is still a really good movie.  The sheer choreography of the battle scenes is superb and not to be missed.  Patrick McGoohan's performance is the best I've seen him do yet.  Most of the little glimpses we get of Sophie Marceau are lovely and memorable.  The only real criticisms I can make of this film rest on the length and on certain cliches which could have been avoided; there were a number of scenes that could have been trimmed to strengthen Braveheart's impact immensely, and the script was not always as strong as the point.  But these are small criticisms.  Watching Braveheart is like immersing yourself greedily in a thick historical novel.However, when I first saw Braveheart, I had never seen anything like it on film.  So over the course of the next few years, hungry for more rich widescreen epics spread over two cassettes, I watched and rewatched a lot of other films, as much David Lean and Akira Kurosawa as I could find.  The first movie I saw after Braveheart was Lawrence of Arabia, which I'd seen and loved before; then, at my boyfriend's instigation, I moved into Kurosawa with a vengeance, starting with Ran.  If my goal had been to keep loving Braveheart, this was probably my first mistake.Then my boyfriend, at my urging, bought the video of Braveheart, letterboxed and everything as all originally widescreen films should be.  A big Kurosawa fan, and someone who cannot seem to get enough of beautifully presented violent tragedy, I assumed my boyfriend would love Braveheart as much as I had.  This was my second mistake.  For had he not purchased this videotape, my third and most critical error of judgment would never have occurred.My third mistake took place a couple of weeks ago.  We held a little film party at our house, ostensibly to watch Monty Python movies with a bunch of our friends, ages ranging from early 20s to late 30s.  We first watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a brilliant and hilarious movie we all love dearly.  Then the people who don't like violent tragedies, even when beautifully presented, had to go home.  So the question arose, what should we watch next?For some reason, neither Monty Python's The Meaning of Life nor Life of Bryan, which we had rented just for the occasion, appealed to the remaining guests.  For some perverse reason which I can only attribute to too many margaritas, we all agreed to watch Braveheart.Like The Holy Grail, Braveheart attempts to portray life in medieval Britain as it might really have been, filth and all.  So the first time we snickered when we saw a dirty face, we suspected we were in trouble.  As soon as the first English soldier in a bullet-shaped helmet appeared to receive a thorough taunting, those of use who had seen Braveheart before knew at once that our love affair with the film was over.  It didn't take long for our small audience to begin screaming things at the screen such as, ""Come back and fight, you coward!"" or ""Not dead; in fact, I'm feeling a little better,"" or ""You don't frighten us, English pig dogs!"" or, worst of all, ""Naughty, naughty Zoot!""I don't want to spoil Braveheart for others.  The purpose of this review is simply to put forth a warning.  And so I will not walk you through all the parallels we encountered, much to the detriment of Braveheart, from costume to character to event.  It would be unkind.  Nor will I go into a detailed analysis of the flaws of Braveheart versus the virtues of, say, Kagemusha.I would offer two warnings, though.  The first warning is that, if you love Braveheart and have not watched a lot of Kurosawa, go carefully into that rich domain.  Know that once you have seen Ran, with all its beautifully composed scenes, unique and perfect music, and careful, truly poetic editing, never again will you be able to look at Braveheart with the same respect.The second warning is much more obscure, probably a mistake others are not likely to make, but still...  If you love Braveheart, or if you want to love Braveheart, never ever screen it directly after screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Oh, sure; should you disregard this warning, you will certainly have fun.  Rolling around on the floor and laughing until you hurt is generally enjoyable.  However, you will never again be able to view Braveheart with any type of dignity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Not Such A Brave-heart,"watched Braveheart for the first time in many years recently and it's fair to say that I was genuinely surprised by how utterly and irredeemably bad this movie actually is. If you need reminding it won a whole host of Oscars way back in 1995 (including Best Picture).I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, not just because he hates me, but because he really doesn't float my boat in a dramatic sense. I think Braveheart is a really good film to highlight his chronic lack of on screen charisma and the notable absence of any real acting ability (that doesn't involve looking solemn or crazy). His performance in this movie is almost a parody, at points I felt like I was watching something from the people who made the likes of Date Movie etc. (which incidentally is probably a better movie than Braveheart!).Mel's lack of charisma and ability are just two of the reasons I dislike this movie. There are however many other reasons. Firstly we are supposed to accept that it is perfectly fine for William Wallace to express indifference at the English occupation so long as his wife is with him. When wifey has her throat slit by an evil Englishman (more on them later) suddenly Wallace catches the highly infectious 'freedom at any cost' disease. He gets rival factions of Scottish tribes together and with no real chance of victory, he murders the English and drags his countrymen into a evidently and ultimately futile war in which thousands will perish and all to avenge the death of his wife; whose memory he abandons/desecrates half way through the movie when he sleeps with Princess Isabelle (who of course finds his ruggedness irresistible).Wallace is portrayed first as an abject coward unwilling to oppose oppression and then as a selfish madman who gets off on butchering people with a large variety of obtusely shaped metal objects, and finally as a man-whore who can't keep his genitals concealed under his kilt for more than 5 minutes. And we are supposed to believe this man is a hero and that his acts are heroic? Come on!Now I'm not really that fussy when it comes to historical inaccuracies in Hollywood movies; however I think artistic license is probably taken a little to far in this movie, particularly when every English character is represented as an inept, bloodthirsty, paganistic murderer and every Celt as a loyal, rugged, family orientated, God-fearing freedom fighter. Also Gibson, as director, seems to present, with the Prince Edward character, homosexuality as either a) a weakness or b) as being part of a type of madness. Seriously, this is straight from the Rambo textbook of social and geo-political representation. In other words; the complex Anglo-Celtic relationship is dumbed down so much that it becomes a laughable parody of a serious and interesting subject.On a technical level Braveheart also falls foul of anything resembling a coherent narrative structure. As I have mentioned, Wallace's motivations are at the very least muddled, at worst incompressible. One event (usually a big battle or a shot of Mel's arse, or Mel stood on a mountain, or Mel holding a sword, or Mel giving a monologue about those pesky Jews, sorry English) leads to another with no real logical progression or explanation or fathomable reasoning. It's like watching a movie with every other scene missing.Overall, I would love for someone to explain to me why they like this movie because I'm totally baffled as to why anyone would.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This is a cinematic experience -- a true composition of sight, sound and excitement.

Villains rule over a country could not interest me in the least,"My point is which group of villains rule over a country could not interest me in the least. Where on earth do you imagine all this iniquity flows from? Human Nature, good luck improving it. The glorification of the Scots and the concomitant delineation of the English as Satan's imps, forgive me, speaks more to Mel being an Australian than to historical veracity. There is this unrelenting demonetizing of the English right out of a comic book. The Lords Of The Congregation who ruled over Scotland, for a time, were not renowned for their heavenly saintliness towards papists. This is the other problem the movie's deep sense of historical unreality about it.

Nice film to spend your time...,"...but this film is perhaps the one with most historical inaccuracies, ever!!!First, the NATIONAL HERO of Scotland William Wallace wasn't a poor peasant taken by an uncle to visit... Rome or Paris. There was a Wallace HOUSE, the man was NOBLE. Not too much important, not so much rich, but wasn't a ""simply nobody man"" as the film portraits.Second, obviously, he didn't had emotional/sexual relationship with the... Princess of Wales, the future QUEEN OF ENGLAND!!!!! King Edward's son was a moron, a stupid arrogant lad,... but there is no evidence that he was a homosexual - as the film wants to mock him.Third, the Scots did fighting ""painted"" like that. That was the traditional way of fight of THE SCOTTISH ANCIENT ANCESTORS, the ""Picts""; which a nickname from the Latin word ""Picti"" which means ""PAINTED"" (FOLK). The Roman Legionaries started calling them ""Picti""/""Pict"", because the ancient Scots were fighting NAKED with full body paint job (traditional paganistic protection designs)! And the colour was dark-blue or black, nothing like that cyan of Mel Gibson.Fourth, the modern MARK of Scots, the ""kilt"" skirt with the clan ""tartans"", were found around 17th century, ""just... few"" (four!) centuries later! There were NO CLANS/HOUSES' specific clothing or emblems, in the era of Wallace.Fifth, the Sterling Bridge battle took place on... guess what?... a BRIDGE!!!! That was the (clever) plan of Wallace. There was a SINGLE semi-stone-semi-wooden VERY NARROW bridge, leading folks from Northern England to Southern Scotland. The English army had to use that narrow bridge to cross the river and invade Scotland and THERE was the place Wallace abused them. The (much more) greater army had to be a narrow line of 2-men-weight and cross the bridge... which was an easy task for the waiting Scots on the other side of the bridge! They also used the ""schiltron"" formation (a pack of men carrying large lances/spears) and they massacre the English army.In the film, they do have a ""short of schiltron"" formation but they're facing the HEAVY UNDEFEATED ENGLISH CAVALRY... in open field!!!!!! They would CRASH the Scots like a bowl of crapes!Five, they showing (as the Scots) the English having UNIQUE ONE design of uniforms, as a modern army. Nope. NOBODY HAD unique single design uniforms at that era! Not even in Napoleon's era, they didn't had unique single design, but many many designs (and most of the times, the men were confused who was the enemy on the battlefield).(Its the same ""classic"" mistake they're doing in US CIVIL WAR films!!!!! They're always showing the North wearing the dark-blue uniforms and the CSA Rebels wearing the Grey! Nope! Everybody was wearing HIS OWN CLOTHING, mostly grey-BROWN clothes. SOME Northern Regiments had the famous dark-blue uniforms, but only at the late of the war. And most of the GENERALS (North & South) had the VERY SAME UNIFORM, the early-days WEST POINT grey uniform, which BOTH (North-South) were wearing the same, since they both were students of the ONE ONLY MILITARY academy!)...I could write for ever. As I wrote in the start, this film has the MOST historical inaccuracies, ever! But... but... still, remains one of the MOST ENJOYABLE films I ever watched.And VERY EMOTIONAL!!!! Even if you are not Scot, you'll cry in many scenes! Especially in the very LAST SCENE (no spoils)... which I'm crying like baby EVERY time I watching the film!Overall?

All that has been said regarding historical inaccuracies has already been said in previous reviews.

9.5/10 - Freeeeeeeeeeeedom!,"Review: This is one of those types of movies which will give you the 'good goosebump' feeling after watching it. It's a typical epic that details a certain hero fighting against all odds for freedom of his/her country. Although the story is pretty typical, its ability to entrance you in it is not. Not many movies are able to accomplish this. Mixed with a powerful musical score (which also won Best Score at Academy Awards for information sake), the movie delivers an amazing experience to viewers satisfying epic lovers, and action seekers. Acting by Mel Gibson is spectacularly superb (he has an edge since he IS partly Scottish). It loses 0.5 points however due to the constant playing of the musical score in some situations which do not seem to fit well with it. What many people complain about is that it is historically inaccurate, I don't remember this movie being brandished with a ""True historical story"" or even a ""Based on a true story"" logo. Watch it for the 'good goosebump' feeling.9.5/10 - Freeeeeeeeeeeedom!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
crap,"The scenery is nice,costumes are good, acting not bad,but that is about it.What is it with Mel Gibson and his anti English feelings.I find him dangerous in modern day film making,he takes a story and twists it around with out knowing anything about our history and comes up with these very offensive anti English films,almost like Hitler and his anti semitic propaganda.According to him English men are either gay,rapists,murderers,torturers,we are yet to see how he wants to portray English women,ma by he thinks their lesbian prostitutes who go around murdering small boys, please don't give him ideas.The worst thing of all is that the film is set many centuries ago when every one was barbaric to one another,he makes it look like it was last week.I'm an Englisman who has Scots and Irish friends,and all actor /directors, if you can call him that do is just stir up trouble.He knows nothing about our history so he should stay out of it,leave it to the professionals,like Richard Attenborough.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best movie I have ever seen,"This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.It's a combination of several things that made this movie so epic for me. First of all, the uniqueness of the story is what made me love seeing this movie over and over. The story of William Wallace has got to be the most heroic and captivating story I have ever seen. What amazed me is how from the beginning to the end, William Wallace fought for his freedom and for his love. He yearned for a peaceful life after years of war and misery, yet this wasn't a path that had been set out for him.This is all wonderfully brought into picture by Mel Gibson, who was the perfect match for a character such as William Wallace. The music in this movie has yet to be beat by any other score in another movie. It really makes you feel the atmosphere of Scotland in the brutal age this movie was set in. The combination of the breathtaking music, the Scottish highlands (Irish, Scottish, who notices the difference? :D) and the epic battle scenes are one of the best things in this movie. I also think the character playing Longshanks deserves an honorable mention, he was just utterly fantastic in this movie.All in all, if you haven't seen Braveheart, I suggest you order the DVD, because you will be wanting to see it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
breath-taking,"this is one of the most amazing films i have ever seen. it captures emotion on a new level. Gibson portrays feeling through intense stares and slow motion. this film makes it impossible to be patriotic about england. i do not like excess gore but i hated the English (i am English) so much in this film that i felt it was well justified. Gibson's power and conviction combined with the script draws you into a wonderful story of passion, honour and love. it is a long film (approx 3 hours) but i could barely remember where i was by the end. if you watch only one film in your life let this be it, don't bother renting it just buy it its a safe risk, I've never heard a bad review and this is definitely one you'll want to keep!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Greatest film ever!,"As all the other comments here have pretty much said how I feel I will instead just draw attention to what I consider to be the best sequence of the film: when Wallace rides into town in slo-mo to avenge his wife. This is without doubt one of the finest examples of mounting tension ever, combining perfect use of heightened sound, slo-mo, rising music and great acting: Gibson looks absolutely without emotion as he stares at the first soldier and then kills him. From there the film doesn't let up. Yep, I love it! For once the Academy were right......",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best of this era,"This is surely one of the best i have ever seen if not the best. flawless is the word for the movie.Mel Gibson has given it a tremendous direction along with his supreme acting skills. I got to say i have seen many but the impact that this film generates is simply amazing.The story is based on William Wallace, a commoner, whom unites the 13th Century Scots in their battle to overthrow English rule.It's definitely a must watch for every movie lover as well for those also whom do not watch movies that much. I must admit that this is perhaps the greatest action/drama movie ever made. It is hard to believe that it was made in the year 1995.So folks if u have'nt seen this movie u are surely missing a great movie. Go and see it because this is the BEST.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"An Enjoyable Film, But Winner of Five Oscars... Really?","William Wallace loses his father at a young age. After going away for a while, he returns (now as Mel Gibson) to raise a family. That dream quickly comes to an end when his wife is assaulted and killed by English soldiers. He becomes a patriot in a romantic rage, not resting until England gets its boots off the throat of Scotland.Historian Sharon Krossa notes that Scotsmen did not wear kilts at this time, saying that this is akin to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits"" and further that ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate -- in short, just about nothing is accurate""... which more or less sums up my primary complaint about this film.I enjoyed it as a story about an oppressed people rising up against their masters, even if it didn't really have any basis in reality. I was a bit confused about Gibson as Wallace, with hair styled by the same person who helps Dog the Bounty Hunter. And I'm not sure how this received ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Director"". I do not think it's a bad film or bad direction, but I have to believe the other films this year must have been considered pretty bad for Mel Gibson to enter the list of legends and giants. I would say, for example, that ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is a better film.I had the film presented to me as ""chick flick"", and I can see that. Despite the violence and political message (about freedom and independence and nationalism), the underlying theme is that Wallace loved his wife and fights in her honor... though he doesn't really take issue with hooking up with his enemy's wife. I guess two wrongs make a right?I see this film as a bridge between ""Spartacus"" and ""300"", as a story of a small number of people fighting against a much larger enemy. Like Spartacus, Wallace is to some extent a slave. Like the Spartans, the Scots have everything against them when fighting the English. Despite the parallels, the sad fact is that ""Spartacus"" is the best film, and ""300"" the least... seems that uprising films are becoming less grand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
10 out of 10 (I'd rate it higher if I could),"I watched the movie again the other day, and I had to write a review. This movie is as close as it gets to perfection.

The acting is perfect, the directing is amazing, the scenes of Scotland are beautiful, even the fight scenes that are full of blood (like you can direct violence without blood?!) are spectacular. Mel Gibson really did an amazing job here and every time I see some good movie I use Braveheart as a reference point - that explains how high this movie is on my list!

A Masterpiece,"Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a powerful historical epic that tells the story of a man named William Wallace and how he fought for the freedom of Scotland. The movie stars Mel Gibson as Wallace a man who was devoted to his country's natural rights. Director and star Mel Gibson really knows the history behind how Scotland got their independence from England, this movie has a similar story to Gandhi by Richard Attenborough in which both of those films had only one thing in common both Scotland and India wanted independence from England but in different centuries. What Mel Gibson tries to teach us from this film is how much of a hero that William Wallace was in real life at the time he was alive. Also the musical score by James Horner was just plain perfect for the movie itself. Also the movie compares to epic historical masterpieces like Schindler's List, Lincoln,Gandhi,Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, and many more.A Definite A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Emotional epic.....,"This movie will always feature in my Top Ten of All Time. The film is extremely well made, with out-standing Direction, a very strong script (if inaccurate in regards to the subject matter), the acting is top notch as is the score (in fact its exceptional) and all these elements make this an amazingly passionate and emotionally charged epic. As a Scot I find myself being slightly bias about the film of course. The historic inaccuracy's are rather large and the film-makers do make the English out to be rather like cartoon bad guy's at times. The final scenes are very powerful and the battles are fierce and believable.I have watched the film many times, and every time I find it as emotional as the first time.

The Best Movie Ever,"Mel Gibson's Braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made. The first thing I can say is that the movie was extremely inspiring, whether the story was 100% accurate or not if you take it as it is, the story is inspiring. It is also action packed and still to this day 29 years later it still holds up action wise.The movie is also shot beautiful the cinematic feel of the movie is better than 99% of what is being put out today this movie just screams cinematic in all aspects. The best part of the movie for me is how moving it was. I have never been more moved by a movie, when it was over I was speechless and Just sat there taking it all in.

"Unremarkable, shallow epic","Why this passable but completely forgettable film has apparently garnered a reputation as a classic in the last decade is beyond me. There's really not much to write home about here.There's no complexity or levels or anything, just good vs. evil, fight fight fight, freedom freedom freedom. Gibson, of course, is as limited an actor as he's ever been. His corny pre-battle speeches have become wildly popular, to the point where you might be fooled into thinking they constitute great moments in cinema, but in actuality they're somewhere above Bill Pullman in ""Independence Day"" and below Al Pacino in ""Any Given Sunday"" on the scale of dramatic pep talks. And in case you're wondering, no, that's not a prestigious slot to be in.I'm not trying to say it's unwatchable like ""The Patriot"" or anything--it's OK. Probably about as good as, say, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" But I don't think anyone who's seen a real epic with real actors would consider it anything special.

Disgracefully bad,"Mel Gibson has an awful lot to answer for. Braveheart is despicable tosh that distorts historical truth beyond all decent conventions. So much in this film is a lie that the uneducated masses with no previous knowledge of the period will believe something that just didn't happen. There is so much that is inaccurate in Braveheart that I shall only mention a few key errors, all of them unforgivable. For a start William Wallace and Edward I did not die at the same time, as is implied, in fact Edward died a couple of years later! Also, Willy Wallace certainly did not father the future Edward III that is also alluded to. The English thrashed the Scots in 1298, but in this film it appears that the Scots put up more of a fight. Wallace certainly did not fight with Robert the Bruce after the battle either! Gibson distorts the truth to satisfy his rabid anti-English opinions. The man is a bigoted idiot with no respect for history. Moving on to the film itself, there are a few so-so battle scenes, but the rest of the film is essentially false junk. The dialogue is ponderous and moronic, whilst the first hour is utterly soul destroying so boring is it. There is a nice scene when Edward I throws a chap out of a window, but if that's the highlight of a film you know there are problems! People should not be taken in by this rubbish. Had Edward I survived a little longer in reality he stood a good chance of conquering Scotland so weak was the Bruce dynasty.

The English(Anglo-Saxons) before then, had little desire to rule Scotland, yet to the present day it is the England of today that is subject to the vitriolic hatred from the Scots.

"Enjoyable romp but oh, the inaccuracies!","This is a well-constructed film with many fine performances - I truly enjoyed it the first time I saw it. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I was curious to find how much of it was true - unfortunately very little.There are too many inaccuracies to list here, but I will limit myself to a few main ones:1) Robert the Bruce was no traitor. Portaying him as such is quite   simply wrong and disrespectful to his accomplishments - particularly in Bannockburn (a far more tactical affair than represented in the film. ) - his father, who did not betray Wallace either and was not a leper - and his memory as a whole. Confusion with John Balliol perhaps? Or deliberate ""artistic licence""2) The Irish fought against the scots - not just during this period but also for the next two centuries - and the crazy Irishman character in the film is the only truly annoying one in the entire length of the picture.3) Edward the second (Longshank's son) was 13 years old during the time portrayed in the film and his bethrothed was 5.4) Mel is about 11"" too short - Wallace was exceptionally tall and usually wore metal armour.5) His followers were not a bunch of wild men from the hills - the majority would have been kitted out very similar to the English irregulars.6) Wallace's first kill was not in retribution, in 1291 the son of Shelby, an English knight with control of Dundee Castle - approached Wallace in the marketplace and demanded his dirk. Wallace stabbed him through the heart although he was much larger and his opponent had no weapon drawn.7) Wallace continued attacking anything (or anyone) English - Soldier, commoner or merchant. In Lanark he fell in love with Marion, who was 18 years of age. This did not stop him from attacking the English in Lanark, a battle during which he and his men fled back to Marion's house and continued to fight there before escaping. Unsuprisingly, Marion was put to death as an accomplice. Wallace returned to Lanark during the night where no guard had been kept (foolishly), killed the Sherrif in his bed, killed his son and then burnt everyone else in the house to death, including women and children. By the time he finished in the town, 240 people were killed, armed or unarmed - only the priests were spared. (Wallace almost ended up in the priesthood)8) The battle of Stirling. During the filming, Mel was asked by a local why they did'nt film on the original site. Mel responded saying that he felt that the bridge would get in the way. Ay - said the local, That's what the English found....9) Who in reality betrayed Wallace? Sir John de Mentieth, one of his friends.This film could have been so much more, without losing ticket sales - never mind.....",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A Western in kilts.  A beautifully shot epic, of the likes the world had not seen for some years.","A well, acted and well paced movie, such that you don't notice its near 3 hour length.  The real strength, though, is its visual imagery.  The blood and gore of the battlefield, the glorious Scottish highlands, the medievel castles and villages.Gibson thoroughly desrved the Oscar for best director, the imagery and camera work is stunning.  While the direction itself is not innovative it is far more than merely effective.  The battles are well depicted, using thousands of extras.  A personal highlight is the depiction of the battle of Stirling as for the first time in living memory cavalry is defeated by infantry.The dialogue feels great to listen to, and the plot is cohesive and flows well.  While the movie could quite easily down without the Princess sub-plot - it does add to the feel of the movie.Mel Gibson takes the lead role with a fire that was absent in some of his other historical work, for me the pick of the acting is Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce, the young would be king torn between yearning to follow William Wallace into the teeth of hell, and the brutul common sense of his ailing father.  A young man yearning to be a warrior while being forced to become a politician.  Also veteran British actor Patrick McGoohan is a joy to watch as King Edward the Longshanks.  A character to love to hate.While filmed as an epic not all epics live up to the tag.  This movie is an epic in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A travesty,"Complete and utter dross. The film decides to bypass the actual story, and go along with some made-up rubbish that Randall Wallace came out with. It's interesting to note that the film originally hired Professor Tom Devine of Glasgow University as the historical consultant, but then sacked him because his version of what happened (based upon the facts) was completely different to what Randall Wallace was spouting.As to the film itself, Mel Gibson's accent is execrable, and that's just the start. Other problems occur - the Scots wear Woad and tartan - the earliest recorded wearing of tartan is in 1595. Woad had disappeared not long after the Roman invasion, over 1,000 years earlier. They also wouldn't have had the plaids or Great Kilts - these don't appear until the latter years of the 16th century.The film takes more liberties with historical fact than is good. The battle of Stirling Brdge is moved onto land without the Bridge in sight. At the end Robert the Bruce throws William Wallaces' sword onto the field, and Scots charge in. Yet Wallace had introduced the use of 'Schiltrons', which were huge blocks of spear men, and which were instrumental in Scottish victory at Bannockburn.All in all, terrible. If you want a good film about Scottish history, watch Rob Roy with Liam Neeson. While it has many mistakes, it doesn't try to portray itself as fact.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Cowardly But Entertaining Enough,"There are so many Historical Inaccuracies in this Film, as many Scholars who know such Things have pointed out, that they won't be listed here. A small amount of Research will shed some Light. But here is one, and it's a DOOZY.The Title, is actually from a Poem Written about and Titled for Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. Want one more? Robert the Bruce never Betrayed William Wallace. That's enough Egghead stuff, now there is the Movie. Best Picture Oscar Winner, by the way, in a very very Slim Year.The Movie is Entertaining Enough and has been sighted for Rousing, Bloody, You are there Battle Sequences. OK. But most of the Movie is Over Acted, with Mr. Gibson taking the Worst Actor Honors, but not without Strong Competition. The Story is pure Claptrap, Pulpy, Romantic, Sentimental Nonsense. It is Manipulative to the Point of Dreariness for almost its complete Three-Hour Running Time.It all makes for some Big Screen Excitement and the FREEDOM Plot Motivating the Movie is a sure Crowd Arouser, but it all Smacks of nothing more than a Big-Budget, Battle Cry Behemoth that is Shallow, Sophomoric, and all Made-Up Underneath.That's because it is. It is all Made into some kind of Superhero Epic, but even that is Undermined because here the Hero not only gets the Girl, He gets any Female who happens to be on the Screen.Mel Gibson, Our Hero, not only gets the Girls, He got a few Oscars along with.

The Best War Movie Ever,"When I first watched his film, all I could say was, ""Wow! This movie is so cool!"" The film is such a great way of showing the history of Scotland. Mel Gibson stars and directs this fine film. His portrayal of William Wallace is really awesome and his acting really moves the viewers. I love the part in the Battle of the Stirling, where his face is painted blue with his shield and up. I have to admit, there is some funny parts in the movie that could make people go nuts. The mooning part (it is only a brief scene of nudity), makes people go crazy, laughing and crying. The scenes of the Battle of the Stirling and the Battle of Falkirk, were amazing and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. The scenes are brutal and barbaric, but the violence supports the story-the want of freedom from the evil rules of the King. Edward the Longshanks is an evil king who is a seriously corrupted person in the movie, but the acting is really great. I'd have to say that the movie is a fantastic achievement and people should watch it, (people who can stand brutal war scenes) because this movie is 100% AWESOME!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Historically inaccurate but its not a documentary,"As a history lover I found elements of the plot simply absurd. As said before it couldn't have been more inaccurate if Wallace had ordered in the heavy artillery or sent in the air strikes. Historically it was a nonsense and probably one of the most inaccurate movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be hand picked from various periods of history and mixed together to make what can only be described as a curious hybrid time piece. That said however this is a movie whose main aim was to entertain the viewing audience, not an educational documentary, and it succeeded in its aim. The acting was good, the battle scenes were brutal, memorable and exciting, the antagonist was conniving ruthless and cunning, all must have qualities for any villain, and the protagonist was brave, noble and charismatic, the plot itself wasn't overly complex and captivating enough to see the movie through to the end, it spawned a number of memorable quotes and the ending was very moving.

A group of Scottish freedom fighters rebel against their English masters during the 13th Century.,"This is one of the few great movies of the 20th century.

With the help of his friends and the love of a beautiful French queen (Sophie Marceau) Wallace must risk everything to free his people and restore life to his native land.With a mixture of amazing locations, breathtaking acting, brutal war images and an enduring theme, Braveheart will be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made.

A bit overrated & it doesn't age well,"I can somewhat forgive the movie for being considered the most inaccurate historical blockbuster ever made. Without even knowing this while watching the movie, I couldn't help feeling that 40-something Mel Gibson was close to 20 years older than the 20-something young buck he was supposed to portray.It's also a very cheap shot to make the enemy so incredible evil, with the whole hanging children, killing innocents, and raping wives (Prima nocte: which for the record never happened), so we don't mind when they brutally kill them however they like Moreover, what's with the whole homophobic and womanizing explicit scenes of the movie?It's clearly overreaching at times, yet is still has its moments and it's at times artful in its brutality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Freedom,"William Wallace was as a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th Century. Braveheart directed and starring Mel Gibson is a fictional telling of the Wallace story.Gibson has produced a rip roaring adventure with bloody battles and visceral violence. He certainly has brought his experience of action from the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon films.Patrick McGoohan is the hissable villain as King Edward 1 also known as Edward Longshanks. He is ruthless and cunning. Just see the way he disposes of his son's newly appointed war counsellor. Yet he will also bribe Scots noblemen with land in order for them to switch sides.The film opens with Wallace as a child, his father killed in an unknown battle. The grown up Wallace just wants a peaceful existence as a farmer with the love of his life. All this is shattered with the despicable English, raping and pillaging like they were Vikings.Gibson with writer Randall Wallace show a sure footing in the the story set up and the early battle scenes in the beautiful settings of Scotland and Ireland.It is the latter part of the film that causes problems with pacing that makes the film overlong and the rather shady depiction of Robert the Bruce who is the better known Scots hero. Wallace who has been betrayed by some noblemen takes revenge against them like he was Zorro, he also has a fictional affair with Princess Isabelle which is almost laughable. The final scenes of torture where he is put on a cross makes it look like that he already was planning The Passion of the Christ.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Harmful fun.,"Having seen this film umpteen times and seeing the very POLARIZED opinions it generates, here are the facts as I see them.It IS an entertaining film, whilst Gibson is as wooden as usual other members of the cast are good, particularly the under rated Mcgoohan.The battle sequences whilst inaccurate are carried off well and visually it all looks great.So it is a pity that an otherwise good film is spoilt by it's sadly one sided view of history. Firstly Edward I behaved no differently to any other monarch of the time in protecting his interests. He was arguably the most effective ruler during a turbulent period of civil war in England itself. His son, the unfortunate Edward II was lucky to have outived his father at all, the crown had to be protected at all costs. The Scots as well as the English perpetrated some terrible deeds, but this was typical of the time and practices such as 'breaking on the wheel' continued in France into the 18th Century.As in most conflicts no party had a moral high ground. It was inevitable that Scotland would become a vassal of England, in the same way that France was eventually enlarged. At the time Wallace may have represented an ideal of Clan freedom and independence but the Nation State was already becoming the currency of power within Europe.A more balanced and investigative approach would have yielded more satisfying results and left a less bitter aftertaste for viewers of an English disposition.I",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Braveheart melds action with romance, and adds loads of wit--with stunning results!  Besides gory, realistic midieval battle scenes, Braveheart gives you a story whose characters touch you.

Speechless,"This is the most amazing film I have have seen and having taken several course on Film, I have seen many. Please anyone who has not seen this film yet do your self a favor and ignore the comments of the people who hate BraveHeart and see it.The claim made from the detractors of this film are not only ignorant but quite hypocritical. So in defense of this great film here is my response to those who hate this film.The film from a historical aspect is not 100% perfect, but it is still very accurate without becoming a preachy documentary. The film itself was never meant to be a documentary, most of you who consider yourselves educated know that it was originally a book, written on what we know to be fact about William Wallace and the rest written from the authors heart. And as for following the book it in many cases follows it to the letter( with the exception of Wallace Travelling to France and Itally. Still without being a documentary, it follows the facts we know about Wallace's life closely, though admittedly not fully. Yes, there was a bridge at Sterling, it was not put in the film due to low production cost, and yes Long Shanks died some time after the film depicted, beyond this though it is accurate to what we know. Since in reality, we know little of Wallaces life, the author put what he felt moved to write, in the story. Yes we will never know for sure if Wallace and Princess Isabell ever met and so on. This part of the film is only speculation. Other the the historical, I find it funny that some people would complain about the violence in this film and yet find movies like the mindless gore-fest by Tarrentino fine ( no this is not ever Braveheart hater, but a lot of them are that hypocritical).Now that I am done defending this film all I can say is that it reach down to the core of every human emotion. As another reviewer said before me, "" this film will make you cheer, love, laugh, cry; but more importantly it will make you think and measure what you have done with your life"". Every award it won it more than deserved and it deserved more. The score is one of the most moving and beautiful I have heard, the Mis-en-scene gritty realistic and unapologetic, and every actor and actress creates such a moving character, you can not help but be moved.

"Average film, nothing spectacular...","This film does not do the story of William Wallace justice.Yes, everyone always says that it does not matter that the film wasn't fully accurate in Historical terms, but I feel it was not adequate enough to make this a very good and enjoyable film, amongst other weak points.Firstly, I don't feel the acting was good enough to carry `Braveheart' along. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace was not, in my humble opinion, good enough. Firstly, he cannot do a convincing Scottish accent. I thought his accent was awful. His attempts at a decent Scottish accent made me cringe throughout the film, and often distracted me from what was going on. That said, I do not have problems with a non-Scot playing a Scot, I just think Gibson was the wrong choice for many reasons. I think he put a lot of effort into playing this role, but the effort does not pay off. However, some acting from the supporting cast is good, notably from Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), and Catherine McCormack (Murron) {who did pull off a good Scottish accent!}.Secondly, like I mentioned above, I feel the storyline was too historically inaccurate. I wouldn't have minded if the film was slightly inaccurate, but this is just a joke.That said, the film does have some strong points. The scenery is wonderful. Note, I believe the film was shot mainly in Ireland, so it is Irish scenery, not Scottish scenery, but I believe the two are similar, anyway. The battle scenes are well shot, also. I think Mel Gibson's directing was better than his acting.Therefore, I believe this is an average film. It does have it's good points, but these are weighed out by it's many weak spots.Please note, the whole William Wallace era was BEFORE Scotland and England were UNIFIED as Great Britain. Therefore, these were battles between Scotland and ENGLAND, NOT Scotland and Britain! Britain didn't exist in this point of time! Also, in the modern day, Britain, or England, does NOT rule Scotland - they are UNITED in the British Union. I just wanted to make that clear. *Wink*.In conclusion, I rate this film 4/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Kilts have never looked manlier,"""Braveheart"" is one of the most well directed and well shot movies of all time. What Mel Gibson does here is astounding. There's plenty of exciting battle scenes and legit emotional instances. The cinematography is terrific. You really feel like you're in Scotland, admiring its beautiful and brutal world. A lot of endearing authenticity is also thanks to great acting and costume designs as well. It's hard to find a war film that's so focused and emotionally driven as this one. The only flaw I have is that there's a love scenario that develops towards the end of the movie that's totally unnecessary and even takes away from some other emotional tendencies that occur earlier in the film.

Some strange facts about this fiction were that the English king actually spoke English, as did his soldiers, who themselves identified as English, when historically you're looking at a would-be further Norman conquest further into Britain.  Also, it appears that many Americans, and now many other nationalities (thanks Mel) seem to think that Scotland and Britain are separate entities.  If ever there is a Braveheart II, which portrays Scottish raids and invasions into pre-Norman Northumbria, Cumbria, Yorkshire, which shows how the Scots conquered the English city of Edinburgh and made it their capital, which awakens in 50 million Irish Americans a sense of their English heritage (hahaha), I'd watch it.

The epic story of William Wallace,"Around 700 years ago, the brave Scotsman named William Braveheart Wallace rose out of oppression by the tyrannical and pagan king Edward Longshanks of Briton, and united the people of the north (Scotsmen, Celts, Irish, and Picts included), driving the English out of Scotland and onto their own lands. Mel Gibson's portrayal of this warrior was next to perfect, he showed savagery, compassion, love, and hatred, all key elements held by any true Scot. During the fight scenes, he showed the heart of a warrior, and in the many love scenes, showed his deep and everlasting adoration for his deceased bride. During the opening of the Battle of Stirling, Mel gave the speech that would set in place the standards for many movies to come, including Aragorn's speech before the Battle of the Black Gate in LOTR: The Return of the King (this only includes the actors actions, as it is obvious that this speech was already told in J.R.R. Tolkeins book). The true brilliance of this movie ends with the remarkable and heartbreaking torture and then execution by means of beheading of Wallace, and then the narrator telling the prologue with scenes of Robert the Bruces army preparing for the final battle against the English, that would result in Scotlands freedom from British rule. The final scene shows Campbell (Brendan Gleeson) hurling the legendary Wallace claymore into the battlefield, sticking into the soil, representing the separation of Scotland from England, and an eternal reminder of the great deeds William Wallace did for his country and his people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Timeless Classic,I first saw this film when it came out. When it came out I just loved it. Even now 13 years after it originally aired it is still as good as ever. This film deserves a 10/10. The directing in this film is superb. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting in this film is also exceptional. I think Mel Gibson might have gotten an academy award for both his acting and his directing in this film. Apart from Mel Gibson all the other actors played their parts brilliantly. One thing I loved about this film is how it focused on the human side of William Wallace that was a definite plus. I also enjoyed the cinematography of this film. It captures the landscape beautifully. Overall this must be one of the greatest films ever made. A definite 10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence","It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his ""they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
about faith,I see it as one of most inspired films about faith. The faith to an ideal. The faith as expression of love. And duty. that does it special. And defines Mel Gibson as a great director. The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene. Impecable made. Great using each detail. A film about the essence of freedom. And about the price for give to it sense and form and blood.,,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Good Tribute To William Wallace - But What's With Isabella?,"As a tribute to William Wallace - one of Scotland's great national heroes in its ancient (and in some ways still ongoing) battle for freedom from England - this movie works very well. Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however. ""Braveheart"" was the name applied to Robert and not to William, and Robert, generally speaking, has received far greater acclaim in Scottish history.There's a lot to like about this movie. The sets and costumes are wonderful, and there are some spectacular shots of beautiful Scottish scenery throughout. The battle scenes between the Scots and the English are marvellously choreographed, and Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is compelling. The last half hour or so, which revolves around Wallace's capture, torture and finally his execution at the hands of the English is fascinating for its look at some of the torture techniques of the day, and for the same reason, it's disturbing. One gains a sense of the conundrum faced by the Scots, with divided loyalties and shifting alliances among themselves.There are also some things not to like in this, however. One could go on in great detail about the historical inaccuracies - and many have done just that. I have no desire to rehash them - but I will mention the one that really stood out for me: the depiction of the relationship between Wallace and Isabella. Let's first point out that Isabella was about 10 years old when Wallace was executed - making their relationship as depicted here quite unlikely, made moreso by the fact that the two never met, and that Edward I would have been unlikely to have entrusted a diplomatic mission (which is where the two are depicted as meeting for the first time) into the hands of a young female child. There's also the fact that Isabella didn't marry Edward II until 3 years after Wallace's death. For all those reasons, it was ridiculous to suggest near the end that Isabella implied to Edward I on his deathbed that she was carrying a child who was actually the son of Wallace. That portrayal mystified me and bothered me, and really detracts from the overall credibility of the story. It's dealing with a Scottish hero, so one expects dramatic licence and a bit of playing loose with history - but why this, which is so bizarre and so inaccurate? All it does is give a soap-ish feel to the story, while it adds nothing of any real significance.That's my main criticism of this movie - and for me at least, it's a big criticism. It detracts a lot because of its extreme inaccuracy, and because of the amount of unnecessary time the faked relationship takes up in the film. And it adds exactly nothing to the story. So this is a good tribute to William Wallace, definitely portraying him in deservedly heroic terms, but that detour into mere fable is a huge problem.

My All-Time Favorite!!,"Braveheart is a wonderful blend of action, romance, and drama.  Mel Gibson is amazing in his portrayal of William Wallace, the Scottish hero who inspires men to fight for freedom.  Although this movie does not give a very accurate description of historic events, that shouldn't make it any less enjoyable.  If you want an exact description of Scottish and English history, or you tend to be critical and analyze historical accuracy in films, then this movie is not for you.  However, if you want to be thoroughly entertained and inspired and feel every range of possible emotions in a 3-hour span then this movie is definitely for you.  I have never before or since seen a movie that can grab hold of your emotions and keep them captive for the full length of the film like Braveheart can.  I am envious of any who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing this great film because there is nothing like the first time. If you rank movies on how they make you feel, then Braveheart is simply the Greatest of All-Time!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Technically well made....just NOT a very good history lesson.,"Technically speaking, BRAVEHEART is an exceptionally well made movie. It's got a rousing plot, great scope and leaves the viewer impressed. However, as I am a retired history teacher, I was compelled (as usual) to investigate the story...and found much of it wasn't true at all and was changed to make the story more interesting...something I really dislike about many historical pictures. So, the affair with the queen, the death of the Prince's 'favorite', the Battle of Bannockburn occurring just after and a result of Wallace's death (it was 9 years later)...just not true at all. Still, if you ignore some bad history here and there, it's worth seeing. One of Mel Gibson's better films even with the historical problems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Fred Flintstone fights for Scotland's FREEEEEDOM!,"I can't imagine how anybody can take this farrago seriously.I can see that if you didn't give a toot for Scotland or its history, but you liked vigorous hack-and-bash action with one-dimensional villains and heroes, cartoon acting (Gibson was clearly channelling Fred Flintstone), simple-minded penis-size jokes and a dash of good old-fashioned homophobia, all set in beautiful (and totally inappropriate) landscapes, you could really enjoy this film. But it beats me how anybody can stumble out after watching it babbling ""inspirational"", ""enthralling"", ""heroic"", ""romantic"" and all the rest of it.

don't believe all the details !,"Braveheart is actually not a historical movie, just an adventure/action movie. But I thought it was not a bad film either. I think the movie was well-made, it was pleasant to watch but in my opinion, Mel Gibson over-played his part so it wastes the character of Wallace. And as I said it isn't a historical movie when you know all the mistakes like: the Scottish didn't wear kilts at this time, some fights in the film are invented, they went too far on a point: the Prima Noctis; Lords didn't really used it), and many others. So if you wanted to know about the history of Scotland, you shouldn't watch this movie, if you want to know the basis maybe but be careful. The love story between the princess of England and Wallace is really really too much and another big mistake in a historical way. Some people say it was annoying as a movie but I didn't think it was as annoying as they think, some scenes are interesting. And I thought the King of England and Robert the Bruce are two great characters, these two actors make a good job ! To resume, it wasn't a bad movie but it can easily be much better, it is not historical, don't trust what you see immediately.

"An excellent movie, but a bit of a fairy tale","I truly enjoyed this movie, from the direction and realism of the medieval battle scenes, to the cinematography and score. However, for the sake of equal time, please note the following information.""Edward I might be taken as a pattern of the medieval king. He is remembered on the whole for his achievements rather than by his personality. Tall, strong and handsome in figure, he was magnificently royal in presence, clear and emphatic in speech, forceful and enterprising in action. He was uncertain in temper, but reasonable in council. Above all, he attempted to live by the ideal of Christian knighthood -- devoutly gallant and heroically chivalrous.""I'm not saying the book I culled this information from is any more accurate -- we are talking about events that took place 700 years ago. But don't take this movie to heart as the whole truth. Examples of history vs. Hollywood:William Wallace was 19 when his father was killed. He had killed English soldiers before his father's death. The French princess first arrived in England years after Wallace died. Edward I lived years after Wallace's death.My favorite error/omission was that in the movie the Battle of Stirling Bridge was in an open field without a bridge in sight. The bridge was the key element to Wallace's victory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Why complain when you can enjoy,"My comment, to all of those who say that this movie is historically inaccurate, is that the opening lines ""Narrator: I shall tell you of William Wallace.

Movies are notorious for being inaccurate when ""following"" the plot of a book or the events of history. My advice is that if you enjoy a movie watch it again don't research it because you'll only be disappointed!Braveheart is a fantastic movie which encompasses all the best genres! Mel Gibson may be a bit greedy by being the director and lead role but his portrayal of the character is astounding.

Very Well Made But Historically Inaccurate Film...,"Nominated for ten Academy Awards and winner of 'Oscars' for Makeup, Sound Effects Editing, Cinematography (John Toll), Best Director and Picture, few can argue that this movie was not well made. This film managed to propel Sir William Wallace, the infamous 13th-century Scottish hero through nearly seven centuries via the magic of a Hollywood script that took great liberties with historical fact.While many praised this movie's epic film making accomplishment, just as many historians decried it's lack of historical accuracy. The film's script, by American screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation), of William's life, love, and death owes much to Blind Harry, a 15th century minstrel who put his rhymes into writing *150* years after Wallace's execution. Wallace historians and biographers continually dispute part or all of Blind Harry's narrative, but his account of the patriot's life DOES provide the most entertaining version of the tale.Blind Harry also used a heavy hand when sprinkling his tale with bitter sweet passion. His mention of a young maiden named Marion Braidfute of Lamington, who Wallace allegedly courted and wed, provided the inspiration for Murron (Catherine McCormack), Wallace's secret wife in this movie. However, no factual evidence of the marriage survives to corroborate Blind Harry's, and now Hollywood's, tale. On the other hand, Wallace DID murder Sir William Heselrig, English sheriff of Lanmark. Wallace put him to the sword and cut him into pieces in May 1297.One of the film's most intriguing twists is pure Hollywood invention. A calendar puts the LIE to the tale of Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau), wife of Prince Edward II, and the fathering of her child. Isabella and Edward II married in 1307, two years AFTER Wallace's execution. Her son Edward III, was born in the years that followed. Incidentally,Wallace was executed by hanging, drawing and quartering, not by being disemboweled at the gallows as the film suggests. The script was also very unkind to Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) specifically, and to the Normans in general, who no historian will dispute, regardless of tactics, unified a then very culturally diverse England and molded it into the great nation it still is to this day.MANY other inaccuracies appear in this film as well, too many to name here, the most glaring of which had Wallace attired in the more familiar Highlander costumes when he was, in fact, a Lowlander. So what we have here is a film that is almost as much a fantasy as it is an epic. But admittedly, it is the good-guy, bad-guy scenario that is the proved Hollywood formula for success.The true power of this medium is that it has the ability to EDUCATE as well as to entertain, and it's truly shameful that so many viewers think this movie is an accurate representation of historical fact. It is NOT! See it for the character portrayals, costumes and well orchestrated battle scenes. But remember, the story itself is as much a self-serving, Hollywood-formula fantasy, as it is somehow well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A well executed epic though not exactly historically accurate,"Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" tells the story of William Wallace, a near-legendary 13th century Scottish hero who fought for his country's independence. While based on actual people and events, the story departs from history in some respects as it hews closer to myth than to reality.The Oscar-nominated screenplay by Randall Wallace was admittedly written with more attention paid to creating dramatic situations than to being as factual as possible. I won't argue with dramatic license when it produces a story as compelling as this but I do think that Wallace stretched the facts beyond the point of credibility on at least one occasion. Others are even less forgiving. So, if you get hung up on stringent historical accuracy, this is assuredly not the movie for you.If you can get past that, you'll find that Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning direction is surprisingly well-handled, particularly given his relative inexperience at the time (""Braveheart"" was just his second directorial effort). There's no doubt that renowned first assistant director David Tomblin also proved a valuable asset to the production. Furthermore, the film is also impressive from a musical standpoint, with James Horner's Oscar-nominated score effectively utilizing Scottish and Celtic influences.Apart from directing the movie, Gibson also delivered the goods with his portrayal of the larger than life lead character. He didn't do it all on his own, though; he had a fine cast supporting him. Patrick McGoohan played King Edward I with villainous relish, Sophie Marceau was stunning as Princess Isabelle and Angus Macfadyen gave a complicated portrait of Robert the Bruce. Among Wallace's men, Brendan Gleeson & David O'Hara both stood out. Catherine McCormack was also notable as Wallace's secret lover.All in all, ""Braveheart"" amounts to a well-constructed epic the likes of which we don't see enough of these days. It may take some liberties with history but they don't detract too much from the overall picture as I see it. While Gibson has fallen out of favour in recent years (through no fault but his own), this movie shows him at his best and deserves to be fondly remembered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Mel Gibson's greatest performance,"Braveheart - the definition of the word 'epic'. Braveheart is a beautifully made film, with Gibson making a career performance. It follows a simple (almost cliché) revenge tale, but the cinematography, acting, music, and so much other elements make this movie great. While the film can get a bit slow at scenes, it makes up James Horner's amazing soundtrack, and for it's beautiful cinematography and atmosphere, it makes you feel like your right there. The slow scenes don't necessarily make the movie 'worse', but it makes you feel ingested in the screenplay. The movie is not historically accurate at all, and even though I'm not really into the historical accuracy and everything....... it can get really annoying. Barely anything in this film is accurate, the only thing being William Wallace is Scottish. That's why I give this film 9 stars, not 10, being my only complaint.

As a leader he is a noble, brave, and charismatic general. But one of the most over looked characters in the film is not even a Scotsman at all. It is Stephen the Irishman. He is one of Wallace's most trusted officials and is willing to give his life for the Scottish Cause. Stephen is known for being the egocentric Irishman who talks directly to God, simply to ""find an equal"" to an Irishman. So for all you Braveheart fans out there, The mid nineties are not good for such a great movie to Be ranked. Rate it where it should be. Stephen is the man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best Movie Ever,"Braveheart has inspired war movies like Gladiator and 300 and many others, neither of which come close to the caliber of film put together in Braveheart.

You might want to watch it again, but even if you don't you remember it.

British daughter in law falling in fantasy love and managing love story with the main Scottish Mel Gibson acted role was cutely demonstrated. War tech of waiting for an enemy advance, surprise elements of old weapons of LONGER SPEARS, Betrayal by established self centered allies, last minute support withdrawal, Not begging for mercy nor opting for a faster death penalty but only cry for FREEDOM in spite of tortured death highlights the heroism.

Amazing and entertaining,"I absolutely love this movie! It won Oscars and deserved them. The cinematography, acting, directing and general feel and theme of the movie is fantastic. It really allows people all over the world to learn about the great Scottish hero, William Wallace and Robert Bruce although i disagree with The portrayal of Robert the Bruce in the movie. Yes, it is not historically accurate but historically accurate does not make a movie, entertainment factor does. Despite the inaccuracies I believe the movie deserves only the highest of appraisal and is a huge accomplishment in film making. The soundtrack is breathtaking and really sets the mood. The acting is among the most believable performances ever and there is of course the occasional lighthearted comedy to lighten the mood. I must congratulate Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson and how can I forget Stephen The Mad Irishman played by David o'hara. I've watched this movie more times than I can count. As an English person I still love the movie despite the bias towards Scottish, but hey, there has to be a her and a villain in every movie, right? Loved it",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant Film (but a lot of artistic license),"I saw this for the first time recently and wow.. I was very impressed! It's not perfect and the good (Scots) against the evil (English) is a bit too black and white. What I mean by that is that the English and King Longshanks are historically portrayed as completely cruel and evil. I know some of the history and in spite of being English myself I think the Scots had every right to defend their land and fight for independance. The film just makes out all the English characters to be comic bad guys and the Scots, of course, the good. I am not saying there were no bad English, I just think the real history would have been more conveluted. But I am not one of these anoraks, that pick out the helmets being the wrong diameter. It's entertainment and it serves that at a premium throughout. There are few boring parts in this great film.Patrick McGoohan, in what must have been one of his last roles (RIP), is brilliant as the dry humored nemesis to Mel Gibson's William Wallace. I think the sets and the filming was all done superbly. You can really feel that wet Scottish landscape & the art director deserves praise. The action scenes are also excellant and very gritty. They use a lot of close ups of faces and nasty pointy weapons. This really makes you feel among the battles. None of the Alan Ladd-esque pantomime violence. There is plenty of blood and guts and soldiers (as in reality) not simply keeling over and being whisked to heaven. But lying in agony, painfully waiting for the reaper. This gritty style has been copied since. But this, along with Kenneth Brannaghs Henry V were among the first wave.Charecter development is second to none. You really feel for the characters, I liked big hamish. A slightly simple, but good natured Scottish giant. When his father is cut down in battle and he weeps, it really resonated with myself.As I said before the action and film direction is top notch. Yes the history is not as black and white. Yes Longshanks is a bit of a pantomime villain. But you can still take in most of the timeline of important events. Including the fact that Wallace was tortured horribly once caught. His severed body being sent to the four corners of England.Well worth a look if you haven't seen it and like me, an old fashioned bloke that loves action and beautiful women (love interests).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

It is good just to listen to and even better fitting in with the music. The cast is well picked. Gibson did a great job starring, and his sidekicks fit the parts perfectly.

'This is Sparta!',"Well almost; the story which has no basis in reality, armies winning battles when hopelessly outnumbered, terrible terrible accents that are barely from the same planet let along the right region - this film is clearly one of the inspirations for '300'.This is my first viewing of the film, 23 years after its release. I'm pleased to say that I hadn't missed much.On the plus side, the cinematography and soundtrack were both beautiful.The rest was average at best. Presumably when Mel cast himself in the lead as a heroic, principled, freedom fighter he thought that only he would have the prowess and credibility to pull it off. Clearly Mel's ego is as vast as some of the panoramic shots in the film.The characters were all old school, the wicked king with his weak and childish son. The freedom fighter hero, who is inspired to fight by his beautiful dead wife, murdered by one of the men employed by the wicked king. The traitor who ultimately repents and finds redemption, and various other cliches live within this film. To be fair, these character types are classic for a reason.Despite my cynicism, I did generally enjoy the film, although now I've seen it I doubt i'll be rushing back for a second viewing.If you like the idea of Mel being the consummate hero freedom fighter then give it a whirl, if you find that tiresome then there are thousands of better films out there...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"history of the British Isles raped, 20th century cheers","I will start with the one area of Braveheart that I will give praise to: the battle scenes.  The battle scenes were, for the most part, very accurate and appropriately brutal.  While I did think it was ""cool"" to see William Wallace wielding a military pick at one point in the film, it seemed pretty nonsensical.  It seems as if someone on the set said, ""You know what would be really COOL?  We could have Wallace smash in some guy's head with a big HAMMER!  Yeah, YEAH!""As for the rest of this film -- let me simply say that I probably would have found it to be wonderful if it was about a man named Elphed Beeblebrox and his life-quest to gain freedom for his nation, Goonia, from the evil imperial Shanta and King Twazel II.However, as this movie is simply an exercise in making history as two-dimensional and misrepresentative as possible, I have to give a big obscene gesture out to everyone involved in the more important aspects of making this film.  I'm sure I don't need to go into details about this -- if you actually cared, you'd probably go pick up a book to read about the history of this period.

one of the greatest epics ever made,"i must say that i am very surprised to find that this film is currently ranked no. 96 on IMDb and that it gets 8.3 out of 10. i think that this film deserves at least 9 out of 10. and ranked 96, is that all it gets? it should at least be in the top ten, i don't know if it's the best film ever made but it's certainly up there with the best. this film has everything, the music score is great, the actors are great (some of them i've never even heard of before and never seen since, but they're good anyway) and the story is extremely well done, even if it is historically inaccurate. the film is so good that the three hours go by ever so quickly and the fight scenes are good and bloody, normally fight scenes in other films are boring and/or hard to follow but this isn't. what's really good is the battle of wits between king edward (longshanks) and william wallace. it's almost like a game of chess on film, wallace controls the Scottish and the king controls the English and what's really amazing is the sense that without their leaders each country would be lost, as longshanks says' they're sheep, merely sheep, easily dispersed if we strike the shepard.' i could be here all day just telling you why this film is so good but if you've already seen it then you already know, if not then get it because you will keep it, trust me. i haven't seen mel Gibson's latest work, apocolpyto but if it's half as good as this then it will be excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Spellbinding,"To say the absolute least I was speechless at the end of this movie.  Its not perfect, but so close its scary.  I have this listed as my #2 movie. (I can't seem to find a number 1)  Based on actual events, (with the exception that princess Isabella was really a toddler when this was going on). It takes a hold of you by the shirt and dosen't let go until the last line is spoken.  The 3 hours it takes to watch this film is well deserved.  Supurbly cast and acted, and not only by Gibson.  But I believe the supporting deserves a standing ovation.Sophie Marceu looks like a princess even when she doesn't have to play one. She is so poised and proper, statuesqe almost. And plays a woman who is not loved by the man she married, which is all she wants, to be loved.Angus Macfaden was brilliant as Robert the Bruce, a man torn between what he knows is right and doing what he has to do to stay loyal to his titles and family name.David O'hara as Stephen. The crazy Irishman who saves Wallaces life on several occasions, he really brought the charator to life.Brendan Gleeson also did well as Hamish, Wallaces childhood buddy and one of his right hand men.Randall Wallace the script writer did an exceptional job by not concentrating on one thing too much.  It wasn't constantly serious, the romance was there but not overly exploited and the comedy that pops out at the oddest times.  And though the blood shed was tremendous it was tastefully done, for the story line reminds us constantly of the tyranny and persecution these people were facing, therefore making the slaughter seem more justified.I recommend this movie to everyone.

"Apologia ""Braveheart""","It baffled me, at first, to discover that there were actually people who didn't like this film. How could anyone resist being swept away by this story? Well, I realize now, you can't make everyone happy, because there will always be people who are determined not to let you make them happy.When ""Braveheart"" hit the theaters in 1995, it was inevitable that Scots and Irish would love it, and the English would hate it. English reviews of this film were hysterically shrill. Much was made of the ""historical inaccuracies,"" but what did they expect--a $70 million documentary? Besides, the historical records of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce are so sparse and uncertain, historians and filmmakers alike are free to take great liberties in reconstructing the story just about any way they see fit. The indignation that the English feel when watching this film is probably similar to what the Scottish, Irish and Welsh feel when they study history and realize that the saga of their people has been nothing but a centuries-long struggle against English oppression. The U.S. senate has issued official apologies to blacks, Indians, Hawaiians and even the Japanese. A similar gesture from the Queen or the House of Lords might allay a lot of bad feelings.In America the film was accorded the same treatment as any other independent film. It received a lot of smug reviews about ""cute guys in kilts"" and was soundly beaten at the box office by the insipid ""Independence Day."" Most reviewers are industry toadies who consider it a breach of professional protocol to say anything nice about an Indie. Anyhow, ""Braveheart"" won a half-a-dozen Academy Awards, while ""Independence Day"" was forgotten as soon as the advertising campaign ended.There is also the bias against a Hollywood stud-muffin having the audacity to direct and star in his own film. What right does Mr. Lethal Weapon have trying to establish himself as a serious artist? But the fact is--as many people have said before--Gibson was the perfect man to direct this film. How would ""Braveheart"" have turned out in the hands of, say, Scorceses or Spielberg? (As a really funny mental exercise, try and imagine Tarantino doing this film. ""I'm gonna get medieval on your arse!"")And then there were the feminists who denounced the film for being Testosteronally Challenged.One remarkable thing about ""Braveheart"" is how little dialogue there is in this 3-hour film. The screenplay available on the Net is only 13 pages long! To tell a fairly complex tale in so few words is just good writing by Randall Wallace. But all some people can talk about is how unrealistic Wallace's portrayal of his namesake is. But that's the whole idea: ""Braveheart"" isn't realistic; it's idealistic.And what's wrong with that?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Fact or fiction,"After watching this film for the millionth time about 10 minutes ago I have to say this is easily one of the best films I've seen. We can go on all day about the best films ever made, but it's rare to find a film like Braveheart today.This film is not the most factual piece in existence, I would consider it fiction based on fact. William Wallace existed as did Longshanks, and England did invade Scotland, however some characters are obviously fiction, a lot of what happens is fiction and I would like to think of it as fiction for film. Being honest this film was made primarily for film-making and money, not historical accuracy, and there is nothing wrong with that due to the film being excellent in my own opinion. The battle scenes are well done with little flaws (continuity errors happen in every film, not just braveheart), it's stuck to the ""rules"" of film making for the most part and the camera work and angles come across sometimes as stunning, along with the scenery, great acting, scripting, and emotion put into the music and story itself it's a recipe for a great film.I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that hasn't, if you haven't, why not? This is easily one of the best war/sword films that has been made and is definitely work a watch, however it is quite long, and at some parts slow. It personally took me a few watches to realise how Wallace thinks, and how he has known certain information he shouldn't know, but I won't spoil it for you and urge you to watch the film to understand.Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Shows the ignorance of Hollywood,"Historically inept, amazingly biased and overall terribly ignorant. I have come to expect nothing less from Hollywood's less than amazing historical epics.Poor acting doesn't usually help but in this case, at least it gives the film some humour. The exaggerations of English EVIL and Scottish pride sickens so much that I am beyond retching. The film goes nowhere towards motioning that the Scottish invaded England constantly in their spare time, this is the reason for England invading and taking over.I'm surprised the king of England didn't have a hump. The next step on from this is to show hoards of Englishmen burning babies for a living then going home smacking their wives having a cup of tea and going to bed in a bowler hat.Thank the sweet lord that Hollywood has better films than this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A modern classic epic.,"""Braveheart"" is a modern already classic epic with beautiful scenery, epic fights and a moving score.Quite frankly, I don't care how historical accurate this movie is. Yes, of course the English are portrayed as stereotyped bad guys and I'm sure many more things in the movie are not as accurate as they had been in real life but I have absolutely no problems with it. All I see is a beautiful moving movie and at least I know now who William Wallace was!Everything about the movie is splendid. Visually everything is perfect and the musical score by James Horner is wonderful (For the Love of a Princess is beautiful) and lifts the movie even higher.The grand and spectacular massive fights are brutal and graphic as well as impressive. And having a few hundreds of under-payed extras fighting each other still looks better than having a few hundred CGI characters fighting, let this movie be a lesson to you Hollywood guys and take an example from it.Patrick McGoohan was one of the highlights for me. He was perfect and unforgettable in his role as King Edward I and he delivered his line's perfectly and with lot's of cruelty.The story is impressive, moving and interesting right till the end that might be just a little bit over the top but impressive nevertheless. On one of my recent viewings I noticed lot's of tiny details Gibson put in the movie to make Wallace look like a Jesus figure, especially more notable after Gibson's other movie ""The Passion of the Christ"".Beautiful impressive movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

brave heart is the best film ever,i watched this film last night for the first time since i was a young girl and i have to say this is the best film ever made no matter what anyone says Mel Gibson is the greatest actor in the world and he has the most endearing beautiful eyes i have ever seen his wife is a lucky woman love him so much. All the cast were excellent Bruce was great and the princes was brilliant so was long shanks. Mel Gibson is the greatest ever and he is also brilliant in forever young. For a man his age i think he is just brilliant. Anyone that thinks Goodfellas or whatever you call that film is better than Brave heart there is something wrong with your head. My favourite scene was the one were William and Pricess Issabelle kissed I think both actors were very convincing and you could see the William really did love his first wife. This film will never be forgotten i also think Mel added good humour into the film especially the scenes at the battlefield were they flashed at the enemies. Mel is a brilliant actor as well as a brilliant director.and all yas English people that are saying that mel Gibson made the English to evul well he didn't mak them as evil as they really are he portrayed this film brilliantly and his Scottish accent was just brilliant and everyone from Scotland that dissapproved of Mel in this film and mocked his accent should be ashamed of yourselfs Mel did your country proud so stop your yapping.

It's a Subjective Thing,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"The poster boy for ""movies that haven't aged well""","I was in my early 20's when I had the chance to see Mel Gibson's Braveheart on the big screen, sadly along with a classroom of young giggling girls behind my seat. I still remember what a huge experience it was on first viewing, full of excitement, great scenery, incomparable battle scenes, and wonderful dialogue with a very memorable scene after scene every minute. The story of a commoner who rebelled against a huge kingdom when his secret bride is murdered was, in one word, majestic.Years later, however, most of these views changed. First, the Internet came into our homes, and as I did a bit of reading about history, I began to realize the mind-numbing historical inaccuracies that Braveheart has. Now I don't mind altering history a bit in movies for the sake of entertainment, but certainly not to this extent. Braveheart, in fact, is not an historic film at all: It uses names, characters and events from history, but rearranges them to fit its story. In fact, it's not too different from Tarantino's excellent Inglorious Basterds in that aspect.Second, DVDs came into our homes, and upon a couple of repeated viewings, those ""incomparable"" battle scenes turned out to be somewhat ordinary, then bad, then straight up laughable. Full of unforgivable editing mistakes, continuity mistakes, background actors playing sword among themselves like children... I'm not talking about ordinary movie goofs that you can find even in Kubrick's films if you try hard, I'm talking about mistakes that could be avoided if you simply took a bit of care.I still gave it a solid 7 stars, though. Because despite all its flaws, Braveheart is still a damn entertaining movie. While making every possible mistake a first-time director could make, Gibson also managed to pull off something very difficult: make a thoroughly engaging, entertaining film. It's fun, it has a once-in-a-lifetime score, and despite its appalling flaws, it's still an unforgettable movie.Final word: Although Gibson directed, produced and starred in this, making it ""his baby"" so to speak, for me it will always be Patrick McGoohan's movie. He's more of a king than some actual kings. A very fine actor giving a chilling performance, stealing every scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Another fine mess from Mel Gibson,"How this film won so many Oscars is beyond me.To start with its totally inaccurate,it looks like a typical excuse for Mel Gibson to try and look macho and at the same time practice his racial hatred on us English.I don't know about anyone else,but i saw this film about ten years ago and the thing i remember most about it apart from his silly hairdo,was the sheer offensiveness of it,I've never watched it since.He implies that the kings son was homosexual,which there's no evidence of,and then implies that homosexuals are evil people,how bad is that in the 20th century.Films have been banned for implying a lot less.But on the whole why cant he just leave our history alone and do something useful like make a film about the Aborigines or the American Red Indians,which is more his neck of the woods,not tear British history apart with how he wants to see it.I'm worried that he may try and make a version of the Battle of Britain,could you imagine it,he would probably portray the English as sitting around drinking tea saying,go on taffy and jock old boy go and kill some Hun for us ha ha tally ho.It would be that bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This film is brutally realistic, not sugar coated by scenes of touching moments or too much of a love story...that being said, the film is very powerful. Here we have a man, Wlliam Wallace, who's determination to unite and gain independence was incredibly moving. Everything about Braveheart is near flawless.

Plot shrinks before the greatness of open sets,"'Braveheart' was prepared to be one of the greatest epic movie experiences of all time, if it wasn't built around it's poor, formulaic core: Randall Wallace's script.The movie opens with some astonishing, aerial views of the Highlands, setting immediately the movie color scheme: brown and green. During the three hours of 'Braveheart', our eyes and hearts will be invaded with these two colors, that come from the mountains down to the very pieces of clothe that the characters wear. The bond between Scotland and Nature is assured then!Although 'Braveheart' is regarded as one of the most historically inaccurate movies ever, an unsuspicious watcher (like me) won't spot that difference while watching the film. 'Braveheart' succeeds on involving us in its story, resorting to little details like the use of Gaelic-Scottish accent to help. E.g., the artificial look of the sets and the American English accent of the characters in 'Gladiator' made me take much longer to feel wrapped in the film. 'Braveheart' never intended to be historically accurate. It wants to create a whole new myth, and succeeds on doing that realistically.The real backdrop of 'Braveheart' is its argument, which is as typical as a Hollywood epic drama movie can get. Taking little risks when writing the plot cuts on the thrills of the film, as much of the story becomes predictable. Here, 'Braveheart' loses to 'Gladiator', as I felt the last one took the liberty of being tragically dense, which resulted on me being completely hooked on its climatic finale.Although no actor is really outstanding, all the actors are competent playing the characters they're given. The story's texture comes mainly from the feeling of the existence of the director's trademark, the sense that a human is behind the camera. Maybe it was an unpredicted consequence from the cuts Mel Gibson applied to the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, but there's undoubtedly something unique in the quick way the story unfolds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

But I do insist on credible - don't insult my intelligence with a pantomime villain and romanticised plot developments. William Wallace was the father of Edward III? Give me a break, Edward II having other um, 'interests' doesn't mean he couldn't father a child, or that his wife is likely to sleep with Scottish outlaws.As for Edward, the ruthless, brilliant strategist and general; getting his archers to fire on his own forces in a mêlée - yes that must be how he was so successful a military commander.

Richard III-- uh uh, no way.Let's face it-- despite the fact that Braveheart is a better movie than any filmed Shakespeare (outside of Kurosawa)-- it is not historically accurate, either, and if that is the sole standard by which you judge movies then you are going to be sadly disappointed in it.  If, on the other hand, you appreciate good characters, heart-lifting drama, and exciting battle sequences, then you should be thrilled with Braveheart. Each to his own taste.Personally, I think Mel Gibson stands in pretty good company with Shakespeare.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Just about the best acted and most exciting film ever,"It's hard to believe 'Braveheart' a fantastic, emotional and hugely involving film, is ten years old. I only realised yesterday, when I re watched it, and noticed what a splendid film it is: not yet has there been a sword/medieval film so emotionally involving, brutal with a true message. Lame recent attempts such as 'Troy' haven't shown this, and don't even get me talking about the dreadfully box-office aimed 'King Arthur'; this is a great revenge flick, and an even better medieval sword classic.Mel Gibson is just a small child named William when his father dies. Already the film has your emotions running. Then, when he is an adult, his wife, whom he obviously deeply loves, is raped, beaten and killed, all in horrific detail. What a light opening thirty minutes.No. This film isn't light. If you expected some clichéd fairytale classic you were wrong. This is stark, brutal cold: a mean, but effect, medieval film.So William kills them all in surprisingly brutal fashion (pushing the bars of the films '15' certificate) and immediately changes his choice of revenge; he now wants to free the whole of Scotland.His unexplained change in motives is fine. No-body cares since the sets are so realistic, so well done, you feel you are taken into this world. Mel Gibson acts with all emotion, as do the others: they really do, in their own modern lives, probably want some freedom. It may sound preposterous, but how on earth could these actors act so convincingly? Maybe Merlin waved his wand and had a say?The fights are brutal, graphic, squeamish may well want to look away. But it is commendable and fine enough. Gibson, who directs, wants to show how terrible, dirty and down right insane these times were. He even admits, as his character, that both sides are savages. Despite the bias is towards Scotland, it carefully weaves in another message: no side is better, or right or wrong.The love story between Gibson and the French princess may be a little short and unnecessary, but it can be forgiven.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"7.4/10 - Flawed, But Very Enjoyable","TL;DR - kickin' arses with funny accents.And, if you want the elaborated version:Braveheart is a classic film from '95, that tells the story (though in a really not historically accurate way) of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scotish warrior that led a rebellion against Edward ""Longshanks"" the first, king of England (Patrick McGoohan). Don't have much more to say without spoiling stuff, so that's about right for a general idea of the plot.Let's start from the things that I didn't like. First of all, the romance in the film and the female characters all suffer from a hella stereotypical, kinda one-dimensional writing. Isabella has some cool aspects to her character, but she could use a little more development in some aspects. I also think that some side characters (especially Stephen, played by David O'Hara) could also use some more development and cool moments :P Feels kinda wasted, tho the film is quite long as it is so maybe it's not a must. And my final complaint on this film for now : the dick showing moment was kinda cringy. Yeah, I've said it, sue me. That's it for now.The things that I liked here - I feel like the cast is very fitting to the characters, and most characters are really well acted, actually. I think that the dialogue is pretty powerful too - yeah, cliche at times, but hey, it really works. Made me feel stuff XD I get why it became so iconic. Also, the fight scenes are really clever and epic, and I'm absolutely here for it.This film doesn't have anything that will really blow your mind, probably, but let's be honest here. Braveheart is a very fun film to watch. I had a really good time watching it, and I enjoyed it a lot. The story is energetic and captivating, the characters are a lot of fun even when they're not fully used imo, and there are tons of cool moments throughout the close-to-3-hours runtime.So, yeah, this film is far from perfect, but I find it truly enjoyable, and I was pleasently surprised even, I'd say. I'm feeling a 7.4/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Braveheart is a huge epic spectacle and one of Mel Gibson's best films, exquisite from beginning to end","Something I didn't think about during my first three viewings, as a child and then teen, was the historical inaccuracies and there's quite a lot of them. Then again, not a lot is known about William Wallace. Mel Gibson who directed, produced and starred, along with Randall Wallace who penned the screenplay. They could have made a more historically accurate film but for dramatization purposes and to create the story they wanted to tell, I would say they succeeded. Braveheart is a story with themes of leadership, heroism, courage, love, sacrifice, friendship, and the betrayal. With the iconic quote of freedom from the central character, it's the Scottish freedom in their war of independence. I truly get why a rating decreases heavily because of historical inaccuracies, at times they can break a film but I think lots of things in Braveheart can easily be looked over and see the reason behind it. Before delving deeper into the film, I just want to say how nostalgic and how incredible it still is after all these years. I understand why it's one of my father's favorite films even more now than then.What a different performance it would have been if Brad Pitt played William Wallace who was the first consideration for the role, instead the producer-director Mel Gibson took on the role in what's possibly one of his best performances. Drawing in different emotions throughout the film, from the love story and innocence in the beginning to the military leader he becomes who is solely bent on revenge and getting freedom for his fellow Scotsmen, to the final scene where the iconic quote ""Freedom"" is spoken by Mel Gibson's character. Three hours of brilliant performances by him and everyone else, from both perspectives (the Scottish and English sides). To the main cast of Sophie Marceau, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo and David O'Hara. To the smaller performances by Brian Cox, Ian Bannen and Tommy Flanagan.As I wrote before, Mel Gibson serves as producer and director, in what might be his magnum opus. His direction to the actors is top notch and the vision for the movie is fantastic, directing each scene with brilliance in mind. Could he have made it more historically accurate, sure, but he had a vision for it all and stuck with it. For example the kilts used, the kilt originated in the 16th century whilst the film is set in the 13th century. Why did they do that big of historical inaccuracy? For the imagery and how people nowadays recognize the Scottish kilt, back to the imagery though, during the battle sequences it just looks epic and the sequence wouldn't have been as cool and epic if it weren't for them, or so I think.The battle sequences are brutal, epic and simply brilliantly shot. The mise-en-scene in those scenes and honestly the entire movie, is fantastic. All from the village fight which begins the journey for freedom, to the different battle sequences throughout the film which was visually violent and chaotic. In a filmmaking standpoint, Mel Gibson directed all of those actors and extras whilst acting out the scenes himself, a truly breathtaking couple of sequences. I want to focus on the battle at Stirling which is the first major battle and in my opinion the most stellar one, truly cinema. The huge amount of extras and actors used, the work behind it. The scene highlights how outnumbered the Scots forces were compared to the English, how they succeeded using their wits and strength. With the battle sequence set entirely on a grassland and not by a bridge which it was in reality, the film delves deep into its historical inaccuracies. Yet, it still succeeds in telling the story it needed to, showing in partly fictional ways how the real Scotsmen succeeded. In the course of a six-week shooting process. The scene required nine cameras to film it, one of which was a computer-controlled stop-motion device that had been used to great success before in Jurassic Park. Gene Siskel wrote that ""in addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago.""In an interview back in 2016, Mel Gibson told of a 4 hour cut he would release if the studio wanted to, and that's something I would gladly watch. Braveheart is a film with a lot of passion behind it, with the crew and actors putting their heart into it. It's a film on such a big scale and could easily become a box office bomb but it went and made $213.2 million on a budget of $65-70 million. Mel Gibson is a big reason for its success and so is the big cast, but also the writer (Randall Wallace) and cinematographer (John Toll). Two other names I want to praise are the editing done by Steven Rosenblum and music done by James Horner. As you notice with all these big names, these talented people, their work made Braveheart into what it became. Technically, a masterpiece and of course cinema. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it ""An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of The Road Warrior."". What's also worth adding is how the film won five Oscars among other awards, winning for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup and another award; also being nominated for other Oscars. Critics have argued if the film should have won all its awards especially Best Picture, honestly I think it's deserving. Braveheart is exquisite in lots of ways, a film for everyone to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I really hate the overacting they sometimes put in movies. It was okay in Lord of the Rings, but here it was dramatic.

This is because he is the hero we have been waiting for all our lives, and hadn't arisen yet. This is because one man loved more than we could ever hope for. William Wallace didn't fight for honour, didn't fight for money, didn't fight for pleasure nor justice. He fought for Love. He fought for Freedom.

He simply brought it to life on screen and did a fine job as an actor and director. You have to take the story with a pinch of salt. It's a romanticised version of history as was Pearl Harbor (also written by Randall Wallace). The opening lines of the film are 'I shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes'. I guess the writer is trying to suggest that this film is the legend of Wallace passed down by the Scots as opposed to the history recorded by the English.

I don't doubt that they committed some awful atrocities but Patrick McGoohan's pantomime King Edward is a jeering, sneering, cliche too far - I was almost expecting Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham to make a cameo appearance. I won't even get started on the history - but as a film and piece of fiction the movie is overlong and the performances only adequate, watch for the battle sequences but ignore the rest.

It is definitely his best work ever! The young actor who played young William Wallace was excellent in this movie. Also the actor who played Longshenks was as evil a character as humanly possuible. The actor who played Hamish is a very good character actor. The young lady who played William Wallace's wife did an excellent job in making both of us cry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Greatest 90s Epic,"Many people have said that this is just a simple bloody revenge story. It is about freedom, and choice. Gibson does a good job of showing Wallace becoming more then he ever wanted to be. Beautifully photographed and acted, especially Longshanks and the Irish mercenary. Second best score for any movie of the 90s makes it all the more emotional. Bloody for a best picture winner, but not too compared to other films. One of my top 5 favorite films. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
MASTERPIECE!!!,"I'm not the one for reviews nor emotions for movies. I barely write reviews for movies except for the ones that pulls a the heartstrings like this movie. And emotions, only a few movies have forced me to tear up at the ending. Movies like Avengers Endgame, Lord of the Rings finale and now Braveheart has joined the list.It's almost everything, astounding cast, beautiful locations, awesome picture quality and even a balanced pacing (as in not too slow and not too rushed).As for the story, the movie details the life of William Wallace, his zeal, and his determination for freedom, even to the very end, and that's just awesome. Now I don't know anything about the Scottish history and I don't know if this is accurate but what I do know is that this movie is epic.The cast makes you feel every emotion, anger, laughter, grief, helplessness, empowerment and even sadness.All I have to say is this movie is an epic ride and a must watch for every movie lover.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Braveheart Review,"""They may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!"" - William WallaceWhen it comes to movies that reach epic proportions and manages to surpass it to legendary status, one film personifies that, and that is Mel Gibson's Braveheart. From its production values, to its beautiful cinematography and excellent direction, this epic defiantly deserves a spot among cinema's greatest pieces of filmmaking.In 13th century Scotland, it tells the story of William Wallace, a Scotsman who, after witnessing his wife being publicly executed by the English, wages an all-out rebellion against the tyrannical English rule. Soon, his rebellion grows from a small group of farmers to, eventually, every clan in the country as he leads them to war for the freedom of Scotland.While, sure, it may not be entirely historically accurate, like the love connection between Wallace and Princess Isabella. But even with some of the historical inaccuracies, it doesn't get in the way of the overall narrative and spectacle. Gibson, who is also the director, shows off his cinematic vision with its authentic production design, gritty and dramatic tone, and sheer spectacle. I especially love the cinematography here, especially the sweeping shots of the Scottish landscape (even though some of the scenes are filmed in Ireland). For a film that is nearly 3 hours long, it felt like the movie had just the right amount of time, and that's mostly due to the film's steady pacing and good editing, especially the quick editing shots during the battle scenes.Speaking of which, the battle scenes are amazing. Right up there with Lord of the Rings, these are among the best battle scenes ever put to film. I'll never forget the Battle of Stirling Bridge scene (historical inaccuracies aside though) for being a brutal, bloody, and badass sword fight. You have heads being decapitated, blood splattering everywhere, impalements, people getting stabbed, people being set on fire, tortured, and getting shot by raining arrows; this is as brutal as medieval warfare could get. Lastly, the epic score done by the late James Horner is so good that it is the icing on the cake.The casting and performances are excellent: Brendon Gleeson, the late Patrick McGoohan, the gorgeous Sophie Marceau, among many others. But the real star is Mel Gibson, in probably one of his best, if not, his best performance, even better than Mad Max. He perfectly shows how any epic hero can be both badass and emotional at the same time.Overall, Braveheart is everything that I wanted in an epic film. A great story, phenomenal filmmaking, A-List performances, lush production values, and an epic score makes this a milestone in cinema history. After more than 20 years, it still stands as one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? Go check it out.Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Overrated,"Not good. Mel Gibson just itches for an excuse to act in bloody, violent movies (such as Patriot) and this one is no exception. A heavy historical drama falls short with its shallow characters, macho Wallace and predictable, boring battle scenes. For some reason I kept thinking ""Highlander"" and ""Conan the barbarian"", which were much simpler, yet tremendously more enjoyable movies. If ""Patriot"" is your thing, you might probably enjoy this one; otherwise see Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Payback instead.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"""Certain Events Portrayed Have Been Dramatised""","That says it all in a way. Maybe if I had watched Braveheart alone I would have liked it a whole lot less. Yet I took this one out on video after seeing ""The Patriot"", my curiosity piqued to see if this was as fundamentally bad.It isn't, of course, and watching in conjunction with that film made me appreciate this one a whole lot more. The Patriot is melodramatic, trite, sentimental and showily directed. Braveheart may have its dream sequences, stereotypical bagpipes and the odd duff line, but generally it's pretty good for Hollywoodised history. I don't even mind the fact that history has been severely distorted, either. After all, this is a film, and every film needs its heroes and villains. The picture may be entirely one-sided in it's portrayal of the Scot/English divide, but at least the ""enemy"" in this one get more than the boo-hiss one-dimensionality of ""The Patriot"".However, while this isn't high-minded enough to be a great historical epic and isn't totally worthy of the five Oscars it received (and, while nominated for more, they were all technical, none for acting) it is sturdy, average entertainment. In fact, what makes it of note, and justifies its watchability are really just two things:1. Patrick McGoohan, No.6 himself, having a thoroughly good time as the outrageously mad King;2. The Scottish accents. Maybe the American audience that thought they were getting an honest historical was convinced by the laughably fake ""accents"". Gibson was far from the worst, incidentally. But even so, anyone who lives in the whole of the British Isles would be unlikely to sit through this film without crying tears of laughter as this Australian, would-be US actor tells us what it's like to be a Scotsman.For those two factors alone, Braveheart is priceless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The best movie ever created,"The movie Braveheart is one of the best films ever created. This movie is definitely on every movie lovers top five list.

The Academy got it wrong but.....,"I have tried to sit through this film on many occasions and haven't managed for several reasons, the primary one being that the Academy thought Gibson was a better director than Michael Mann and Ron Howard ( I don't recall if Mann was nominated, he certainly should have been), another being that I just can't stand the sight of Mel Gibson, another being that the Scottish accents are absolutely DREADFUL. I have, however, set myself a goal to see every Best Picture winner in reverse chronological order (yes I am an anorak) and Braveheart happens to be the first I haven't seen. So I finally managed to get through it and my conclusions are as follows:It's really quite a well made film, actually most of Gibsons directing efforts are good films production wise - I guess it wouldn't have had such commercial appeal if he used Scottish actors and no-one understood what the hell they were saying -the Academy showered it with awards because it has all the ingredients of what they normally give all the big awards to ie, an inspirational true story (although Gibson was quite creative with historical events), a great soundtrack, a tragic tear-jerking ending....So yes, the Academy got it wrong, but it's not the first or last time, the biggest injustice ever is that Slumdog Millionaire was showered with so many awards, it was a good, entertaining film, but that's it, no way it deserved the awards it got. Oh, and considering the other nominees for '95, I think probably Sense and Sensibility and Apollo 13 were better films than Braveheart, but 'Heat' was the best big studio film of the year and it wasn't nominated, and Michael Mann was the best director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Wallace was truly ""larger than life""","I've just returned from a long-planned trip to Scotland, and let me tell you, the legend of William Wallace is EVERYWHERE. Naturally, parts of this movie have received the Hollywood treatment, but that's to be expected. They were making a movie for entertainment, not a documentary. Still, it seems to be fairly accurate.I spent 2 weeks hiking around Scotland, visiting castles, monuments, and talking to local historians. (The ""Historic Scotland"" employees are fantastic!) Everyone there LOVES this movie, and they have no problem with the bits that got the Hollywood treatment. I discussed the movie several times with locals, and they put certain things into perspective. If the historical accuracy is good enough for them, it should be good enough for the rest of us.If you are ever in Scotland, be sure to visit the Wallace Monument near Stirling- it is visible on the crag near Stirling Castle. There are about 246 steps to the top of the monument, but on the 2nd level, you will see the sword of William Wallace. This is no museum replica- this is an old sword that has seen some action. It is quite impressive to think that this sword was used in battle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Fiery!!,"Clint Eastwood needs to take lessons from Mel Gibson who did a great job with this semi-epic rumble. Braveheart is a movie that is filled with great emotion. In fact I find it difficult to believe a person could watch this movie and not feel anything for the main character William Wallace. Sure the plot is your basic revenge for love destroyed good guy bad villain standard but that is not what makes this movie tick. Great landscapes, score driven, and violently picturesque battles and added with a touch of romance make Braveheart scream down the film highway. And once again it is the supporting cast that I feel overshadow Gibson's performance. Especially Patrick McGoohan as the ruthless Longshanks. In my opinion this is the part that makes or breaks this movie and it definitely made it. If you are going to have a villain in a movie not only do they have to achieve that hated look their actions need to match. Longshanks behaved how like a King trying to enforce his rule should. He was smart, cunning, and rarely did he lose his temper unless it was needed. If this sounds familiar then watch the Godfather and Michael Corleone. The comparisons between their actions are very similar. Wallace's fellow Scots and soldiers were also well chosen and added characters that made Wallace even stand out more. I am impressed with the way Gibson chose his shots. From the ground shot with the sword appearing fifteen feet on the screen to the shot at the end with the cloth he understands that when there is a defining moment in the script you need to do something even more to emphasize it. Make it stand out in the audiences head. This is where Eastwood sorely lacks as a director. His films have potential to be more than he puts into them. Especially Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil that just screamed from every page of the screenplay for a director to drive it like a Ferrari on an open road. Gibson rightfully deserved the Oscar and he understands how difficult and restless the directing experience is. But he is also unwilling to take a great script and let it go to waste and for that I give him his do. Braveheart is a grand movie that will be a classic for years to come. It invokes volcanic emotions and returns to a time when men fought for love and freedom with fearless passion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

History as seen with an american mindset,"There are many comments here obsessing over historical inaccuracies, but here is one you missed: the overwhelming american ideology present throughout the film.  ""Freedom"" is mentioned again and again to the point where it really gets painful to watch.  I know the primary audience is american, but did Gibson really have to bring out the buzzword time and time again?Apparently it worked, judging by the number of americans who love this film and who mention the freedom aspect in their comments. Not that this is the ideal place for political arguments, but really how americans unerringly swell with pride at the mere mention of ""freedom"" is beyond me.  If freedom means having one of the highest incarceration rates in the the world, letting 18 year olds carry concealed automatic weapons, but not allowing them to touch alcohol until 21, and keeping a heavy military presence throughout the world to brutally restrict any behavior they dislike, then I want no part of it.However, there are many good points to this film as well.  It is beautifully filmed, well acted and flows well from beginning to end.If it weren't for all the chest-thumping ideology pushed down our throats, it would be one of my favourite films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Overblown and overrated,"I finally watched this movie after hearing about it for years and I really wish I'd spent my time watching something else.  Braveheart ranks right up there with Titanic and Pearl Harbor as prime examples of what's wrong with Hollywood historical epics.  They take a rich and complex history or event and dumb it down for the viewing public into a shallow tale of revenge, love and death.  Emotions are over-the-top and characters are either good or bad. Strangely enough, considering its reputation among some people as being mindless entertainment drivel, I feel Gladiator is a much better film, despite all the sneers that Gladiator aped Braveheart.  Gladiator took the elements that floundered in Braveheart and made it much more satisfying, visually and dramatically.  Compare Maximus's quiet death, as he finally reaches his family on the other side, with Wallace's leatherlung scream of ""FREEDOM!"" delivered on the soaring wave of a pulse-pounding, throat-catching orchestral surge that you would find only in a Hollywood epic.  I look at Braveheart as a supreme egotrip by a moderately talented actor.  Mel Gibson needs a good director to keep him in line so he doesn't grandstand, and Emmerich succeeded to some degree in The Patriot.  Throw in the shameful historical inaccuracies and the blatant gay-bashing (Mel has a few personal agendas) and you have a long film that bores and exasperates.Still, I gave it 2/10 for the cinematography.  The scenery is beautiful. Oh, and the gut-wrenching bellylaugh I got from Wallace's final word made the rest of the movie much more enjoyable.  Too bad it didn't come earlier in the film.If you want to see Braveheart summed up in about 5 minutes, watch the ""Starvin' Marvin"" episode of South Park.  It's infinitely more satisfying.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
One of the best movies ever put to film,"Not only was Braveheart one of the best movies put on film but it was rightly named Best Picture for 1995.

There is 28 minutes of unused footage that Mel Gibson cut out of the film. During the TV broadcasts, you can see some of these scene actually spliced in the movie which is very cool. But until they come out with a better DVD I will not buy my FAVORITE movie. I gave this movie a 10 because every time I see it I cry, it's just one of those movies that does that to me. the story and scenery are so rich and involving it amazes me.

Best example of a film that causes viewers to release emotions.,"Braveheart is one film I will never forget. There could not have been a better director or actor than Mel Gibson to helm such a captivating film. The emotions are so intense that I frequently felt ""prickles"" running down my arms and cheeks because I was so touched by this film. I know we have all felt that feeling before in movies we have watched, and that definitely proves that Mel Gibson knows how to reach his audience. He gets our adrenaline rushing when battles begin, he makes us try to hold back tears when a sad event occurs (in this movie there are about a million sad scenes). All of this well-crafted story is made even better by James Horner's masterful music score. Now THIS guy knows how to compose music effectively, fitting his score perfectly with the images on screen.

Long-winded; simple-minded; ultimately disturbing.,"I had liked Mel Gibson's *Braveheart* a bit better 9 years ago when I first saw it; but that was 9 years ago. 9 more years of experience in both life and movie-watching has revealed to me this film's inadequacies upon a re-viewing on a TV broadcast.Gibson shows no particular talent for framing, camera placement or camera movement. Blocky, centered compositions dominate. Like all amateur directors, Gibson relies on slow-motion to increase the significance or suspense of a scene. There's one particularly egregious sequence in which Gibson's Wallace, returning to a village in which he attacked some English soldiers, SLOWLY approaches some infantry who are ready to take him into custody. One soldier's chain-mailed hand SLOWLY takes hold of the harness of Gibson's horse. Gibson SLOWLY raises his arms above his head. Gibson SLOWLY reaches behind his back for his weapon. Gibson SLOWLY bashes the soldier's head in with the weapon. Look -- this is really incompetent film-making. A good director, in order to increase suspense, would find NARRATIVE solutions to achieve his aim, rather than simply assume that slowing the film's speed to a crawl will put us on the edge of our seats. Slow motion: the hallmark of lazy, unimaginative, and incompetent film-making. *Braveheart* is riddled with it, to the point that the entire film seems to consist of it. Run the film at normal speed, and the movie's no more than 2 hours long . . . and it would also become abundantly clear that there's not much to this simple-minded epic, after all.There's certainly very little complexity here, an unforgivable sin, in my opinion, for a historical epic. We're given to understand that King Edward the First feels that he needs to subjugate Scotland in order to create a united ""Greater Britain"" against the competing imperial aims of England's Continental neighbors (particularly France), but why make such a comically satanic figure out of this character? ""My greatness will be better demonstrated when Scotland lies in ashes,"" Patrick McGoohan hisses -- all that's missing is the villainous chortle. McGoohan functions as a sort of Evil Stepfather in this castle-and-moat fairy tale. It works both ways, as well: because the English are such slave-masters, any and all terrorist tactics against them by Wallace's army of Highlanders is meant to be applauded. They burn forts, slit throats, lay siege to York (""When we invaded York, you would not support us,"" Wallace reprimands a council of Scot nobles), send the head of York's commander, via a basket, to London, trap English soldiers in a wooden hut and burn them alive . . . all for ""freedom"". Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation to the subject of the film, presumably) manage to find nothing contradictory about all of this. Acts of murder are Bad when the English commit them, Good when the Scots commit them. However, perhaps unconsciously realizing the murkiness of this type of morality, they give Wallace an added motivation designed to checkmate those who question if murder is washed clean by patriotism: the English brutally execute Wallace's wife (married to him secretly in order to avoid Longshanks' proclamation of ""prima noctis"") on a trumped-up insurrection charge. Therefore, Wallace's butchery is sanctioned by a divine sense of retribution above the laws of men. One unforgivable act makes a thousand revenges forgivable. Such ontological morality is as easy as it is totally insane.It's not Christian, either -- but Gibson has demonstrated with his most recent film, *The Passion of the Christ*, a religiosity that's not merely misguided, but mired in ignorance and neuroses. He conflates his own masochistic impulses with that of Christianity itself. In *Braveheart*, we get a foreshadowing of his *Passion* in the sequence in which he's tied to a wooded cross and tortured. (Though the cross is laid out horizontally, we get the heavy-handed point.) In Gibson's theology, spiritual transcendence is achieved when your body is getting cut open. ""FREEDOM"" is the triumphant battle-cry after your entrails are piled in a steaming heap. Only through pain suffered in its extreme can true victory, and therefore happiness and peace, be found. Watching one man's pathologies play out in such a public manner -- e.g., a major motion picture -- is a merely pathetic spectacle; more alarming than that is the ecstatic response this sort of thing has received from the movie-going public. Both *Braveheart* and *The Passion* were big box-office hits.Well, the battle scenes are still pretty exciting, and have been justly imitated over the past decade. For that reason, and that reason alone, *Braveheart* earns a generous 3 stars out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Just a few thoughts ....,"...about the Scottish hero, William Wallace.In reality a relatively privileged Frenchman from a noble family.The reason why the Scottish nobles didn't unite behind Wallace was that Edward I was generally regarded by historians to be a wise and just King (although I have to admit, there are allegations that he might have been 'in touch with his feminine side').The wars which escalated into the battles portrayed in the film, started as border skirmishes in which minor figures on BOTH sides had a crack at expanding their lands.The princess who becomes Wallace's lover in the film, was 9 at the time he died. Today that would be illegal, presumably it was frowned upon even then! So then, A French pikey, greedy for extra lands with a penchant for little girls.

I'm a descendant of Sir William Wallace.,"Anyone who thinks that England's history has entailed ""being civilized"" needs only watch ""Braveheart"" to learn the truth. It's the epic tail of my ancestor, Sir William Wallace (Mel Gibson), who was Scotland's greatest patriot. As the movie shows, he fought off the English invaders to death. I admit that the movie did get a few things wrong (namely that the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, not in a field), but it definitely deserved Best Picture.I should remind you that this is not the sort of movie that should be viewed by just anyone. The battle scenes are more violent than anyone could imagine. But this is one movie where violence is an integral part of the story. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Magic,"Some say this film is just Mel Gibson's way of glorifying himself, those people are talentless hacks. This is easily one of the best films of all time. I don't say that lightly. This is THE film that sparked my interest in cinema.An amazing story of love, betrayal, war, revolution, oppression and quite simply, it's a true hero's tale. The story is so well told and so engrossing it pulls the viewer into the movie.This film will make you feel the anger and betrayal the characters feel in a way that very few films are capable of(the way you felt in Saving Private Ryan when Mellish had a bayonet SLOWLY shoved into his heart while Upham hid in fear) over and over. It can and will make a grown man cry.The acting is far above par. An amazing cast that really didn't get the recognition they deserved(all went to Mel really). The beautiful Sophie Marceau made her Hollywood debut in this film.Something few people mention is that this is the first film in which the violence was actually realistic although the background fighters were less than convincing at times.If you are a TRUE fan of cinema, this is a must watch. A real classic unlike other so-called-amazing films such as Citizen Kane. It's the full package and represents what Hollywood really does best.Anyone who says this movie isn't good most definitely thinks the Twilight films are masterpieces.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
I Am William Wallace. A review through time.,"Men of Scotland, I stand before ye, not just as a warrior, but as a man who has seen his tale brought to life on the screen. They call it ""Braveheart,"" and it tells our story, our struggle, our fight for freedom against the tyranny of the English crown.Now, I willnae lie to ye. They have taken some liberties with the truth. Hollywood likes its tales grander and its heroes larger than life. Aye, the film paints me as a towering figure, wielding a mighty sword, rallying the clans with a voice that can shake the very hills. But I ask ye, does that matter? For in its heart, it captures our spirit, our unyielding desire for freedom.The battles, oh, the battles are fierce and bloody, as they should be. They show the bravery of Scotsmen, the power of our charge, and the ferocity with which we fight. The film may not capture every detail of our strategies, but it shows our courage, our unity, our defiance.As for the English, they are portrayed as the oppressors they are. King Edward, with his cold heart and ruthless ways, stands as the villain we know him to be. The film doesnae shy away from showing the cruelty and injustice we faced.And what of me, ye ask? I see myself up there, a man driven by love and loss, by the fire of rebellion. The film shows my pain, my rage, my unwavering resolve. It may not be the complete truth of who I am, but it captures the essence of my spirit, the heart of our fight.""Braveheart"" is more than a film; it is a call to arms, a reminder of what we fight for. It tells the world that Scotland will not be tamed, that we will not bow to tyranny. It shows our sacrifices, our struggles, and our triumphs.So, my brothers, when ye watch ""Braveheart,"" see it for what it is-a tribute to our fight, a testament to our courage. Let it stir your hearts, let it remind ye of why we stand here today. For they may take our lives, but they will never take our freedom!Now, to battle! For Scotland, for freedom, and for the legacy we shall leave behind!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Gibson made a Masterpiece,"Greatly enjoyed this story and the great photography throughout Scotland and its beautiful landscape of green pastures as far as your eye can see. However, their was plenty of blood shed on the battlefields and a very realistic view of how battles where fought many years ago in England and Scotland. Mel Gibson portrayed a great William Wallace who was deeply in love with a woman he knew immediately was going to be his soul mate and the King of England had other plans for this relationship as England had complete control over Scotland and had the idea that every newly married Scotish bride was to be shared with an Englishman and integrated their blood relations in order to break down the struggle of Scotland wanting to be free from England. There film is full of wonderful surprises and their is a strong romantic theme running behind all the blood and gore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Historically inaccurate and overrated,"Braveheart has to rank as one of the most overrated movies in the history of cinema. Yes it is visually stunning and the battle sequences are extremely well done, but it is historically inaccurate and portrays the English in such a bad light that the film has been used by the Scottish National Party to whip up support. This distortion of history is, sadly, all too common in Hollywood film making.If and when the United Kingdom breaks up then Mel Gibson can smugly boast to have played a part in its downfall. The fact Braveheart won 5 Oscars awards also shows how politicised the ceremony is.Rated 1 / 10",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A  Great Movie,"BRAVEHEART is one of the greatest inspiration I've had as a filmmaker. It inspires excellence in the film craft, both in terms of its excellent production quality from the crew and the beautiful performance by the cast of the movie. The fact that the movie is based on true events inspires me even more. For me, Brave Heart is the greatest patriotic movies of all times. I never get tired of watching it, and every time I watch it I'm doubly inspired; first it makes me reaffirm my decision to live my life a dedicated patriot of my country, and secondly to dedicate myself as a filmmaker to producing movies that will impact positively on humanity. I love the great plot of the story, the amazing epic setting, and my most thrilling of all; the perfectly choreographed BATTLE OF STERLIN BRIDGE.

This movie is great!!,So far after a few years of watching movies I've learned that acting and directing at the same time is hard so Mel Gibson did a great job on his part ding double duty. I like his way of acting. Braveheart is gory and very bloody. i love his freedom speech. it is one of the best if you watch this movie you will feel moved. This Movie is centered around the Scottish revolution when they broke with england or rather when they try. A Scottish man by the name of William Wallace steps up and takes action as you know Mel Gibson is William Wallace. as the movie progresses the Scottish learn quickly and they follow their hearts. so this movie is great for any of you movie lovers.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant!,"this movie shows the passion William Wallace had towards Scotland. Mel Gibson has some great acting in it and his accent is brilliant. this is my favorite movie of all time and thats because i love medieval history and my hero is William Wallace his story is so amazing and how his friends continued the rebellion after his death is also amazing and inspiring. Although in ""Braveheart"" his death is completely wrong its still good. If you haven't seen ""Braveheart"" (which i think most the people in the world have because its a absolute classic) go see because its brilliant, i repeat go see ""Braveheart u wont regret it its BRILLIANT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"This movie was really, really incredible.  I have no idea if the story of William Wallace is truthful, but it makes a helluva good movie.  The cinematography is wonderful... I loved the slow motion scenes (It's nothing like John Woo's ""slow-mo at weird times"" scenes).  There are a few scenes that will actually make you want to weep, and I'm really not that kind of guy.  The scene where the young girl gives William a thistle is very, very moving.  Only one piece of dialogue I didn't like... the ""every man lives"" bit is an old cliche.  Other than that, the movie was incredible.  I gave it a rare score... a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A stirring epic,"A remarkable film in which I can watch several times without faltering.  I am as much a lover of history as I am of film and literature, so I must acknowledge that this film is loosely based on the life of Wallace and does fall short in numerous instances to historical verity.  That said it remains a stunning achievement in film work liberally reconstructions actual events in order to present a gripping modern epic.The entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the thistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace with a wildflower at his father's funeral.  Few tableaus in film history can match the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. The tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate) is also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt for the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing of the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may only possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for sheer power in a battle scene).  It's also notable that the script and Gibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the soothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto voce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a life with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war and the obvious benevolence of the princess.This movie is a great one and without a doubt in my top ten.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Entertaining popcorn but very inaccurate historical movie,"I love watching this movie many times as light entertainment and for the battle scenes but this is Hollywood's version of history. Gibson is way too short to portray Wallace who was a giant not quite short. Wallace never met the King's daughter in law at all and Edward 1 died .long after Wallace. Overall the film is very anti English and as is the case in history there are always two sides and viewpoints on events and McGoohan's portrayal although good is a typical nasty villain viewpoint favoured by Hollywood. So, enjoy the film but don't value most of the history content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great epic film!,"Mel Gibson shows his true talents in 1995's ""Braveheart."" He acts, produces, and directs.""Braveheart"" tells the tale of Scottish hero, William Wallace, who led his people in a revolt against England in the 13th century. He wins many battles, wins enemies and alleys, and is feared and revered. Until his capture and execution. Wallace remains as Scotland's national hero and this film glorifies him as well as the human concepts of freedom and liberty.Little is known about William Wallace. The major source of this film was Blind Harry's poem, which is debated for historical accuracy. Well, this film is a Hollywood film, and as we all know, Hollywood cares little about history. Inaccuries are many, including the first battle being fought on Sterling ground whereas sources say it was fought on a bridge and the use of kilts for men (the clothing didn't exist at the time). But the most inaccurate is the romance between Wallace and the French-born princess of England, who was a little girl at that time.Historical inaccuracies aside, this a great action-packed film that can be enjoyed by anyone old enough to swallow it. It's a raw film, featuring tons of violence, ranging from really bloody battles, as so on and so forth (this was, after all, a violent time). Gibson, known for violence issues, such as in ""Lethal Weapon,"" portrays the battles realistically with no remorse. He brings us to the reality of that harsh time. He manages to make the battles very violent yet emotional. Viewers can feel as if they're not watching a re-enactment of the battle but in the actual battleground itself.""Braveheart"" is a beauty to watch. Other than providing lost of gut-wrenching action, it also has some lovely cinematography. Filmed in Ireland (though not in Scotland, where it takes place in), it offers lots of gorgeous scenery thanks to cinematographer John Toll. There's also great music from James Horner, who uses the most of Scotland's instruments, including bagpipes and flutes. The music is emotional and the mood is perfect. The script fares well under the writing of screen writer Randall Wallace. Although having no relation to the film's protagonist, Randall Wallace shares the same last name with William Wallance and this coincidence inspired him to write the script. Under his storytelling skills, the script tells the story of the struggle to win freedom from a tyrannical power.The direction is great. Mel Gibson not only is a good actor but talented producer and director as well. This film was not Gibson's directional debut, however, since his first directing experience was during ""The Man Without a Face,"" but he is talented, nevertheless, and his skills are even featured on his third directional attempt, ""The Passion of the Christ."" The directing makes this films good. In this film, Gibson, as the protagonist, battles the English, an attempt later repeated in ""The Patriot."" Of course, no film would be good with its cast of characters and the talented actors and actresses to portray them. Mel Gibson stars as Wallance, alongside Patrick McGoohan as a great antagonist Edward I ""Longshanks"" of England, Catherine McCormick as Wallace's tragic bride, Sophie Marceau as the French-born English princess, Brian Cox as Wallace's uncle, Brendan Gleesan as Wallace's childhood friend, as the list goes on.Released in 1995, ""Braveheart"" has gone to win 5 Oscars even Best Picture. It revived the epic film genre that was later done in 2000's Gladiator. Today, this film is remembered as an great epic tale of the strong will of an oppressed people to win a deserved freedom from a tyrannical power.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An inspiring masterpiece,"What a masterpiece! It makes me want to be a better person. It makes me want to fight for what I believe in. It makes me believe in doing the right thing - whatever it takes. It's just so inspiring! Braveheart is a masterpiece made of masterpieces such as Randall Wallace's screenplay and James Horner's magnificent score. Director Mel Gibson made it shine like no other could have. There are so many moments of profound beauty and dignity. After 170 minutes you just know that there is so much more to life than seemed to be three hours ago.

"""They Fought Like Scotsman, And Won Their Freedom""","""They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsman, and won their freedom."" Those final words said by actor/director Mel Gibson made this film truly a legendary masterpiece. Not only that, but the film was legendary from start to finish. This movie proved to audiences that Mel Gibson can act and be a successful film director and I truly thought he would be the first man to receive the ""Best Actor and Best Director"" Oscars in 1995, but still no one has done it...yet.When I saw this film back in 2001, I knew it would go down in history for many years to come and that there will never be another William Wallace film to top Mel Gibson's. However, what won me over as well was the score. It amazes me how not many people have ever heard of James Horner before. The guy has composed countless amounts of films such as ""Troy"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Randsom"", ""The Perfect Storm"", and so on. That final song at the end still to this day puts a tear in my eye. The other thing that won me over was the acting from the supporting roles. Of course Mel Gibson was flawless but I'm also glad to see that David O' Hara (The funny Irishman) is still acting in films and Brendan Gleeson showing a lot of talent as an action star.This was hands down the best film of 1995 and still today continues to take its place among the greatest of the great action drama's of all time.

Greatest movie of all time,"I first saw this movie when i was 11 or 12 and instantly knew no other movie could come close to touching this film.

The best action and plot and characters and love story all mashed into one film are great. even if u are not Scottish you will be touched by this movie and its inspirational story of love, revenge and belief in a cause. But I would have to say uncle argyle is my favorite character he was perfect and he taught William right and made him the man he was.The battle of Stirling is my favorite seen along with wills speech in the beginning.One thing I didn't really notice until after i had seen this film a few times is that Hamish's father takes a lot of injury during battle until he finally dies in Falkirk. next time u watch keep an eye on Hamish's dad its quite interesting.

The best parts about this film were the strong acting by not only Gibson but everyone involved and the cinematography, which was stunning at times.

Freedom when?,"The last time I checked, Scotland was still ruled by London, and is still the domain of the 'British' (actually German) royal family.Braveheart was a huge deal when it first came out. I never really watched the film properly until recently. As a frequent cinema-goer since my youth I was not a part of the mid-nineties cultural phenomenon that was Braveheart's release in Scotland. I did turn up at the the cinema, the old Odeon in Edinburgh, but the queue went round the block (the literal term for a blockbuster) and there was no way in hell I was prepared to wait for three hours on a gray September afternoon (a choice I came to regret). Every subsequent attempt since then was blocked. I never rented the video as I didn't want to watch in pan-and-scan. The fact that every single living Scottish person had seen it apart from myself really got on my nerves, and I was quite bitter about it. And then, as the fever died down, I just kind of forgot about it and moved on.Watching it fully as an adult I think I probably enjoy it more now that I would have done as a teenager. It's certainly a huge epic right up there with the best of them. Mel Gibson captures the pretty side of Scotland wonderfully with his scope photography accompanied by James Horner's bittersweet score. The film never really feels three hours long, the time just disappears.Nearly every notable Scottish actor (apart from Connery and Connelly) appears at some point. From the brilliant (Brian Cox) to the dreary and pretentious (Peter Mullan). Keep a lookout for Tommy Flanagan too, in one of his earlier roles.The battle scenes are impressive, but I wish there were more gory. Gibson's first cut of the film was apparently bloodier, I wish it had remained intact. But despite the grim satisfaction of seeing the English aggressors getting splattered the fact that Scotland IS still ruled by England kind renders Wallace's bravery irrelevant. It may have been 700 years ago, but I hate the fact that he ultimately died for nothing. We DON'T have a country of our own, plain and simple.Maybe one day...in my lifetime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Watch this film,"This film is great and everyone should watch it at least once, thats the review out of the way. If you are reading this review i assume you have read the reviews before it and will probably read the ones after it. All the other reviews can be broken into 2 groups. Group 1 are the people (i'm ashamed to say often my fellow Americans !) who write ""this film is great and is about how the Scottish beat the British"" this may be a small point but Scotland is a part of Britain as is England. Therefore the Scottish were not fighting Britain and anyone who writes a review featuring that statement is well worth avoiding. Group 2 are the people who will mention the historical accuracies. Whether or not you read those reviews is very much up to you. If you want mindless entertainment dont bother with them. If you want educating read away as you might learn something.

Marvelous Mel,"BRAVEHEART (1995) **** Mel Gibson, Patrick Mc Goohan, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, Angus MacFayden, Brendan Gleeson.  Exceptionally directed epic about fabled Scottish rebel leader William Wallace (Gibson, who won an Oscar in his sophomore directing gig as well as Best Picture, is in fine form blending stoicism with romanticism) who in the 13th century led a bloody revolt of his fellow countrymen against the vile English King Edward I (sneeringly good Mc Goohan).  Brutality never before seen but definitely expected with some superb battle sequence choreography and smart editing.  Excellently produced and executed with some humor and genuine Shakespearean moments sprinkled in for good measure.  First-rate and exciting filmmaking which won a total of 5 Academy Awards including the aforementioned as well as Best Makeup, Best Sound Effects Editing and for John Toll, Best Cinematography.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An Inspiring and Exciting (If Historically Inaccurate) Epic,"At the sixty-eighth annual academy awards, Mel Gibson's Braveheart won five awards, including best film, and it deserved every one of them. With epic battle sequences, rousing speeches, remarkable performances by some of Hollywood's best actors, and its inspiring tale of man's quest to liberate his homeland from tyranny, Braveheart is as great a film as has ever been made.Following the (mostly) true story of Scottish outlaw, hero, and martyr William Wallace, the film takes us from the childhood events that would shape him, through his war against the English, and to his betrayal and execution at the hands of Edward II. In any hands this would be an exciting tale, filled with violence, treachery, and intrigue. And in Gibson's hands, with a script based on the writings of the 15th century poet Blind Harry, this is truly a tale to inspire. It is inspiring because it is the story of a man who wanted only to live and work in peace, but who was willing to take up arms to avenge the woman he loved.It is inspiring because no matter how high the odds were stacked against him, and no matter what he was offered in return for halting his crusade, he would not give up his struggle to free his beloved Scotland. And it is inspiring because unlike other men, who would have sought to use their military success towards their own rank and status, Wallace fought under the banner of another, Robert the Bruce, even when Robert did not deserve it. For Wallace it was not about power, or wealth, or even his own honor, though this mattered to him greatly. It was about seeing Scotland free and independent under the man who rightfully held claim to the throne.William Wallace, as depicted here, is one of the greatest heroes in any film, and only Mel Gibson could have done the role justice. Despite the scandals and alcoholism that have plagued him in recent years, there can be little doubt that Gibson was, and is, a great actor. And when this film was made, he was at the very height of his career and acting ability. Earnest and charismatic he brings both the gravity and experience of a veteran actor and the energy and enthusiasm of a younger man. Few actors will ever give a performance as great as the one he gave here, and it was unquestionably the best of his career.The other cast members also performed excellently. Patrick McGoohan is the very epitome of ruthlessness as Edward the Longshanks. Sophie Marceau likewise performs very well as the noble princess Isabella, whose romance with Wallace, although wildly historically inaccurate does much to give the film an extra emotional pull. Angus Mcfayden is particularly compelling as Robert the Bruce. He is a good man who genuinely wants to do the right thing, but who lacks self confidence and is plagued by evil council. It is with great anticipation that we await the moment he will break free from his fears and doubts and take up the cause.From a technical and cinematic standpoint, Braveheart is exceptionally well made. No expense has been spared on the sets and costumes, and the film utilizes some of the most beautiful settings in Scotland and Ireland. And the battle scenes are among the greatest ever to be put on film. The scale of the battles is something to behold, with hundreds of fully armed and costumed combatants on both sides. Nor have the filmmakers shied away from the sheer brutality of medieval warfare. Watching the axes and claymores strike their mark, the hard part is believing that people weren't harmed. This violence alone, without the later execution scene, is enough to earn the film a hard R rating, but it is absolutely what's needed.It may be graphic, it may be suspect in its historical accuracy, and I admit it has cast aside much of the complexity of the real William Wallace for the sake of a more compelling narrative. And of course it's a vanity production on the part of Gibson. But Braveheart is absolutely the kind of rousing epic that audiences crave. It is well acted, well crafted, and contains a compelling story and an uplifting message at its heart. Wallace's cry of ""Freedom!"" will resound with you long after the film has ended. There is no doubt in my mind that this was the best film of 1995, and it has lost none of its impact since.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Mel Gibson not very convincing as Wallace,"I was extremely surprised to find out that this was supposed to be such a good movie. I saw it on TV yesterday, and I hated it. It was soooo boring, and Mel Gibson was not at all convincing as William Wallace. He was looking like a 40 year old man that was still desperately trying to be young. He was supposed to be just a little bit older than the beautiful girl (whose name I forgot), but it was obvious he was much older.The story was boring, and some parts of the movie were well acted, but I was so irritated by Gibson and the story line, that that did not make up much.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"It's gritty, dirty but also beautiful","A tight script with very few holes, a wonderfully full-bodied score, great panoramas and characters we can immediately sympathise with; Braveheart tells the story of a true protagonist resisting a cruel, tyrannic and insurmountable enemy.When we witness the very brutal murder of William Wallace's wife in an up-close and personal way, we cannot but feel emotionally invested and so we share in Wallace's blood lust, not just for revenge, but for justice also. What a great evil villain Patrick McGoohan portrays as Long Shanks, the King of England! His sudden, swift deliverance of rage or the foreboding tremor is his voice, makes him truly terrifying. How we can so easily loath everything about his tyrannic kingship. This character has no redeeming features other than you LOVE to hate him. He is a wretch who's only motivation is to maintain absolute and total power and he has no qualms about the suffering of others to maintain it.Oh really, who cares if the movie itself is grossly and historically inaccurate! Perhaps it embodies the original spirit of the man become myth... or perhaps it elaborates too much for some... I guess normally I would detest such liberties on historical accuracy and shy away from the forced elements of the blockbuster, but in this case I allow it licence simply because it has managed to seamlessly forge all the elements of good storytelling together. It is the perfect movie for the escapist; acting near like opera, Braveheart plays off deep inherent feelings, plucking at our heart strings to feast upon our most basic and primordial emotions. It is a gritty movie -especially the battle scenes- yet also sweet and sentimental. The movie will take you... and you yourself will fall willingly into it. Let it sweep you away...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Awesome historical epic.,"This is one of best films ever. This is Mel Gibson's best performance and best film All of the other leads did very well too. Angus Macfadyen was very good as well as Bruce It was very interesting to see his character change throughout the film. Braveheart is an extremely well done film in every way. John Toll's brilliant Cinematography is a sight to see and the editing by Steven Rosenblum is great Oh, and most of all: James Horner's haunting, yet utterly beautiful musical score. A shining example of how music can really make a movie. Horner's music is, in my opinion, the heart of the film. To me, the music he composed for this film is the best score I've ever heard for any movie. This is a very powerful, heartfelt movie. I've seen it over 10 times and it can still make me bawl. I love Braveheart and I highly recommend seeing it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant Film-making,"Quite honestly this movie is just absolutely brilliant. I have never, ever seen a movie that inspiring in my life. Any time I would hear a person talk about how a movie inspired them I would laugh. I mean we've all seen great movies, but I have never thought longer then 2 seconds about a movie after I saw it.Braveheart is the only movie that i have seen more than 5 times. It is simply an amazing piece of film. The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't even move. It was that brilliant. I am not someone who cares for 99% of movies. And ones like the Godfather, Shawshank, North by Northwest, are all very good, but none, and I mean none even approach the level of filmamking that Braveheart attained.As far as the movie itself goes, there are much better writers then I here on IMDb who can artfully tell you the brilliance of this film. I don't know too much about all that. But I do know that after watching this film, I felt truly inspired, and I mean I really did. The scenery of this film along with the music truly elevates this movie to a level most films would die to get to. But it is the content of this film that resonates so deeply in me.This film is crafted to near perfection to touch on the rawest of human emotions, freedom and pain. The freedom isn't some corny word that most lame ass liberal Americans throw around these days, it was a visceral word. A word that was real. A word that stood for more than some college professors rant on Bush. Braveheart elevates the theme of freedom to something to die for. Not only does the film do that, but it introduces love as freedoms only companion. Wallace played by Gibson, rises to the occasion of playing a passionate Scot who wants to free his homeland. That plot alone sounds basic, right? But somehow, it rises to what it is suppose to rise to..brilliance.I know people have challenged this movies historical portrayals, but that is really not relevant. This film isn't played in schools in Scotland, or anywhere for that matter, to teach them some Scottish history. Please people, this movie is theme based.Watch this movie A.S.A.P. if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again. It is truly inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Loved it better the first time around.,"When I first saw this film, I thought it was fantastic! In particular, it skirted the second act letdown. Tonight, I saw it on DVD. One, too many and too long battle sequences. Two is enough for me. Second, Wallace (Gibson) is carried to his execution on a cart with a cross. Well, OK, Christ dies for all of us. But then, when he is secured to have his head cut off, he is also spread out in a cross. Too much Christianity for me. I did not notice this aspect when I first saw the film.Otherwise, this film hooked me well into its story, and it has a very strong spiritual aspect. The love that was consummated (twice) struck me as more of the spirit than of the flesh.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This is a powerfull movie because of what it stands for. What would one do for his beliefs? It's not just a movie. It makes you think: ""How far would you go for what you love an believe?"" How far would you go for freedom? The actors' interpretations are excellent. I can never forget the look in Wallace's eyes when he saw he'd been betraied. The passion with which he fought. The passion, the will, the power... that granted Scotland's freedom. For me, this is one of the best movie ever.

A gripping epic,"My favorite movie is Last of the Mohicans, but Braveheart rates very close too. Granted, the movie is not historically accurate as far as the life and times of William Wallace go, but if I wanted a history lesson, I would be turning on A&E or the History Channel, not paying $6.50 at a movie theater. I want to see a moving story which makes me feel, and Braveheart does just that.The storyline is awesome, and the cast turn in excellent performances all around. Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau both made me start to hate Mel Gibson since he got to work with both women. Mel himself turned in a very stunning performance. The soundtrack was very moving as well.Now back to the storyline. Normally when I watch a long movie, I see many scenes which could have been deleted. Postman, for instance, had many such scenes. However, every time I watch Braveheart, I find every scene necessary, and the film never drags. The action is constant, whether it be physical or emotional. I have watched this movie many many times, and am moved to tears every single time I watch it. Great great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"An Amazing Accomplishment, Easily the Best of 1995","I can remember when everyone was shocked when ""Braveheart"" won the Best Picture Oscar of 1995.  However, ""Braveheart"" was easily the best film in an above-average year for movies.  Mel Gibson's style of directing is the heart in ""Braveheart"".  It is a cinematic event.  In 2 hours and 59 minutes Gibson tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish rebel in the late 13th Century, who led a rebellion against the English and freed a nation from an evil tyranny.  We get a glimpse of Wallace as a young boy to his awful death at the hands of the English.  The greatest argument about this film is whether this film is history or Hollywood.  Well it's more Hollywood than history, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of the film.  Gibson reminded us of all the great epics of the late-1950s and early-1960s with this masterpiece.  His ability as a director was solidified and ""Braveheart"" is a film that will likely never lose its glitter.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Almost great, but not quite","There's a lot to love about Braveheart: an engaging, sweeping story, amazing battle scenes, a host of fantastic supporting performances and an achingly beautiful soundtrack that should have definitely won the Best Score Oscar.However, there's one reason why I'd never ever call this movie a classic, and for me, the problem lies with Mel Gibson. I'm not saying his performance is weak or inefficient: Gibson's Wallace is a passionate leader as well as a masterful swordsman. But, through the entire long run of the movie, I could never shake off the feeling that the man on the screen wasn't a medieval Scotsman, but a 20th century actor wearing a rather silly-looking wig. In short, I simply didn't believe in the main character, I could never believe that it was William Wallace up there on the big screen. I realised it even more distinctly after I've seen 'Gladiator' with Russell Crowe, now that, to me, was a 100% credible performance in a historical epic. And since I could never believe in Wallace, I couldn't particularly care about the character and what was happening to him. I wasn't moved or saddened during the execution scene: to me it was simply a grisly affair that stroke no emotional chords whatsoever. Because of that, I would give Braveheart 7.5 out of 10, but I'd give it full 10 if only the main character felt more real and credible to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Some of Everything,"Braveheart is currently listed on the IMDB list of top 250 films, with reason.  It has everything, history, action, drama, romance, comedy, and does well at all of them.

Good for its time.,"Braveheart turned out to be a nice surprise. All of the characters were likable in their own way, with a thorough backstory fleshing out Wallaces character. I found the main cast to be enjoyable and fight scenes were watchable for being made in 1995. They showed creative tactics for overtaking their enemies many times.The story was simple, but done well with a few twists and turns waiting for you. However i don't like the ending too much. Everyone was there but just watched Wallace, it would probably of been suicide to help but still... I think someone would have jump in to the fray. It was still OK. And the way they wrapped it up at the very end, felt to quick. (As long as the movie was) Wish they showed the story unfold till the end.It was a nice watch and a break from all the crap out there. It just was not satisfying enough to hold a special place for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Way to go re-writing history!,"Had i wrote the review back in 95, I would have gave it 8/10. Because as a movie I really enjoyed it. However, that was back in 95 when I was fairly ignorant and just wanted to be entertained. Now, a little older and wiser the main issue I have with this movie is; it is a work of fiction masquerading as fact. You can't search William Wallace on the internet without it making reference to Mel Gibson's character. The movie is littered with blatant one sided inaccuracies; However I'm not going to list them here; many of the reviews have, so read some of them because I don't want to add spoilers. I realize a lot will be thinking I need to lighten up a little and just enjoy it as a movie... but Hollywood, it is NOT your history to be re-writing. How would an American audience react if the British made a movie about Vietnam, or the American Civil war, or the Indian Wars, and then depict all the American inaccurately as lying, murdering, rapists cowards. There wasn't a single honourable Englishman amongst them. As far as I'm concerned this was a missed opportunity to tell the story of William Wallace accurately while still making a great movie. William Wallace is a national hero to some in Scotland so to retell his story inaccurately is an insult to the ancestors of both sides.Freeeeeeeeeeddddooooommmmmmmm!!!!!!!!! (Laughable).Having just re-watched this and having vivid memories of The Patriot (same movie, only the accents differ). As a movie. A piece of fiction I would rate an 8/10.

William Wallace really WAS seven feet tall!,"Where does one begin?  ""Braveheart"" is a unique blend of masterful performances and superb directing.  Mel Gibson has proven his brilliance both on and off the screen.Being a student of history, I am always interested in historically-based films, and ""Braveheart,"" while not the most historically accurate of tales, is near the top of the list.  The battle scenes are brutally realistic and the love story between Wallace and Murron is among cinema's most compelling.Horner's score matches the mood perfectly, and the photography of the Scottish landscapes are amazing.  All the elements of an excellent film are here.By the way, if you find amusement in the bit where one of the Scots asserts that the real William Wallace is seven feet tall, you may be interested to know that the real William Wallace actually was seven feet tall.

"A good movie, but historically inaccurate.","A comment by dr_necron on March 7th states that Wallace met Isabella when she was 12 years of age which was the year before his death.  I find this hard to believe because he was in hiding in Scotland at the time and she was mainly in France.  Does anyone have any information to support this? I would appreciate such info. She married Edward II after Wallace had been killed, but in the movie she is married to Edward while he lives.  She is shown in the movie to mediate between the Scots and Edward I, but she actually was a mediator between Edward II and the Barons.  She was a remarkable woman!  Her real life would make quite a movie.  She put her son on the throne in place of her husband and then he eventually put her in prison for most of her life.  She lived to be 66 which was quite old for those times. The battle scenes in this movie are very well done.  The acting is excellent.

Rule Britannia,someone previously attacked the English for being Norman/Saxon in origin and for being invaders. That is a very simplistic view of things. For a start William Wallace himself was descended from a minor Norman lord. Does this mean he too was an invader ? most of the lowland Scots had Anglo-Saxon blood in them. The easiest way to view Englands invasions is that England was a potentially powerful nation but as long as it had enemies who were able to mount serious raids (and often did) She could not influence the world. it is no coincidence that when the British Isles were united they went on to forge the greatest empire the World had seen. So when you slam someone for being proud of Englands military achievements bear in mind that those military achievements laid the base on which the cultural achievements lay.,1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This film has insufficient runtime....,"This is one of those films that just don't last long enough.

Like a couple hundred years ago or so. I believe this film are called epos, often telling a true story. Braveheart is after my opinion just such a movie.There is really not enough space on this page for me to tell you (if you are one of those who have not seen the film, yet) just WHY you should see this film, but if I tell you that one of the reasons are the most breathtaking battle-scenes you have ever seen in your life, would you be more interested in this feature?!!The Battle-scenes in this film are the best I have ever seen in my entire life as one of the globes most eager moviefans. They really brings to life exactly how it was on the battlefield. It is almost as you are really there among all the English soldiers and Scottish ""farmers"". Blood squirting on the camera(or whatever they used for blood in this film) is a pretty good way of showing the audience that no one on this battlefield are bullsh**ing about anything.

Not a film I would normally recommend BUT....,"I must recommend this one. I'm not one for a blood and guts movie. The film is very 'Mel Gibson' in nature. Yet, this film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, you will be horrified, and you will be amazed. The roller coaster emotions are endless. The score is one of the most beautiful, and the romance is.... well, totally indescribable. A wonderful film, this. The blood and guts is indeed a turn off and certainly could have been eliminated without ruining the film, but what is done is done. While the film is quite fictionalized, you'll still find yourself wishing you knew William Wallace. Indeed, a modern classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Loved It,"This was a great movie, I unexpectedly fell in love with this movie after watching about a few months ago. The script is terrific, the acting is great (though some could have worked on it)I guess this movie is so good because it works on so many levels.

"Braveheart in my view, is one of the greatest most breathtaking films of all time.","From beginning to end this movie will put you on the edge of your seat for nearly 3 1/2 hours.  This film has all the  elements to make a great movie. It has romance, tragedy, action, war, revenge, betrayal, and at times comedy.  The acting was amazing, especially by Mel Gibson.  It was by far his best movie.  Although it won an academy for best picture I felt Mel should have at least been nominated for best actor.  I don't want to spoil the movie for you but I thought I would give you a brief summary on why I think this is the greatest movie I have ever laid eyes on.

Awesome,Braveheart tells the story of how a man fights for the independents of Scotland to avenge the death of his lady who was killed by the evil British king.  The story is one of gripping power sure to keep anyone glued to his or her seat for the three-hour film.  The large battle scenes are gruesome and very realistic.  The acting is inspiring and the script is magnificently done.  The breath taking scenes of Scotland add much to the film along with the use of some comic relief through out the film.  Braveheart is sure to please any film enthusiast who enjoys a good love story mixed in with heart pounding violence.,,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Epic Masterpiece,"An time period epic masterpiece film with intense story lines, perfect acting, best Oscar for sweeping cinematography, and best Oscar for brilliant directing! Shakespeare was said to be the first noted writer where the majority of his characters had severe psychological undertones identifiable by the reader who could understand them and relate to them.Braveheart does this as well with an perfectly cast film with dozens of stellar Shakespearian- type performances that the viewer can identify with: The political clans head where everything is a payoff, the ruthless king who maintains his kingdom through fear, the inept son of the king who is there by birth-right, the pure village maiden misplaced in a ruthless time, a queen forced into a loveless relationship, Robert the Bruce who is struggling with establishing his own character, the reluctant hero leader, the lover's vengeance, the son who his avenging his father's murder, and the singular heart who pure focus is achieving his goal of freedom.The battle scene are very gory, but necessary to tell of the struggle and raise the stakes in the movie. Since this movie, I have seen other movies influenced and whom have borrowed from this movie's battlefield trickery, angles of fighting, and eye-level impact clashes.A sweeping epic that is one of the most inspiring movies of its time. It is the 1990's version of a Man for All Seasons. In a Hollywood industry that highlights and makes films of the underworld seediness, Mel Gibson brought forth a story of conviction and character and inspiration, and in hindsight laid the foundation in this film that would be the foreshadowing of his work in the Passion of the Christ.One of the Best Movies Ever Made, as FIVE Oscars recognized!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Do you see the president out in the battlefield now in days?

The tragedy in this movie is so sad, it makes you want to jump in and fight next to Wallace and do your best to support the inhumanity that's delivered from all those who put them through so much. How could anything have ever gotten this out of control? Well this is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. The soundtrack is simply powerful and so very lovely.

Continuity,"During the funeral scene of William Wallace's father and brother.

Most romantic movie ever or just most gory?,"One of the most interesting things about this film is how differently people react to it.  When I offered it as one of the most romantic films I had ever seen, several people scoffed, commenting on how much death and gore there was and how could that possibly be viewed as being romantic.  True, the battles are horrific, hundreds, thousands, of men butchering each other in close quarter hand to hand combat.  There is decapitation, dismemberment, and rivers of blood and death.  Yet it is also the story of the power of commitment.  In the story (how true this is I can not say, but the theme works anyway) William Wallace gave up his life, gave himself entirely to free his country.  Nothing else mattered.  There is no cautions planning, no careful conservation of resource.Every fiber of Wallace's being is spent in every second on defeating his enemy, now, not tomorrow, but now, right now.  He lives entirely in the moment, being his commitment to free his country.   His success is a direct consequence of that total commitment.  And the source of that commitment was the love he had for his wife, his childhood sweetheart.  What could be more romantic than a love that changes the world?    If the tears aren't flowing in the final scene, about both an agonizing death, and the power of love to overcome even that horror, then your heart is made of stone.  This film is among the best I have ever seen.Great sound track too (interestingly enough I believe the new release Cast Away uses at least one of the same tracks).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
One of the all time best movies!,"Braveheart has it all. It's a great movie for guys, and a chic flick as well, but not in the traditional sense. Women will love it for romantic aspects, but will cringe at some of the graphic fight scenes. Overall they will love it though, so guys, you can have your cake and eat it too!Critics have said that the movie has historical flaws, but this is not a stale documentary, it is a movie. I've found that the story is closer to the truth than many critics care to acknowledge. Remember, the English records are going to view William Wallace in not the most favorable light. However, the movie is based in large part on the writings of ""Blind"" Harry who was not biased against Wallace.The bottom line is that the movie is well written, directed, and acted. I can't even remember how many Academy Awards it won, but it wasn't enough. The fight scenes alone are some of the most realistic (and graphic) that you could expect to see. It is also inspiring to see men stand up for their beliefs in the face of overwhelming odds when their very lives were at risk.You can't go wrong with this film unless you are English. *grin*Two thumbs up, WAY UP!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
exquisite film making,"Mel has already proven that he's not only a wonderful actor, but also a great director with his directorial debut The Man Without a Face. this is definitely one of the best historic spectacles to date. since i've seen the movie, it inspires me to immediately compare it with all other movies of the same genre i get to see and so far i've found no match to this giant. i realise that the movie's based on a true story, but anyways this is quite daring film making, juicy and to the core of one's emotions. bravo Mel !!! also my compliments to Patrick McGoohan it's a real treat watching him grind his teeth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Hollywoodized,"Classic Hollywood-American mojo, historically inaccurate (my apologies to the scots and the brits), but I can suspend my disbelief and I can be entertained.

And I love the ""HUSBAND of THE BRIDE"".All in all I would love to see a sincere representation (aka historically accurate story) told of William Wallace.I would also like to see a little less slant on how innocent the Scots were.No faction (enemy nor hero) is 100% pure valiances or villain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The GREATEST FILM EVER MADE !!!!!!,"Mel Gibson spent a good few years in getting this film made .... and it was COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED. Mr Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors, but his greatest success by far was in the production and direction of this SUPERB movie. Although the movie itself is almost 3 hours long, it is totally absorbing from beginning to end. I first saw this film as a special preview, and had to take the very last seat in the cinema, which of course was the worst possible one. The film was just so amazing that I didn't move a muscle for the entire film, even though I was sat at a very uncomfortable angle. The 3 hours seemed to fly by, so much so that I was late for an appointment, as I just hadn't realised how long the film was, and I never checked my watch once. Everything about this movie deserves the highest praise indeed, including Mr Gibson's Scottish accent. I have watched this film time and time again, and it never ceases to impress, or indeed move me, as certain scenes seem to provoke a tearful response at every viewing.

An achievement in storytelling.,"This film is perhaps one of the most entertaining stories that Hollywood has produced to date.  It is of course completely historically inaccurate, though it is certainly not the only, nor the most recent, film to obscure historical truths and still be impressively well done.  Gibson does nothing new with this movie, as it is a classic blend of adventure, romance, morality, and comic relief.  What Gibson does do, however, is weave these aspects together with greater skill than most.  To compare this story to history is futile, as is comparing the Bard's tale of Julius Caesar to the actual occurrences in ancient Rome.  While based on historical events the purpose of this and any movie is to entertain.  Education, while a good and noble purpose, is not nor should it be the primary goal of the cinema. While Braveheart will not educate as to the events in medieval Scotland, it will indeed tell a tale that has been told the world over in a million variations.  Some call Braveheart laughable and trite and in some respects these critics are not wrong.  My counter to this argument is that all epics, from The Odyssey to Beowulf to the Lord of the Rings, are by nature laughable and trite.  The story of William Wallace as presented by Braveheart is not the story of the man who lived in Scotland centuries ago but the story of every epic hero.  As an epic, the story must invariably deal with and contain archetypes so broadly ranging that they must be described as laughable and trite.  That Braveheart is a very basic story, which I will admit, by no means qualifies it as a bad story.  Instead it is an epic story, and a very good one at that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

It made me think...I well die but have I really Lived?,"""Your heart is free, have the courage to follow it"" Wallaces Father.  This is the only movie i have ever watched that has enlightened and endowed me with something. Mel Gibson is absolutely unbelievable in his unrelenting quest for freedom, however he is just not simply fighting for freedom from bondage to England, but freedom from the oppression within his lands. He is trying to unite the heart of Scotland within itself to stand up to its outside oppressors. This movie is an enigma in filmmaking. How often do you see hollywood make a movie that holds up true value and tru love in the quest for life. i have seen the movie at least 20 times. It also depicts Wallace as a holy man driven with determination, enveloped with loyalty to his countrymen, himself, his country, and his God. If you have seen it and admire it then you will remember when Wallace was in the jail awaiting his torture and he prayed to God to give him the strength to do the right thing after he could've took the poison. Because he knew that taking the poison would only bend his will and give him weakness in the greatest test of his beliefs, and if he couldn't stand for his beliefs fullt sober and aware then how could he ever believe in what he had done. I think this is the greatest film of all time- not just for the story-not just for the direction and the strength that it has-or the effort and attude Gibson and the rest of the film crew put into it, but for the wholesomeness it brought up in me- it made me think of who i am and what i believe and what i will stand up for. and more importantly if i have that courage to embark on my belief. a masterpiece, a milestone for hollywood. Mel Gibson desrves so much credit for this film. The best film ever made by a long shot. Ryan",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Oscar worthy, but not the greatest!","""Braveheart"" is a very impressive war epic, especially since it was directed by Mel Gibson. Before the movie won any oscars, I had no idea that Gibson was capable of such filmmaking. Here, he effectively recreates a legendary story of Scotland's battle for freedom from England.This three hour picture focuses on the life of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his courageous attempts to lead Scotland to victory in the 13th century. A peaceful man by nature, Wallace is driven toward violence after his beloved wife is executed by English soldiers. Having lost his father earlier to the English as well, he is no longer capable of standing aside and allowing the enemy to rule his life. As he coldly and vengefully kills the men responsible for his wife's death, he begins a revolution. Brave men are quick to help him in this battle and desire more. Wallace, unsure of his goals, is eventually persuaded by his men to continue even further. He accepts the role of leader as a classic quest for freedom unfolds.The cinematography in ""Braveheart"" is excellent, especially during the battle scenes. Some of the most energetic and quite graphic sequences occur during the fighting. Gibson plays Wallace very well. The hero vows never to give up, and often when it appears that all odds are against him, he still manages to overcome them in some way. Cold and determined, Wallace still remains a good person. He will not accept defeat nor will he accept compromise. Along the way he meets the unhappy wife of King Edward's son. Princess Isabelle is played by Sophie Marceau, who I really like and respect now after also seeing her terrific performance in ""The World is Not Enough."" They find beauty in each other and Isabelle is inclined to aid Wallace in his battle.The acting is superb and the film is very well made. Wallace's heroic will and his endless efforts are evident in Gibson's performance. The story is smart and well written, and the entire outcome is not too obvious. The film could have been even better if a couple of scenes were omitted. For example, during battle, the Scottish raise their kilts one time too many in order to flash the English army. An unnecessary shot of one Scot getting his rear hit with an arrow follows. Also, this film is yet another war epic in a long list fine war movies. It seems that those types of films are too safe and too easy to make. No one will ever hate them. While ""Braveheart"" is probably not better than ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" it is right up there with them. Aside from a couple of sequences I would have liked to see edited out, this movie is terrific. The cinematography creates a story world where there is very little not to like. This movie deserved the oscar it received. Overall a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Magnificent moviemaking of medieval times; Mel Gibson deserves Oscar!,"Very few film directors can thoroughly entertain us with historical epics. Spielberg and Lean come to mind. Now, Mel Gibson can be added to this prestigious list of names. BRAVEHEART is easily one of the best films of 1995. Watching it, you really get a sense of what movies are all about. I've always thought Mel has had a flair for giving audiences what they want. Even when he was working in Australia, doing such projects as The Bounty and the Mad Max films, I knew there was a creative genius behind those great and under-rated performances. His work in BRAVEHEART is exactly what I had in mind. This is truly a labor of love for Mel, showing real pride in the quality of his craft. I loved the power of this film, emotionally and visually. William Wallace is a savage, but he always represents what he consistently stands to achieve: love, happiness, and most importantly, freedom. You can feel the majesty of the story, weaving Shakespearean edges within it without making it seem like it was made for a privileged few. Patrick McGoohan, who got gipped for an Oscar nod, is brilliant as King Edward, despicable in a collected demeanor. There is even a sense of humour to boot in this epic, bringing a bit of Scottish wit to an intensely serious and bloody carnage of a film. In this regard, I would compare it to Shakespeare. The attention to detail, the emotion, the power of BRAVEHEART prove Mel Gibson definitely has a flair for genius and a gift for entertaining the public. This is not to be missed!

"Good film, but many flaws away from greatness","Watching Braveheart was an enjoyable experience.  I thought the cinematography was amazing... the fight scenes were some of the best ever filmed... and the story was filled with passion and emotion.  However, they were a few parts of the film that just didn't work for me.  First of all, the story was quite one-dimensional.  If you are looking for anything else behind William Wallace's revenge against the evil King of England, you won't find it here.  In fact, the main characters do not grow or change throughout the movie.  Second, the romance between Wallace and the Princess is not very believable.  It moves way too fast and doesn't work with the rest of the story.  Third, the acting is far from perfect.  Save Gibson's performance, no one else stood out as particularly memorable.  Finally, the movie is overlong.  However, these flaws do not detract from a generally, very well made movie.  It's a movie intended to inspire... and for many, it does its job.

This movie shows a great portrayal of this mans heroic feats, and includes romance and humor. Most of the movie is also historically acurate, due to the fact that Mel Gibson consulted with the head of the actual Wallace clan in Scotland on everything, though he added a few of the movie essentials to keep it moving.

WOW !!!,"My husband and I loved the movie so much that we got married to the same music that William Wallace and Murron did.  Not only is it a story of courage and strength, but it is also a wonderful love story that will affect my soul forever.  Too bad more people don't have the conviction and motivation that he did to fight for something that he believed in.  And was willing to die for.  I pray that I can impart to my children the same qualities that he lived by.From My Heart, Jinx O'Casey",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Inept Epic,"In the 13th century, Scots battle to overthrow the English and gain independence. This is nothing but a big, bloated turkey that seems like it's never going to end. It is not clear where Gibson is worse - the hammy performance in front of the camera or the inept direction behind it. Gibson often has the camera linger on himself as he strikes heroic poses. Too much screen time is devoted to bloody battle scenes, causing the film to become increasingly tedious. The only respite from the repulsive bloodbath is romantic scenes that look like shampoo commercials.

Good film - history shows,"Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love, he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Evocative but Troubling,"After watching Braveheart, I can't help but wonder how much of an influence starring in ""Mad Max"" was on Mel Gibson's film making. Maybe the then young actor landed a role that matched his view of good and evil just through good luck. In ""Braveheart"", the suffering icon Gibson plays is William Wallace, who fights to liberate the Scots from the tyranny of their English rulers and the treachery of the Scottish Lords.Wallace matches cruelty with cruelty but that's alright because he's on the side of freedom. At least in ""Braveheart"" the times and the enemy are more in tune with barbarous methods than that of ""The Patriot"", which I detest as nothing more than a Revolutionary War-era ""Death Wish"". Patrick McGoohan is delicious as the English king Edward Longshanks who treats his allies as callously as his enemies. And I must admit my props to Mr. Gibson for treating warfare as the messy, horrific affair it is although he seems to revel in it.""Braveheart"" has many pluses. It is very convincing in taking you back in time. The stark landscapes of the Scottish countryside are lovely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great pace....shame about the content,"This film deserved to win the Oscar for Mel. The Direction, particularly of the Battle scenes, was excellent.

abysmal in every detail,"Firstly let me confess I turned it off after 30 minutes.I hated everything about it, particularly the music, which was Irish and not Scottish. That typified what I saw of the film - slapdash, clumsy, lazy film-making that is an insult to its audience's intelligence. It's not that I'm nit-picking or being perfectionist, this film is really rough in the way it handles everything (in the first 30 minutes). Every character, every scene, every bit of dialogue, every bit of storytelling is so short of believability that it completely failed to weave any kind of spell over me at all.There is one thing in the film worth seeing, though, which is Mel Gibson doing what he imagines to be a Scottish accent.

Historical Truths,"Frist of all, let me be clear about the fact that l did enjoy Braveheart a lot, And l would have to put it in as one of my all time favourites. However it does not mean that l ignore the historical inaccuracies of the film. And reading many of the reviews on this site, it is clear that many people seem to gain their grasp of history from films and television and not from the facts as we know them. So l will try to help a few of you out there. This is what l had manged to find out about William Wallace after being inspired by the film. Both my parents are Scot's and often spoke to me about Wallace long before any film. It appears to many Scot's (like my parents) that Wallace continues to be an inspiration for an independent 'Scotland' and his struggle (like all for Freedom) captures the hearts of many. But most Scot's that l know, my parents included, have no real desire to be independent of England, in fact the UK has always been stronger united than separate. Wallace's inspirational achievements may well be greater than his actual achievements and this could be his greatest legacy. So some facts. 1. Wallace was born into what was believed to be a minor 'noble' family - a sort of 'county gentleman' not a Lord. However recent evidence suggests he was a game keeper or professional tracker or hunter - but certainly of lower class then previously believed. He was a lowlander! 2.Scotland and England at been at peace for over 100 years until the death of the Scotish King, Edward the 1st of England then tried to put a 'puppet' king on the throne of Scotland. Scotland said no and England invaded - Edward removed the puppet King and claimed the throne of Scotland for himself. 3. There is little known about Wallace's life before this time, but what evidence we have suggest's he was already an 'outlaw'; but seems that he did try and fight the English when ever he could after Edward took the throne of Scotland. 4. Wallace's actions seemed to be a rallying cry for many Scot's and his numbers grew - encouraged by the the Church he openly targeted English forces and administration centres. 5. At the Same time a Scotish Knight called Andrew Mornay began actions in the north of Scotland ( forces you see in the film that come down to join Wallace at the Battle of Stirling) 6. Wallace did have a wife or lover killed by the English and he did Kill the English Commander of Lanark in response ( We know this because at his trail it was one of the only recorded actions of Wallace's that was mentioned and we have documents about) 7. The Battle of Stirling was fought over a Bridge, not on an open field. 8.Wallace did invade England but not as far as York (as shownin the film) 9. He never had a relationship with the Princess of Wales as she would have only been about 4 years old at the time. 10. Wallace lost the battle of Falkirk due to the power of the English longbow and his own cavalry fleeing. (shown in the film) - however Falkirk was the first time during the middle ages that heavy cavalry had been stopped by foot soldiers. 11. Wallce went to France for several years - returned and after a few small actions was captured and killed as shown in the film; but did not shout FREEDOM at his death - sorry to say. 12. Robert the Bruce was never at Falkirk - he was 50 miles away. 13. Edward the 1st died a number of years later after Wallace, not at the same time. 14. Wallace has believed to be about 6'7"" tall and could have been as young as 20 to 24 at the Battle of Stirling.Wallce is a true hero of Scotland and his 'stepping' on to the pages of history was short but dramatic - he did inspire the nobles to fight for Scotlands freedom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
It has everything in it,"Whether u r a lover of epics,the romantic type or a music critic, this movie just does it for u.The story of William Wallace is exciting but tragic yet inspirational.

It is suddenly thrust upon his self as the love of his life is openly murdered. It just starts from there & in the end, it's his death that really gives the jump start that the Scots need. When they r torturing him in at the end, the fact that he never screams..is just so... frightening in a heroic way.

I wish more movies like this would be produced. The battle scenes were exciting, the storyline was fantastic, and throughout this three hour movie, there was never a point of which I was bored. The only thing that I can say that is negative about this movie is that it could've been made into a 2, 2 1/2 hour movie.

The scenery is absolutely brilliant and there is a decent enough score to go along with it. The movie is not entirely accurate however and leaves some important details out though it does not take away from the enjoyment of the film, unless of course accuracy in movies really matters to you.

The little known actors in supporting roles were all superb and intense in what could have easily become a bore of a movie. What makes this film so great is it's attention to detail, and to the many facets of William Wallace.

"They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!!!","Braveheart (1995) is a first time watch for me, but this is a movie I've heard of for years. Now I understand that people have complained and criticized this movie for it's historical inaccuracy, but for me I'm willing to forgive all those mistakes because this movie was truly epic.Positives for Braveheart (1995):
Now I have to give it to Mel Gibson for his phenomenal directing here and while I know people don't want to acknowledge him now for obvious reasons, I've always had respect for what he has contributed to the world of cinema. Regardless of that, Gibson still does a fantastic job at getting the audience to feel the epic atmosphere of the story. I also have to say that Mel Gibson does an excellent job with his performance as William Wallace who is easily one of the greatest movie characters in the history of cinema. For a movie on the verge of 3-hours long, Gibson does a great job with the pacing and the three act movie structure. I really enjoyed the cast of characters and the banter between them throughout the movie. I was also very surprised by the amount of humor here and it worked for me. The action sequences are epic and I appreciate how brutal they are. And finally, I liked that the movie ends without telling us what happened and it allows the audience to form their own ending.Overall, Braveheart (1995) is a true epic in every way possible and I'm surprised that this movie did win some awards at Oscars because they were well deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Unwatchable,"Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and one of the few I couldn't even finish. After five minutes, my partner and I began to mutter to ourselves about the sloppy editing, ridiculous dialogue, and wretched performances (it's probably best not to cast child actors who can't control their facial muscles). At ten minutes, mutters had become outraged snorts and laughter - couldn't the editor have even *tried* to sync the piper's fingers with the terribly unrealistic pipe music? At 15, right after he said, ""Look! It's the ghost of Basil Rathbone!"", we turned it off, figuring that if they didn't have the sense to edit out the crap by that point (admittedly, by then eliminating what sucked would have involved a totally different script, editor, and actors, and about 12 minutes less film), they never would.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Spectacular Yet Simplistic Ode to Freedom,"The most striking and memorable aspects of Braveheart are its meticulous production design and timeless score. While the political maneuvering in the storyline feels a bit naive, and the clashes between the two main characters come off as overly simplistic, the lead performance by Mel Gibson is steady and powerful. The rallying cries in the first half of the film might lack some of the grandeur and impact they had 30 years ago, but the final moments-those iconic shouts for freedom-still resonate deeply, leaving a lasting impression.There's no denying that Braveheart is a commercial masterpiece, deserving of all the praise and accolades it has received over the years. However, the film's relentless, almost mechanical repetition of the word ""freedom"" and its slogan-like declarations can't help but feel limiting. The protagonist's understanding of freedom seems stagnant, never evolving or deepening despite the trials and tribulations he faces. This makes the story come across more like the naive imagination and fantastical adventure of a 20-year-old rather than the grounded, heartfelt journey of a steadfast hero who stays true to his beliefs through life's joys and sorrows.That said, the film's epic battle scenes and sweeping landscapes are undeniably impressive, even by today's standards. The sheer scale of the production is awe-inspiring, and the emotional weight of the story-though somewhat simplistic-still manages to tug at the heartstrings. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to stand up and cheer, even if you're aware of its flaws.In the end, Braveheart is a film that succeeds more on spectacle and emotion than on depth or nuance. It's a rousing tale of rebellion and sacrifice, but its portrayal of freedom feels more like a rallying cry than a profound exploration. For all its grandeur, the movie leaves you with the sense that it's more about the myth of a hero than the reality of his struggle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Overlong and overrated,"Solid flick but nowhere near as good as epics such as Gladiator or 300. Mel Gibson is simply irritating as William Wallace and, although the battle sequences are undeniably awesome, the majority of the film is far too drawn out and the ridiculous run time makes it difficult to maintain concentration throughout. I did enjoy the film immensely but I have given it such a low rating due to its wasted potential to be like some of my favourite films of all time, and despite only being from 1995 it already feels incredibly dated like a film from the eighties or even seventies may. Enjoyable performances from Sons of Anarchy's Tommy Flanagan and James Cosmo, as well as a personal favourite Brendan Gleeson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Passion Of William Wallace,"Mel Gibson won a couple of Oscars with this super production which recreates the battles between England and Scotland in the Middle Age and the life-story of one of the Scottish leaders: William Wallace (Mel Gibson, of course). I won't deny that ""Braveheart"" is just spectacular, and the battle sequences are so exciting (they did a great work there), but did this movie REALLY deserve all those prizes? Well, it is kinda grandiloquent (those images filmed from 2 or 3 helicopters of Wallace on the top of a mountain!! It reminded me of those excessive clips from Guns N'Roses), demagogic, and Gibson's character seems to be a premonition of that long-suffering Jesus Christ from ""The Passion"". Anyway, though it isn't as important as ""Spartacus"" or ""Ran"" (two of the best battle-related movies of all time) it certainly has some appeal, and you don't get bored even though the movie length is up to 3 hours.PD: Scottish landscapes are just amazing.*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Should Hollywood rewrite history ?,"This film won the Best Picture award in 1995. William Wallace is deeply in love with his childhood sweetheart who is then 	  slain by the English.

This is a very 	  Hollywood version of the history - Some things are ignored, some things are changed and some things are just made up.

A great film - But lousy research,"I love this film; don't get me wrong - it's great! I'm a medieval freak, and so I enjoy the battles and the milieu and all that. And I like the Scottish people and their humour. However, I am very disappointed that so many historical factual errors have been made. Of course, you cannot get it all right - and some things have to be adjusted to please audiences and keep a red thread and in order to make a great film. BUT: There are several things that could have been done historically correct. For instance, the Battle of Stirling. Why not include the bridge as it was essential to the outcome of the battle? What's the point of the intimate relationship between the future Princess of Wales and Wallace? Seeing as she was just a little girl at the time it doesn't make much sense to invent this relationship. And the sacking of York - what's the purpose of inventing this? Not being in control of Scotland would be serious enough for Edward to send the army north. Besides, a rebel army such as this would not be able to lay siege to a walled town like York at this time.My main point is: If film makers think that the story or themes are most important then they should leave historical figures alone and invent their own. Of course, they may include historic events and persons, but they should not form the core of a fictional venture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Good film,"Good historical film. Wallace's revolution was set in motion, with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact, the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace, by comparison, is a man of honor, incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland,' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles, submitted to Edward I, King of England, he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throne-Robert, the Earl of Bruce-to whom he confided , 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.'

The same thing is with recent ""Troy"" movie - yes, the battle scenes look good, but you cannot feel them. When you watch ""LOTR"" or ""Troy"" you are more likely to say ""Wow!"" than ""Oh my God!"".

Good historical film,"I agree with everyone on the history of the Welsch invaders and the Scots rulers in 1656. Edward I, ""Longshanks,"" is reputed to have been one of the most ruthless rulers of England. He died two years after the death of Wallace. That was a year before his son married Isabella of France. So, all the parts of the film about her, Longshanks and Edward II are pure fiction. An Encyclopedia Britannica article reports that Edward II may have had relations with men as well as other women and his wife. The Scots under Wallace did invade and conquer parts of northern England, but they did not get as far south as York as shown in the film. After the major defeat at Falkirk, which the movie shows, Wallace disappeared for four years on the continent. He returned to Scotland and resumed his fighting when he was captured. Wallace's execution is one thing that the movie shows accurately - but much less graphically than it actually was. We don't know what was said, of course, but the manner and method of his execution is accurate with recorded details. Perhaps we should have seen more of it to realize the gore and horror of English punishment in that time. After his trial on August 23, 1305, he was stripped naked and dragged through the city by a horse. He then was hung, then disemboweled, then beheaded, and finally drawn and quartered. His head was mounted on London Bridge for a time and his limbs were sent to the four corners of Britain for display and deterrence against revolt. Still, history records that the Scots has the last word with the ensuring victories that established their independence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Great Film, Pure Fiction","Undoubtedly a brilliant film to watch, engaging throughout and exciting until the end, but also one of the most inaccurate films ever. It cannot be avoided, every element of the film had some fiction stuffed in for cinematic sake, whether it be characters, locations, attire, relationship, timelines, everything is put in to generate that excitement. In so many cases it is entirely unnecessary though, the foundations for the plot are interesting enough, and for Scots parts may just be plain insulting. Robert the Bruce is not done justice in Braveheart, but thankfully is portrayed better a couple decades later in Outlaw King.Despite all that, if considered a fictional film (and completely disregard any suggestion of accurate portrayals of historical Scottish figures) then it is pretty great. The speeches are stirring, the battles are full of bloodshed, and the line between good and evil is simple. Perhaps some of the characters become pantomime versions of themselves (Edward II), but it makes it very easy for an audience to know who they are rooting for.There are some fairly glaring goofs, and Gibson's accent is all over the place, but there is good reason for this film being so famous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Hoots Toots Och Aye Da Nooo!!!,"William Wallace was a hero, whose story lapsed into obscurity for the more famous Robert the Bruce (who liberated Scotland from the English). Because of the lack of historical detail this story is obviously going to a fabrication. A broad, romanticized story of an individual leading many to fight for freedom.Well directed by Mel Gibson, with perhaps too much time spent on the battle scenes (which were not very accurate and never really explained the truth about how the Scottish beat the English....basically it was about using methods from Roman times that were effective but had fallen into disuse in an era when war was about making sure only the peasants died and the Noble's wore so much armour they couldn't fight properly, but they wouldn't get hurt either).Instead of worrying about facts, Wallace becomes the idea of freedom and this what makes the movie brilliant. Along with the drama, romance, humour, fun fight scenes and dark violence the movie is above average.However it stumbles in a number of places, making it less than perfect, but not so that it matters unless you want to watch it often.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Oustanding acting and,"This is a wonderful movie to watch again and again. It has a plot that is interesting to follow, and the action is intense and believable. Mel Gibson displays his romantic and heroic side in a way that really touches me. He is truly talented and is very remarkable in this film. The entire supporting cast really brings a lot of belief into the movie as well. One aspect of the movie that held my interest is how we are able to see William's character as an innocent child and as a grown man whose fate becomes that of a hero. This is a widely viewed movie, but if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to check it out and see if it appeals to your taste. It's serious, emotional, and powerful!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best Film Ever..After 13 years..,"Well is it still relevant to write a my personal view of this film after 13 years? 13 years ago this film was shown on the cinema in UK (I was studying there at the time). All my girlfriends said it is a great movie. Ahhh I think they are all just saying that as they are Mel's fan. And I thought when they said the movie is great, my expectation will be high & I'll be disappointed.Yet after watching the movie at the cinema, I was wrong...and they were right. I even purchase the original movie soundtracks. When I went back to my hometown I bough it's VCD...and later DVD. I've lost count how many times I watched this movie over & over again. Almost memorized most of the powerful dialogs of WW characters. Not knowing the movies is about Scotland legend then, I was hoping his follower will resque WW during the tourching scene.. Also been to Scotland & saw the WW sword replica that has been used in the movie.After 13 years I still can't forget WW (Mel) face expression when the traitor revealed was Robert D'Bruce. That alone should win Mel as best actor in the Oscar that year.Yup maybe some floss in the historical (but who does really know the actual event?) & editing but it won't stop to make this movie to be best movie ever for me.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
