Beautifully Defines An Era On The Backdrop Of A Realistic Class Study and Dynamic Music,"Although it may seem dated and cheesy to some viewers today Saturday Night Fever remains one of the most underrated examples of '70s pop-culture. It is undoubtedly the quintessential dance flick and remains one of the most entertaining films of all-time. Yet, behind all the music and entertaining aura you are actually viewing a drama studying the American class system and young rebellion. Though at times it is slightly exaggerated, it still manages to capture a vast amount of authenticity and ultimately the sights and sounds of the time.Saturday Night Fever follows self-proclaimed ""dance king"" Tony Manero (John Travolta) and his love of dancing and the trials and tribulations of his life in the Bronx. He soon meets an arrogant fellow dancer named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Quickly becoming attracted and influenced by the women he starts questioning the way he lives his life.The film is not always upbeat and at times can be depressing, particularly the scenes depicting peer-pressure. Although both have their differences, both are very alike and ultimately want to be something ""big"". There are also the elements of jealously, rivalry, religion, rebellion, respect and racism added into the film. This captures the realism of the time and with more accuracy and honesty than a lot of films. Just take a look at the brief scene where Tony is on the tube, this is an oddly poignant, effecting and compelling scene presenting Tony's confused emotions.Saturday Night Fever still carries the vibe, rhythm and atmosphere it did back in '77. It remains one of the most influential films for both the film-world and pop-culture. Infamously holding some of the greatest dance sequences ever committed film; you can feel the energy, emotions, time and determination that were spent perfecting the dance scenes to the finest detail. The lighting is perfect at creating the ""disco world"", the set-piece of the 2001 Disco is one of the film's many iconic highlights.John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the ""strut"" in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being ""cool"". All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
There's no denying it...,"... this is a product of my generation. I was the age that Travolta's character Tony was in 1977, although in a completely different part of the US. Probably the disco era is the only one in the history of film in which people in street clothes look like they are going to a costume party. The pointy collars, the shoes, the hair so full of hairspray that it looks like it would shatter if it brushed up against something, and those jackets that are so full of holes - big ones - they look like they were attacked by moths and why are we calling them jackets anyways?So Tony (Travolta) is a New York City born and bred Italian American with only a high school education, an employee at a dead end job - selling and mixing paint - in a store that is now extinct - the neighborhood hardware store that is about to get replaced by the big box hardware stores such as Harbor Freight. Dad is used to being the head of the family, but now he has been laid off in middle age. Suddenly Edith is talking back and disrespecting Archie and he doesn't like it one bit. And the only thing that makes Tony feel alive is Saturday nights on the dance floor of the local disco where he is the best.And then he meets a girl - Stephanie. She is everything that I, a Texan, was told that New Yorkers are - loud mouthed, self important, snooty. And yet Tony follows her around like a puppy because he is in love. Annette (Donna Pescow) follows Tony around like a puppy because she is in love. It's funny how Tony doesn't like how Stephanie treats him, yet he turns around and treats Annette the same way. But Tony turns out to be much more self aware than you would think. And Stephanie - there is much more to her story than her being just another stuck up Manhattanite.There is so much casual sex going on here that it answers the question ""Where did herpes come from?"". But it is so much more than glittering disco balls. it is a love story. A story of a guy learning about the friendship component of love. It is a tragedy. It is a story of young people at a crossroads. And last but not least, it has probably one of the great soundtracks in motion picture history and gave the Bee Gees a second act. I'd highly recommend it. Just try to ignore your probable first reaction ""Yikes those clothes!!!!"""".",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It has it's moments of absolute glory,"Saturday Night Fever is thoughtful, engaging, and sometimes brilliant. While some might call it one of the greatest films ever, I must disagree. But along the lines of a groundbreaker, yes it is.  The film does for disco what Suburbia did for punk.  And the film gives John Travolta, the cool Italian guy from Engelwood, NJ a good break.  He plays a paint guy who at nights (and sometimes days) has a love for dancing, which he is absolutely excellent at (those dance scenes are quite memorable).  Not always on the money, but when it is, it delivers the goods.  Bee Gees provide songs here that everybody likes (I would have to assume from Wayne Campbell's statement in Wayne's World).

Living Vicariously Through the Weekends.,"An uneducated Brooklyn teen (John Travolta, in an Oscar-nominated role) lives in a dream world over the weekends as the king of a disco dance floor. Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time. Travolta is a revelation in arguably his greatest role. The other players are adequate and the screenplay is deceptively smarter than it appears on the surface. The movie also works as a time capsule to a part of contemporary American history where discos and bell-bottoms were all the rage. Still one of the finer films of the time period. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Music
"Clunky at times, but also iconic.","I first watched this as a teenager and I just thought Tony was a cool guy doing cool things, Annette was a stupid piece of ass and Stephanie was classy. I realized there were subplots like Frank and Bobby C's story but most of that went over my head.As I've been rewatching this from time to time over the decades, I now see there is a lot more there. It's actually pretty nihilistic, the family drama is reasonably intricate, as is the love story. On top of that, it's an interesting view on 1970's NYC, perhaps not in the same league as Midnight Cowboy or Taxi Driver, but nevertheless sharing an origin. At times, it's as gritty and dark as these two films.The music is stellar and the disco scenes are iconic. Not a masterpiece as it sometimes is cringeworthy and shallow, but on the whole it's a culturally important piece of film history.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A film about a dumb guy whose shallowness reaches amazing depths!,"I think that your opinion about Saturday NIGHT FEVER may have a lot to do with your age. People who were of age during the Disco Age probably will love it. Older or younger people may feel less impressed. As for me, I was rather young during this disco craze and thought that the gold chains and unbuttoned polyester shirts were all pretty tacky--so the film doesn't hold the same wonderful nostalgic memory it might for others--though I will admit that I liked the music (yes, folks, it's true--I am so uncool that I actually like disco).As for the film, it is unusual in structure in that much of it is like a very prolonged music video. While this sort of film is more common today, in 1977 it must have been revolutionary to have such a meandering film that isn't always plot-driven. What was also unusual is that unlike most films, the main character is amazingly stupid and shallow--his friends are even worse. For Tony Manero (John Travolta), what matters most to him in life is his hair, his clothes and disco--and little else. As for his friends, their priorities would be drugs, sex, date rape, driving like idiots and disco. Not exactly a group of Einsteins, eh? This is a problem for folks like me, as I have a hard time really getting into a picture if I don't like anyone. My only emotional connection was feeling sad for the desperate women with low self-esteem that actually cared about this shallow guy or his obnoxious friends. Otherwise, I just didn't care about what happened to anyone--including his slap-happy family!While it probably sounds like I hated the film, there were some things I did like or at least respect. As I mentioned above, the music was nice--with one of the best soundtracks in movie history. While no one today admits to liking disco (other than nuts like me), it did produce the biggest-selling soundtracks in history. Plus, while I didn't love all the dancing, I sure could respect all the work that went into choreographing it and making it look so effortless. What Travolta and the rest did to get ready for the film is incredible. I just wish, however, that the film was less like the prolonged music video and was more plot-driven at times or had greater importance than ""who will be Tony's new dance partner?""! Of course, this shallowness might actually be a great metaphor for the era--an era typified by loud clothes, drugs, sex without consequences and Studio 54.Overall, an interesting time capsule hindered by characters that are mostly low-lifes and co-dependents.At one point in the film, Tony muses ""there are ways of killing yourself without killing yourself"". Wow, such amazing depth to his utter shallowness!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I Don't See Anyone Givin You A Raise Down At Unemployment,"I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the ""Edited For Television"" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.""Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere."" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his ""station in life"" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Modern, and Misunderstood, Classic","While the movie is more apt to be recalled for its impact on American pop culture, few who watch the movie will ever see beyond the admittedly fantastic dance sequences.  As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.While his quick study under Denny Terrio for those dance sequences showed a great deal of determination, Travolta's Tony Manero shines in so many other way.  The looks of embarrassment and exasperation that his character expresses when confronted with the possibility of working in a Bay Ridge paint store all of his life, or the prejudice and regional chauvinism of his friends, or the behavior of his friends at White Castle or his initial inability to express himself to Stephanie in any way that might impress her, all of these and more contribute to a fully realized character.While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence.  While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.Forget those who call this a musical.  While the music is an intricate part of the film and setting, Travolta's performance is what sets this film apart.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Proof that disco does not suck or is dead,"Will openly admit to having very fond memories of school discos, singing along (often forgetting words) and dancing (with some energy if not such a discernible beat) to music, a music college graduate has to start somewhere, that was great then and still is now.'Saturday Night Fever' may not be a perfect film, or a masterpiece, but to me and many others it is high-energy and hugely enjoyable entertainment that took me back to nostalgic, and happier, times in my life. This was the late 90s-early 2000s, just to make things clear, memories of the 70s are none due to not having been born yet. 'Saturday Night Fever' is one of those films where it is easy to sit back and forget any problems and relax after a hard day (am hardly any stranger to those, so 'Saturday Night Fever' was a much needed distraction).There are imperfections sure. Anybody looking for one of the all-time great scripts or a great story and iconic characters better look elsewhere. This said, the script is not all bad, but does have some cheesiness that will make one cringe, regardless of whether they are demanding much or not. The story and characterisation is somewhat more patchy though better than given credit for, the story does absorb but a couple of the subplots are silly and don't feel as resolved as they should, particularly that for the rival gang.One of 'Saturday Night Fever's' biggest problems is how the character of Stephanie is written and how Karen Lynn Gorney plays her. The character is very underwritten and often very annoying, giving Gorney little to do and failing to inject much charm or likability, outside of some great dancing.However, the production values are great with lots of glorious colour and style. John Bradham directs with a clear affectionate love for the period and subject, and the film does offer a more complex view of disco than one might think with some easy to relate to themes.Best assets are the music, dancing and John Travolta. The soundtrack, with some of the most memorable contributions being from the Bee Gees, is one of the best, most unforgettable and iconic soundtracks of any film from the 70s, and great music in its own right. Music is a real passion and something that is always talked about in my prolific reviews here, and something that mostly garners a lot of praise but have also been known to be picky. The dancing is full of high-octane energy, snazz and pizazz, Travolta especially though the dancing is the best thing about Gorney's performance.John Travolta is a revelation in the role that made him an overnight star and pop-culture icon. Danny from 'Grease' may be the slightly more famous role but to me Travolta is better here.In conclusion, very enjoyable though not without its imperfections. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Decaf Scorcese with unlikeable characters. Good dancing though.,"Okay, I was into punk not disco back in 1977, and held off seeing this movie on ideological grounds for many years. Perhaps if I'd seen it during its heyday it would have carried more weight, but when disengaged from the giddy heights of the disco era it does not travel well. This is basically 'Scorcese lite'; a sort of 'Mean Streets' done for teens, and missing out almost everything which made Scorcese's work so compelling. The viewer is faced with a parade of characters so stupid, self-centred and under-developed that it is virtually impossible to bond with any of them. Tony Manero is an idiot and his friends are even more moronic, whilst the girls are doormats (nice-but-dim Annette) or emotionally distant egotists (brash big-talking Stephanie). Add to this some downright unfathomable casting; Martin Shakar looks more like Tony's uncle than his brother (seriously, he looks a good ten years older) and whilst cast as Tony's crucial dance partner, Karen Lynn Gorney's ability is conspicuously 'school lunchtime disco'. Check the bit at the dance studio where she and Tony converse whilst she's practicing; it looks like she's been learning to dance for all of twenty minutes. Having said that, the dance scenes themselves are the high point of the movie, even if they are all Tony's show. In fact, there is an uncomfortable strand of narcissism and outright homo-eroticism to 'SNF' which is all in keeping with the essentially non-macho disco scene. With its falsetto vocals, elaborate studio-bound arrangements and invariably sex-obsessed lyrics, the music was made by producers, not neighbourhood bands, and the emphasis was on glitter and flash, not grit and trash. The dance scene's flamboyant, exhibitionist nature was far more in-tune with 'gay' sensibilities than the world of rock music, and so it was that disco suffered a boom-and-bust popularity over the late 1970s. 'Straight' society briefly sampled what the movement had to offer and then moved on to more gender-friendly cultural climes. By 1979 it was all over, and 'new wave' music was all the rage. Considerations of personal taste aside, 'SNF' is less than the sum of its parts, clumsily realised with characters who come far too close to being repellent without any redemptive qualities. It is all too apparently a vehicle for John Travolta, who served notice with his performance that his entire career would be based on slight variations on his 'Vinnie Barbarino' character from 'Welcome Back Kotter'. He struts solipsistically through 'SNF' wearing the exact same expression you see staring blankly back at you from a fish-shop window. Away from the dance floor, he could not carry the movie, which is a massive weak point since none of the other characters are as extensively written. By all means watch 'SNF' for nostalgia, for the dancing or the music or the actors, but not as a movie experience, because you will be disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" - Tony Manero.","I love this movie.I love the way it focuses on dancing, yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes, long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor, but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle: Trying to escape from your boring daily routine, even if it is just for an hour.That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store, then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint, where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking cliché. In a sad sort of way, it's true.But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin: ""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime."" ""Saturday Night Fever"" is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way, Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.""Saturday Night Live's"" theme tune, ""Staying Alive"" (the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel), speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. ""I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me, I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me yeah"" chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now, I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song, and for good reason.I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But ""Saturday Night Fever"" makes me feel as if I had--and that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon, and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. (In the Travolta film ""Get Shorty,"" a criminal threatens a producer by saying that, if he doesn't pay up, he'll be ""dead as disco."" Ironic.)Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero, a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fame--as brief as it may be--and the most obvious theme of the film, which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey, a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantly-waxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that, he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.Part of this movie is learning to grow up, and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plots--the other is, of course, trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background, and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son, who became a priest, and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son, and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from $3 to $4, his father tells him that $4 can't even buy $3. His son swears at him and storms away.Some of my favorite scenes in ""Saturday Night Live"" are the human ones, such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror, bare-chested, and combs his hair forever, looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" scene in ""Taxi Driver,"" released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from ""Serpico"" and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. (Just think, Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo, yet he was, in a way, in the first film, too.)I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family. He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work, but after working for quite some time on his now-out-of-date hairstyle, he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner (in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh). He yells at him: ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" I know that scene has been quoted before, but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard.In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie, and certainly one of the most touching, Tony has lunch with an older girl (who later becomes his dance partner) and tries to impress her by acting mature. But his immaturity shines through--he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time, and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower. In a way, this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were.This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbers--I love them, and I probably shouldn't. As for the right reasons...I think we already know what they are. It's all about dreams. Everyone has some. Whether it's dancing or whatever, we all have dreams. And that's why I think ""Saturday Night Fever"" relates to so many different people on so many different levels.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hard to hate this film,"I finally got around to watching Saturday Night Fever and I liked it. The film has one of the most iconic opening sequences to a film I have ever seen. John Travolta is the epitome of charm and style in this film. He captures and owns every scene he is in with his charisma and unique looks.The plot is another story. It is not all bad as one can see a degree of realism. Poor or simple neighborhoods are shown and the main cast do not shy away from foul language. They almost come across as a small gang and Tony is their leader. The characters have depth and are not superficial. There is some story, strong emotions and issues they need to deal with. Ultimately Tony is a young man trying to find himself and find something more. This is why he is taken by the stuck up Stephanie. I feel if the story was rewritten with more depth and a stronger story then this could have become one of greatest films of all time. The other elements already existed: incredible music from the Bee Gees, strong talent from Travolta and a favorable setting.One can see why this film became famous. The music is a hit on its own. The Bee Gee's released some of their timeless and wonderful music as the soundtrack to this film. This ushered in the era of disco and dancing. Saturday Night Fever was a cultural phenomenon and a big hit for its time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Gritty urban tale,"1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music scene. How ironic then that the final number one single in the U.S. of that year was Debbie Boone's ""You light up my life"". While I think that the punk movement has never been well documented in film fiction, the more popular and mainstream disco culture had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was Saturday Night Fever (SNF).The snag is that SNF was NOT a disco movie. Yes, it had dazzling dance sequences, yes, it had a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes were shot in a disocteque, but I have always felt that the disco theme was peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the acceptance and sanctuary they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, Nik Cohn's article on which the film was based (and which he later admitted was faked), ""Tribal rites of the new Saturday night"" would have been a more apposite title. John Travolta perfectly captures this. As Tony Manero he almost ritually prepares himself for his night out, preening himself in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and then escaping the drudgery of his existence to his battleground, the local disco where he is the tribal chief.Gritty, foulmouthed and somewhat downbeat, SNF starkly presented the darker underbelly of the disco subculture.",,Anonymous,Music
Great but unsatisfying.,"I wasn't a fan of ""Saturday Night Fever"" when it first came out in the theaters. I was under a lot of pressure. I was a fifteen year old member of the ""Disco Sucks"" club. I secretly liked the songs (I couldn't tell anyone) but the movie never hit the spot. Watching it now, the music is terrific but the movie is still not that satisfying a watch. What kills this movie for me are characters. Sure Tony is a sympathetic character but the others are mostly awful. I'm not a prude but if I was of Italian decent, I would ban this movie in my my house. The negative Italian stereotypes are over the top. They're just too much at times. That said, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is definitely worth watching. It's wildly uneven but often terrific fimmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than what most people would expect of the stereotype,"Travolta's potential as an actor is seen in this film more than any other. Sure, he was good in Pulp Fiction, but this film shows that he has potential for more range.As for the movie itself, I think there is more to the movie than just disco moves and acting like hoodlums.  Tony (Travolta) is your average Italian generation joe who has conflicts about whether he should be sticking around the usual gang of crude friends or try for better.  Along the way, many other topics are hit upon.Now let's face it...the dancing and the music are the highlights.  Even if you hate disco, you'll be amazed by Travolta's moves that made the Pulp Fiction moves look like granny steps.  And the songs are just classics.If you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely rent it.  It should be a rite of passage, just like watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail in college and Caddyshack in high school.  And do get the R version (the PG versions is for wusses).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A masterpiece from the greatest era of American cinema.,"There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it (see some user comments). Personally I can't understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes, and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it, or appreciate it. However, at the risk of sounding like a dick, I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do; that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell, this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man, Tony Manero, from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor, basking in the glow of the disco ball, and the frivolous, moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub, Stephanie Modano, played by an underrated Karen Lynn-Gorney, who is equal to him in dance ability, and, more importantly, in desiring a better life. The two struggle together, and against each other, in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.A simple story yes. One you've seen before yes. But after that, there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta, as Tony, was in his prime, giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who can't relate to a character who is so honest, so cool, so goofy, so conflicted; who has talent but doesn't get recognized by the people who should recognize him, like his family, only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of us!The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made, in terms of making you feel joyous, and impervious to the world's problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees, as well as others, it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.John Badham's direction is even; giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits, yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But it's never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic, comedic, exhilirating, and pensive, and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.In the end, literally as well as figuratively, Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support; someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is, even if they can't be lovers. Simple, realistic, beautiful. The 70's was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese, Coppola, Lucas, Spielberg, Badham, and so forth had for a decade or so, the ability to make truly visionary films; in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure, political correctness, marketing tie-ins, and big budget, sensory offending, special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.Attention younger viewers, don't let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isn't a ""cheesy film"" with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that ""sucks"". It is as good a film as you'll see, if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it ""sucked"". John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor, and the story really does have depth.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
BeeGees Fever!,"Knocking this off my list of films I'd never seen and I kinda wish I'd watched it earlier. Sadly, coming to it now the story of a talented young man from the wrong side of the tracks and watching him make mistake after mistake on the road to self-discovery has been done so many times that its hard to really invest in this one, even if it does play an archetypal role in others.That said, the music is spectacular. Travolta really can dance and it is hard to imagine this movie being anything without him in it. The ending is something as well, a strong comment on cultural norms and his characters growth. Unfortunately, it's not until that end that I'm invested in anything more than the groovy voodoo of the soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Blue Collar frustration,"Watched Saturday Night Fever again last night. It's one of those movies I watch everytime it's on & never get bored by it. This movie perfectly captures the feeling of everyday life in a Blue Collar neighborhood, & the frustration that goes with it. Your caught in the middle not rich by any means, but just getting by & the feeling that your never going to get beyond it. Just existing and getting by is an everyday struggle & in this movie it shows how disco is an outlet. I remember 2001 Odyessy was a real club in Brooklyn. Saturday Night Fever is one of those rare movies you can watch & just enjoy yourself. How can you get tired of watching John Travolta walking down the street with a paint can? That opening captured your attention right from the start. You know where these characters are coming from. Tony's friends have basically given up on doing any better & have accepted there fate. Tony & Stephanie know there's something more out there for them & their going for it the best way they can. By the end of the movie I'm rooting for them to ""make it big"".  Being a big John Travolta fan I am a little bit biased. I'll watch anything he's in. '",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Brilliant - Changed my Life,"Watched this as a 15 year old in 1977 at the local cinema - and like many of my friends it was a watershed moment in my life. Opened our eyes to a whole new world - nightclubs, disco music, women, dreams - there was a whole world out there which we;d never seen. In my small town, mobile discos sprouted everywhere - and we all wanted to be John Travolta....and it was one of the catalysts for me to leave home and explore the world.Watched it again last night, and as a 50 year old it all came flooding back - melancholia obviously setting in because I felt like a 15 year old again - the memories came flooding back. And whilst some of the movie is obviously dated, it still after all these years gives a sense of joy, hope, youth and dreams. The opening scenes are timeless classics, the music is still sensational, and the film really does have some great characters and some brilliant sub plots.Stil magic - a timeless classic, and personally probably the most influential film I ever saw.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me.""","This cult disco movie, which made Travolta a star, talks about growing up in the working class and attempts to escape from mediocrity and pointlessness of everyday life, even if only on a Saturday night. The main character finds sanctuary in a discotheque, where he's undisputed king of the dance floor. Through film permeate many of the problems typical of the lower middle class, as well as disturbed relations between the sexes that are particularly noticeable in this environment. Although music and dance occupy a large part of the film, the ""Saturday Night Fever"" exudes the atmosphere of hopelessness. Travolta gave an excellent performance, and the soundtrack is one of the best ever, but the overall impression is relatively weak. The film is good, but not nearly up to its reputation.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Travolta shows his moves,"""Saturday Night Fever"" is a 1977 musical drama directed by John Badham starring John Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney.
⚪
All in all, this opalescent character study easily takes to the floor and moves elegantly to a feverish beat, and even if it cools down at some times, it brings a lot of heat with it and also doesn't fail to explores the few shadows the glittering and shining lights of the disco ball casts, all lead by a young Travolta at his peak form. I came across this film after I have watched Travolta's more popular dance romance ""Grease"" and was instantly intrigued by the premise, as it promised some solid drama. In the end, it wasn't even as mediocre as others said, but not as brilliant either. Nevertheless, it managed to portray the conflict I was hoping to see properly: A young man who struggles with his family and anxiety for future and dances in order to cut out all of his problems. Travolta plays the teenage main character, nineteen-year-old Italo-American Tony Manero convincingly and superbly conveys this inner dilemma of escapism and the fears and desires it entails. To be honest, Travolta is in general an underrated artist, I mean, he can sing, dance and act, sometimes all at once - and in this film he shows two of his skills wonderfully. Underlined by the immortal and agitating soundtrack by The Bee Gees, most prominently ""Stayin' Alive"", he turns in some remarkable performances and nails all the choreographies apparently effortlessly. It is no understatement when I say that he is literally the king of the dance floor in here and sets it on fire with his moves. The contrast between his bleak family life and his own kind of heaven shows to advantage as well and conveys some unexpected dark subtones. For example, when he meets the mature and intelligent Stephanie, he is reminded of his own hopelessness and how far he is away from being an adult himself. All those undeniably serious topics are included as well, but what is what keeps me from bestowing this flick a higher rating? Well, the dialogue and plot are the problem. The majority of spoken lines are utterly cheesy, and some scenes are extremely lengthy and should have ended on the floor of the editing room. Travolta was the only reason that they were somewhat bearable. His character is the centre of this atmospheric tale and the reason it is so fascinating in the first place, because he in fact develops wonderfully throughout. With the done hair and the countless stylish outfits he makes this coming of age drama and ode to the disco era what it is - a flawed yet extremely ambitious escapism tale that doesn't hesitate to also point out the more opaque sides of a troubled teenager and his ways to cope with reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A decent time capsule,"As infrequently as some oldies tunes happen to pop up on the radio, there was a time when that's all it was believe it or not. During the 1970s, the wave of disco joints multiplied by the day. Besides the 1960s and 1970s promoting peace and love, it also became a time where dancing was the ""in"" thing to do. Everybody was doing it. It was a craze that took a nation by storm where all people wanted to do was party and dance. For movies, the 1970s were also a time of many successes that have created quite an impact on today's culture and society. One of the most widely popular films to be remembered from that era was Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). However for movies that capitalized on the dance wave at the time, the best known and respected film to represent such a time was this film. It does have some components that could've been left out or fixed but mostly it is an entertaining film of its time.Written by Norman Wexler (Serpico (1973)) and directed by John Badham (in his first feature film), the story is about a late teen named Tony Manero (John Travolta) who lives in a world where the only thing that matters to him is the weekend. He's a nice kid at heart and works hard but just wants live his life in the present. During the day he works at a paint shop, later he hangs with his immature goof ball friends, gets badgered by an old flame named Annette (Donna Pescow) and then has the same dinner every night with his family of high expectations. What Manero looks forward to on the weekend are the disco dances. While attending a party one night he comes across a dancer who catches his eye named Stefanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). It's at that moment Manero wants her to be his dance partner for a competition. For all the prior subplots going on around Manero, they do serve the purpose of character development but they also fall to the wayside over time.The reoccurring moral of the script is the power of choice. Everyone has a choice to be or do what he or she wants in life. Manero's family wants him to become a priest like his brother Frank (Martin Shakar). Annette gets told numerous times by Tony that she has to decide on whether she's going to act like a woman or a prostitute. Tony is also challenged on his beliefs by Stefanie and when his boss tells him to stop spending his money frivolously on the weekend. Stefanie even gets some of her own medicine thrown back at her. Tony friends are a gradual eye opener as well. Every single supporting/main character has a specific role to play when it comes to character development and it is handled properly. The problem is once the change in character occurs, the supporting threads and their respective characters disappear and aren't concluded in the most direct of ways. The only other component to the writing is some of the slang dialog used. Yes, the 1970s were a much different time. However, this still does not excuse the fact of using various racial slurs.Other than this every other aspect to the film is enjoyable. The acting is competently performed. It is a bit jarring to see the difference in years when it comes to how much John Travolta changed. Also voice-actor Paul Pape has a role as one of Tony's goof ball friends. The acting and writing also effectively capture the mood and attitude of the era. As stated before, disco was a craze at the time and many people hopped on the bandwagon just because everybody was doing it. Plus with all the issues surrounding Tony, going to the disco was also a good representation of how disco was an escapist activity for a lot of people. For the people who took part, it was a moment in time where people would forget about their troubles and just enjoy the night. The cinematography shot by Ralf D. Bode fit well with the scenes too. Bode was able to acquire a number of odd angles and establishing shots that in some ways felt like the camera was prepping the audience just as much as the scene was.The choreography handled by Lester Wilson was crafted nicely as well. A year before, Wilson worked on Sparkle (1976) which proved to be a success and it didn't change here. Wilson's ability to get the entire cast to work in synchronized motion is impressive. That and all the dance moves that Travolta and Gorney perform are well staged. It's unimaginable how much practice went into making sure those dance numbers were done the right way in one shot. That takes patience. The music for this film is practically scoreless with only a few tunes composed by David Shire. The rest was handled by English pop group The Bee Gees (Barry, Maurice & Robin Gibb). The movie itself would probably not be as memorable or popular if it weren't for the numerous songs heard throughout the background. Songs like ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""More Than a Woman"" are just some of the songs that'll stick in the viewers mind. It's also interesting to watch the dancing with these songs because of the viewers' knowledge of music, how sensual the emotions are in the performances.Unfortunately for its time it suffers from racial slurs that are still not excusable and its subplots are well written until they aren't needed anymore leading to indirect conclusions. These flaws are thankfully made up for with the abundance of character development, appropriate acting, memorable music tunes and well-staged dance choreography. It is a time capsule that defined the 1970s.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
You Should Be Dancing!,"Saturday NIGHT FEVER (1977) **** John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Joseph Cali, Barry Miller, Julie Bovasso, Val Bosoglio, Donna Pescow. Quintessential film about the Seventies' disco craze that made Travolta an American icon (Best Actor nominee) and superstar as Brooklynite Tony Manero, a free-wheelin' Italian kid who loves to dance but doesn't know what he wants from life despite his talent and some eye-opening advice from dance partner Gorney. Directed on location with gritty realism by John Badham this blockbuster features songs by the ultimate trio The Bee Gees.(My favorite: ""How Deep Is Your Love?"").

Iconic and unexpectedly dark,Saturday Night Fever is a real time capsule of a film for better and for worse. It really does capture a moment so effectively in everything from its costumes and phenomenal soundtrack to the struggles of its characters in their aimless everyday lives but it doesn't always feel in control of the darker elements as it struggles to walk the fine line between depiction and endorsement.John Travolta is fantastic in a lead performance that requires just as much from him physically as it does emotionally. It's a great role to have as the breakout moment for him since it gives him plenty to work with as he's constantly moving between highs and lows. It's a good thing that Travolta is this good since a lot of the supporting characters are thinly sketched and forgettable.John Badham's direction reels you in straight away with the iconic opening and the drama is just as essential as the more memorable dance sequences even if there's a noticeable tonal struggle towards the end as it gets really dark. The soundtrack is undoubtedly the best aspect with an endless parade of perfectly chosen hits that enhance their corresponding scenes so much they probably wouldn't be memorable without them.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Staying Alive To Jive,"Saturday Night Fever holds a special place in the hearts of all the residents of Brooklyn. Besides being the visual symbol of the disco era, it is also the best filmed recollection of the post Dodgers era of Brooklyn which sad to say is still going on.Brooklyn does not have the Dodgers any more and in fact the 2001 club is no longer there, but you can see a lot of the area that was photographed in Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton. I could even show you the places on tour.But it's the music and story of Saturday Night Fever that has made it an enduring classic. John Travolta left the sweathogs of Welcome Back Kotter and broke out as a major film star playing Tony Manero in this film. Travolta's a kid working at a paint store in a dead end job, hanging out with his dead end friends who has only one great talent going for him. On Saturday night when he goes to the 2001, he's king of the dance floor.He can get just about any girl he wants and quite a few would like him, especially Donna Pescow, but Travolta's got his eye on Karen Lynn Gorney who is of Italian background like himself, but has real career aspirations as a dancer. Travolta and Gorney agree to dance together, but John just can't let it go at that.The only Oscar that Saturday Night Fever was nominated for was John Travolta as Best Actor. He lost that year to Richard Dreyfuss in The Goodbye Girl. Travolta does a great job in playing Tony Manero, a kid who over the course of the film realizes there is a great big world out there beyond his neighborhood. A lot of things help convince him of that, his involvement with Gorney, his dancing, his dead ending friends one of whom meets with real tragedy.Special mention should go to Barry Miller playing Bobby C, one of the Travolta friends. He's such a sad case trying so desperately to belong with the crowd. They tolerate him basically because he's got the car and he takes the gang where they want to go.The Motion Picture Academy has committed some god awful blunders in its time. But one of the worst was its total non-recognition of the music of the Gibb Brothers and the other music from Saturday Night Fever. Saturday Night Fever was incredibly not even nominated for Best Musical Score. Not one of the songs from the BeeGees and others was nominated for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture. The winner that year was You Light Up My Life, a nice song, but has never had the enduring popularity of any number of the BeeGee tunes like How Deep Is Your Love, Staying Alive, You Should Be Dancing, or Night Fever.The Brooklyn shown in Saturday Night Fever is a Brooklyn that most grew up with. Only old codgers like myself remember the Dodgers, but Saturday Night Fever is Brooklyn for the next couple of generations.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Little Film that Could...and Did,"I was NOT a fan of this film when it came out. I was a teen, and this lifestyle didn't apply to me. But in speaking with many ""twenty"" and ""thirty"" something New Yorkers at that time, they could fully identify with this film and find little bits and pieces that reflected their own lives as teens.What appealed to me the most in this film was the music and the dance scenes. John Travolta pulled this off well, slickly and is clearly one of the main reasons for looking at this film. I absolutely HATED the dance his character Tony picked for the BIG dance contest, but that is part of the charm this picture had.There is no mistaking now that this film bust discos and disco music wide open in the late 70's. Disco was made to be fun, free, expressive, fashion. And like all things that get over exposed, it died in just a few years to Punk/New Wave of the late 70's and throughout the 80's.Saturday Night Fever produced the second biggest Soundtrack of that decade (Curtis Mayfield's Superfly was the first...) with hit after blinding hit, mostly led by The Bee Gees. This was fun stuff.The movie was okay (I too feel that little Ms. Soap Opera star of that time Karen Lynn takes the film down..), but there IS something in it for everyone from the lead character Tony just trying to find his way and loving to dance, to the ""fat"" girl (I did NOT think she was all that fat, but again, that is one of the charms of this film) doing all the wrong things to get noticed, to the friends, the family and how they all intertwine on Saturday Nights to shake it all off and away...if only for a few hours. Disco or not, I think at some point in our youths, we can all identify.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautifully photographed and scored drama about repellent, repulsive people...","TV actor John Travolta shot to fame and received an Oscar nomination for his acting (and dancing) in this otherwise depressing coming-of-age story. Brooklyn kid, stifled at home and restless at work, is idolized at night when he takes over the dance-floor at the local discotheque. ""Misunderstood teens"" theme gets a real work-out here, with director John Badham and screenwriter Norman Wexler bending over backwards to make these trash-talking, uneducated, sex-obsessed goof-offs engaging and colorful. Wexler, who has his youthful subjects putting down everything worthwhile, seems to think he's actually saying something new and fresh (with Karen Lynn Gorney as the ambitious girl who is ultimately condescended to--she's made to look like a cynical sell-out). The disco music (mostly by the Bee Gees) is kinetic and alive, and was instrumental in making the film a box-office success. Travolta's solo dance number is also incredible, transcending the script and the surrounding phoniness. Followed by a 1983 sequel, ""Staying Alive"". ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I watched this film when it was first release.,Since then I have seen it on average every two years. As each decade that goes by I see it from a different angle and it portrays something different. It took me 20 years to see how good Karen Lynn Gorney was acting in her part. In fact everyone else was spot on. Three years ago while visiting New York I took a trip to Bay Ridge and went down to the Bridge and sat on that bench. The film must have made a big impression on my as I am now 67.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
Defined A Decade. But Still Not For Everyone.,"John Travolta broke away from tv and into film by playing a young dancer from Brooklyn. Following ""Saturday Night Fever,"" Travolta became one of Hollywood's biggest stars, even during his dry patch in the 80s.Travolta play Tony Manero. Not even twenty-years-old, Tony always looks forward to hanging out with his friends and going to the ""2001 Odyssey""--the hottest disco joint in town. Tony works at a paint store, which he doesn't mind, but he always tries to dodge his low-class family. Tony is aimless and doesn't really have an outlook on life except to dance in the disco whenever he gets the chance.The family and romance stuff is where the movie makes an effort to become more than just a dance flick. Tony's father has been unemployed for months, and his seemingly perfect older brother just quit the priesthood. The whole Italian family from New York has been done and it is passable here, but nothing huge.Tony meets a serious dancer named Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). The romance isn't too bad, but Tony is very selfish and immature, so it's hard to fully invest time in it. There isn't as much chemistry as you would hope for. She's serious, he isn't, and it just stays that way.""Saturday Night Fever"" will forever be best remembered for its musical element. The legendary opening features John Travolta walking through the streets of Brooklyn while 'Stayin' Alive' by the Bee Gees are playing. Countless other disco songs play while they are at the nightclub and the dancing becomes alive. I am no dancer, but the scenes at the club are extraordinarily made. The lights and the cameras are all very impressive. And as a non-dancer, I can assure you the dancing is good too.To me, ""Saturday Night Fever"" will never be a great film. Everything gets stuck in arrested development which is a huge blow. Also, the movie simply feels much longer that it actually is. The movie is two hours, but it feels more like four hours of non-compelling stuff. I love long movies, only if I am fully sucked into their world and am having a great time. Because ""Saturday Night Fever"" has so many flaws to begin with, the length that feels stretched doesn't feel fine.Disco is a dead musical genre. The hottest in the 70s, but that's it. But literally no other movie captures this genre better. This is a times capsule of an entire decade. The music, the style, and the star of a generation.3/4.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Probably more for those who grew up in the disco era,"This movie is part of pop culture, and I had always heard about it, being hailed as a classic and a great showcase of the disco era. Though I was born after the disco era ended, I was always curious about it. With that in mind, I thought as a film fan I should check it out.At first I was grooving to the music and was enjoying seeing all those classic and sometimes a bit chuckle inducing disco moves. It was interesting seeing the lifestyle of Tony and his friends, and him being an ""outsider"" trying to appeal to the more ""classy"" girl and make something of himself outside of his dead end job.While watching, I saw so much that were remnants of a bygone era and would not fly today. From homophobia, to sexism and racism, and even rape that gets blamed on the girl and almost shrugged off. Now I'm not the SJW type, but these were definitely surprising to see in a movie that is so revered.That's not my biggest complaint though. That would be the downer ending that leaves so much unresolved. In the end, this movie was a bit of fun, but it peaks around half way or so and goes progressively downhill as it goes on.I'm glad I watched it because I no longer have to wonder any more, but it's not something I'd want to watch again.The movie is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7 because of Travolta's dancing and acting, which elevated the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Famous Iconic Film But Unfocused,"Think about the mid to late 1970s and you'll think about this movie . It's a film that changed western culture and that is no exaggeration . The OST sold tens of millions of copies , turned the almost forgotten Bee Gees into superstars , inspired Jerry Brukheimer to make films where the soundtrack was the most important aspect and gave us the striking image of an Italian American in a white suit strutting his stuff across the dance floor . It's a movie I've seen parodied a million times in other films and TV shows but one I had never seen until tonight . Sorry to say this but apart from marrying cinema and popular music into one there's little artistic worth to itIt's a very flawed film because it's a very unfocused one . What is the main plot about ? Is it about Italian-American Values ? Is it about religious pressure versus indiviualism ? Is it about gang warfare ? Or is it simply about trying to get ahead in life ? All these issues are explored in a series of subplots but I'm vaguely at a loss trying to decide what the main story is about . It's by no means as confused and rambling as THE DEER HUNTER but like so many films from this period you are left with a feeling that there's a lack of concentration in the production . Say what you like about Jerry Bruckheimer ( And if you say he's out to make a fast buck I'll agree with you ) but his he knows what type of market he's going for whilst the original SNF was re-released a few months later in a PG version so that young teenagers could flock to the cinema to watch it . By having the original version gritty and foul mouthed must be seen as a failure on the part of the producers",6.0,Anonymous,Music
From the opening scene with John Travolta carrying a gallon can of house paint he had the necessary swagger to own the Brooklyn Disco scene and moviegoers knew it too!,"I have now watched this film at least six (6) times over the past forty-five (45) years since its initial film release way back in 1977 and it amazes and yet confounds me at the same time that this film has not achieved the deserved credit for its excellence in so many areas of filmmaking such as for story line, the superior ensemble cast and acting, the memorable and multiple dance floor sequences, and of course the memorable musical score. This film is not in either of the IMDb, nor AMI's top 100 movies of all times lists and I simply just do not understand why it has not succeeded with this honor as of yet?From the opening scene with John Travolta carrying a can of paint he had the necessary swagger to own the Brooklyn Disco scene and moviegoers knew it too! The musical score sounds better today than when the film came out some forty-five (45) years earlier. What the film critics had no control over was the success of the Saturday Night Fever record album. The soundtrack was released on November 15, 1977. It is one of the best-selling albums in history, and remains the second-biggest-selling soundtrack of all time, after The Bodyguard, selling over 40 million copies worldwide (with some estimates as high as over 50 million).The five local Brooklyn boys led by the daytime hardware staff member and nighttime disco dancing champ Tony Manero (John Travolta) live a simple life of working hard but on Saturday nights they go to the best disco in Brooklyn to strut their stuff, pick up chicks, get laid if they are fortunate enough, then repeat the same week after week. But Tony meets Stephanie, (Karen Lynn Gorney) who is his dancing equal but also a girl who has greater aspirations about successes in her life and how to get there.This is a film for the ages, and no one is cooler than Tony Manero when he hits that dance floor and any one of the many Bee Gees songs starts to play. John Travolta must have worked extremely hard to move the way he does on the dance floor and even his swagger when he walks with a simple gallon can of house paint I knew this film would entertain the masses. And entertain the masses it has, for the past forty-five (45) years and counting.I remain optimistic as the old film critics die off from old age that the new film critics who put together the the next top 100 films of all time that the 1977 film release of Saturday Night Fever will not only make the list but move closer to the top of the list. I give the film the highest reward that us common IMDb reviewers can give and that is a most deserving 10 out of 10 IMDb rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The man who gave you coolness and hotness and everything you want""","Saturday Night Fever is a hopelessly naive film that appears to have no discernible sense of irony. Such a self-aware approach could have fully vindicated this dated story of Travolta's Tony Manero  who now looks an idiot throughout with colossal collars  getting his highs through disco dancing. Filled with contemporary film and juvenile sex references, this is the sort of film a sixth former would write, falsely believing it to be ""relevant"" and ""meaningful"".The film also has a bitter edge, centred on the obnoxious Tony and bad language. ""What are you anyway, a nice girl or a c***?"" is a typical chat-up line. The most harrowing scene comes when the rejected Annette (Donna Pescow) initiates a gang-bang with Manero's friends in order to make him jealous. Despite her changing her mind halfway through and crying for them to stop, the act continues in a quite repellent example of cinema. This snapshot of racist, homophobic, foul-mouthed Italian-Americans is more Scorcese-DeNiro territory than the cosy retro of Grease, and can be quite shocking for those that think of this as a film solely about disco-dancing.An odd scene is Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney sitting on a bench in front of Brooklyn Bridge, shot from the same angle as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton would be two years later in ""Manhattan"". The difference being Allen wouldn't have called her a c***. Well, at least not until Deconstructing Harry. On the unintentional laughter scale, look out for a gang brawl that involves much harsh editing, balsa wood chairs and overdubbed ""punch"" sound effects.John Badham's direction is very good, combined with Bronx slum surroundings that give it the aspect of an art-house movie. Ultimately, though, this is a film famed more for cultural iconography than actual content. Aside from Travolta in a white suit dancing, I bet that very few people could tell you what the film is actually about. Just short of two hours long, the repetitive tale  it alternates constantly between disco and mundane everyday life  is surprisingly never dull. Like Travolta, it is personable and imminently watchable, if never actually any good. Abortions, crisis of faith, gang war, attempted rape and Travolta seeking redemption by leaving the slum - this is more than a film about dancing. And, no matter what anyone else says, the best song on the soundtrack is obviously Rick Dees and his ""Disco Duck"". 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The TAXI DRIVER of disco musicals,"I believe that Saturday NIGHT FEVER in its original 118 minute R+ version is genuinely one of the great dramas of the 70s, a film so severe, that I liken it to TAXI DRIVER in its relentless scathing depiction of NY life in the 70s. When first released in Australia in 1977 it was the full, full on, foul mouthed vicious version that I astonishingly saw in free to air TV in Sydney last night (on a 9.30pm slot). This R+ version had not been seen here for almost 30 years and only existed in its PG re release that played endlessly as a double feature with GREASE thru the 80s. Amusingly that is exactly how it played last night with GREASE prior at 7.30pm. All that aside, SNF with its scalding expose of the lives of these 20 somethings is a superb film, and for all those moaning about it not being fun because it is a musical... well it is not supposed to be fun... it is a damning comment on the uneducated and ignorance of the lives depicted. If you seek a fun musical then see STEP UP which is NY similar but nowhere as courageous and fully realised as this film. In 1978 with underage fans screaming to be let in, it was considered smart to cut 10 minutes out, dub over all the swearing (especially the two times Travolta says 'c*nt' in the same sentence, all the references and scenes to car sex...) and make it PG friendly... and it certainly was a success. But if you want a ""Scorsese version"" as originally released, and you can tell drama from drivel, then this full R+ version is for you. I have never seen a better damning of an uneducated bunch of cruel insensitive people in any film... and if there is a moral to this cinematic thrashing... it is that if you are not educated then you will end up like this lot. Brit director John Badham has drawn well from the equally vicious portrayals seen in the 'kitchen sink' dramas made in Britain in the early 60s like ""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" or THIS SPORTING LIFE where the working class who are bogged in their ignorance keep returning to an emotional bruising cycle of behaviour until one just plain stops and looks at himself. Like Tony does in this film. I also believe the scene with Karen Lyn Gorney and Travolta in the empty apartment they consider renting is one of the great moments in any American film (she is sitting on the window sill). This is a great film, uncompromising in its depiction of that 'lifestyle' cornered through ignorant mean-ness into delusion and nowhere. Perfectly realised. then cut to a PG.

And out of the ashes rose John Travolta under a disco light,"I finally saw the famous ""Saturday Night Fever"". Now, it's not one of my favorite movies, but the dance sequences are amazing. John is an incredable performer. But I do love his strut, and his ""Watch the hair!"". It's enjoyable.

"Poorly edited, sloppy, and cringe worthy","What did I just watch? Am I supposed to empathize with this character? This unappreciative, manipulative, cruel, violent, but oh-so-apologetic rapist? Is sexual assault okay if your dad is mean to you and your friend jumps off a bridge and you apologize for it? The protagonist of this movie is nothing less than abhorrent, his supposed redemption is a cheap, unearned, insulting sham.Aside from the single good dance scene (which does NOT involve John Travolta) this film is an awkward mess of supposed class warfare, blue collar self aggrandizement, soft lighting (so romantic!), and explicit glorification of violence and rape.

Almost a European movie,"We just rented this movie to see what it was all about, and the result was quite different from our expectations.SNF is not just a dance movie. The dancing is one part, and some of the dance scenes are really brilliant (but by todays standards, the music is quite mushy in the rhythm and rather slow).  However, these scenes are nicely contrasted with the not-so-hip everyday life of Tony.Travolta does a very believable portrait of a teenager torn between a rather bleak day life and a hot night life.  He feels he could be something, but he has no idea how.  He dreams of owning expensive cars, but earns barely enough to support his once-a-week clubbing.  He is annoyed by girls that want to have sex with him, due to something that is not entirely clear.  But he is really really believable.Unfortunately, the story does not hang together very well.  There is the stuff of a great movie in here, but the story is told in a rather unfocussed way.  The end feels like a big ""what?"", and there are a bit too many unconnected scenes for my liking.  The plot just does not follow a logical path.But it is interesting with the mix of glamourous dancing and social-realistic movie about poor urban youth.  Would never be have been made in the past 15 years, due to current Hollywood being scared of such tragic figures.But it could have been made in Europe, which is big big praise for a American film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great snapshot of the disco era with compelling characters and story,"RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by John Badham, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a drama/musical detailing events in Brooklyn where a group of Italian-American youths led by Tony Manero (John Travolta) work dead-end jobs, rumble with Hispanics and meet babes at the local discothèque where Tony is a champion dancer. Donna Pescow plays his needy wannabe girlfriend while Karen Lynn Gorney plays his dance partner for a big contest.This was a huge hit in its day and the catalyst for disco fever throughout the world. To this day you'll see people mimic Travolta's iconic dance stance with one arm pointing upward and the corresponding leg out. John was in the prime of his life at 22 during shooting (a great inspiration for guys to get in shape) and already popular due to TV's Welcome Back Kotter. ""Saturday Night Fever"" shot him to stardom, making him a household name.The movie's hit status was deserved because of its emphasis on the ordinary, but interesting protagonists and their entertaining drama, not to mention the dynamic dance sequences and popular soundtrack featuring the Bee Gees. There are several quality scenes, including one with the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop. Watch for 19 year-old Fran Drescher making her acting debut in a glorified cameo.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 58 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn, New York City.

"Travolta's Dance Skills are What Made the Movie Enjoyable,","Saturday Night Fever is a good movie with a well written storyline although there really isn't very much conflict throughout the movie,and an average cast.The plot is certainly nothing too exciting but it is certainly the dance scenes that make this movie enjoyable,I'm usually not a fan of watching people dance,but John Travolta is certainly an exception and this movie is the best example of what are professional dance he really is,and his dance scenes are without a doubt unforgettable scenes and the movies highlight.As for the casts performances,I honestly think its the weakest part of the movie,I was that bothered about the plot,but I don't think anyone really delivered a top notch performance,not even Travolta,his performance is certainly the best in this movie,but he was still very new to acting at this time and he was nowhere near professional yet.The worst performance was certainly Karen Lynn Gorney,who played Stephanie,I didn't believe her for a second,she started off seeming like a upper class girl,but as soon as she started talking she was not one bit believable,and especially when she was upset,she could not do a fake cry.All in all,Saturday Night Fever is an enjoyable movie,it's filled with flaws but the dance scenes are the main thing in this movie,and they are the best parts.Tony Manero (John Travolta),a young man living in Brooklyn,is trying to find himself as he is growing up,he gets a low payed job,but keeps a positive attitude while seeing his friends every night and going to his favourite dance club.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Here comes the good music,"The success of this movie only relays on the performance of John Travolta, and the brilliant Bee Gees's musics. The rest of it, the story, the other characters, and the way of filming, is pretty bad.I haven't decide yet if it's the character Stephanie or the actress who plays her role (Karen Lynn Gorney) that is annoying me, but she really does ! Fortunately the sight of John Travolta dancing on the dance floor (damn he's a really good dancer) help us to forget the global aspect of the movie.At least, Saturday Night Fever gives a sincere vision of what American teens were like in the 80's.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Lament to a by-gone era,"Before I ever saw this movie I had happen to see Grease, which I did not like. I never got this 50s nostalgia, and the story was corny. Now, Saturday Night Fever, which isn't related to Saturday Night Live in any way, has as an engaging story enhanced by great disco music without being a musical. It's actually rather similar to Fame, the movie, having a similar message: the entertainment business as a vehicle out of the ghetto. Perhaps not very ingenious or innovative. The picture deals with other themes too, such as racial issues, religion and sex, but only subordinately. Over-all good acting and dancing.Interesting this 70s disco music phenomenon: it developed out of soul/funk, and Barry White was crucial to its genesis as his Love's Theme was the first hit to be referred to as 'disco'. The new genre was endorsed by artists that were not predominantly Afro-American, adding an international flavour and popularity. 'Disco' was not prone to develop much further than White's sound of 1973, though, and in 1979 there was even an anti-disco movement called 'Disco Sucks!' that culminated in mass burning of disco records at a stadium in Chicago.Saturday Night Fever did capture the essence of the era with regard to the clubbing side of it. One thing that does surprise me is that the fashion they wore didn't match the class and ever-greenness of the music: polyester...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"I had watched the sequel (Staying Alive) a few years ago, and I looked forward to seeing the movie that had started it all--Saturday Night Fever. The premise seemed promising: a blue collar teen from Brooklyn finds solace in the disco scene. I love movies about my hometown... especially those that are grittier/slice of life (e.g., Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, etc.) Unfortunately, this particular movie didn't age well. As others have mentioned, the misogyny, racism and rape scenes are disturbing. This isn't to say that I can't love a movie that includes these themes, but here they seem to be glossed over or glamorized, which makes them all the more disturbing. The plot is not well developed; the characters--while apparently meant to be sympathetic--are utterly repellant (not even antiheroes or flawed protagonists). Aside from a few good dance numbers, I didn't see the point of this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This is the quintessential disco movie,"I first saw this movie at the drive-in as a kid. I remember being fairly amused seeing Vinnie Barbarino on the big screen for the first time. For what it's worth, this is the quintessential disco movie. The characters are believable, if not appealing. If you're a fan of the era, you'll love this film. If not, you can't help but be amused. Personally I fall somewhere closer to the latter. This isn't just a dance movie though, it deals with the characters and the other aspects of their life...questioning religious faith, unwanted pregnancy, relationships, friends, and family. For me, it's a quality period piece from the much maligned late 70s, set in Brooklyn. I have to admit I'm somewhat thankful that I was a little too young to really be involved in the disco era.*** (Out of 4)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The king of the dance floor,"This is one of those movies that has an aura about it. A glamorous outer shell which serves as presentation and to cover the darkness inside it. And it works. How else could I explain that, in a movie containing both an attempted rape and a suicide, the only thing I will remember is John Travolta in his immaculate white suit breaking it down on the dance floor?John Travolta plays Tony Manero, a 19-years old American-Italian living in Brooklyn with his parents. He has a dead-end job and no plans for college. But he seems to be content, at least for now, as long as he has his friends and the 2001 Odyssey nightclub. He changes when he sees a girl on the dance floor. Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) is close to being his match in dancing skills and is also part of the Manhattan upper class. She has an office job and seems to be doing pretty well. She also takes no time to lay into Tony about his shortcomings. While her snobbism is not sympathetic, it serves to wake something in Tony. He becomes more aware of himself and the world around him.But is this sudden realization to become more responsible real or just driven by his insecurities and needs to impress Stephanie? At first it might be the latter, but as the movie progresses, he thinks about it more and more. Everything eventually culminates in a nervous breakdown one evening after winning a dance competition at the Odyssey. A win he believes he did not deserve and was given to him and Stephanie simply because the other couple were Puerto Rican. This racism--and the racism of his friends as well--pisses him off. Yet he is not driven by hatred, but rather frustrated by stupidity. I always consider stupidity a bigger insult to racism than evil because evil is held to a higher standard while stupidity is simply tossed aside. Indeed, by the end of the movie Tony becomes a man trying to overcome his condition.But don't think this movie scoffs at the lower-to-middle class. Stephanie has her own mistakes to be ashamed of mostly related to the ways in which a young woman like her might be able to climb the corporate ranks. And she is also not the only woman in Tony's life. Anette (Donna Pescow) is an ex-girlfriend of his, stuck in the friend zone but is probably the only girl who truly loves him. He is too young to understand her feelings but it's easy to see how well they are made for each other. But the movie keeps them at an emotional distance and is ruthless in their separation. Perhaps their impossibility is what makes me wish they would reconcile even more.Still, while these ideas are all fine and dandy, this movie is not without flaws. The subplot of Tony's brother Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar) is dealt with really quickly. Frank is a priest, highly regarded by Tony's parents--his mother always calls him ""father"" and crosses herself each time she mentions her name--but he shocked everyone when he decided to abandon priesthood. He doesn't have a specific reason, simply not feeling like he belongs. He then leaves the movie and is never mentioned again. But not without leaving a mark. For Tony, peer pressure is a real thing and he has a guilty sense of satisfaction seeing his brother move backwards for a change. He by no means hates him, their interactions being very friendly, but he feels pressure has been taken away from him and was given time to breathe. So is this really a flaw at all?I always claimed that a truly great movie can depict any form of evil as long as it contains the smallest glimmer of humanity. This usually comes at the ending, but not in ""Saturday Night Fever"". Director John Badham gets it out of the way early, the first time Tony sets foot on the dance floor in his outlandish sense of fashion. The ending, in fact, offers no guarantees and doesn't solve any immediate problems. When Tony runs to Stephanie's apartment we get a feeling he has matured, perhaps understanding what true love is. But in no way do I get a sense that once the screen turns black these characters will head towards the proverbial ""happy ever after"", nor they are obliged to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A blast from the past,"I was a senior in high school when this film first came out, I didn't pay too much attention to it because ""Vinnie Barbarino"" was in it and the only real cool part of it was of course the tunes.

I found out, I missed a compelling story of a young man just going with the crowd when it finally dawns on him to go for his dreams. And of course the disco beat still had me hopping.

Not What I Expected,"Saturday Night Fever was a disappointment. I expected Travolta's character to be more ... interesting, to say the least. He somehow never gets past being shallow and vain, except for the anger over his friends about the dance contest. But in a way, that was vanity, too. The cliches about Catholics were tired and overwrung -- I thought the thread of the Catholic girl and her boyfriend was particularly pointless, unless the whole goal of the movie was to get in as many anti-Catholic jabs as possible.Saturday Night Fever had a lot of potential, but sadly missed the mark and survives only as a specimen, interesting as a study of the times but good for little else.

Loneliness & elation rolled into a film reflecting its era.,"It's funny how people remember a film they are reminiscing about. An example would be ""Muriel's Wedding"" - a film that is labeled as a comedy. And yet it is one of the saddest & most realistic films about family life that has been made. When you remember the film, its moments of humour are so clever, that they hide the dark undercurrents explored.The same goes for ""Saturday Night Fever"" (SNF), a film that showcases disco in its most perfect form. And yet the true theme of the movie is about wanting more out of your life but just existing, until something affects you so much that you decide to start living.John Travolta's character is so well played against his friends who are, quite simply, cruel no hopers who disrespect the opposite sex & treat them as fifth best against the car they all share to have 'mobile' sex in.The female character that eventually shifts Travolta's character appears at a time when horrific events really force him to reassess where he is going  something that his friends will never be unable to ever do.It is easy to label a movie a certain way. There are films with similar themes such as 'Good Will Hunting', which is noted for its themes & dialogue rather than being a kitsch memory, and we should remember SNF for the same reasons.",,Anonymous,Music
Disco Is Not Dead,"A Brooklyn teenager (John Travolta) feels his only chance to succeed is as the king of the disco floor. His carefree youth and weekend dancing help him to forget the reality of his bleak life.In 1977, disco was alive and well. Today (2015) most would say that disco is dead. But watching this film proves them wrong. The story is as good now as it ever was, and the songs (many supplied by the BeeGees) are quite timeless -- almost every single song on this soundtrack is today considered a classic. Few films can claim such a lineup.From a historical point of view, the movie launched John Travolta, which is interesting... he is one of the more fascinating people in Hollywood over the last forty years.

S10 Reviews: Saturday Night Fever (1977),"Tony Manero (John Travolta) is ""Tres Cool"" spending his days at the local Brooklyn paint shop slaving away and supporting his parents and siblings. But when the sun goes down he puts on his polyester leisure suit, throws on his chains and spruces up his platform shoes to head down to the local discothèque where every woman wants him and every man wants to be him. There he is the king of the night-time world. Manero and his hoodlum friends aren't all that nice but they ooze gutter cool when the mirror ball starts to spin.I am not fond of disco music so I figured I would hate the film with a passion. But I was wrong. ""Saturday Night Live"" is now like a time-capsule of the late 70's music scene which is surprisingly interesting. Travolta does a great job of making his flawed and ultimately unlikable character, likable. The production is a flashy musical-hybrid at it's' roots but it has a surprising dramatic sophistication when you see Manero working his way through the mess of his life. Obviously a movie about disco can't be made without it. So I forgive them that fact. But I won't be getting the soundtrack. Can you dig it?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Tony Manero,"A film that marked a generation and became a cult classic.John Travolta is the perfect choice for the role of Tony Manero, he embodied the character perfectly. The director's version is definitely worth watching, although the original cinema version (R rated) is just as great.The film is a drama that shows us family relationships, inner struggle and interesting characters.The characters are layered, they have their virtues as well as flaws, everyone tries to deal with life in their own way. Realistically portrayed, these characters are not polished but human and that is perhaps the most important feature of the film.The soundtrack is what makes this film truly extraordinary and it fits perfectly into the film, and Tony Manero and his dance have become legendary.An unforgettable classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
OK,"Its good that film has a documentation of the disco era, and this is the definitive disco movie.  However, it just isn't that great of a movie. First of all, Travolta's character is a joke.

There was no connection between me and them, and I found myself sitting patiently through the plot-based scenes to see more dancing and musical montages.  7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A slightly flawed classic,"OK I will declare an interest. I was ""there"" in the late seventies. And yes, the first dance scene, to the sound of ""You should be dancing"" still takes my breath away because that was the song that was playing as I walked onto the floor of the first real Discotheque that I entered back in 1977.But this film should NOT be approached as a Disco era feel good nostalgia trip, anybody who is looking for that should watchthe contemporary film ""Thank God its Friday"". This film should be thought of for what it is, a drama with music. And the story is rather bleak, albeit with a slightly optimistic ending.John Travolta gives a superb performance as Tony, a gauche teenager with a talent for dancing that gives him a respite from his dead end job in a hardware store. His friends are one dimensional losers with no ambition beyond looking forward to the next weekend. His family spend their time arguing about nothings. But unlike his family, and his friends, Tony does want to make something of his life, but is unsure what he wants, let alone how to achieve it.The weak link is this film for me is Karen Lynn Gorney, the female lead, which is surprising given that at the time of filming, she was rather more experienced than was Travolta. I have seen this film many times, and still don't understand what Travolta's character actually saw in her, since the characterisation lacks precision?There are two versions of the film, my advice is to watch the R rated version, the cut version was made just for younger teenagers, and softens the impact when Tony realises what a nasty bunch his friends actually are.I have read reviews from younger reviewers who object to some aspects of the film, this film was made for the audience of the late seventies, not those of the twenty twenties, and it was no more intended for woke teens of today than John Wayne's films about 1776 were intended for those who want to march in the street carrying British Union Flags.And finally, 1977 was NOT the era of platform shoes, which died out in 1975. Disco was a time when it became fashionable to look smart and sexy again, after the shapeless hair & jeans of the early seventies, and the hideous and clumsy fashions of '73 to '75. Apart from anything else, how could one leap around a dance floor in platform shoes without breaking ones ankles?(!)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Saturday Night Fever,"John Travolta and The Bee Gees team up, and the result is the biggest selling soundtrack in history. Travolta's feverish dancing put a face on the Gibb Brothers' disco beat. We still imitate him in his white suit, our fingers pointing to the sky. For awhile, I thought The Bee Gees were singing ""Bald Headed Woman."" I was informed that it was ""More Than A Woman."" It is unlikely that the movie would have gone far without The Bee Gees music. Songs like Stayin' Alive and Night Fever echo today. I particularly like Yvonne Elliman's rendition of If I Can't Have You. It was painful to watch The Bee Gees renounce the disco era a few years later. The characters and storyline of SNF are downers. A sequel called Staying Alive was released in 1983. It was so bad that it killed Travolta's career for a decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

John Travolta's Greatest Film!,"""Saturday Night Fever"" in my humble opinion has remained John Travolta's best film to date.  It was his debut lead film role and it has remained an all time favorite of mine.  Travolta plays a character named Tony Manero, who is a 19 year old paint store retailer in Brooklyn.  Tony yearns for a better life and trys to figure out a way to break free from his dead end friends and parents.  He knows he's capable of doing more with his life than he has.  Tony is a remarkable dancer and he shows everyone this at the 2001 Odyssey Disco, every Saturday night.  Then he meets Stephanie, a maturing young woman who is trying to improve her life with education and interest in her career. She also enjoys dancing, so Stephanie and Tony decide to become dance partners.  The story follows the two becoming friends, falling in love and Tony's maturation.  John Travolta couldn't be bettered in the role of Tony Manero.  His character is outwardly cool and tough, but inside there is a lot of tenderness and caring.  Travolta is an excellent dancer and he proves this as he glides onto the dance floor and gyrates to the Bee Gees pulsating soundtrack. The supporting cast is first rate too.  This is definitely a 1970's classic that shouldn't be missed by any connoisseur of film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dancing Fever,"To me dancing fever was the draw when this came out. Who doesn't want to be cool and know the right dance moves but what are they? Well this movie with the help of Travolta defined them and the rest is history. Of course what are dance moves without dancing songs so enter the Bee Gees and there thundering music that makes you want to move even sitting down. I didn't care for the sex innuendos, scenes and all the rest but I guess that was part of the culture and the times. This movie brought Travolta his fame and fortune of which he followed up with Grease making him a household name and someone who youth wanted to emulate. Having a TV show that made him famous only upped it notches. What a ride all in his twenties too. To this day, Disco inferno still works on you as the hit song to boogie by and those flashing lights and center stage was copied by every dance night club bar none.

"Tough, gritty and touching","On a purely visceral level, SNF is a joy to watch, as Travolta, Gorney, Pescow and others all demonstrate that they can move to the sound of the beat, and the music etched by the Bee Gees and others (don't miss out on the Trammps ""Disco Infereno"") provide a riveting backdrop for the performers to strut. However, on a more human level, the movie expresses in simple and sometimes violent terms, the struggle that kids on the edge of being adults face everywhere in this country and others -where do I fit in, how do I make my way in life? For Tony, the dance floor provides an outlet that undergirds his self esteem and gives him plenty of opportunities to score with chicks (Pescow even prompts him for sex by bringing the rubbers), but it does nothing to address his desire to make his mark as an adult. Living at home, kicking in for food, working at a paint store and blowing $20 or $30 a night at the 2001 Odyssey leaves a void that only becomes apparent when he meets Stephanie (Gorney) and tries his best to score with her by asking her to be his partner in the upcoming dance contest. It is a boy meets girl, boy gets girl? story, laced with compelling dialogue and subplots. PARENTS BEWARE: this movie features an extreme amount of profanity, a rape sequence, depicts women in a largely unfavorable light and contains a tough death scene.In short, it is a movie that has stood the test of time since its release in 1977. It made Travolta a star (he was nominated for the Best Actor oscar as was Gorney for best supporting actress) and it deserves high marks on many levels. Please stay away from the sequel ""Staying Alive"". Stallone discards everything from the original but Travolta and the story is mundane and predictable.Note:  Rent the 25th anniversay DVD as it contains 3 deleted scenes and commentary from director John Badham, which offers insight into Badham's thought process as he directed and edited the movie.",,Anonymous,Music
We know how to show it...,"I must confess: I'm not a big Bee Gees fan... (and my favourite song of there's isn't even in the film) so you might think the fact that you hear one of their little ditties every five minutes in this production could represent a problem. Not so... the tracks fit each scene like a glove, and it's impossible to imagine them missing. With all the other disco themed tunes too, you could argue that more people have heard the soundtrack than watched the movie. I'd certainly place a small bet on it.Rather than being a celebration of all things hedonistic about this era, the script provides a rather more level-headed approach. It doesn't deny the exuberance that one can derive from casual sex and shaking' your thang every weekend, but it also highlights the dangers of such an irresponsible approach... namely, teen pregnancy, barfights, sexual assault and even young death. It's all fine and dandy when you're that age and you feel you have years to burn... but unless you make long term plans for the future outside of the (metaphorical) dance floor, your folly will soon catch up with you, and you could end up with nothing but broken dreams. Take it from someone who knows... *Looks down sadly, but then perks right up again*Travolta, as you could guess, is quite the mover, and the parts where he gets his groove on in a variety of funkadelic outfits provide some of the more stimulating moments. There's also that brilliant introduction where we a close-up of his feet as he paces the streets of New York... just by his stride alone, you can tell we're in the hands of a very cool cat indeed. His friends are all jerks, his parents sole focus is on his priest brother, and he works at a dead-end job at a paint store. Saturday night is about the only time he can cut loose, so who can blame him for wanting to make such a big show out of it? This was his star-making role, and it's not hard to see why. He simply exudes sex appeal... and when all the girls throw themselves at him as he cuts a rug, the surprise factor is 0%.So you have brilliant dance sequences, good performances from all and sundry, a dark undertone to all the frivolity and some bangin' tunes to immerse yourself in. A 70's classic that has truly stood the test of time. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a white suit I need pressing... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dated, but crisp, appealing performance by Travolta","John Travolta's high-octane performance took his stardom (earned on Welcome Back, Kotter) to otherworldly levels. His Tony Manero isn't a perfectly nice Brooklyn kid, but he's also not a rotten jerk. He's 19, has a job that he enjoys (selling paint at a hardware store), and at night he's the king of the dance floor at the height of the disco age.The movie is very dated - as most movies that rely on topical music score and fashion must be - but the theme runs true. Tony dances to build his own self-esteem, since he gets little in the way of positive enforcement from a family that dotes upon his older brother, a priest. He hangs with his arrested-development pals, drinking and dancing and carousing and fighting.Travolta is fantastic as Tony; he's not as loud and arrogant as his friends, but he's clearly their leader. He's not terribly bright, but he's smart enough to know his limitations. He's a little thoughtful, but not too reflective, choosing to live in the present. Until, that is, he meets the slightly older Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney).It's easy to see why audiences flocked to this one, with its strong soundtrack (all Bee Gees, all the time) and electric atmosphere.

Disco: The Movie!,"There is surprisingly more to ""Saturday Night Fever"" than just John Travolta in the white suit rocking out to the Bee Gees (you see some iconic images over time, they sort of symbolize the movie, what can I say?). We can all identify with these youthful fears of a dead-end job, a go-nowhere life, and that came through extremely well. And I love his meathead line delivery. But the scenes with Travolta and his friends, their woman hating (it's ugly), that all lost me. And it makes up a substantial part of the running time.So, ""Saturday Night Fever"" . . . well, it kinda is all about the dancing. That's what it does best. The energetic dancefloor scenes, awesome soundtrack - it's flashy, calculated fun.A star-making movie if ever there was one. And talk about that opening credits strut; he owned those streets.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Cancel, Tony Manero! Another classic that couldn't be made in today's culture","This feels more like a documentary than a movie. The film touches on so many urban issues including classism, religion, racism, peer-pressure, jealousy, rivalry, rebellion, respect, unprotected sex and rape, in a way that feels honest and not contrived. It's not trying to make a statement about these social issues it's just showing you realistic characters that deal with it. I see a lot of people that like the film hail Tony as a hero and a lot of people that hate it decry him as a shallow idiot. I view him more as a tragic character that sees the path he's going down isn't the right one, but doesn't quite know how to deal with it. He's not happy with the man he is, but doesn't quite know how to change into the man he wants to be. Movies that try to accomplish these things intentionally come off pretentious and ham fisted. This movie was just and honest slice of life story with a great lead performance and its realism lead to its depth. Yes, the amazing soundtrack and dance sequences are the reason why it became a blockbuster and a cultural phenomenon, but even without them this movie would have been a cult classic and time capsule of the late 70s.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"OK, but not great","OK, but not great.Music (by the Bee Gees) is fantastic, and the dance sequences are great.However, the human drama side is pretty uneventful and mostly quite dull. The characters, including the leads, are mostly so loathsome it is hard to feel any empathy.Performances are so-so. John Travolta does well in the lead role, seeming to inhabit the character. No real stand-outs, otherwise.Not a great movie, but a great piece of nostalgia from the disco days of the 1970s.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Cultural Dino,"I just watched this again on some channel. . Bravo, maybe.When it first came out I was very young, and actually went under duress because all my other friends wanted to go.Then I had to sit through it again on a flight to Europe.I didn't get it then--I wasn't part of the whole disco culture--and now when I watch it I'm hypnotized, because it's so screamingly dated. The only way I can really view it is as a cultural artifact, which I guess, is exactly what it has become.Since everyone knows the plot by this time, my only observation is that the only really sympathetic character in the story is Tony's brother, who quit the priesthood. Tony's friends are clods, except for the one who's the whiner, Tony's family is repellent, and the only woman in the story that *seems* to have anything resembling self-esteem is a delusional, stuck-up pain in the butt. As for Tony, yeh, he has his likable moments, but for the most part he treats women like crap.One thing that always puzzled me was the casting of Karen Gorney as the girl Tony fixates on. Nothing against the actress, but she's utterly ordinary, and, as the character, totally obnoxious. Tony is a genuine hunk, all right, so why not cast someone as the unattainable girl who really can stop some traffic on the street? I mean, there WERE pretty women in Brooklyn in the 1970s.I've noticed in some of the reviews that the lack of political correctness in the movie seems to be refreshing to a lot of people, so I'll say something that may be politically incorrect: As I watched the camera pan lovingly over the prone figure of John Travolta lying in bed on his stomach, wearing nothing but black briefs, I thought ""Wow, this is gay."" Not that there's anything wrong with that.I understand why this flick appeals to guys on another level. Tony is the ultimate six foot strutting, prancing rooster, a man who knows that any girl he singles out will probably fall on her back and open her legs. And yet he has this streak of sensitivity. But not TOO much sensitivity.As for the music, you either love the Bee Gees and disco or you hate 'em. But I will say I understand why the soundtrack became one of the biggest selling soundtracks of all time.Anyhow, it's worth watching if only for the sheer culture shock.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A very true depiction of the glorious 70's,"I lived this time period and was a ""disco queen"" and can say every part of this movie holds true. The 70's was such a time of naivete and ignorance in so many ways. Woman still believed in a ""knight in shining armor"" many men still marginalized women as ""good girls and bad girls"" and guys could get away with date and gang rape if a girl was wasted enough. One night stands were the norm for many people, you'd go and dance for hours and in your naivete, go home with the guy who may be the knight you were looking for. Amidst it all was this hope for a happily ever after, a better life than the middle class one you saw your parents live.When disco happened it literally took the country by storm in less than a year. Discos popped up everywhere and people from 18 (if you could get a fake ID) up were out there in their polyester suits and disco dresses living the dream. Whoever was the best dancer and best looking were the king and queen of the disco. Everyone emulated the way they dressed, danced, etc and the guys at least could have any girl there. For those who think this was not an accurate representation just didn't live it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Rocky of dance movies,"Saturday Night Fever, the huge musical hit and film that launched John Travolta into A-list stardom, is kind of like the ROCKY of dance movies. Made at around the same time as the Stallone flick, its emphasis is on capturing a street vibe and depicting the grittiness of life for young people living in late '70s New York. Like ROCKY, it features a central character attempting to better himself in order to lift himself out of his humdrum surroundings.The movie belongs to Travolta and Travolta alone, because he electrifies the screen like no other. In many ways he plays a variant on his 'jerk' character in CARRIE, except that this guy just so happens to be a brilliant disco dancer. Wait until you see some of those dance sequences - they're amazing to behold, and it helps that the Bee Gees soundtrack is excellent into the bargain.Elsewhere, the story isn't afraid to shy away from downbeat realism, but at the same time it's oddly uplifting. John Badham's assured and confident direction helps to bring both story and era to life, making this a time capsule of its age.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

TV Version,"I watched the TV version first many years ago and was surprised when I saw the unedited version. Many uses of the four letter c word!But I did like this movie. John Travolta plays Tony a working class teen whose life revolves around blowing the money he makes at the local disco with his buddies where he's the king. Eventually down the line though he meets Stephanie a dancer with professional ambitions who works in Manhattan. Slowly Tony tries even if unconsciously to break out of his element.The clothes/music/discos have obviously all very much aged but not so much the meat of the story. That trying to break out of your ""element"". I think that's why this film still does so well.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I know it's a 70's pop movie but I never thought it's a good story of ethics,"After hearing a few shares of comments from my mother's stories, I might as well find out why this movie was so popular in the 70's.Tony Manero (Travolta) is a guy with little but contented wages from a paint store, a dropout of high school with an elder brother who's a priest, always pointed by his parents to be ridiculed, with a group of friends who plays the fun for living, being envied by girls for his savvy looks and poise, but most of all... he loves dancing, even to the point that he makes practicing perfect. Things became different after meeting a matured girl who tells complicated stories about the intelligent world...an opposing thought for a dropout kid.The movie is full of excellent scores by the BeeGees and some 70's dance fever hits that's famous when you hear this movie title...but what's the best part of it is about Tony Manero's good ethics against a city life obsession. He doesn't cheat much on his things, he even tries to cheer up his brother after giving up priesthood, he tries to control his friends' abusive tendencies, and practices dancing with seriousness. A look of a good ethics for a city kid. I never thought it could be well made for the movie. At least that saves this movie an entertaining piece of video to watch for it...not just for the music grooves.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Disco Turns 50,"I was 17 when his film debuted. I remember being so excited as at the time disco was everything to me. When I saw the film, it did not disappoint. Felt like I saw so much of myself in Tony Manero. Heck, I was him. The dancing, music, booze, etc. Were things we aspired to in that era. At the time I thought it a bit slow in places. As I matured I would occasionally revisit the film, each time gaining greater insight into what the lead character was lacking. Suddenly the slow parts were understood as the lead character's quest to be more than his lot in life. Now, over 50 years since disco pounded our airwaves, I see it with amazement. There are scenes where John Travolta looks so dumbfound lost and it is heartbreaking to see such a fish out of water. At the time I couldn't appreciate the desire and wanting portrayed in this film, but as I matured I got it. We grew up and melted our polyester, but a little bit of Tony Manero's strut remains.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
MY favorite musical movie!!!,"Saturday Night Fever marked the beginning of a new generation,a young dreamer called Tony Manero (John Travolta)is the king of the NYC discos at the 70s,works for some coins in a store by day,but when is the night, especially the weekends,he turns in the greatest dancer of the ""big apple"",along with his nasty friends,lives in a world of lust and pleasure. Being an Italian descendant,into a mid-class family,his room shows the posters of 2 icons for then:Bruce Lee,deceased 4 years ago and ""Rocky"" or better to say Sylvester Stallone already all an idol,his parents so funny and bizarre,a brother the pride of the family owing to his devotion to the faith:a priest,but he will be carried by Tony into the disco world,How can we forget that music full of energy?Regretly many youngsters despises that great rhythm,intolerance and absurd slim less noises crowd those heads,it's so funny to watch a young Fran Drescher(the gorgeous ""Nanny"")STANDING WITH HER PRETTY AND SEXY GREEN CHANNEL DRESS awaiting for Tony Manero taking over the lighten ballroom with ""YOU SHOULD BE DANCING"" by the Bee Gees,THE PLOT IS NOT EXTRAORDINARY,but for those years children,young boys,adults and even elder people enjoyed this flick. But the final was sad after one of his frolic friends dies,everything crumbled down,and even Tony felt the emptiness of his rushed life, his occasional partner Stephenie went away from him,because he tried to make non-desired love and she refuses all the Tony's behavior. It's unforgettable the moment when they waved goodbye,""How deep is your love"" by ""The Bee Gees"" penetrated all the inner being of us, it was not a happy end,you can dislike so many things about this movie,regrettably the Disco is underrated,many teens prefer to burst their minds with ugly screams,rhythm-less noises claiming hate,anger and violence for free,please learn to respect,understand what you cant analyze,this film and its soundtrack will be eternal!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Vinnie Barbarino dances the night away,"This turkey was undercooked and served up wet.

Like It's From Another Planet,"This is a really unique film. Because it comes out of the disco era (which seems like a hundred years ago) some don't take it seriously. While I hated most of the music, I did like the Bee Gees and was intrigued by the knock down performance of John Trovolta. He is a man of arrogance and assuredness who dominates a subculture. A paint store worker by day, he lives for dancing, and he's darn good at it. He and his lackeys live a life of pain and violence. Women are at Tony's feet and he can do what he wants. What it is really about is a psyche that is so fragile. Those that admire Trovolta's character don't have the same ability to stand alone and some, one in particular, is on the brink. This is a slice of time that has past, but the quality of the film is excellent and will survive.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
It's time for some disco dancing,"""Saturday Night Fever"" is a movie about the glorious disco-years during the seventies. The movie is seen as a classic but I don't think it's worth it. The story is very average and it isn't very deep or original either. The male lead is for John Travolta who is the star of the local disco, named Tony Manero.I love John Travolta. He was brilliant in ""Grease"" and many other movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"", but I don't understand why he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Tony Manero. His performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't an amazing performance either. Furthermore it wasn't a difficult part.The dancing was good but not breathtaking. If you want to see a good dance-movie, I advice you to see ""Grease"" or ""Dirty Dancing"". These are two timeless classics, but unfortunately ""Saturday Night Fever"" isn't. Of course, the two other movies aren't disco-movies, so if you want a movie about disco-dancing, you should see ""Saturday Night Fever"". It's good and enjoyable but not great. Not an Oscar-worthy performance either. For me, it was somewhat disappointing and cheap. It had high expectations who weren't fulfilled at all.6,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Sad and Frustrating,"I have to say I watched this movie in the hopes of seeing some good dancing. Well... some of the dancing wasn't too bad.

If you enjoy watching young people who have poor role models and the emotional maturity of three-year-olds screw up their own lives and each others' lives, watch this movie. I found it quite depressing. Possibly the last moment was slightly redeeming but not enough (for me) to have made watching the movie worthwhile.",,Anonymous,Music
Disco movie gave Travolta his shot at fame...,"For disco fans, ""Saturday Night Fever"" must be like going to heaven. It's only when JOHN TRAVOLTA, as Tony from Brooklyn, is doing his thing on the dance floor (energetic, dazzling twirls, leaps and steps lit by rosy glows of strobe lights) that it really comes alive. The story itself is rather mundane, about an arrogant boy's restless search for something to do on week-ends to get away from his everyday living in a Brooklyn tenement.But when the Bee Gees music is in full blast and JOHN TRAVOLTA shows the Brooklyn gang what he can do on a dance floor (in that white suit), we can see the kind of immediate appeal this film had in the midst of the Disco Era. You might call it a microcosm of the '70s craze for this kind of dance music.All of the scenes capture New York City nicely (especially those bridge scenes at night), but there's nothing deep here in exploring Tony and his restless energy while he seems to be a loser at love and finding himself. Nor are his friends anything more than cardboard cutouts of stereotypes we've all seen before, most of them with accents even stronger than Tony's and somewhat dumber, some of them yearning for jobs and a little respectability.Summing up: Great for Travolta fans, all others beware, it may not be your kind of music--or film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Saturday Night Sharking,"The career of John Travolta has had many ups and downs, but 'Saturday Night Fever'as where it really took off for the first time. The film is many things: a portrait of archetypal young people growing up under the influence of music (not unlike 'American Graffiti'); the story of a dance competition (like the later 'Simply Ballroom', although without that movie's wild comedy); and a portrait of New York's Italian community in the 1970s. One of the delights of this film is that Travolta's character is supposed to be cool, according to the standards of the time; but certain details now seem very dated, and one of the scenes set in a supposedly trendy club actually appears to demonstrate a form of line-dancing! There are subtleties here perhaps unexpected in a mainstream film, especially in the way the attitude of the male protagonists is at first apparently celebrated, but gradually revealed as atrociously misogynist; our attitude shifts with Travolta's, as his character grows up. As a pure dance movie, 'Simply Ballroom' is far more entertaining; but the edge of social, and human, realism raises this movie above the average modern Hollywood hit.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Resonates with a certain generation,"1977's ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a movie that strongly resonates with a particular generation - mine. Five minutes of the movie brings it all back -- the disco era, the incredible Bee Gees music, and the charm, charisma and dance moves that was young John Travolta. If you were around then, you'll remember the cultural explosion this film caused. It simply defined the era, the way ""Flashdance,"" an inferior film, did in a smaller way with the off one shoulder sweatshirt and music.For me watching this movie has the added plus of being a film about Brooklyn made in Brooklyn and New York City, where I lived. In fact, a young woman in my dance class is kissed by Travolta as he walks into the club. I can still remember how excited she was talking about it in class.It's the era of platform shoes, polyester shirts, and big blow-dried hair, and in the midst of it is a young Brooklyn man (Travolta) who has a gifted natural ability for dance is surrounded by friends heading nowhere and Italian-American parents who are afraid that he's just like his crowd. He finally realizes, thanks to his relationship with his pretty, uptown girl dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney), partly because of a tragedy, and partly because of his talent that he needs to stretch himself and move beyond his friends and neighborhood. As Stephanie says to him, ""You live with your parents, you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a cliché. You're nowhere, going' no place."" As Tony Manero, John Travolta is a sexy number with his swiveling hips and white suit, and he has a neighborhood girl (Donna Pescow) in love with him, as well as one of his friends, Bobby (Barry Miller) who's gay and doesn't know it, but always shows off for Tony and cries when Tony doesn't call him.I love what Roger Ebert says about the effect of this film, which was his review partner Gene Siskel's favorite: ""We all have a powerful memory of the person we were at that moment when we formed a vision for our lives. Tony Manero stands poised precisely at that moment. He makes mistakes, he fumbles, he says the wrong things, but when he does what he loves he feels a special grace."" Directed with both realism and romance by John Badham, ""Saturday Night Fever,"" especially for those of us who were young during the disco era, holds a very special place.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly deep toe-tapping drama,"I thought that Saturday Night Fever was an OK film. It's not one of the best ever despite its iconic moments and having John Travolta perfect;y cast in the role as Tony Manero. I admired the films guts, that it didn't turn into some fluffy rom-com, like Flashdance and it could've quite easily followed that formulaic route. Instead we're given a protagonist who a lot of the time isn't at all likable with his womanising and compassionate-less state. The film gives an in-depth view into his dysfunctional family life. Tony Manero is a well thought out and realised character. Unfortunately little characterisation is given to his friends, although they mostly appear the same as him.Saturday Night Fever really scores points in its atmosphere though. Once we enter the 2001 Odyssey the atmosphere is quite infectious with its vibrant flashing lights and sometimes hypnotic camera movements. I thought that the film would be too dance-heavy and whilst some of the dancing did go on for too long it was actually quite a joy to watch. It's easy to see why John Travalto's mesmerising dance solo has gone on to become iconic.However, I did feel that the film took a disliking to women due to male dominance. Tony's love interest isn't explored in enough depth and the film has some serious pacing issues. Sometimes it loses its focus by getting too into a sub-plot that doesn't require that much attention. I think that the film should've primarily focused on winning the dance trophy, but once the final came I didn't feel excited like I did for the Nina's opening night in Black Swan, and I should've done! The final 15-20 minutes are quite gripping though and very upsetting. The film reaches even grittier territory that I found hard-hitting. I admire it for that. And although in the end it did reach some sort of cosy ending, I thought it was believable and quite touching. Saturday Night Fever features a fantastic soundtrack, brilliant directing and excellent characterisation on Tony Manero, but in the end it lacks focus and drags in places. I didn't enjoy it any where near as much as a Chilean film called ""Tony Manero"" which grippingly follows a Chilean man who has a disturbing obsession with Saturday Night Fever. I'd recommend seeing that under-rated gem instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
It will stay alive forever.,"You know the scenes: Tony Manero (John Travolta) walking down the street primping his hair while ""Stayin' Alive"" plays; he later is the king of the dance floor while ""Disco Inferno"" is playing. Overall, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is more than simply a disco movie. It's a look at that era. Working-class teens saw no future, and so they saw fit only to get down every weekend in the discotheques. Some people say that disco is dead, but I beg to differ. I may have been born after the disco era, but that music will live on, whether in this movie or in people's souls. In other words, disco will stay alive forever, as will this movie. So let's get down everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Never give an icon an even break,"""Saturday Night Fever"" has become synonymous with disco's brief heyday, if someone knows just three things about disco, chances are that John Travolta dancing on the colored-lighting disco floor is one of them. This is hands down the iconic disco movie, and it will always have value as a time capsule both into disco culture itself and one of the biggest movies of that time period.As a movie, though, it isn't quite a classic for anything but its iconic pop culture status. We meet Travolta's Tony Manero, a working-class Italian-American with a passion for dancing, who initially seems okay with his lifestyle working in a hardware store in the old neighborhood and being the king of his ethnic neighborhood's local disco, as well as ringleader of a group of friends who obviously idolize him.Everything starts to unravel when he meets Stephanie, a dancing queen who is trying to make it out of the old neighborhood and succeed in Manhattan which, as the characters remark, seems like a different world even though it's just across the river. Stephanie turns Tony's world on its head by using him as a dancing partner only and refusing him romance, which was how Tony was used to treating women prior to meeting Stephanie. Smitten, Tony starts to have doubts about his lifestyle, and grows annoyed with his job, his family and his friends.The movie has a few problems. It's almost a movie about someone becoming disillusioned with disco, which is a strange plot direction for a movie called ""Saturday Night Fever"". For a movie that's remembered as a high note of disco culture, it's actually pretty lukewarm on the whole thing and almost downplays any potential excitement the characters might be feeling, any ""fever"", rather than trying to highlight it.Side-stories are awkwardly developed - Tony's brother quits the priesthood and expresses his crisis of faith, a clear prelude to Tony's own problems, but it just didn't seem to have been handled particularly well, Tony doesn't even seem to care particularly much when it happens. What's more, someone losing their faith in god is the opening act to someone losing their faith in disco? It's rather shallow when you deconstruct it. Aside from his brother, Tony's family and friends never even move past being one-dimensional, limiting any emotional impact the movie might have.Although they deal with different time periods and cultures, I think an apt comparison here is ""American Graffiti"", which was made within a few years and dealt with the same general topic of post-high school teenagers trying to figure out their future amid a hang-out culture. ""American Graffiti"" offered much more depth and genuinely interesting characters and situations, highlighting the areas where ""Saturday Night Fever"" falls short.This isn't to say ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a bad movie. Travolta's acting is iconic and memorable, the choreography is fun, the music, sets and costumes obviously have a lot of nostalgic appeal, and the story isn't bad or void of meaning, it just doesn't rise to the level of great storytelling. And, as opposed to many movies about a specific culture or lifestyle, everyone I've talked to who ""was there"" agrees that this movie is pretty accurate in its depiction of the northeast's disco culture in the late 1970s.It's a good time capsule, but unfortunately falls short of being a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Crass, ""uninspiring"" plot - I am sorry I tainted my memory of this music with any association with this film","I was in high school during the ""Saturday Night Fever"" era and, I thought surprisingly, I had never seen the film.  In late December, perhaps on a reminiscent whim to hear some high school popular music, I rented the film and now don't feel surprised I didn't see it when it came out - it is not a film with any degree of innocence or timidity.I was very disappointed at the crass violence (especially when Tony, played by John Travolta, leads his friends to literally crash into a bar to beat up the folks there), crude language, demeaning sexuality, racism, and lawless behavior of Tony and his gang. To me, the boorish characters juxtaposed ironically and very negatively vis-a-vis many of the songs whose lyrics were in fact positive and innocent.The crass and insipid plot argue for a rating of perhaps 1 out of 10. However, the dancing is good and the songs bring back memories to me of good high school times. Overall, I give this film a 2 or 3 out of 10, but I can't think of anybody I'd recommend to see this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Travolta comes out of nowhere in this hit dance film,"John Travolta almost came out of nowhere to star in ""Saturday Night Fever."" Not since Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly had hung up their dancing shoes had the screen seen such moves on the dance floor. Admittedly not of the style of the sophisticated and modern dance of the earlier two great dancers, Travolta nevertheless had the moves to command great reviews. He had been around for five years, but mostly on TV and in some horror flicks that didn't do much. So, when this movie came out, he was unknown to the mass of movie fans.But his fame would shoot up with a couple more great hit films, and more dancing, but then it would dive for nearly a decade as he tried other roles, as well as a couple more dance and music numbers. But all of those weren't for the public's liking because they weren't very good. Then, ""Pulp Fiction"" of 1994 restored his popularity, and Travolta who continue with mostly good films and hits from then on.This film was quite alarming for its day, with Travolta's sexually suggestive moves on the dance floor. That and some buddies getting a girlfriend drunk and raping her gives this movie its R-rating. The movie didn't need that, and would have been better without it. This film is very good just for the tremendous dance scenes with Travolta.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An OK travolta film,"well, what can i say? it wasn't bad even though i only saw part of the PG version on TV. yet, it wasn't as good as Grease.

Wanna know why? because they all have battles. this and flashdance had a disco battle, 8 mile had a rap battle and purple rain, i don't know what kind. it's about this man, Tony (Travolta) who wants to be a disco king. He falls in luv with this ballet dancer Stephanie but has so many issues at home, his family's broke, despite the fact he looks like a real New Yorker. He also has his womanizing skills. I don't know what happens later. but maybe i'll find out soon..... when i watch the PG version. if ur parents don't want u 2 watch the R rated version.... the next time it's on... watch it. so rent it, watch it, dance once in a while and if you like it, buy.

Vinnie Barbarino is Buddy Love,"This is a coming of age film with a 23 year old actor playing a 19 year old in the lead role of tony, a 19 year paint store clerk who is obsessed with spending his Saturday nights on the dance floor of a Brooklyn discotheque. He can shake up a can of paint and he can shake it up on the dance floor but has little else going on. He does have a 19 year old girl, Annette, played by a 23 year old actress over at the disco who is obsessed with him but he is attracted to a 20 year old woman, Stephanie, played by a 32 year old actress who he wants as his dance partner in a competition. The actors who play Tony's presumably same-age buddies from the Italian neighborhood are 25 and 27 years old and the third one is actually 19 years old. The story is based on a story by Nik Cohn that appeared in the June 7, 1976 New York Magazine that was passed off as a true story called Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night. Cohn had gone to the 2001 Odyssey disco in Brooklyn to look for material for a story on the disco scene. He saw an impeccably dressed and coiffed dancer who stood out among the crowd and came back the next week to look for him but he wan't there and he couldn't learn anything about him. He knew nothing about the disco scene so he ditched his plan and decided to make up a story using the guy he had seen as the model for his character he called Vincent. Producer Robert Stigwood read this story and figured it would be a good movie and he could score the music to it from The Bee Gees who were under his contract. Norman Wexler who had written the screenplays for Serpico and Joe adapted the short story into a screenplay. Rocky director John G. Avildsen was hired to direct but his differences in how the Tony character should be written with Stigwood's vision got him fired and replaced by John Badham who had recent success with The Bingo Long Travelling All-Stars & Motor Kings. John Travolta who was well known from the Welcome Back Kotter TV comedy was just starting out in films. He had done two TV movies and had a starring role in one of them and had been in two theatrical release feature films including the popular Carrie. Most of the other actors in this film were unknowns recently starting out in films or making their screen debut. Dance instructor Deney Terrio worked with Travolta and actresses Karen Lynn Gorney and Donna Pescow on the latest disco dance moves and additional training for the cast was from former Broadway actor and choreographer JoJo Smith who had been in the '64 revival of West Side Story and was running JoJo's Dance Factory in New York. Lester Wilson choreographed all the dance sequences. He had choreographed such films as Funny Lady and Sparkle and would go on to do the films Scrooged, Sister Act and the Motown 25 TV special. All their work hardly pays off as this film shows no real love for dancing. The characters are all going through the moves and it's energetic but their is no fun displayed in what they're doing for us to understand why they do it. Cinematographer Ralph D. Bode films the dance sequences in a point and shoot manner with poor lighting and little imagination. The Bee Gees of course provide a bulk of the soundtrack which went on to be the biggest selling movie soundtrack of all time. Lot's of songs by other artists too. Stayin' Alive, Night Fever, More Than A Woman, Disco Inferno, If I Can't Have you, You Should Be Dancing, How Deep is Your love and many more familiar tunes throughout this film. It's amazing that no songs from this film were nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Song which was won that year by the diametrically opposed You Light Up My Life by Debbie Boone. Travolta did get an Oscar nomination but throughout the film I keep imagining him in this role as Vinnie Barbarino doing the Jerry Lewis character Buddy Love from The Nutty Professor. This film hit the disco era in full stride and it was perfect timing. Oddly there had been no disco flavored music films but a flood would follow like Fame, Village People Can't Stop the Music, Roller Boogie, Soup for One, The Apple, The Wiz and Xanadu that all hit as disco was fading. I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and it is a good snapshot of the 70's disco era but as a story and as a film it falls short. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best films ever made,"Is the only reason this is not in the the top 250 films, snobbery? Its a film about disco, about a dumb teenage (19 year old) dancer, it was an enormous hit with pre-pubescent kids, it helped sell a lot of pop records. Its easy to dismiss and yet with each repeated watch it gets better and better. What is so great about it then? For starters John Travolta delivers the most physically exciting male lead acting role ever on screen. The dialogue is unrelentingly rough and dumb, perfectly matching the group of deadbeats that Travolta hangs out with. The editing is relentless allowing the viewer to get to know a lot about Travolta's character and background in as short as time possible. And of course it has the most exciting, intimate dance routines on film ever. It should surely sit among the top 50 best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Saturday Night Yawn,"I think that it's fair to say that I haven't seen a worse movie in my life (ok ... there's Blair Witch, Titanic, Pulp Fiction ...).  Saturday Night Fever takes out the prize as one of the least watchable films I've ever had the misfortune to see.Being a child of the 70's I thought it'd be fun to have a bit of a look and I'm glad I was a little tipsy when I saw it otherwise I'd be even more scathing in my review.  The soundtrack and the dancing weren't that bad. The film should have stopped at that: dancing and music - an hour and a half music video.  Unfortunately the movie didn't stop there.  The plot was dreadful (dragging along with no real place to go), the dialogue was shockingly awful and the acting was just as good.This is the sort of film that could be used well in interrogation processes. I, for one, would be confessing to all manner of things before too long!!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Year's Best Films,"""Tony Manero"" (John Travolta) is a 19-year-old man who lives in Brooklyn and goes with his friends to a popular disco known as the 2001 Odyssey every weekend to dance. He works at a dead-end job and even though he wants to make something out of himself he realizes that he has no real prospects. He does have one remarkable skill however-he can really dance and everyone is in awe of his abilities. So when the 2001 Odyssey announces that they are have a dance contest with a $500 reward for first prize he immediately enters it and reluctantly chooses a woman by the name of ""Annette"" (Donna Pescow) as his partner. The problem is that, although Annette is deeply infatuated with Tony, he doesn't really care that much for her and insists that their time together should be completely focused on their dance routine--with no romance allowed. Things change, however, when he happens to see a more attractive woman by the name of ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) at the club who is also a much better dancer. That said, he does everything he can to get her as his new partner. Needless to say, this devastates Annette while at the same time it is Stephanie who now must insist that their dance routine be totally devoid of romance as Tony has fallen completely head over heels for her. In the meantime, several other issues arise which soon creates all kinds of problems for everyone concerned. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a film which brought disco music to mainstream audiences and revolutionized the entire industry for years afterward. Not only was the film one of the most successful for that year but the soundtrack won a Grammy Award for ""Album of the Year"" and John Travolta was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as well. Admittedly, there are some scenes of a sexual nature along with some very rough language throughout so viewer discretion is advised. Be that as it may, I was very impressed with this movie and have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"26 years after its release I watched this movie yesterday evening for the first time: what a disappointment! I simply don't understand the big success it had!

I really enjoyed John Travolta in Grease, which was released a short time after that and which was one of my childhoods ""musts"" but this.... no way!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Stigwood's Legacy,"The Beatles tried it and failed. They, especially Paul, saw movies as a sort of music, or at least a sibling of music. They saw how naturally and effectively they were able to change the world. So they tried movies, and it was a disaster. (""Hard Day's Night"" wasn't theirs. I'm talking ""Magical Mystery Tour"" here.)But it got a lot of entertainment heavyweights thinking if something better could be done than those stupid Elvis movies. Robert Stigwood had built a record empire. (In those days it was black plastic.) And he thought he could make big hits by thinking about movies the way he thought about record albums.So we have this and ""Grease"" as successes, and a few failures as well, including the BeeGees as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Whew, that's a rough one.But this one changed the world of movies. Music and movies always have had a dance of possibilities, mostly built around two models. Either the music was part of a realistic story, like when Micky and Judy ""put on a show"" so you have the show and some events surrounding (usually threatening) it. And you have a stagy otherworld -- a peoples opera -- where the world of the story and that of the music blend.This is sort of in between, more like a show within, but there's a magic in the notion that the story more than wraps the show, it is a striving to actually pull the ordinary world into the world of music and dance.Its what I call a clever fold. We the audience identify with Manero who strives to take his mundane life and make it a magical, transporting show. Just like (exactly like) we were yearning to turn our own lives into something like we associated with movieland.So it works. And it was a first of this new model -- and also a new mode of promotion. It is a touchstone. But actually it isn't that good a movie. Some of the style has passed us by. We all used to know that Travolta character, and he's been replaced with a different, more dangerous and broken stereotype now. And we don't tolerate much now without what we call irony, a different sort of fold, dismissive.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Music
Saturday Night Fever,"I was but ten years old when this was released, so never saw it at the cinema at the time - but boy was it big news. John Travolta was fêted all around the world as the white-suited hipster ""Tony Manero"" who almost glided around the city streets - and the dance floor. Determined to improve his lot, he enters a disco competition which he thinks will change his life and what ensues for about two hours is his story. Sadly, it's not much of a story. He's not a very engaging fellow; treats women badly, has a mouth on him that could strip paint and is constantly at loggerheads with his hard working, decent, old man. Things take a turn for the more complicated when the apple of everyone's eye - his priest brother ""Frank"" (Martin Shakar) returns home announcing his intention to give up the priesthood for a life that doesn't require celibacy. Luckily, ""Tony"" teams up on the dance floor with the spunky ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) - a woman even more ambitious for a clean start than him - and that is where the film eventually takes off. On the dance floor, with the disco ball working it's magic and a collection of superb Bee Gees tracks that cannot fail to get your toes tapping. ""Night Fever""; ""Staying Alive""; If I Can't Have You"" and the more slow tempo'd ""How Deep Is Your Love"" make the soundtrack way, way, more memorable than this otherwise tawdry, tacky look at life in New York in the mid 1970s. Travolta is the star, his walk and his cocky style stand him apart from the rest of this rather depressingly anodyne story - but in the end it's a film about aspiration, dancing and the Bee Gees, and the latter elements are well worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent Movie,"Rating: 6.8
Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances.Pretty Good Direction (Able to move the movie forward and executes the dancing sequences very well, but besides this, he really does not get that much out of his actors and there are a lot of questionable scenes), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Very Good from John Travolta (In a very ""John Travolta"" way, a film that really puts him on the map for his exaggerated character), Decent from Karen Lynn Gorney (Has some good moments and has some questionable ones), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (A lot of the characters play the stereotypical New York Italian and it just gets so annoying to watch/listen to after a while)), Decent Story (Pretty formulaic and easy to predict, nothing really of substance), Decent Screenplay (As a whole, it is fine and gets the job done (very surface level), but there are just way to many stereotypical Italian mannerisms that it gets annoying), Great to Incredible Soundtrack (The actual songs were Incredible, but there were moments where I felt the director did not use the soundtrack properly (like reusing songs)), Pretty Good Cinematography (The cinematography comes to life in the dancing scenes as I liked the very low angle shots to show how big of a dancer Travolta's character was), Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Costumes (Very Disco-esque attire), Plot Structure was structured pretty well with no major problems (except the end kinda falls apart as it really could have ended 10-15 minutes earlier), Pacing was fine, Build to climax was not well done as the movie builds to the competition as if it is th the climax but the real climax is after (therefore, it just feels like it was building to nothing); climax was kinda boring as it was not what the movie was building to, Tone was very 70s/disco/New York Italian and it was made very clear with the dialogue and the mannerisms the characters have, The actual message of the movie is good but it is just so hard to believe as the character of John Travolta goes back to his foolish/degenerate ways right after as soon as he has his epiphany; also the movie really did not age well with its themes and language (but I guess it tried to portray the average New York Italian youth in that era)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Much deeper and meaningful than you'd expect,"A film that played not an insignificant part in helping to launch the last big disco craze of the late 70s. Seen as something of a cultural icon for the music genre and regarded as a minor cult classic. Which is why I was surprised to find out that its outlook on disco was in fact rather jaded. It definitely showcases the style and the mood of the music genre beautifully, but it doesn't glorify the culture behind it. Quite the opposite in fact. It deals with subjects such as aimlessness of early adulthood, gang violence, lack of responsibility, the downsides of loose sexuality, the list goes on. It shows that the reason people become so obsessed with disco was because they had absolutely nothing else going for them, no other goal worth pursuing.So what's the story? Tony Manero (John Travolta) is a young Italian American living in Brooklyn. He has a job in small hardware store, which is going nowhere, even though his boss seems to like him. His parents idolize his older brother, a priest by profession, not placing many expectations on him. In his downtime he hangs out with a couple of his friends, who have essentially formed a gang, and goes to a local disco club, where he is regarded as the king of dance. Then he meets a woman, another great dancer like him, who causes him to start questioning his life and his goals.This is very much John Travolta's film. One of his earliest film roles and still one of his best. It's actually not that surprising that Sylvester Stallone liked this film a lot - enough to direct its sequel in fact - because you can definitely see a lot of similarities between it and his own Rocky. Both are brilliant examples of their respective main genres, dancing and boxing, respectively, but what makes both of them work beyond their genre limitations is the substance in them. They are good genre films, but they also provide you with great drama, social commentary and character development. Both feature uneducated, down on their luck blue collar protagonists, who nevertheless struggle to make something out of themselves and improve their lot in life.Saturday Night Fever is a great film. Not only because it's such an inviting, energetic and enjoyable film visually and auditorily, but because it's an excellent example on how to make a film be more than its bare bones. It is a film with both style and substance and is well worth a watch for all looking for a good story.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dance the Night Away,"At the beginning of the '70s, a new subculture emerged in the American nightlife scene. Disco music started playing at venues popular among African/Americans, Latino/Americans and young, trendy gays. Then, in 1976, British rock journalist Nic Cohn came to New York to write about the phenomenon. His lengthy article ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"" turned out to be extremely important in the development of the new club landscape.Back in London, music mogul Robert Stigwood had been given an advanced look at the article. And he liked what he saw. Even before the piece was published, Stigwood bought the rights to Nic Cohn's story. In the central role of the up-and-coming film he wanted John Travolta. A young actor best known for playing a cocky Italian heartthrob in a popular TV sitcom. Stigwood was sure the guy would be perfect for ""Saturday Night Fever."" And boy, was he right...Unfortunately, it wasn't an easy movie to make. Travolta was forced to undergo a rigorous training regiment, aided by a personal dance instructor. Nine months later (and twenty pounds lighter) the actor was finally considered ready for the cameras. At that time, John Travolta had become such a skilled dancer that the choreographer decided to add most of his moves into the film. ""Saturday Night Fever"" was then shot in a real Brooklyn disco, with strobe lights, mirror balls and lots of hazy images cut to the pumping beat of the music.From the moment John Travolta strutted down the street in ""Saturday Night Fever"", pop culture was changed forever. The film simply set a whole new standard for marketing synergy. Not only that. The soundtrack (featuring the Bee Gees) became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The disco movement, once an underground oddity, turned into a mainstream pop phenomenon. And John Travolta went from being a mere TV idol into a true, movie superstar.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An Indictment Of Machismo and Urban Tribalism....,"Anyone who read Nik Cohn's original New York Magazine piece (""Tribal Rights Of The New Saturday Night"") would know that the article, and the subsequent film, are meant to CRITICIZE urban tribalism (""neighborhoodism""), machismo, racism, sexism, etc.....not glorify these ideas! Although the real-life Tony Manero (a fellow named Eugene Robinson) and his friends were a multi-ethnic group, other aspects of their behavior were dissected in the piece. The film chose to change their ethnic background to Italian, and take potshots at urban Italian culture circa 1977. The disco/dancing leitmotif was meant to be exactly that, a leitmotif. I never realized how many people missed the entire point of the film until I went to see the God-awful play here in NY....these people were APPLAUDING the stereotypes portrayed! The Faces are supposed to be ignorant, sexist, violent near-thugs, not role-models.....that is why Manero leaves them at the end of the film. It amazes me when people emulate and glorify negative stereotypes (like the Italian-Americans who emulate ""The Sopranos""!) Part of the problem is that many people see the censored versions of the film, where the negative behavior is censored. The R-rated film is the only legitimate version. The PG/PG13 versions are inane (hey, guys, let's put out a PG, dumbed-down version of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.....so the kids can hear all the GREAT MUSIC!).SNF wasn't the only film at the time to attack ethnic tribalism, NUNZIO and BLOOBROTHERS are other films that examine similar themes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Doesn't matter what it was rated, it's a great movie all the way!","The 1970's was the decade for John Travolta. He did ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", ""Carrie"", and now ""Saturday Night Fever"". I can understand Brooklyn, when you're a nobody in the neighborhood, you ought to get noticed. This movie to me is all about life, and the disco is the only place you can think of, right, WRONG! Anybody can strut his stuff of the disco floor, but wait, there's Stephanie. She's learning to live her life the way it is. She tries her best to help Tony(John Travolta) what it's like outside where he comes from. He hangs around his friends and his family who are bound by traditions. I think they are more misguiding than anyone I would know. And conscience played a factor for Tony when the disco dance contest was rigged and he thinks the Spanish couple deserved the 1st place prize. I agreed with him big time. At the end, Tony realized that Stephanie was the real deal and his family and friends were all a big joke to him. Starting over was the goal to Tony and Stephanie. The movie it had a lot of advantages, the music, the cast, and the scene. The cast had a big impact for the stars of today, like Fran Drescher, and Donna Pescow, two years later she did a sitcom called ""Angie"". This movie was a big phenomenon.

"""You're a cliché. You're nowhere...on your way to no place"". - Stephanie Mangano","""Saturday Night Fever"" is a late 70's classic coming-of-age film. When I saw this movie, in a packed theater on Staten Island, New York in the winter of 1977 the people around me seemed to miss the point. When Karen Lynn Gorney's character Stephanie tells John Travolta's Tony he's going nowhere the audience booed her & clapped for his response, ""What the ""f"" you got? A stairway to the stars?"" After the film's release, some people were emulating Tony's friend's negative & sometimes stereotypical behavior. The movie's message was to better yourself, but some people just didn't get this simple premise. Karen Lynn Gorney was excellent as Stephanie Mangano, the business person/Manhattanite wannabe who mesmerized Tony Manero. Although she was about 32 at the time, she was playing a 20 year old (this was common casting practice in the 70's). My favorite scene is the touching moments when Tony tells Stephanie all he knows about the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge symbolizes Tony's desire to get out of Brooklyn. If it had been The Brooklyn Bridge this scene would have made more sense, because the Verrazano Bridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, not Manhattan (a place we're their lives will supposedly get better). The language is authentic, the clothing, music & dancing are filled with 70's nostalgia. The film is NOT politically correct in any way. Therefore, it's very realistic, ""in-your-face"", & represents the time & place in which it was made. If you have an interest in late 70's pop culture this movie is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic movie.,"Karen Lynn Gorney's performance in this movie is worthy of accolades. She carries this movie and makes this movie into a powerful dramatic story about two young persons who are forced to confront the truth about themselves and as a result grow up.There aren't enough accolades to describe this movie. It is one of the great movie musicals not only because of the great acting, exceptional music, excellent musical numbers and exceptional choreography, but because of the story itself. Instead of fluff, the movie presents a strong, engaging story that is timeless. As a result, the movie avoids becoming a period piece which makes it as watchable today as when it was first released in 1977.The term ""classic"" is a word that should be used sparingly, especially for Hollywood movies which for the most part are pot-boiler remakes of remakes of remakes, crass commercial products utterly devoid of any artistic originality. However, this movie is a classic. It has withstood the test of time and presents a complex story with themes that are as relevant today as they were when this movie was released thirty years ago. This surprisingly unique movie dramatizes a wide range of social issues that still plague society today. These issues include alienation, racial strife, family discord, class conflict and other symptoms of social pathology that if anything have intensified. The movie's power is further enhanced by the excellent acting and timeless music that together with a compelling story make this movie something special, not just another commercial product but a work of art, a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
There's not much going on in those tight trousers!,"Saturday Night Fever (1977) -Wow! I can't believe how uninteresting this film was. What was the actual point of it?I saw that another reviewer had called it the 'Rocky' (1976) of Disco and I totally agree, because that film was also a huge disappointment. It has hints of 'Goodfellas' and 'Raging Bull' too with it's stereotypically loud and angry bunch of sexist Italian-American men.Did they create the term ""Male Chauvinist Pig"" as a result of this film, because that's what Mr Travolta and his friends all are. They all clearly love themselves and none more so than John Travolta's Tony who, in fairness, seems to be the only one that's capable of doing anything. He's the best dancer and the only one that can handle himself in a fight as well as deal with the ladies. I know he was the lead, but the hero worship towards him was a bit much. And what sort of hero? Usually, even in films about Nazi's, there is some small appeal to the characters, despite the hideous things that they do, but none of them are attractive or have anything going for them.The character of Stephanie is right when she says that Tony is a nobody going nowhere. So why make a film about him? I can only assume that the original story had more going for it and the censors or producers have taken the essence that made it interesting away from it.It's odd when you consider what a likeable guy he played as Danny in 'Grease' (1978), he was still a rogue, but one that you could get behind, because he really didn't mean any harm, but this guy is just vile.There is no denying his ability to dance, but his moves certainly lend themselves to the rumours that John is gay and perhaps that's why the character is such a b@st@rd to the ladies?Bobby's character was incredibly frustrating and even Stephanie has no real hope of getting away from it all. I felt nothing for her even after John got a ""bit"" handsy.The one huge positive is, of course, the outstanding soundtrack and not just the tunes by the Gibb Brothers. There are some real crackers in here. And it is the only reason it scores as highly as it does for me.I actually found a lot of it incredibly uncomfortable and not just the bits where I was meant to. I lost interest early on, but stuck with it to tick it off, but I have no interest whatsoever in seeing the sequel after watching this and there is no chance that I will ever revisit it.121.22/1000.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

This Was It . . .,". . . the flick that made ""John Travolta,"" a household name. Looking at this late 70s film in 2002, it's easy to see why this happened.""Saturday Night Fever"" offers an extremely impressive ""guido"" type characterization by Travolta. He's not only got the handsome Italianesque features (complete with clef chin) great bod and sensual manner, but also displays brilliant disco dancing and strong acting skills.Travolta's solid work dominates a film which, unfortunately is a mixed bag. Great 70s music, pulsating disco scenes, and a potential paean to teen under-achievers, is mildly defeated by a director and editor with apparently limited abilities or vision.Director John Badham allows the film to fall apart, as Editor David Rawlins sloppily cuts, splices and fades in odd manners.  True, the original version is much more coherent (and the ten minutes excised in an attempting a PG rating further undermines its continuity).But Writers Nik Cohn and Norman Wexler also seem to run out of steam, not quite knowing just where they want their story to go, or exactly what kind of statement they want to make.  The result is more murky confusion than inventive surprise, and the viewer is left with decidedly mixed feelings.It's interesting to note that, to date, ""Saturday Night Fever"" represents Travolta's career peak.  Not that he hasn't tried in a long line of subsequent films, and one appreciates his hard-working efforts (with his total career being financially very successful).  Still, his work in this film has guaranteed that the name, ""Travolta,"" is forever enshrined in the annals of Hollywood history.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Completely captures a time & place,"This movie is as great as any other from the 1970's.  I was seventeen when this was released, so I saw it at least twenty times.

You should be dancing,"The rap on SNF today is that it is dated. The music, the dance moves, the clothes, and this supposedly detracts from the film. Personally I don't get this, every film that is about a specific place and time ends up 'dated'. Some even start out that way. If a movie was made today in 2012, about the disco scene from the mid 70's, wouldn't they use similar music, dance moves and fashions as SNF does? The 'dated' complaint is senseless, in my opinion.Saturday Night Fever begins with a lot of visceral energy as we learn about Tony Manero and his obsession with disco dancing and hanging with his lower class Italian crew. There is a vibrancy to the film that jumps off the screen. As the thin plot unwinds, some of the energy unwinds with it.There is a raw appeal to the street milieu that carries us through some of the more pedestrian scenes and conversations, but as expected, it is when the music is playing and the feet are moving that Saturday Night Fever comes alive.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Standing the test of time, 40 years later","""Saturday Night Fever"" was released in 1977, meaning that this year marks the 40th anniversary. My local art-house theater here in Cincinnati had the good sense to hold a one-off special screening to commemorate the event (more in that later). I can't recall when was the last time I had seen the film, and in fact I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first time I saw it again in its entirety since I saw it during its original release (in Belgium, where I grew up, the movie was released in Spring of 1978, if memory serves me right).Here some comments, in no particular order, having re-seen the film after all these years: 1. The music! Yes, the music! it remains the best feature of the film, and all of those Gibb Brothers-penned tunes are nothing short of a classic, every single one of them. 2. The dancing! John Travolta is as smooth as silk as he dances his way onto the dance floor and busts those disco moves. Love the scene when the entire floor dances along in unison to the Bee Gees' ""Night Fever"". And then there is Travolta's long solo during the Bee Gees' ""You Shouls Be Dancing"". Wow, just wow. 3. I had forgotten how many social commentaries and undercurrents there were in the film: tension within Tony's family, Tony's brother pulling a shocker, peer pressure among Tony's friends to 'fit in', even more pressure on the girls--if it all sounds contemporary, well, it is of course. They played out in society 40 years ago, and today--albeit not the exact same way of course. 4. The Travolta character gets a raise from his boss to $4/hr. Wonder how much that is in today's dollars? Almost $17! (Current federal minimum wage is $7.25.) 5. The age difference between Travolta and Gorney is much more noticeable to me now than it was for me as a kid (i was 17 watching it back then). 6. I was surprised at the number of F bombs throughout the movie (I don't know what version I saw in Belgium, the original R-rated version, or the subsequent revised PG version). 7. Seeing New York in 1977 like this, it feels like a bombed-out post-apocalyptic place, outright scary and depressing.Bottom line: SNF stands the test of time, 40 years later, and then some. The Sunday matinée one-off screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, mostly people in my age group (I am 57). The event was co-sponsored by one of the city ""oldies"" radio station, and everyone had a great time, hooting and hollering in the beginning when Travolta was walking as the Bee Gees ""Stayin' Alive"" was blasting from the screen.

"A good history lesson, however.......","Saturday Night Fever may indeed be the one movie from the seventies which had the greatest influence on people. This doesn't keep it from being a very bad movie.It's not altogether bad though. The cinematography is great, especially the interior scenes from the nightclub where Travolta is dancing. And of course there isn't words enough to congratulate the choreography for the dancing scenes. The props, the haircuts and the clothing is so in keeping with the time, and at the same time it created the fashion for the time to come. The music is simply outstanding with the soundtrack being the best selling for many years. They even manage to fit the music in with the movie.These are the good things about this movie and neither of them are a good reason to watch it today. It's simply out of time and not just from a fashion point of view. The characters are bad developed and every one of them, except for Travolta occasionally and his brother, is either a lame unpleasant prick or just plain stupid. The language the characters use speaks for itself.In the beginning of the film, Travolta is one of those ""pricks"" but he goes through some level of growth and you can actually manage to discern some sort of intelligence and humanity in him. This is, as I said before, more than you can say about the rest of the characters in this mess. If people in the seventies were like the gang which Travolta hangs out with, I'm glad that I was spared from that age (being born in 1979).The story is about Tony (and NO, he does not look like Al Pacino!); a dreaming young man who lives in Brooklyn. Daytime he is working in a paint store and at night he is driving around with his ""cool"" gang, fighting with (and sometimes tries to kill!!) another gang and hanging out at a disco called ""2001"". Here Tony is the king of the dancefloor. Actually he is so good that the dancing crowd disperses and makes a space in the middle for him to ""shake his thing"" while they stand around and watch him. Then there is a dance contest and Tony teams up with a girl who he falls in love with and they start to practice together. This leads up to a number of circumstances and situations around which the movie circulates.In spite of all the terrible things Tony do throughout the movie, you actually care for him in the end (and that's quite an achievement).However, this movie is just sad. It's vulgar, sexistic and even boring at some parts. Don't watch it! Unless you are about my age and want to see what it looked like when your parents were young and went out dancing. Also, Travolta does a fine job and was indeed very well casted. So if you have a small budget and have to choose between the movie or the soundtrack......Well, you know what my choice would be.** 1/2 out of *****",,Anonymous,Music
good,"I am black man who was 16 or 17 and I was in a integrated high school in Brooklyn when I went to see this movie in 1977. I did not know any white kids in their family life, but I knew a lot of white kids especially Italians from the neighborhood betrayed in this movie. I thought the way he talked and the way they dressed was true to many of my classmates. The leather jackets, the hairstyles and the Brooklyn accents were excellent.The nerd character was a bit of Hollywood, the chance of Tony and his other friends hanging with him is unlikely and just for storyline.From the outside looking in. I thought the Tony character acted like at least three or four people that I knew from school at the time. I thought it was much better acting than his Barbarino character in Welcome Back Kotter.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Appaling Stereotyping,"Some years after SNF was released, the British author of the popular, supposedly fact based and researched article on which the film was based admitted he fabricated the entire tale and never even set foot in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where the film is set. That the story had no basis in reality was apparent to me when I saw the film at the time of its release, as I was a resident of Tony's neighborhood. Except for the dancing and music, everything about this film is repulsive, with the most appalling ethnic stereotypes imaginable. Almost none of the characters were remotely likable or sympathetic, and the plot is ridiculous.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Spectacular,"I don't think I've ever appreciated this movie as much as I do now (along with enjoying the great disco songs).

New York Man -Walk the Talk,"There is magic of the disco in the 70s, as a transition kid ( too young for the disco ) who's too excited to see my elder siblings dress up and go to the disco in their teased hair and Vanderbilt jeans, this film is heaven-sent to kids like me who love to dance. It was rated R in those days so I relied on the retelling of my sister ( who edited the explicit part ) to me until I was old enough to see it for myself. By that time the hype is over but the memory of me cutting this out of the newspaper as a 'gotta watch movie 'I know I made the right choice. I can not imagine any actor doing the dancing as John Travolta did. He is the swag jumping out of the dictionary, strutting, enchanting the viewer. It also has a realistic depiction of how the poverty, religious beliefs and hardship of the working class family was in those days. Also the recklessness of youth, the lack of communication between friends, blind ambition are universal topics of then and now. It has a shoulder-shrug ending which up to now many people didn't get so my one point deduction is for that.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely Exhilarating!,"Now this is a classic! It's funny (""Al Pachino!"") sad, raw and affecting. Plus one of the best soundtracks in film history! Johnny T. gives one of his best performances ('sides Fiction) as Tony, a Brooklyn toughie who works at a paint shop, gets laid, hangs out his his low life friends and burns the dance floor every saturday night. THis film is about how he starts to hate his racist, hateful life in Brooklyn and wants to escape from his pals and his dysfunctional family to Manhattan. As i said before, this Movie is raw, the last scenes with Tony and his friends when he realizes that he hates his life is powerful stuff. The dance scenes are great too.

A steamingly hot John Travolta and Bee Gees' immaculate music,"The wonderful, glossy disco culture was abruptly killed off by some bitter dissenters insecure of their own manhood during the so-called ""disco backlash"" in the summer of 1979, but luckily it lives on thanks to this profound and stylish film from John Badham, starring a steamingly hot John Travolta and Bee Gees' immaculate music. The script by Norman Wexler may well include one or two slight cheesinesses (including the climax at the bridge), but the writing is completely eclipsed by the atmosphere, style and testosterone captured on camera here. Few films have captured an era better than Saturday Night Fever, and Badham recognises and makes the most of the purity and edge that is created at the intersection between 1970s youth culture, Travolta's buoyant energy, and the pulsating disco music. Today the film works as dual escapism, but it's no less relevant and no less valid than it was back in 1977 because the essence it captures is timeless - even if the wonderful music turned out to be ephemeral.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Dancing, Not So Great Characters","John Travolta is Tony, a 19-year-old paint store employee in NYC who has an unhappy life with his family and a lowlife group of friends, and who goes to a disco every Saturday night with said friends, where he shines while dancing and basks in glory while he is there. He meets other dancers, including a girl who also can dance well, but she rebuffs him.That is the theme of the movie, of course, that Tony is only happy on the dance floor and is not happy otherwise, not even having adventures with his clique. Not without cause; his religious mother is stifling, and his friends conflict with other ethnic gangs like themselves. Tony can dance, but can he find happiness?The story is a microcosm of mid-'70's New York City and its culture and inhabitants, not all sympathetic. You can enjoy the dancing and the music if nothing else.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Dancing Revelation,"As the film opened with John Travolta coolly walking down the street in his posh gear with background music, 'Staying alive' playing I knew this was going to be a great period classic. We all have feelings about films and straight away from the chilled upbeat music I knew why older audiences talk highly over this period musical drama.The unknown artist at the time, Travolta laid down his mark in film history by playing the part of the central protagonist Tony Manero, an upbeat but concerned character who has troubles with his family and friends but releases his stress on the dance floor.The main reason why this film was captivating was the slickness of the character. His joyous upbeat character is convincing but viewers can associate with the stress he is going through to. Travolta's dancing is terrific. His movements on the dance floor are enjoyable and energetic. Seeing him in one of his best performances has inspired me to be more involved with the dancing industry.Has Travolta ever topped this performance? Pulp Fiction and Grease people may argue but he is convincing as the slick styled emotionally paranoid character but this is certainly one of the best, if not the best.Juxtaposing Travolta with Karen Lynn Gorney was a very effective method to bring a sociable element to the 1977 classic. His relationship on stage with Lynn Gorney is terrific as the pair performance brilliantly together, expressing their own opinions and dancing with their heart and souls on their sleeves.The film really captures the essence of the late 70's where dancing was all a rage and meant something, unfortunately unlike today where dancing has become as influential as Travolta's recent performances e.g. 'Be Cool and 'The Punisher'.The film is successful because of its phenomenal soundtrack. With such classics as 'Stayin Alive', 'Night Fever', 'Disco Inferno' and 'More than a woman' plus many others, it's a dancing revelation and is too likable to be hated.The mode of address is well developed to captivate the late 70's. The classic suits, the discos, and the cars and buildings to conform to the rough surroundings and create a very effective mise en scene.Its all about the beginning and getting 'Into the groove' and getting to know the different opinions from the parents and late teens about dancing and through this method of arguing and debates the film expresses emotional ideologies and viewers can associate their own views with the characters.The first half of the movie was fast flowing with different ideologies about dancing, families and work very convincing in short scenes. Though the whole film is like that I personally felt the latter stages of the film were over done with too much conversation at times but its minimal criticism for a film that is very emotional but truly conforming to different ideas and is therefore a much watch for anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie about disco,"Rated R for strong language, sexuality/nudity, drug content and some violence.Saturday Night Fever was John Travolta's breakthrough film.After this film and Grease, he would not be famous again until Pulp Fiction in 1994.There are two versions of Saturday Night Fever.The original R-rated version and an edited PG version which is hard to find on VHS(not released on DVD) but is the one which is used for the edited for TV version of Fever.It is cut by approx 6min.Anyway Travolta's acting is very good in this film and the storyline is pretty good as well.A bit boring at times but the soundtrack is excellent.I actually bought the soundtrack a couple of years ago.The film is about a young man living in Brooklyn.Everyday, him and his friends go to a disco to hang around and dance.Travolta is a very good disco dancer.One day him and this girl he likes try to win the dance competition which is being held there.Saturday NIght Fever is an interesting film which portrays disco in the 1970's.This is actually the film which helped popularize disco.Worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Only if you stop minding,"It's enough for me when a film has spontaneity and spirit, what the Spanish call duende; it's okay to not be sophisticated, to not try to think up everything, there's no surer way after all of reaching your limits of observation (and all art is that) than an intellectual approach.This observes in a simplistic way, a young dance hero at the local disco has to envision life ahead of just tonight. He works in a store by day, gets slapped upside the head by his Italian dad for being late for dinner and only minds that it messes up his hairdo, not the indignity.By night though he commands the stage, life acquires shape, colorful order out of the swirl, and this is the beauty of dance and dance films in general; expression that ritually transforms scattered reality, and we see this wonderfully on the disco floor, room is cleared for him, he acts out with the whole body, and the moves are not stupendously choreographed such as you'd see in a Gene Kelly confection, they look goofy now, much parodized as silly.I like this in much the same way I like Showgirls. Easy to be critical of both, to find the protagonists and overall worldview vacant and catty. Easy also to run into trouble in the effort to prop either as somehow profound satire that is above what it shows; it's not, even though the moral is creating a safe ordinary life outside the dance.But it has a bit of the spirit that many films lack. This is all epitomized in Travolta; it's not necessarily in the moves, he could do it of course, but it's more than just suaveness that attracts, the dance scenes are few after all. It's in the eyes of innocent swagger, in not being afraid to stupidly dance at the edge of the Brooklyn bridge.",,Anonymous,Music
CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""Ah, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' Alive, Stayin' Alive!""There isn't a person alive today who hasn't heard that song. ""Saturday Night Fever"" helped to define an era when disco ruled the charts, a time when you worked all week just so you could blow your money at the local discothèque every Saturday night. This movie propelled John Travolta to stardom, making him a household name. For what was best about the late 70's, look no further.Tony Manero (Travolta) is a 19-year-old who still lives in his parents' house, works in a dead-end job at a hardware store, and who is trying hard to get some respect living under the shadow of his older brother who has become a priest. Not finding this respect at home, he finds it on the dance floor at the local discothèque called Odyssey 2000 - where he rules the night. It is a coming of age story set against the backdrop of a dance contest, his brother's decision to leave the faith, and a fateful bridge that would serve to play an important part of his life.I was about 9 years old when this movie was released to theaters, so I didn't get to see this until much later, but it still had an impact on me. I decided to watch it again just the other night, and I was surprised how well it stood up, even as dated as the music from that time has become. The relationships and dialogue were still very real and a bit raw in places ... just like life. Travolta not only amazes on the dance floor, but off it as well, believably portraying the frustrated teen who is trying to be a man.I highly recommend this film. You don't even need to be a fan of disco music and it's lifestyle to have an appreciation for it. This is without a doubt one of Travolta's finest performances and it is easy to see what the attraction was all about back in the day. I have enjoyed watching this one over the years, and it still receives a solid 8 stars out of 10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic moments but mostly rancid and dumb,"Tony is a NY roughneck with a low IQ and a job in a paint store, but manages to find relief and recognition through his Saturday night disco dancing.One of the real curiosities of modern cinema, this bit of guff-among-the-grunts spawned one of the world's biggest albums and a whole disco industry; but at  the same time is clearly a thrown together script based on a short article published in a little read newspaper.(You can read it in full as part of the rock and pop anthology ""The Faber Book of Pop"" - a highly recommended read if you can find it.)I can't think of any film in which the message and style of the music contrasts more with what appears in visual form. Thank god the Bee Gee's wrote the music in glorious isolation to the crass, dark and ugly images.Here we have death, gang rape, homophobia (thrown in twice in case you went to the bathroom the first time around), racism, violence and family conflict. Like a checklist from the cheap thrills section of the Bumper Book of Teen Movie Clichés. Yes these things exist in real life, but surely we need a point to go along with them? So much that happens here has no consequence or knock-on effect, beyond things like a token cop scribbling on his notepad before tipping his hat.Take away the music and the dancing (which are sadly brief) and what you have is two hours trapped with foul-mouthed morons who spit out their food as they talk (boy has that John T actually swallowed a few burgers since those days!) and walk on the tables to leave.SNF is one of those movies that would be better if no one saw it as a whole, but only saw via those brief clips we see on TV  - especially those played out against the Bee Gee's better work.Yes Travolta can dance and is a bit double jointed, but he isn't that good. He doesn't even really win the contest down at the 2001 Disco. Let's not get too carried away here, he is still only a talented amateur impressing the locals who don't know any better.If you watch it on video you should  at least keep your finger on the fast forward and rewind button.

Interesting character piece that could have been better but it is the dancing and soundtrack that make it memorable,"Tony Manero lives in Brooklyn with his parents, grandmother and younger sister. His brother is a priest and he feels like for every bit of pride that his parents have in Frank, it is equalled with the sense of disappointment that they have for Tony and his sister. Spending his days working in a hardware store, the one thing that Tony actually enjoys and feels he is good at is disco dancing, and he is a star in his local club. When he meets the annoyingly bitchy Stephanie he gains a dancing partner for an upcoming competition, although she is a difficult character and not the sort of female relationship that he is used to being with. With all this around him Tony tries to look forward to a direction in his life.I noticed this film coming back onto television recently and I wasn't going to watch it because I had already seen it a few years ago. However, when I thought about it all I could actually remember was the famous dancing scenes - I then realised that I was actually remembering these from Airplane! Anyway, I decided to watch this again so that I could hold an opinion about it in regards more than just the dancing scenes. Watching it again I can understand why we all remember the soundtrack and dancing more than the plot, because they are the best aspects of the film. The plot is mostly a character piece with Tony at the heart of it and it is interesting enough to fill the running time as it gives us a good impression of the world he is in and his feelings. The problem comes with the fact that Tony (or anyone in the film in fact) is not that empathetic a character  he is rude, ignorant and pretty spiteful towards women. This is not to say that it damages the film but I did want the script to take me past his exterior to a greater extent than it actually did. In some ways it gets close (Tony's disbelief in his own ability works) and it is worth seeing but it needed to do more and be more consistent.The plot around the dance contest isn't that interesting but it does produce some colourful and fun dance numbers that are all played out to a superb disco soundtrack that did have me rocking in my seat. Travolta copes well with the acting and the dancing, although I would have preferred a bit more humanity in him than he brought out but then again I suppose that was the whole point. Gorney is OK but is surprisingly bland past her very obvious character. Pescow is much better and produces a character that we actually cared about even if we never really get to know her. The support cast has too much in the way of cliché and stereotype to really be effective and they didn't make much of an impression with me.Overall this is a good film but not a totally successful one. The dancing and soundtrack are both great but what was really needed was better writing. The character study is interesting enough to carry the film and make it worth seeing but it is blunt, cruel towards women and lacking any sense of humanity and realism. Worth seeing but don't expect the fame of the dance scenes to mean it is a classic film for other reasons.",,Anonymous,Music
What was all the hype about?,"I finally watched Saturday Night Fever last night. For all these years all I heard was hype and good reviews regarding the movie, but in my humble opinion, it was nothing more than a typical 1970s b-grade movie. I was very disappointed. The story is disjointed throughout, acting is very mediocre (except for John Travolta himself), the characters themselves aren't as strong as they seem intended to be, and the sound and video quality is also poor. There are several parts where the audio is almost definitely lip synchronised. (By the way, I watched the DVD version, so poor quality wasn't due to it being a worn VHS video copy). The music soundtrack is probably the only thing this movie really has going for it. I think this movie is a classic that we all have to watch at one time or another, but I don't think it's in the same category as Grease, which can be watched over and over without getting tiresome.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
One Trick Pony,"This was John Travolta's first big step from being a ""sweathog"" on Welcome Back Kotter. It was promo-ed with a lot of studio hype with a disco beat in the middle of 1977 disco-mania across the country. The big part of the promotion was Travolta on the fancy dance floor with the strobe lights.Unless you like disco, & that sequence. you will find the rest of the movie is forgettable. There is little to recommend it either though at least Vinnie Barbrino got to escape from Kotter's series. I don't know what it was but Marcia Strassman is still my vote for the worst looking sitcom wife. Even when she did Honey I Shrunk The Kids later, I never can picture her as an attractive woman.As long as you like John & that dance sequence this movie is for you. If you don't like either thing, I'd not waste my time as the rest of the movie is nothing worth watching. I am not even sure if this mess has a plot.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Saturday Night Fever,"Saturday Night Fever was a landmark film that came to symbolise the disco era of the 1970s.It was also the the first part of a two punch knockout blow star John Travolta delivered to cinema audiences. With the follow up Grease a year later, he was heading to cinema immortality, cemented 17 years later with Pulp Fiction.This should just be a silly disco movie with nothing deep about it. I was too young to watch this in the cinema, but several years later I did watch the recut PG friendly version on the big screen.It was many years later I watched the raw expletive ridden original adult version.Based on a somewhat fictional article by Nik Cohn. Travolta plays proud but dim Italian American Tony Manero. He works in a hardware store, his boss does not pay him until Monday so he does not blow his money away at the weekend.Very perceptive as Tony lives for Saturday nights where he is the king of the disco dance floor in his Brooklyn neighbourhood.With his macho friends for company. Tony attracts female attention and is not averse to get into fights. He brushes off the advances of Annette (Donna Pescow.) He does not mind dancing with her but does not want to sleep with her as that would make her a whore.When he meets the more stylish, upwardly mobile Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney.) Tony realises that maybe his life is shallow, an uneducated guy like him is going to be stuck in the hardware store for the rest of his life.Maybe there is an escape to Manhattan and leaving his life in Brooklyn behind. Just like his revered older brother decided to leave the priesthood as that was not the life for him.There is a rawness to Saturday Night Fever, it mirrors movies like Mean Streets, Serpico and Rocky. Tony has posters of Al Pacino and Sly Stallone in his bedroom.Of course there are also classic disco songs, mainly by the Bee Gees. What makes the movie is the various dance scenes, especially the iconic solo dance moves to the song You Should Be Dancing.The movie attracted critical acclaim when it was released. It was not a movie that critics were sniffy about and puzzled why it managed to be such as a big public hit. Critic Gene Siskel cited it as his favourite ever movie.Travolta got a Best Actor nomination, the movie set the template for a dance movie for many year to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

surprisingly trashy artifact,"The moment is firmly over for this, but I'm not a joiner, so I'm just getting around to it. I guess I'll get to Rocky this week too.This is much more grotesque than I imagined it would be. Watching insecure, self-involved, low-class Brooklyn Italians is about as appealing as it sounds. The slim plot stops completely for the dance numbers just like a musical. The idiot who grows up (a little) storyline just doesn't hold much interest. Every aspect of this study of 70s meathead priorities is grotesque; unsubtle stereotypes, travolta in a speedo, hideous chicks, fried hair, terrible dancing, people who couldn't find a beat if you were pounding them with a hammer.This is like junior Scorcese. This is the culture that needs to be saved from gay marriage? I still know meatheads who get on the dance floor and make the pointy move from this.

"Still Stayin' Alive, More Than 40 Years Later","Where to begin??Is it the polyester suits? Is it the disco mirror balls? Is it the Bee Gees? Is it the charisma of John Travolta?Well, the answer to all four of these questions is YES.More than four decades since it was unleashed onto a not-entirely-unsuspecting world at the end of 1977, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains one of the cultural touchstone movies of the late 1970s, admittedly dated in some places (sometimes a bit too painfully obvious), but timeless in far more ways than one. Its story of Travolta's working-class New York City tough Tony Manero getting onto the dance floor at the 2001 Odyssey club and showing his stuff to escape his oppressive family life, but seemingly unable to commit to either one of the two women (Donna Pescow; Karen Lynn Gorney) that he finds there, is a true microcosm, not only of the era in general but also of the much-reviled Disco craze in particular. Nik Cohn's story ""Tribal Rites Of The New Saturday Night"" provided a whole lot for screenwriter Norman Wexler to conjure up, and he had a lot of help from Travolta, who had first become a star on TV via the 1976 TV film THE BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE and the hit TV sitcom ""Welcome Back Kotter"", then on the big screen as Nancy Allen's toady boyfriend in Brian DePalma's 1976 horror classic CARRIE. He is also helped by the sure-footed (to use a well-turned phrase) direction of John Badham, who had had many credits for television but, prior to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, only one big screen credit (1976's THE BINGO LONG TRAVELLING ALL-STARS & MOTOR KINGS). Besides all the great dance sequences, there is also the famous scene of Travolta and his friends playing a dangerous game of chicken on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge while a horrified Pescow looks on, set to ""Night On Disco Mountain"", a discofied adaptation, by David Shire, of Modest Mussorgsky's terrifying 1867 symphonic tone poem ""A Night On Bald Mountain"".Made for what nowadays seems like a ridiculously low budget of only $3 million, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not only a huge box office hit, grossing something like close to a quarter of a billion dollars, but also unleashed a 2-LP soundtrack album that went on to spend twenty-six straight weeks atop Billboard's album chart and sell close to 40 million copies, making it one of the most successful album releases ever. That the film should have been as successful as it was is kind of amazing even now, considering how rough the street language in it was, making it unsuitable for unaccompanied minors and thus warranting the 'R' rating that it got. Even so, it's hard to forget the impact it had on popular culture, with a wall-to-wall soundtrack that included not only the Bee Gees, but Yvonne Elliman, MFSB, Ralph MacDonald, Tavares, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more-a soundtrack that still keeps selling like crazy even to this day.It is instructive to look back at this film, and realize that the craze it depicted was the subject of a lot of invective from the so-called ""Disco Sucks!!"" crowd, a bunch of disaffected rock and roll fans of the time who railed against Disco as a ""threat"" to their music, which, being a classic rock fan myself, I always found overblown. Rock music wasn't consumed by either the Disco craze or by this film and its soundtrack, far from it. Given that, and everything contained in it, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains a truly classic film, worthy of many viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

More Than Dancing,"Gene Siskel's favorite film. Although ""Saturday Night Fever'' appealed to him primarily on an emotional level, Siskel spoke about it in terms of its themes, and there are two central ones. First, the desire of all young people to escape from a life sentence of boring work and attain their version of the beckoning towers of Manhattan. Second, the difficulty that some men have in relating to women as comrades and friends and not simply sex facilitators.There is a scene in the movie where the hero, Tony Manero, sits on a bench with Stephanie, the girl he loves, and tells her all about one of the bridges out of Brooklyn: Its height, length, how many cubic yards of concrete went into its making--and you can taste his desire to cross that bridge and leave Brooklyn behind. Earlier, Stephanie has described him in a few brutal words: ""You live with your parents, you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a cliché. You're nowhere, going' no place.'' Tony senses that she is right.No one wonder Saturday Night Fever is still Stayin' Alive!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What makes Saturday Night Fever a great film?,"What makes Saturday Night Fever a great film? Before this can be answered, it must be acknowledged that this is far from perfect film making, and that there is more than one weak spot in the plot structure. On top of that, the performance quality is fairly uneven, in regards to the supporting cast.Again  What makes Saturday Night Fever a great film?  First and foremost, it is the stellar performance by John Travolta. Travolta's portrayal of Tony Manero is all at once, vulnerable, crass, intelligent (his portrayal, NOT Tony), and tragic.  Travolta's dancing some 25 years later is still of the more memorable in cinematic history.As far as the soundtrack  forget everything OTHER than the Bee Gees. The music is not only still great, but is the only quality disco music period.Finally, the opening sequence in which Travolta steps off a Brooklyn subway car and begins a swagger back to the paint store in which he works is in my opinion, the most tantalizing scene of the film. This is I would argue, one of the most powerful and dazzling opening scenes in movie history, and Travolta plays it to perfection.SureSaturday Night Fever is a dated film. The clothing is ridiculous by today's standards and there is more than one scene that would have the politically correct movement of today be up in arms.  Despite this, Travolta's best performance of his career (at 23, Travolta was nominated for Best Actor), along with the mostly-Bee Gees soundtrack, make Saturday Night Fever a great film today.",,Anonymous,Music

Travolta with cool dance moves and the Bee Gees,"Tony Napero is a real smooth Brooklyn fellow, who likes to dance some disco.Then he finds this perfect dance partner, Stephanie Mangano.This could be his dream girl.Saturday Night Fever (1977) is a disco movie classic, directed by John Badham.You can't think of a better guy to act the lead than John Travolta.His mother Helen and sister Ann are also seen in the movie.Karen Lynn Gorney makes a really good female lead.Great work by guys who play Tony's friends, Barry Miller (Bobby C.), Joseph Cali (Joey) and Paul Pape (Double J.).Donna Pescow is terrific as Annette.Val Bisoglio and Julie Bovasso are brilliant as Tony's parents Frank and Flo.Martin Shakar is very good as the priest brother Frank.And Lisa Peluso as sister Linda.Sam Coppola is great as the boss Dan Fusco.Robert Costanzo is in a small role as Paint store customer.Fran Drescher makes her movie debut as Connie.What makes this a really great movie is the music by the Gibb brothers, Barry, Robin and Maurice.The group is known as the Bee Gees.Their hits like ""Stayin' Alive"", ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""More Than a Woman"" really get you going.And Travolta really has the dance moves.He really rocks the dance floor.The drama of this movie works, too.Like when they're on that bridge and something dramatic takes place there.Watch this movie once, twice or as many times as you like and you will find that disco will never be dead.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Relevant at the time,"I saw this at the cinema when it came out in 1977, I was a teenager and it was a reflection of the youth and disco era at the time. It was my era, the clothes, the music, the attitudes, spot on. John Travolta made his name with this film, the BeeGees came back into prominence with their amazing soundtrack ( I had it on cassette) numerous men donned the famous white suit, it was a sensation. Now when I watch it, it looks so dated and surprisingly Travolta's next film has gained more prominence in recent times, Grease, but Saturday Night Fever will always be up there for me, a nostalgic film for me now, but it was great!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"This sounds repetitive, but it's true.","After reading several other comments on the film, I have to concur; the only reason to watch this film is for the dancing. The one-note, whiny plot about how hard it is to be a teenager in New York had me screaming at the screen, ""GET A LIFE, PEOPLE!"" I didn't see the film until a few years ago (I was 6 when it hit the theatres, and was dying to see Travolta dance; my parents went to see it, and walked out halfway through, thoroughly disgusted),and my wife refused to sit through it after hearing how repugnant the language was. I can't honestly say that I blame her now. Like Midnight Cowboy, this film left me with a nasty taste in my mouth.   This presents a golden opportunity for Paramount when they get around to releasing this one on DVD.How about releasing a disc that (through the wonders of seamless branching) has both the PG and R rated versions on it? Not only would this appease those of us who were repulsed by the R rated version, but it would be a piece of history, a piece of nostalgia. Just a thought.....",,Anonymous,Music
"Saturday Night Fever is a fun, and really great movie!","It's a really great movie! You got amazing dancing and choreography. Wonderful music and soundtrack. It's really groovy and 70s-ish. Also, great acting, John Travolta and the other actors did wonderful jobs in portraying their characters. This movie also has a good story. The plot was really well done, although the ending is kind of sad, which is the only drawback. But otherwise, the story is really good! You can just feel the conflict that the characters are having within themselves and with the other characters. That's great acting too. It's just really great! It's fun. It's fun to watch John Travolta cut amazing shapes on the dance floor and it's fun to listen to the beautiful bee gees soundtrack, especially night fever. It's just really good! Great movie!!

Not a single likeable character in the entire film,"Travolta is a violent rapist. Treats everyone like they are worthless, especially the women. His parents are caricatures--they are supposed to be people who give Travolta no respect. But instead they are just over-exaggerated, poorly-acted nincompoops. You can't take anyone seriously in this film. Everybody is so over the top.It is an ugly film. Even the dancing is ordinary.The acting is second rate. The characters the actors depict are people you would cross the street to avoid. 11-year-old boys in men's bodies.What is the appeal of this film? We couldn't wait until it was over, so we could go take showers.P.s. Disco dancing is a poor excuse for real dancing. Hard to believe it was popular for awhile.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Brilliant,"I didn't live the time when SNF has premiered; but this movie fascinates me, from the first time I saw it when I was 5 or 6 years old in TV, and this fascinated me, and years after, I danced like Travolta in a performance in the elementary school; it has something that makes me enjoy it in a different way, it has everything, it's interesting, entertaining, exciting and it's definitely a very would.One of the things that fascinates me about this great movie is its music, I love the music of the Bee Gees and since I saw Tony Manero walking with the paint pot I got hooked with the character.The scenes on the dance floor are spectacular, each one seems iconic and not only the scenes in the club are good, the background story or above is just as good, it's interesting, you can see the evolution of John Travolta's character and the life he has.Here they show with great success the life and behavior of many adolescents of that time and some of the consequences that will occur if they continue with that lifestyle I have immaturity.In short, a very complete film, very serious and a classic of the 70s.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Other Than the Soundtrack, There's Really Nothin' *That Great* About the Movie!","I really wanted to rent this movie and watch it, partly because it looked interesting and partly because everyone kept saying how good it is. What luck! I finally find some time and rent the movie! As I sat watching it for the first few minutes, as the movie opened with John Travolta doing his little funky walk thingy to the paint store with the Bee Gees music in the background, it seemed like it was going to be a good movie. But, and please don't sue me after I say this--the rest of the movie was just pretty downhill from there.Yeah, sure, you could say ""What about all those great dance moves John Travolta did on the floor??"" or ""Don't forget that romantic scene with Toni and Stephanie dancing in the studio!"" or something like that. Well, I myself have never really been the romantic type, and some of the dance scenes were just....well...I just didn't like them. They either went on too long or were kina cheesy, ya know?? I have nothing against John Travolta--he's a very good actor and played his part well in this movie--but I wouldn't say that this was the best of his films. I mean, some parts were too confusing or too boring or too cheesy. I really don't get that part where Toni and his pals all go and get busted up at that Chinese restaurant, or whatever. Plus, what's this bridge deal got to do with anything? See how confused I already am?! :-)Another thing is that some parts of ""Saturday Night Fever"" were just unenjoyable to watch. I wanted to watch the movie with a member of my family or someone, and, well, frankly, I'm *glad* I didn't. And does every other sentence really have to have the F word in it? It gets kind of old after a while, people.Well, I just want to say that I really don't like this movie at all, and think it hasn't really lived up to what everybody says about it. Like I said, I have nothing against John Travolta or any of the actors/actresses in this movie. Writers, maybe, but actors, no. Maybe I'm just keeping my expectations too high. Maybe I just don't know a good movie when I see one. But I think that if it weren't for the great Bee Gees soundtrack, I would ditch this movie altogether.",,Anonymous,Music
It's funny how serious this movie takes itself,"I kind of wish I wouldn't have watched Saturday Night Fever. It's a dated, melodramatic mess. Instead of story, they have strutting. Instead of character development, they have choreography. Instead of dialog, they have dancing. This movie is a joke, but the only funny thing about it is how seriously it takes itself. And there really isn't anyone to root for. None of the characters are likeable. It's also a lot more offensive than I anticipated. The soundtrack may be the only good thing that came out of Saturday Night Fever being made and now, after watching it, I like the songs a little bit less.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
the days of wine and disco.....,"Saturday Night Fever. Just the name evokes memories. It's hard not to feel nostalgic remembering this movie. Being someone who grew up knowing the magic of disco, I  definetly remember the glittziness and glitter of this early travolta movie. But I still wouldn't call it one of the best pics ever made as many reviewers before me had indicated.I think this movie stands up as being a major influence on other movies as well as having some of the best music ever seen in a movie-and that's for sure-the music is addicting. And the dance numbers were pretty cool to.But the story itself is just good for me-ok maybe VERY good-I'll admit I am a much bigger fan of ""Grease"" then Saturday Night Fever. I will say the movie nailed the atmosphere to a tee. Another reviewer recently posted on here talking about aspects of superficiality and I agree. In the disco era, as in many others, image is everything. That's the type of environment that can have more then a little negative impact after awhile if it gets into your skin.It's hard to see this now and not be taken back in time but even now, I like this less for the story then for the incredible sizzling music that very few movies before and after have ever been able to duplicate so effectively.I give Saturday Night Fever a 12 out of 10 for the music but about an 8 for the movie as a whole.

"Love it or not, SNF is a Cultural Touchstone","I saw it in the movies back in the day.Must have seen it a dozen times since ( in part, on TV).The story is pure Brooklyn. I can vouch as I was born in raised next door in Jackson Heights. Yes. It's a bit corny, but a wonderfully engaging corny. And for what the film wants you to know about the characters, it could not have been written, presented and edited more perfectly.The Music is undeniably sensational and it's the singular, defining aspect of the entire film. This happens sometimes in cinema- The same way the music began to drive and take over the film, ""Oh, Brother"" by the Coens.This is The BeeGees at the height of their pop/music power. ""Stayin' Alive"" has one of those spectacular, infectious beats that, no matter what music you love, it never fails to thrill. The music defines every emotional aspect of the film, almost as if the film was simply a dramatic backdrop.And the Ballads are pure 70's perfection, as the 70's may have been the defining decade for pop music ballads. (Think ""Philadelphia Soul""- one of the greatest American musical art forms). The great ballads in SNF are the polar opposite of those god-awful ""power"" ballads"" sung by cheesy morons wearing spandex and headbands.All in, SNF is a pure American Classic and it defined the late 1970' global, popular culture- Art imitates Life- imitates Art.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very hard to watch, not a movie about good music and dancing.","I heard so much about how good the dances were in this movie with John Travolta, and was willing to give this a shot, but unfortunately this is not really what this movie is about. I know this is supposed to be how it was like back then with realistic things and that it's not always going to be a lighthearted side of the world with flowers and rainbows, etc but the amount of swearing, suggestive themes and violence (including a rape scene) is very appalling. It's like after seeing these great dance scenes and music, it cuts down to people calling each other insulting names and swearing at each other, having sex in cars and explaining suggestively how they're enjoying it, or attacking one another. It's just disturbing and disgusting on how this movie is, not sure if the PG version is totally clean from this but unfortunately that version is hard to come by.

On The Sexual Politics Of Saturday Night Fever.,"What an interesting film.Travolta plays Tony Manero, a disco obsessed, paint salesman by day, who is the king of the dance floor, by night...and, perhaps most notably, also a gay man in denial - which gets to the heart of what this film is really about.Sure, you can focus on the scene itself, and the not-so-much of a love triangle involved, in exoteric fashion, while tunneling on the fact that it was based on a completely fictitious piece of bawdy journalism by Nic Cohn.But that would be missing the point.Because, when it comes down to it...it's really all about the conflicted and contrary nature of the main character, who Badham clearly portrays as a closeted homosexual, if only in an esoteric manner.Manero is an Italian street kid who is essentially coming of age, in his stomping ground of Bay Ridge- in the southwest part of Brooklyn.To this day, no film has even come close to defining the silver screen legacy of the Bay Ridge neighbourhood quite like Saturday Night Fever has.His environment and upbringing are central here - mired with a particularly-Italian sense of machismo, and a heavy dose of Catholic guilt.His dad- an out of work teamster who is coming to grips with his aging failure to remain the breadwinner of his family; and his mother- a church-going housewife, who is trying her damndest to keep the family in good standing with the Catholic God, or Jesus, or church, or whatever- treat him like the black sheep of the family, because all he does is make enough money to squander drinking and dancing his life away, at the local club each weekend.The intro of the film really does make it seem like he does it all for the ladies...but that is just a clever ruse.Because if you watch carefully enough...it's pretty obvious that he is gay, or, at the very least, bisexual (though the term pansexual, might be more aptly applied here).Firstly, he is a hair, and fashion obsessed dancing king...who can get any woman that frequents their local haunt- the 2001: Odyssey disco- simply by stepping on the dancefloor.But, while his friends are neck deep in pussy, in the back seat of their buddies car, every waking chance they get...he is less concerned with getting laid, than he is finding the perfect dance partner.And, while acting like a bigot every chance he gets- ironically targeting the very black and spanish communities that made disco what it is.When his friends harp on homosexuals, he remains presciently silent - not coming to their defense or anything; rather, omitting to engage in the acts of bigotry employed to target them.Which, itself, speaks volumes.One might, at first, argue that he tends to exhibit some borderline asexual qualities- treating the act of dancing as his sexual act of preference (over the act of sex, itself).But the almost rape scene at the end, does seem to imply that he is still subject to the implicit sexual urges you'd expect from an ego-driven 19 year old man.Which can be contextualized (if only subtly) by the sub-plot that revolves around his (up until now) ""perfect"" brother, who is on the cusp of leaving the Catholic church, after having served as a priest - no doubt because he realizes he still has urges of his own, and finds himself wanting to fulfil them (perhaps, even being gay himself, and realizing the inherent hypocrisy at the heart of the Catholic church's demonization of homosexuals).Because, if it's a film about anything (other than disco, and dancing)...it's a film about how heavy of a burden it is to carry this sort of catholic guilt around with you.Manero passes off any female advances that are directed his way- only pretending to give in when it suits his otherwise non-sexually oriented goals (ie with his original dance partner, who he uses the first convenient excuse to get out of the act with).Something Stephanie (played by Karen Lynn Gorney) realizes relatively early on- despite his explicit attempts to woo and impress her.She sees him for what he really is...and understands why he fraudulently believes he is attracted to her: because she is on his level when it comes to her appreciation for- and skill in- dancing.Which is exactly why she forgives him rather quickly after he forces himself on her...because she knows, deep down, that he's not really a threat...and understands full well that said action was the result of his Italian, Catholic, Bay Ridge upbringing...which has rendered him a homosexual in denial, burdened by the Catholic guilt imposed on him by his family.Once you consider this...it really puts things into perspective, and makes it quite the film, in regards, not only to the cultural establishment of the scene at the heart of the story...but also as a character study, in terms of an exoteric vs esoteric reading (as they are almost polar opposites of one another).Interpreting the film in this way also contextualizes the otherwise dated racial and sexual bigotry that it portrays, and helps you understand his underlying misogyny a little better.Because, without it...the film just wouldn't work.In the end, justifying it's status as a classic.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Could have been great,"My favorite dance sequence in the movies is Jack Rabbit Slim's Twist Contest from 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the next ten favorites are from 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. They all have one thing in common: John Travolta. Where 'Pulp Fiction' was also great without that sequence, 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever' are not. 'Grease' has so much singing and dancing that it is a lot of fun anyway and unfortunately 'Saturday Night Fever' has not. It is not that the rest of the movie is bad. It is all entertaining and pretty good, especially the ending is satisfying, but it could have been great instead of good.

One of the all time great movies,Great story great music great and believable acting. All around great movie.People in all over the world can understand such movie. It has a cross cultural flavor in the sense that the experiences and the types of characters that are depicted in the movie are found in all cultures. So it is easy for any viewer in any place to understand the message of the movie and related to their own experience in their own culture. The details of the experience may vary from culture to culture but in every culture the experience is the same and this universality is what this movie depicts so nicely. The naivety of the characters give the story and the acting a great measure of credibility and makes this move so believable.The music and dancing are so great and so alive.

surprisingly offense,"I love dancing, so I rented SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and was caught completely by surprise.  The film is not about the joys of dancing at all.  Instead you are bombarded with profanity, misogyny, drug use, promiscuity, racism, homophobia, suicide, and even rape.  I cannot understand how this movie is so big and popular.  All my life I've heard about this film and have encountered numerous satires.  Since when is mainstream America so accepting of such material and content?  This movie is extremely offensive and definitely adult-orientated.  I assume that all of this is just the film's reflection of the disco generation because I am already aware of their ignorance.  The disco scene was largely a ""white"" mainstream rip-off of two subcultures: the African-American and gay club scenes.  So, in that regard SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a good portrayal of that time.  I was just amazed that such a mainstream and well-known film had so much bigotry.Now, don't get me wrong.  This movie did have some credible moments (the opening sequence was fabulous!), but I was really caught off guard.  I am a fan of fun and dancing and that is why I like disco music, but I certainly did not find any in this movie.So kids, if you want to watch a movie with good old-fashion dance fun.  This movie IS NOT for you.  You'd be better off watching Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM (1992).",,Anonymous,Music

A tale of hope and ambition,"Too many people have complained that ""Saturday Night Fever"" isn't a disco movie first and urban drama second. Released at the height of disco, the film has too easily become associated with the Bee Gees soundtrack and John Travolta's white suit. These are side issues for the film, just window dressing. Sure, the soundtrack certainly evokes memories of the 1970s effectively. But the retro revival of the late 20th century ensured we became very familiar with the 1970s, so in that sense the music, the discos and the costumes can be put in the background and the audience can concentrate on the story. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is an effective drama about ambition, dreams and the harsh realities of life.The funniest thing about ""Saturday Night Fever"" is that it is essentially a film stuck in the 1970s. There is no way that Tony Manero (John Travolta) could possibly act the way he did then in today's society. Tony is essentially a bum, a dropout deadbeat in a low-paid job with no future ahead of him. The only thing Tony excels at is dancing, not professionally, but at his local disco, the amusingly titled Odyssey 2001. He and his friends live like Neanderthals, existing in a life of drugs, boredom and aggression.They are the epitome of misogyny - it's almost disturbing how lowly they regard women.Tony's life begins to change due to two factors. Firstly his brother Frank (Martin Shakar), a priest, returns home with some unexpected news. Held up as an angel by his parents, Frank's sombre return to the Manero house ignites a spark in Tony – if Frank can change, why can't he? Tony's family is generally loveless. His father (Val Bisoglio) is bitter for not having the life he always wanted, and perhaps more so because he never gave Tony the support he needed as a child. As a result Tony has grown up to be the image of his father: uneducated and going nowhere. All Tony's mother (Julie Bovasso) sees is the realisation that Frank is everything the family wanted (a Priest for a son!), while Tony is nothing but a deadbeat.The second factor that changes Tony's life is his discovery of Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). He first encounters Stephanie at the Odyssey 2001. Different to all the other girls Tony has been with, Stephanie, at least to Tony, represents a higher class of girl. He wants her, and combined with this desire is a need for change and progression. For what could be the first time in his life, Tony has ambition.As an audience we feel for Tony and share his sense of ambition to cross the bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan. In Stephanie he sees himself – a person from his own background that has made something of herself. Of course we learn that Stephanie, for all her celebrity namedropping and airs and graces, is essentially the same as Tony, possibly even more of a dreamer. While we may not connect to Tony and Stephanie – their lack of intelligence is a little overpowering at times – we want them to succeed. The scene where Tony tells Stephanie a story about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is truly touching. They both realise that they can succeed, but also, that the world is a lot more dangerous and difficult than they can ever imagine.The conclusion of the film is slightly weak and predictable, but it is generally satisfying. It is unfortunate that it takes a tragedy for Tony to finally shape up, but perhaps that was what was needed for him to turn his life around. As the credits roll we are hopeful that Tony and Stephanie will succeed but not entirely confident in their abilities.John Travolta reprised his role as Tony in the sequel ""Stayin' Alive"", directed by Sylvester Stallone. It contained some outstanding dance scenes, but lacked the grubby optimism of the original. While the dancing in ""Saturday Night Fever"" is truly brilliant, the story is an underrated and effective drama that carries the audience along a journey of hope and discovery in an unforgiving world.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Gospel According To Barry, Robin, Maurice & John","""I got the wings of heaven on my shoes/I'm a dancin' man, and I just can't lose..."" More people know ""Saturday Night Fever"" for its soundtrack than the movie. Having been one of them, I can speak to how that can skew things negatively seeing the film for the first time. The music of ""Saturday Night Fever"" is shimmering, accessible disco music of high sophistication, an aural cocoon of positive vibes. The movie, by contrast, is harsh, nasty, vulgar, and dark.Tony Manero, a kid of good instincts but mediocre intelligence, lives a life of quiet desperation, hanging around his low-life buddies and trolling after sex and various illicit thrills. He blows his small weekly wages for a brief spark of the divine, music that makes him a god, or at least an idol, to the others who come to his temple. ""Can I wipe your forehead?"" a woman asks, and as she does so it reminds one a little of Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet.Calling ""Saturday Night Fever"" a religious film feels like a stretch. If anything, the attitude of the film is fairly atheistic, especially in the way it mocks the piety of Tony's mother and showcases the fall of his brother the priest. Yet ""Saturday Night Fever"" is completely concerned with the question of transcendence, man's desire to achieve it and his inability to do so, using the grimy streets of Brooklyn as the reality and the music of the Bee Gees and other artists as the fantasy. The result is a cultural touchstone.The music may be the best part of the film, but it works in unison with the narrative, right from the opening when a God's-eye view of Brooklyn descending from the clouds to the train tracks suddenly picks up ""Staying Alive"" in midbeat. When we first see Tony, in a brilliant sequence that merely involves him toting a paint can, the song's lyrics are already telling us his sad story, that this tough, chiseled character is struggling to stay alive, ""going nowhere"" in a big city with no one to help him. Bee Gees Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb almost merit co-screen writing credit, as they set a mood director John Badham and writer Norman Wexler weave throughout the film.People who complain SNF is foul have a point; in isolation the soundtrack does nothing to prepare you for the language, casual sex, and racism presented matter-of-factly on screen. To me, it points again to the question of religion, and what people have if they don't have God. The answer, it seems, is music, and nothing else. It's either one of the most nihilistic or pro-religious messages ever put on screen. The fact I have no idea which it is makes it more interesting to me.Another reason the film is so very good is John Travolta's breakout performance in the lead role. People talk about his dancing, and he's amazing especially when the floor opens up and lets him do a solo turn to ""You Should Be Dancing."" But his best dancing comes when he's acting. One moment his character is nobly refusing a prize he knows he didn't deserve. The next, he's assaulting a woman because he knows she doesn't want to have sex with him. The dark undercurrents with which Travolta imbues his character make such transitions not only believable but essential to the story.I'm not completely sold on ""Saturday Night Fever."" The family scenes are annoyingly one-dimensional, for example. Like another bleak, pathbreaking film featuring a gang of toughs, ""The Wild Bunch,"" it's a film I respect more than enjoy.But there's a lot of color and depth here. Those who say otherwise aren't watching it with both eyes open. I also love the performance of Karen Lynn Gorney, who provides pathos and humor as Travolta's dance partner Stephanie whose aspirations of glory exceed even his, even if she can't pronounce words like ""interesting."" The scene of the two of them in the coffee shop is hilarious.A lot of the film isn't, though. It's quite bleak. But that's the strange source of its power, that and the music. Like its protagonist, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a film that doesn't stand still.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Loved the music, loved John Travolta and have the 2001 Odyssey, how ironic!","SNF really brings back memories. Recently, I got the DVD for Christmas (the only thing I wanted). I thought I would watch it with my kids, but quickly nixed that idea after the first round of graphic sexual scenes and pungent expletives. (I was 13 in 1977, when this definitive 70's movie came out, so I was a disco wannabe and only remember seeing it as a PG-13 movie. I honestly think it could do with a NC-17 rating in its rerelease instead of the fairly tame R-rating. )After sending the kids out (they love the opening ""Stayin' Alive"" sequence), I fell in love again, with the music (okay, like the Bee Gees are my absolute favorite group of all time), with John Travolta (my husband has a cleft in his chin, too), and all the generation-defining disco dancing. The Bee Gees have always been my favorite group (because of their work on this film), and I have a 25-year-old original soundtrack LP to prove it, so even though I never set foot in a disco, I feel I was really part of the disco generation. And, now, disco music (and weird 70's clothes) is cool and hip again (although I promised my tweens I'd never say either ""cool"" or ""hip"" again - sorry).For those of you who think disco sucks, too bad - you're simply out of fashion - disco is back, man. My kids love the soundtrack, too.And, in addition to all my posters of John Travolta, the Bee Gees, and Princess Diana (yes, loved her, too - great when they danced together at the White House), irony of ironies, I own the greatest, most obscure (and probably the most common) piece of movie trivia - a 2001 Odyssey (Honda).I think all who love this movie should get together and watch it in unison every Saturday night a la ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and all act out the parts.

But aside from the great music and Travolta's winning performance, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a realistic, well-written, character-driven film that is unlike no other.  Travolta's character isn't perfectly sympathetic, but there's nothing wrong with that. He still has a very human side to him that he's simply afraid to show since he grew up in a tough part of Brooklyn, surrounded by the unrelenting machismo (and misogynism) of his closest friends.  I kept getting frustrated whenever he wouldn't agree to go out with Donna Pescow's character, who is likable and pretty, but it made sense in terms of his character's motivations.  With many movies nowadays that involve a guy pursuing a girl who is out of his league while giving the cold shoulder to the girl who has wanted him along, the guy eventually falls in love with the latter girl.  It makes the audience happy, under most circumstances, but that's not how it always goes in real life.  This movie doesn't contain any sentimental contrivances, and ends on a tragic note.Despite the fact that this was a landmark film of the 70's, I don't feel it has shown its age.  I enjoyed the dance sequences, mostly featuring the great songs of The Bee Gees.  And though Travolta was a sex symbol during this decade, he showed that he was much more than a pretty face.My score:  9 (out of 10)",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Look Mr. Kotter, I Can Dance!","It would be almost impossible to believe that John Travolta received an Academy Award nomination for this movie if the Academy didn't have a long history of nominating films and performances that left us scratching our heads at what they were thinking.Actually, Travolta's not bad in this movie; if anything, he's absolutely the only reason to watch it now, because the movie itself just isn't very good. It's got groovy music, coiffed hair and 1970s disco atmosphere dripping from every frame, but it's primarily an excuse for a bunch of flashy dance numbers without the burden of stringing them together with anything resembling a real plot. It's hokey and harmless, but I can think of a thousand other movies off of the top of my head that would be more worth your time than this.Grade: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Film Critic's Favorite Movie,"Roger Ebert said that ""Saturday Night Fever,"" was Gene Siskel's favorite movie.  While not my all-time favorite, it is definitely in my top fifty. It is not a mindless disco film, it is an intense character study that accurately captures the era.  If you have empathy for the plight of others, and enjoy powerful dramatic portrayals of flawed, real people coming of age in tough circumstances, then you will enjoy this movie.

You'll Be Movin To The Groovin,"This era defining film from 1977 is pure dance hit classic of a film. You follow the life a young man named Tony (John Travolta) who is the King of the Dance Floor by night and Paint Shop Clark by day, but in amongst all this he doesn't get on with his family and doesn't know what he wants to do in life. For the soundtrack however, it is filled with Disco Fever classics like: Disco Inferno, Stayin Alive (of course) and More Than a Women.

"Not just Real Disco, Saturday Night Fever' is a Real Good Story'","From the classic opening scene when a young paint store worker struts down the Brooklyn street with a bucket of latex, to the stirring BeeGees rendition of 'Staying Alive, you know that director John Badham's Saturday Night Fever' has attitude. And attitude would seem to be just what you'd need to succeed in a place like New York. It's the story of Tony Manero. An Oscar nominated performance by then teen idol John Travolta. Who was the star of the popular TV sitcom 'Welcome Back Kotter' Manero, although languishing in a minimum wage job during the day, takes over the dance floor at the local disco by night. He is the king and an icon to his loudmouthed and juvenile friends. Who all seem to be on a road to nowhere. As pointed out to him by his new love interest Stephanie ( Portrayed by Karen Lynn Gorney ) The problem with this love interest is that she's not all that interested in him, Unlike his drooling groupies at the 2001 Disco. (Which was actually filmed inside the famous studio 54 ) And this causes Manero to stop and think that his life may be headed down a dead end street as well. This picture is not just you're mindless dance romp. Travolta creates a character who is totally believable. He makes you think that Manero is as crude as his idiotic friends. But it's the great way Travolta emotes and you can see on his face what's going on in his character's mind. It's still his best performance to this date. There are plenty of moral implications and concerns. Manero's brother is/was a priest, who returns home to their Italian parents to break the news to them that he's lost the faith. One of Tony's friends has gotten his girlfriend pregnant and is pressured to marry her by both sets of parents as well as his local priest. You can see just that little trace of the 1950's morality still remaining in the disco era society. Today, almost thirty years later. A single mother does not wear the same scarlet letter as she did even then. And recent revelations of child molestation in the Catholic church would probably make a family weary of being related to a priest rather than proud of the fact. But it's fun seeing the disco era as it really was instead of some cheesy imitation. If I had one problem with the film it would be with Gorney. Stephanie tells Tony and his friends that she's 'Only twenty' Yet at the time of the filming Gorney was thirty one. And she really does seem and look too old for the roll. As my father so crudely pointed out. 'You can't make a woman's ass that's thirty one look twenty.' But she can do the scenes. At one point after her and Tony meets her old boyfriend, she is reduced to tears by his jealous barbs. Gorney does fine work in this scene and you can feel the strain. Maybe that's what they were thinking when they cast her. That and the fact that she has a great Brooklyn accent. While the film has a great story with a little bit of everything. The music really is special. The soundtrack, which was dominated by the BeeGees, is the very cornerstone of the disco craze. When Tony and Stephanie ultimately dance to their 'More Than a Woman' a truly great song. To Badham's half fast half slow motion direction. The results are pure bliss. Actually the whole film is charming and fascinating, and I believe extremely underestimated. 'Saturday Night Fever' is about life. About difficult choices and conflicting voices. About growing up and having the courage to chase what you want. And it sounds and looks beautiful. Whether you like dancing or not, this movie's for everyone 10 out of a possible 10 T.H.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

You're a Cliché...,"...you're nowhere, on your way to no place...My appreciation of this movie just intensifies as time passes and I get older.
It is a perfect snapshot of an era (albeit the much maligned ""disco era""), a time, a place.
Exactly what cinema exists for.Having relocated to nyc in the '90's, i feel blessed to have made a point of visiting the very real 2001 Odyssey club, in the year 2001, just for fun. And before it was demolished as part of Brooklyn's then booming gentrification.And it is simply a brilliant coming of age piece. Travolta was electrifying in it.

The Disco Dancing Craze Explained for All,"Because this movie is so good, the ""disco sucks"" crowd has never wanted to admit that they liked it, or in some cases have never even seen it, because the Bee Gees (Barry, Maurice, and Robin Gibb) and other disco singers provide the soundtrack to John Travolta's superb portrayal of a swaggering sexy guy from Brooklyn who takes up with a girl from Manhattan. The drama is honest, Travolta's performance is spot on, and the songs sound better today than ever: ""How Deep Is Your Love,"" ""If I Can't Have You,"" ""More Than a Woman,"" ""Night Fever,"" Stayin' Alive,"" ""You Should Be Dancing""-they all convey a real sense of what it was like spinning around on the dance floor under that disco ball. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The movie that sold a soundtrack and a generation on disco,"When this movie came out in 1977 disco was at its peak and punk rock was rising. New wave was just starting and it was the year that star wars smokey and close encounters ruled the box office. Despite the r rating, which forced Paramount to reissue and edit the movie into a PG rated version following the massive success of Grease the year before, it spawned a soundtrack which became more popular than the movie due to the bee gees as well as other acts. The movie would soon be followed by a sequel which did OK despite being lambasted by critics. A musical soon followed and it has been a popular mainstay on cable TV.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Travolta's breakthrough,"Saturday Night Fever is a movie from the disco era. At the same time it tells about disco culture and life of 70's young adults. The movie plays many classics of disco music and presents dance movements of its time. John Travolta makes the final breakthrough in Hollywood with the main role. Travolta plays American-Italian Tony who lives in New York with his family in modest conditions. His family is catholic and conservative and his parents don't like Tony's dancing in discos on Fridays. He has some close friends with him at the disco every time. I think the movie is underrated but not perfect. The movie contain some unbelievable scenes like the final scene but I still like this movie a lot. It is very entertaining and characters are interesting. On the other hand Saturday Night Fever is a time window to the disco era. Above all, this is Travolta's best movie and I recommend this movie to everyone. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A fine achievement,"This is an extraordinary movie. I found myself watching it on TV without knowing what it was... if someone had told me what I would be watching, I wouldn't have given it a chance. Why? Because of its being so often paired with grease. But it is everything grease isn't. Saturday night fever is gritty, pretty hopeless futures await the protagonists, the sheer jungle of youth and young mens culture is highlighted marvelously. The weak don't survive, the weak are shown no pity... there is no saccharine here. The dilemma facing Travolta's brother is an all too familiar one in Catholic countries. Travolta himself emerges a likable decent lad, which in itself is no small feat.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A classic,"I don't know what people are expecting from this movie but it is what it is. It is not the fluffy disco movie that people think it is.This movie leaves many issues unresolved and is actually the snapshot of a period of time in the lives of the characters. They are dysfunctional - they have loads of problems. That's what makes it real.Saturday Night Fever is a great movie from a great period of time. The music serves as a backdrop to a time in the lives of the people in the movie.If you've never watched the movie and you get the DVD, watch the VH1 ""Behind The Hits"" presentation on the DVD before watching the movie to make it even more real.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
classic period piece,"If I was honest I should admit this is one of my all time favorite films. But understand I also realize this movie is hopelessly dated and some elements of the plot may not work as well in hind site. Having said that I still believe if you take into consideration the impact and influence this film had and still has, the fact that it is linked to an era in film that is largely considered fantastic, and lastly that it contains perhaps the most impressive acting debut for a lead in history and you have a stone cold classic.The music is also very much of its time, and in its time it was hugely successful. If one wanted to be transported back to 1978 this is its soundtrack. But the way the film uses music is in my opinion unique in that its not a musical in the traditional sense- nobody breaks into song mid-scene. However the music is organic to the story of how this young man comes of age and begins to realize the imprisonment of his friends,of his family, and of his environment.Another thing about this movie that I have long admired is how the story is told. This is one gritty urban tale and it captured NYC circa 1977 perfectly. Forget the disco, this is the era of Son of Sam and blackouts, and as a lover of NYC I gotta say I love seeing the trash and the graffiti everywhere. The script by Wexler is authentic and bites. But most of all the simple motif of escaping an environment is a passage that is incredibly profound and not explored often enough. Who cannot relate in some way to that.Bottom line this is a classic very much rooted in its place in time. Saturday Night Fever deserves its place as one of the best films of the 1970s. And that was one hell of an era to be one of the best films in.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A groovy and toe-tapping disco era movie.,"Saturday Night Fever is one of the most ultimate disco movies, where John Travolta stars as Brooklyn teenager Tony Manero, who is known as the king of the disco floor at a local dance club. His weekend visits to the club help him overcome the bleakness in his life and he teams up with a girl from a dance class to enter a dance competition.You get to see Travolta dance and boogie to a number of discos songs, from the Bee Gees' Staying Alive to KC & the Sunshine Band's Boogie Shoes, and you couldn't help but rock and sing-along with the groovy and toe-tapping music. The movie reserves a good amount of time for all the disco singing and dancing, which what I think represent one of the most iconic moments in the disco era and in pop culture as a whole.The cinematography captures the somewhat lazy and dreary feel of Brooklyn, which I think symbolizes Tony's troubled life. The chemistry between him and his carefree friends serve up some good drama in the movie, and the conflict between him and his family was pretty suspenseful. But, I think there is little chemistry between him and dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) as I thought her character was unsympathetic and pretty wooden. The plot was well-paced for the most part, but thought it ***spoiler ahead** fell apart at the end especially toward the end during the fighting scene and the events after the dance competition as left pretty anti-climatic. ***spoiler ends***Overall, though, it's a pretty cool movie with great songs and an iconic performance from Travolta.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent urban drama that is far more confrontational than many assume,"Saturday Night Fever is a film whose image and reputation suggests something very different to what it turns out to be. It often sort of gets associated with John Travolta's other music themed blockbuster from the time, namely 1978's mega-hit Grease. But the similarities between the two are frankly entirely superficial, as where Grease is a feel-good musical that looks back nostalgically on a bygone era, Saturday Night Fever is a gritty urban drama with a music back-drop that takes a decidedly unglamorous contemporary look at the lives of a group of young city youths. Part of the reason folks sometimes forget SNF's true form is that a heavily circulated PG version of the film was released in cinemas very soon after its extremely popular soundtrack started selling millions, the idea being that loads of youngsters would flock to see this Travolta disco movie that was being promoted via the music charts with a constant string of smash hits. And the studio was right of course, so much so that this censored version even played TV for a good number of years too. So much so, I have to admit to being a little surprised when I finally saw the original version which had drug taking, some extremely frank sexual scenes, bloody violence and dialogue with healthy amounts of racist terms and full-on swearing. Needless to say, this original raw version is much preferable and makes for a tough and interesting bit of unsentimental drama.Whatever the case, this was definitely the film that firmly put John Travolta on the map. His performance as Tony Manero is one of the most iconic of the 70's. This was the Brooklyn kid who isn't too bright and has a dead end existence, whose life is one of humiliations and restrictions. But due to his skills on the dance-floor of his local discotheque he is treated like a god. It's in many ways a coming-of-age story about a young man imprisoned by his environment and friends. It paints a very gritty portrait of 70's NYC and the young Italian-Americans at the centre of the story. It doesn't even glorify the disco era or experience, suggesting in fact that there were a good many unsavoury elements to that also. All these reasons make for a fairly complex and unpredictable drama with all characters having many flaws and feeling all the more real because of them.It was also, for better or for worse, the film that moved disco from the underground to the mainstream. The soundtrack album sold astronomical numbers of records. The Bee Gees contributed four classic tracks, ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""More Than a Woman"", all of which are integrated into the film very well. Obviously, the songs work well alongside the celebrated dance routines but, more importantly, the music was mixed in very well generally into the flow of what is contrastingly an often quite grim and confrontational drama. All-in-all, this is a film which would probably appeal to a lot of people who would never expect to like it in the first place, on the other hand it will also be too much of a downer for quite a lot of folks who think it's going to be right up their alley. Saturday Night Fever is certainly a film that will continue to confound a lot of expectations and its all the better for that.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Reference Point of 70's Culture,"To watch this movie today, it almost plays like a parody of itself. The clothes, the language, the music, the Farrah Fawcett posters on the wall ... but what a great trip.This movie is about many things. Dance is a central part of this film but it is not what it is about. It is more about what dance does for Tony, how the Disco is the one place where his life is in order - where he rules.Whether you loved or hated Disco in its peak, I believe that every guy secretly wanted to be Tony Manero. Handsome, confident swagger, well dressed (for the time), great dancer and a lady killer. Who wouldn't want that on their CV. But this movie shows us the dysfunctional homelife and everything else that Tony yearns for and doesn't get.Twenty Five years later, we can now also have a full view of the cultural impact of this film. It is a 70's reference point for everything - fashion, music, dance, culture, language - and it is the launch of one of the most colourful careers in Hollywood. The music, though, has the longest lasting impact. The songs from this film are still routinely played in clubs and weddings, on the radio, covered by bands, sampled into hip hop music, and have become the backbone of the disco era.Saturday Night Fever is an important and wonderful film not to be missed. I hated it in the 70's - I love it now. If you didn't like it then, give it a chance. Look for the R-Rated version and have fun!***1/2 out of 4.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A masterpiece from the greatest era of American cinema.,"There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it (see some user comments). Personally I can't understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes, and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it, or appreciate it. However, at the risk of sounding like a dick, I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do; that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell, this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man, Tony Manero, from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor, basking in the glow of the disco ball, and the frivolous, moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub, Stephanie Modano, played by an underrated Karen Lynn-Gorney, who is equal to him in dance ability, and, more importantly, in desiring a better life. The two struggle together, and against each other, in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.A simple story yes. One you've seen before yes. But after that, there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta, as Tony, was in his prime, giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who can't relate to a character who is so honest, so cool, so goofy, so conflicted; who has talent but doesn't get recognized by the people who should recognize him, like his family, only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of. us!The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made, in terms of making you feel joyous, and impervious to the world's problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees, as well as others, it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.John Badham's direction is even; giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits, yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But it's never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic, comedic, exhilirating, and pensive, and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.In the end, literally as well as figuratively, Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support; someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is, even if they can't be lovers. Simple, realistic, beautiful. The 70's was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese, Coppola, Lucas, Spielberg, Badham, and so forth had for a decade or so, the ability to make truly visionary films; in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure, political correctness, marketing tie-ins, and big budget, sensory offending, special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.Attention younger viewers, don't let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isn't a ""cheesy film"" with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that ""sucks"". It is as good a film as you'll see, if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it ""sucked"". John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor, and the story really does have depth.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie with a pulsating soundtrack,Tony Manero (John Travolta) is in his early 20s. He lives in Brooklyn with his parents (who treat him like dirt) and has a dead-end job. He blows off steam every Saturday by going to a disco with his immature buddies. He's also GREAT at dancing. One night there he meets Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) and falls in love. However she's ambitious and is moving forward. He isn't. Can their love survive?This was a HUGE hit in 1977. It made disco popular and made Travolta a star. There's tons of swearing (in the R rated version) but that's how guys that age talk. It moves quickly and has a compelling story. With the exception of Gorney all the acting is good. Travolta is superb! His acting is great and his dancing is beyond belief. Also the soundtrack (primarily by the Bee Gees) is wonderful. It's actually a pretty dark movie but the acting and soundtrack make you forget all that. A true must-see movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Staurday Pastache,"Saturday Night Fever released in 1977, captures an era that is unique and yet prevalent throughout every era. It is a time piece that transports the viewer to the golden age of Disco and the sweet sound of the Beegees. The opening sequence captures the southern section of New York City and the beautiful design of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It gives the viewer the perspective of the era through Tony Manero, and his moments with friends, encounters with women, and confusion and acceptance of his older brother (Frank) decision. Also, it shows the beauty of relationship and love and how there are times of conflict and moments of helping. I enjoyed this movie very much and inspires me to visit the sites that are in the movie.

Night Fever,"I believe that this was the first movie that I saw in the theatre when I four-years-old. (My second movie was Star Wars-also in 1978-then the Muppet Movie, and then I am sure the next was Popeye).  The baby sitter took me to Saturday Night Fever, and I remember my legs fell asleep sitting in the seat for so long.  I viewed the movie again tonight, and this time nothing fell asleep.Despite the fact that the lead actress was completely the wrong chick for this film, and although the movies ending was sort of lackadaisical; nevertheless, the acting was all pretty honest, nothing was forced, and the film flowed very, very well.  Coupled with the fact that the soundtrack is superb & the dancing was top-notch it tells us a lot about how we took a relatively cool style of music and mistreated it with coked-up lifestyles and loud polyester.  Sure, it might look cool en-retro; however, asked someone who lived the discotheque life and they will grin and bow their heads in shame.This is really a fun movie that actually contains substance.I think Saturday Night Fever deserves a lot better rating than most IMDB users give it.  As for me, I am going to break out my platform shoes and give it a solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic,"One may like or not disco music, Travolta and the Bee Gees, but this motion picture is a good illustration of its times. It was based on British author Nik Cohn's article ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"", published a year before in New York Magazine, and although he later revealed the piece had nothing to do with young proletarian New Yorkers, and that he based his writing on his British friends' antics, I feel that what the motion picture shows was universal, a compilation of emotions, actions, and decisions that were experiencing all those of us who were young back then.I belong to the generation that kind of founded discos with other type of music, where dancing was truly a ""tribal rite"", when bodies moved in unison to the beat of, say, Eddie Kendricks' ""Girl, You Need a Change of Mind"", or The Supremes' ""Bad Weather"".When ""Saturday Night Fever"" was released, things were changing, the disco experience was losing spontaneity and becoming a mechanical fad, songs were formulaic, choreographies on the dance floor became obstructive to the collective disco madness. And I guess the Tony Manero story precisely illustrates that, the gentrification of the disco space, with a boy in white outfit, with gel on his head and showing off all those dancing mannerism.A true classic motion picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Travolta Lights Up the Screen.,"The intelligence of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is probably due to John Travolta's hunk appeal and wild strut.  It's amazing that Travolta can go from the rowdy but clean-cut Vinnie Barbarino to the foul-mouthed disco king Tony Manero and still be successful.  The music really defines the era of disco and makes the film a big hit that is still popular even if disco is dead and gone.  The street language is acceptable, but it also prevents the movie from being perfect.  Altogether, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is a very watchable movie highlighted by Travolta's dance solo.

An American Classic,"Ahh Saturday Night Fever.. Polyester 3 piece Disco Suits.. Hittin the Oddysey Nightclub on a Saturday Night.. Carousing the streets of Brooklyn.. Saturday Night Fever tells the story of Tony Manero- a slick, good looking guy from Brooklyn who has a gift for dancing.. By day he works for small pay at a local hardware store.. He lives at home with his less than supportive, hair slapping father, and a mother who prays that her other son, the priest and their savior will call home... Tony pals around with a small group of buddies- Joey C, the hot headed Double J, and the eternally conflicted Bobby, and together they hit the local Oddysey nightclub every Saturday night where Tony rules the dancefloor.. He encounters a dancer named Stephanie one night and is instantly taken by her, moved to wanting to meet and partner with her in an upcoming dance contest.. Along the way,a budding friendship/romance ensues between the two as Tony learns more about himself and life.At first glance, Saturday Night Fever is about the Disco scene, and the great soundtrack featuring Bee Gees Music with songs like How Deep is Your Love, More than a Woman, Night Fever, and Stayin Alive.. But the film is much more than that.. There's several characters that bring provocative subplots to the story.. There's Annette- so enamored with Tony she'll do anything to ""make it"" with him.. There's Bobby C- the weak minded kid who the fellows let hang around for the use of his car, and who is obsessed with what he should do about the pregnancy of his girlfriend Pauline.. There's Tony's brother- Father Frank Jr.. also conflicted about remaining in the priesthood.. And then there's the budding relationship between Tony and Stephanie, as they prepare for the dance contest.. But above it all, and at the heart of the story is our hero- Tony, played convincingly by an underrated John Travolta.. We immediately assume that Travolta is just playing himself in this role, but isn't that the job of a good actor- to portray a character so convincingly that we believe that's the actual person.. Travolta's Manero commands the screen as he does on the dance floor..Several scenes stand out as some of my favorites.. The line dance in the night club- where it seems the whole cast takes part in it.. The dance contest, where Stephanie and Tony kiss for the only time through the magic of dance.. And the camaraderie of Tony and his pals..Movie Mike gives Saturday Night Fever a rating of Very Satisfied.. Thanks and have a great day!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

How is this getting such low ratings?,"This is one of the great cinema films that captures a time in history so few films are able to do.The music is fantastic and still plays as relevant today as it did when it came out. Such raw story and great characters. Love, struggle, triumph, death and friendship, all encapsulated in this beautiful timeless gem. It's a blue collar film and does a damn great job showing the lives of such people, especially NYC at the time.I never understood films being criticized fro showing truth, no matter how offensive it may be seeing it. Life isn't perfect, nor are people. There is a certain amount of phoniness when you water down reality so that you don't offend certain people. That is where many films are headed and it's a shame.One of the movies everyone must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Coming of age movie,"A great coming of age movie.  A movie that defines what a person is.  One of John Travolta's first movies and best.  It helped defined the age of Disco music, and bring from what was underground music to new age music.  Why anyone would give this more than a 9 or 10 is unbelievable.  It's a ground breaking movie, it was different, something new for its time.  The moves that Travolta did, and the dancing.  How can someone watch this movie and not say ""Oh Yeah""?  Remember Siskel's late partner, Eibert, he thought this was one of the greatest movies of all time. Great movie Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A classic,"Travolta gives an astonishing performance in a movie that for me is the epitome of a movie meditation on the themes of youth culture, society and human interaction. Saturday Night Fever is intelligent, realistic, multi layered and the subtleties of the various facets of the narrative are perfectly blended by an all perfect combination of performance, screenplay, direction and soundtrack. This movie speaks for a generation - not just for its style - but it explores universal and timeless themes in a powerful way through understatement, and questions this society through the dramatic device of characterization and relationships. The result is ultimately convincing and has genuine emotional impact. I've never seen any other film which seems as fresh and challenging after the tenth viewing as it did after the first.It saddens me that so many of the wholly excellent cast members were unable to launch a consistent, internationally successful acting career following their triumph here in SNF. However, their outstanding legacy from this movie will live on for many generations to come. Thank you to everyone involved in Saturday Night Fever - every member of the cast, screen writer Norman Wexler, director John Badham, for the faith of Robert Stigwood in this project, the monumental soundtrack and finally to every single member of the crew for their contribution to making a powerful statement not only about a time and a place, but about the human condition itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Alot of style and new music came from this movie, many films in the future is well where to be based on this movie.

An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic With A Brilliant Performance by John Travolta.,"Saturday Night Fever is an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines wonderful direction,an amazing star-making performance by John Travolta and a great cast,a classic soundtrack and a memorable score. All of those elements make Saturday Night Fever a classic and one of the best films of the 1970s.Set in Brooklyn,New York,Saturday Night Fever tells the story of Tony Manero(John Travolta),a young teenager who goes to the local Disco club every Saturday night with his friends to dance where Tony is king of the dance floor but outside of the dance club his life is miserable. When Tony meets and befriends fellow dancer Stephanie(Karen Lynn Gorney),Tony starts to re-examine his life and decides to grow up.Released in 1977,Saturday Night Fever is a brilliant,unforgettable and iconic film that was not only a critical and Box Office success but also made John Travolta a movie star,helped launch the Disco craze in the late 1970s and gave viewers one of the best and biggest soundtracks of all-time. It's a movie that has become so famous and apart of Pop Culture you know the film by the title name,the white suit that Travolta wears in the movie or by it's many songs on the soundtrack that are played throughout the film and are still played on the radio. Right from the now iconic opening scene,Saturday Night Fever is an instant classic from the very moment you watch an amazing film that is just an experience that glues viewers to the screen with music,intense drama and electricity that just never stops. When you watch Saturday Night Fever it's truly like watching a time capsule that takes viewers back to the 70s and 1977 in New York showing the night and day-to-day life in New York during that decade. While Saturday Night Fever isn't a musical where characters are singing and dancing,the music and dancing play a big part in the film with the music making certain scenes come alive while the dance scenes are amazing,memorable and are done in a visual stunning style that is dream like and beautiful with tons of energy that makes the film. What I also love about SNF is that despite the music and dancing the movie at it's heart is a timeless Coming Of Age story and is one of the best in the genre showing viewers the Coming Of Age of Tony Manero. The character Tony Manero is a classic character of 1970s cinema and the Coming Of Age genre because while he isn't the most likable person and can be a jerk at times we see Tony deal with the hardships of growing up. When Tony is dancing at the night club he is the king on the dance floor but outside of the night club Tony's life is a wreck and is pretty sad,he works a dead end job at the hardware store and his parents think less of him and see Tony going nowhere in life. Despite Tony's miserable life he's very ambitious and wants to succeed in life beyond his neighborhood which makes the character Tony truly complex. What also makes Tony grow is when he meets Stephanie who Tony sees as a prime example making it and being successful which gives Tony more hope for his future. When Tony and Stephanie begin to dance together and start to know one another they both need each other and start to relate to one another more and try to help each other out. Tony Manero is a memorable and interesting character you will never forget and is one of the reasons the movie is a classic. There are also parts in SNF that make the movie dark,bleak and gritty because like Tony the other characters have sad and miserable lives and the movie has a tragic overtone that sticks with you. The movie also deals with themes such as sex and aimless youth who are lost in the haze of trying not to think about about real life. SNF is a much deeper movie than one might think and isn't just a movie about Disco and dancing and that's one of the reasons it's a great film. The ending of Saturday Night Fever is amazing and powerful and truly brings the character Tony full circle and we as the audience feel that there is hope for this character. A terrific ending.The cast is great. John Travolta is excellent and iconic as Tony Manero,with Travolta bringing charisma and depth to the role. Karen Lynn Gorney is wonderful as Stephanie Tony's love interest and dance partner. Barry Miller(Bobby C.),Joseph Cali(Joey),Paul Pape(Double J.)and Bruce Ornstein(Gus)do fantastic jobs as Tony's friends. Donna Pescow is great as Annette,a neighborhood girl who's in love with Tony. Martin Shakar is sensational as Father Frank Manero Jr.,Tony's older brother who's a priest. Val Bisoglio(Frank Sr.),Julie Bovasso(Flo Manero),Sam J. Coppola(Fusco)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by Fran Drescher in the role as Connie.The direction by John Badham is terrific and stylish,with Badham always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful and visually stunning look to the film with fine camera angles and use of color and lighting. Great direction,Badham.The score by David Shire is fantastic,memorable and matches the tone of the film. Wonderful score,Shire. The soundtrack from The Bee Gees one of the best and most iconic soundtracks of all-time with songs by The Bee Gees(Staying Alive,More Than A Woman,How Deep Is Your Love,Night Fever,You Should Be Dancing),Yvonne Elliman(If I Can't Have You),K.C & The Sunshine Band(Boogie Shoes),The Trammps(Disco Inferno),Walter Murphy(A Fifth Of Beethoven). A classic soundtrack.In final word,if you love 1970s films,cinema in general,John Travolta and Music,I Highly Suggest you see Saturday Night Fever,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will never forget and watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Greatest,"Fifty years from now people will still be dancing to the soundtrack. There is something magical about it. Yes, the story was silly, racist, dumb, etc., but hearing those songs makes me feel like a kid again.The funny thing about this movie though, is the fact that John Travolta was the only big star to come out of the movie. Yes, there was Fran Drescher (but it definitely wasn't the movie that made her a star) and a few actors and actresses who have gone on to minor success, but where did everybody else go? Donna Pescow had a sitcom but that's about it.Nevertheless, I have seen SNF 100 times, and I'll see it again anytime it's on TV. I can never get tired of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sex, Drugs and Dance","""Saturday night fever"" is not just a movie about dance or the usual Teenage lust for sex and drugs, in fact it is a well crafted biopic of an ordinary teenager raised in a dysfunctional family and who is struggling to find his true purpose. John Travolta stars as Tony Manero; a 19 year old kid who works at a paint shop in the daytime earning his petty cash to spend it during weekends to go to a disco club with his mates. At the club, Tony is treated as a king, the alpha male (a status he earned through his smooth dancing skills). Everyone notice him and greet him. Women are charmed by his moves and ask him to dance with them. Club goers compliment him by saying ""You know something, Tony? You always seem to be in control"". This attention and freedom that he receives at the club is far more pleasurable than what he experience at his house; his family life. There is no respect for each other in the family; they fight over the silliest matter when having dinner. His parents are overly proud of their eldest son who is a priest and this make Tony somewhat inferior, and he faces constant pressure over the decisions he has made in his life. It is not surprising that such a youth would hunt for some form of release to breakthrough from this misery. For some, it usually involves drugs and other abusive substances, but for Tony it is Dance, and Dance is what he could always think about.It is at this dance club where he stumbles upon Stephanie; another good dancer who is more mature in age, beliefs and attitudes than Tony. Even though they possess these contrasting traits, the way that life has dealt with both of them has never been more similar. They both depend on one another to make themselves feel better. This movie explores deeper themes than it appears on the surface. Matters we sometimes resist to tap into, and director John Badham has achieved these immediate goals. The pure film-making used to shoot the dance scenes encompassing funky tunes are another aspect to pay close attention to. One of the best films of the 80's.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Disco Inferno Is Burning! (And this is before ""Boogie Nights"")","Wow...another cult classic film!  I've seen quite a few movies from the 1970's, and next to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", this one is the best. John Travoltra is an excellent dancer and I thought that this movie had some of the greatest and unforgettable dance moves ever thanks to the guy who choregraphed every step that John's character, Tony, danced to.  The Bee Gees are some of the greatest song writers of all time, and you can't help but be impressed by the sound that they add to this film!  ""Saturday Night Fever"" is one of the best films from the 1970's!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE 1970s,"""Saturday Night Fever"" is about much more than dancing. It contains a sturdy character study, which is what makes this film so great. That and the music.John Travolta stars as Tony Manero, a Brooklynite whose life consists of dancing at the local disco and hanging out with his friends after working at the local hardware store all week. This is one of Travolta's best performances. After seeing him as Barbarino week after week in ""Welcome Back Kotter"", it was probably a great shock to his many fans that he would do a serious drama. But he pulls off this difficult role so well that it establishes him as a serious and great actor.Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Tony and his family. Tony is seen as something of a disappointment, especially compared to his brother who is a priest. The conflicts with Tony and his father are among the truest and most human I've seen in some time. It's a shame that they are not very well remembered among audiences today.The most well remembered and talked about sequences are the scenes inside the discotheque. John Badham, the director, makes good use of the camera and captures the energy and color of a local disco of the 70s. At the very least, it blows away ""Can't Stop the Music"" and ""Thank God It's Friday"", probably among the worst films of this era. Travolta himself is impressive in the dancing sequences. It is good to see an actor actually do the dancing himself rather than a double.The music is great, too. Most of the music is from The Bee Gees, the standout group of this era and this is some of their best work. Songs like ""Stayin Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""More Than A Woman"", ""You Should Be Dancin"" and ""How Deep Is Your Love"" not only represent the disco era, but they also enhance the film itself and not many soundtracks can do that.""Saturday Night Fever"" is a wonderful movie, an insightful look at a time that has faded away from memory. So many people want to forget the disco era so badly that they tend to take potshots at the music and fashions. They forget that they lived that time and it should not be forgotten.***WARNING: ""Saturday Night Fever"" exists in two versions. My review applies to the original ""R"" version which has a lot of offensive language and material. The alternate ""PG"" version is the one used for TV and is also of interest. My advice: rent or buy the R version. This movie's soul is in that cut.R version: ****",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Well acted with good music and dance scenes,"I liked this one a lot. It was probably John Travolta's best film ever. I liked the music, dancing and thought the acting was very good.

An Unappreciated Classic,"This movie is not mainly about disco, it's just a setting for the characters.Disco was fun, people were dancing and having fun, the 70's was probably more fun for most people because of it. You didn't have to like disco to go to a disco to be social and interact with people, but disco made that widely popular. Some of you reading this now probably owe your very existence to disco.A lot of hate came from people who preferred rock, they were scared rock would vanish and be replaced by disco. But they didn't realize it would wear itself out on its own, just like rock has today. There are no real rock songs tearing up the charts now.This movie was basically a classic from the moment it opened. The characters, the setting and the dialogue are up there with some of the best 70's movies. You can't fault a great movie for the era it takes place in. If you have never seen it because of some hang up like this, do yourselves a favor and see it. You may change your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A music video that has a ""Siamese Twin"" of a ""B"" movie","Do watch the full-length version of this 1977 dance classic; it's a strangely muted John Travolta ""vehicle"" of a bunch of 70's cliches.  It precedes the 1981 MTV phenomenon but showcases some excellent tracks of the Bee Gees' music and lyrics (including some great covers).  The movie presents a strangely uninhabited urban landscape where whites rule the ""roost.""  The plot and odd storyline are quite ""B"" in their haphazard domestic/gang fighting and abuse.  The pathetic female co-star who is the object of sexual abuse is more or less a caricature and I am not quite sure who the leading lady is asserting her right to be -- partner or ""trophy"" ?? My evaluation is of course quite revisionist in nature but the great musical that has been ""Siamese Twinned"" with the Italian working family saga (complete with a ""doubting Thomas"" elder brother) needed some revision-ing of its own.  Maybe Tim Burton's next project will be a Ricky Martin version of this classic 70's piece where he succeeds on a wave of New York Puerto Rican Latin musical frenzy.  Or is that already so ""last year"" ?!?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A working class tale,"I must definitely write a review about Saturday Night Fever. This film was the talk of the town in my teen years. Right after the release I saw the film once, together with a school mate, in the neighboring city. There was no cinema in our village, and our film journeys invariably transformed into a pleasant evening out. The usually preferred menu were James Bond films, but that time SNF was a must. We enjoyed ourselves. It has everything you could wish for. Music of a proved band. A new style of dancing that we could imitate (how little were our talents in this regard). Even sex. Enough chances for identification and enough stupidity to maintain a feeling of superiority. The guy who made a girl pregnant, but took aversion to marrying her and fell into a state of contempt of death. There are real character moments when Tony lacks power: Tony begging his boss to get advanced money. Or Tony, although among equals of a cool attitude, getting slapped by his parents and whining. About 25 years later I recorded the film on video, and watched him some seven times, at short time intervals. At first it was just nostalgia, a reminiscence of the good old times that are lost forever. Then it was the film itself: lots of movement and fun and actions. My involvement with SNF finished with an analysis of the intriguing relation between Tony and his new dance partner, and a dissemination of the dialogs (what do they say and why?). The characters are certainly credible and well-played. It seems to me that the film comes close to a working class tale and a criticism of American society: the apathy, lack of education, the brutal surroundings, the struggle for mental survival, and of course the desire to get out. It is essentially a good-natured film, which still portrayed some hope in the aftermath of flower power. The right film at the right time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

While in the disco, Tony is the king, and the visits help him to temporarily forget the reality of his life: a dead-end job, clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents, racial tensions in the local community, and his associations with a dead-beat gang of friends.Tony connects with the aloof Stephanie one night at the disco. Despite her initial frosty and superior attitude toward Tony, she agrees to partner with him in the dance contest after much urging. Tony then has to ditch his current partner Annette, who had actively pursued Tony, despite his obvious disdain for her. Stephanie has a job in Manhatten and is poised to move there.

To the night fever,"One of the catalyzers of the disco fever, this film is much more than a flick, as some critics insist. It definitely has become a classic, the best view of the Seventies and one of my all time favorite movies. (I've seen it a thousand times!) Tony Manero, a young Brooklyn guy (played extraordinarily by John Travolta) struggles to be the disco king at a local disco where he's already recognized as a dance master. He also meets Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) there, a beautiful and snob woman who despises him until she realizes how pretentious she was being. Even though, she's not in love with Manero but became his friend. Parallel plots develop around Manero's family and friends during the film. Director John Badham adds an erotic touch to all dance sequences while Travolta (wearing his classic black and white sport suit) reigns as the greatest find of the film. The great soundtrack by the Bee Gees (which was a smash hit worldwide) remains one of the most popular movie albums of all time.Taking a nostalgic look at the film's costumes is a funny (!) experience too.

It's Saturday Night catch the Fever. Tony Manero rock on! (And the Bee Gees too.) The most famous scene is Tony (John) strutting down the Brooklyn side walk with a paint can, and ""Stayin' ALive"" playing in the background.

Groovy!,"John Badham's 'Saturday Night Fever' is a groovy, spicy and lastly energetic movie. John Travolta puts on the coat with grace, goes on the dance floor and provides some clap-slap dance moves.'Saturday Night Fever' is about a young immature fella, who finds himself stuck between family issues and disco-dancing. His journey is thrilling and very musical. John Badham's direction captures Travolta's sissy movements with a jig on the crust. Travolta rules the show with a super performance. His dancing, though very 'Girly' makes you move nonetheless. But what truly moves you is, as mentioned, his performance. He gives his character importance and he keeps the atmosphere alive.

If you can survive the life without turning into a raging alcoholic or drug addled dancing fool, or survive getting into the fights that sometimes erupts, or the potential for car wrecks after you leave the scene, the club scene is a very exciting and fun time.This movie still inspires and excites many people, but beware!

Great Fever to Catch ***1/2,"John Travolta truly shines as dance hero Tony Monero in this wonderful 1977 production of ""Saturday Night Fever.""When Friday night comes around, Tony can quickly forget about the rest of the week, get those dancing shoes ready, dress up and head down to that Bay Ridge Disco and dance the night away.The songs from the Bee Gee's are great. Shockingly, they were not nominated for best song among the Academy Award nominations. Why not? What was the nominating committee thinking?Tony has his problems at home and frustration at work. Dancing becomes an outlet for him and what an outlet he has. Fast on his feet, Arthur Murray praised Travolta's dancing in this film;although,prudish Arthur and Katherine objected to the language.We see the lives of average Italian Brooklynites on the streets of Bay Ridge as well as the disco.Complications ensue. Tony's brother, a priest, comes home and announces that he is leaving the church. There may be homosexual implications but that is fortunately glossed over.Karen Lynn Gorney is an excellent dance partner for Tony. Usual TV good girl, Donna Pescow turns in a surprisingly good performance as a girlfriend rejected by Tony.There is plenty of excitement beyond the dance floor. That memorable scene on the bridge, where tragedy befalls a pal of Tony's, is terrifically done.Get out your dancing shoes and dance up a storm.

The family is shocked when his sainted brother decides to leave the priesthood.From the first scene, Travolta brings a power into this disco fable. It's the music. It's the fashion. It's the family and friends. Best of all, it's a hungry Travolta on the prowl. Tony is clueless but he's hungry. He doesn't know what he's hungry for but he's restless for it.

Dated and sloppily directed but with high points,"The film has many careless editing bloopers and they detract. Also, the film is pure disco 70s and that era itself was dated by the 80s so imagine what it is now. Another problem is Travolta had reallife lady love at the time( comely actress Diana Hyland) die on him at the time and he is awful angry in scenes because of that.Yet, some of it somehow remains timeless. The theme of escaping the world you were born into, Catholic religion in your family and it's hold or loosening hold on you, gathering with your friends, dating ladies if you are a guy and more.Look. I do not use know how the film would have worked if there had been a violent lady in the film who beat people up. So many viewers are bothered by the depiction of ladies in this movie but they are all basically nice and make calm viewing. Besides, most women in real life are nice and not full of bad attitude.

A fantastic dance flick,"Just last night, for the first time, I went to a showing of Saturday Night Fever with my mom, who snuck to the theater to see it when she was little, and only remembers getting in trouble for it. So, she felt like SHE was seeing it for the first time, too! And I've gotta say, it's a terrific movie.The movie centers on 19-year-old Italian-American Brooklynite Tony Manero (played by John Travolta), who lives with his parents, and holds down a weekday job as a clerk at a local paint store. On weekend nights, Tony escapes the harsh reality of his bleak everyday life by going with his friends, Joey (Joseph Cali), Bobby C (Barry Miller), Double J (Paul Pepe), and Gus (Bruce Ornstein), to the local disco, where he DOMINATES the dance floor. One night, the disco announces a big dance competition. In need of a partner, Tony ropes a snooty, but beautiful young lady and talented dancer named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney) into dancing with him. As the two train for the big night together, they gradually develop feelings for each other.The story is gritty, serious-minded, poignant and really intelligent. And the writing just makes it even better. The movie has a fittingly edgy tone to it, and some real tension. There's also some really exciting moments, too, ESPECIALLY Tony dancing! In addition, the movie boasts some great comedy, especially the Manero family dinner scene. The movie is also touching in some places, especially at the end. However, I need to question the fact that this movie has a pretty sexist tone. Even for a movie released in the 1970's, sexism isn't a good thing.The acting in this movie is excellent. John Travolta is very energetic and charismatic as Tony. That, and he is an AMAZING dancer! It's no surprise that this was the role that made him famous. Karen Lynn Gorney is fittingly grounded as Stephanie. Joseph Cali, Barry Miller, Paul Pepe and Bruce Ornstein are great as Joey, Bobby, Double J and Gus, respectively. Everybody else is great in their roles.And lastly, the thing that people remember this movie for the most, besides John Travolta's dancing: the music. It was done by the Bee Gees, who wrote and performed several funky disco songs that went on to become hits in their own right and still hold traction today, including ""You Should Be Dancing"" and most notably, the beloved ""Stayin' Alive"". They even take the form of orchestral score cues in the more plaintive scenes.Everything considered, not for nothing is Saturday Night Fever considered one of the best movies of all time. It's got a smart, touching yet gritty story, it's got a fantastic star-making performance by John Travolta, complete with awesome dancing, and it's got delightful, infectious music. Highly recommended!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Gritty but great.,"This film was a lot grittier than I remembered. A cautionary tale & at times triggering. I think young adults today may be shocked but it's a realistic reflection of the 70's I'm sorry to say.However, John Travolta's moves on the dance floor worth suffering cringing through the other scenes.Warning! There's some gross macho behaviour, distasteful sex in cars & rape scenes. Sad to see Women being grateful for attention they should not be but again good to know times have changed or at least I hope so?? Big warning there are suicide themes. I'd choose another film if you're feeling a bit fragile.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
only the music made it worth looking,"The dance scenes and the music in Saturday Night Fever kept me watching to the end. Where I live they have movies from the 30's to 80's  each week. This week was Saturday Night Fever.Perhaps I saw this on TV years ago without foul words. But the subplots about his family not giving him any credit, the brother leaving the priesthood  could have been written a little better. And I was a girl and saw how Tony ate that food, I'd be gone in a heartbeat!.   Too many unreal things in the subplots combine with filthy words, turned me off to to film. The Dancing saved it. He was great with on the dance floor and at the studio which kept me to the end.for films of this kind i'd give it a kind 5 ( 1 out of 10) magictrain",,Anonymous,Music
a 7 (or good on IMDb scale) if you like cheese,"So most of us know Saturday Night fever that are between 30 and almost dead. It has some iconic and often spoofed dance scenes. I wonder if the youngin's of the world today have heard of this movie or for that matter seen it. So is it a classic, well that depends on how you look at it. If you are shallow and have an insipid mind it is. If you are someone who likes to make fun of Disco and cheesy movies it is as well. I think, though I could be wrong, that I fall into the latter category. I enjoyed watching this movie not because it was good, but because it was just humorous to watch Vinny Barbarino in action, and I admit he is a good dancer. I found myself making fun of this movie while I watched it, but it is not terrible or undeserving like say the Blind Side (which I just reviewed), of being in this blog but just dated and just o.k. But there is that music by the Bee Gees that I am almost ashamed to admit I like, and the disco which along with the 80's are among America's cheesiest decades. So I recommend watching it to feel nostalgic, to see what the disco era was like if you are young, or just to laugh at a la mystery science theater 3000. Oh and look for a ridiculously hot very young Fran Drescher in the movie, marone that chick can get sausage stiff if yo know what I sayin' yo know what I am say sayin, ohhhh... marone, I think I just felt the thunder bolt (my attempt at being a stereotyped Italian from Brooklyn or I guess New Jersey as well).",,Anonymous,Music
Expect the unexpected,"Wanna see a glittering and frivolous celebration of the joys of the 1970s disco scene with its outrageous fashions? Then go see ""Thank God Its Friday"". See ""Saturday Night Fever"" and you'll find a serious, thoughtful and ultimately quite tragic tale of a group of Brooklyn youths going nowhere, but who are kings at the local disco. In particular the story concentrates on Tony Manero who lives at home with his nagging and overly critical parents, and who dreams of one-day crossing the river to Manhattan and escaping the drudgery of his dead-end life. Tony develops a fascination with Stephanie, a girl he meets at the disco, who has apparently achieved this goal. Serious plot aside, the film nonetheless does contain several dazzling disco sequences (the synchronised dance to ""Night Fever"" is my favourite, though Tony's dance solo to `You Should Be Dancing' ain't too bad either) and of course the great music that made the soundtrack album the biggest selling movie soundtrack ever. A brilliantly made film which is ultimately quite emotional and affecting, and nothing like its reputation. Make sure you see the original version, not the toned-down PG version in which many scenes have been changed and others removed altogether.",,Anonymous,Music
Cheesy dance sequences and a plot !,"'Saturday Night Fever' has acquired something of a reputation as a classic film.  The first time I saw it I thought it was incredibly boring, the second incredibly bad and the third time quite good.  Whilst undeniably a star vehicle for John Travolta, the film itself is an intelligent (at times) study of the emptiness of life.  Most of the characters are unpleasant though at the same time arouse our sympathy.  The ambigouity of the characters forces the audience to work to understand the characters rather than simply presenting them with one-dimensional characters.  The lead had to be played by a star with the charisma of someone like John Travolta as he is the most unpleasant character in the whole film.  This is perhaps the film's flaw, I really didn't care what happened to John Travolta, he could have plunged off Brooklyn Bridge for all I cared.  A major problem in evaluating the film nowadays is that it's difficult to know how much was supposed to be funny when the film was made and how much is funny now.  For instance, when John Travolta preens himself in front of the mirror would audiences in 1978 have laughed as they do nowadays ?  Ultimately 'Saturday Night Fever' is far from being a great film (although it is one of the highlights of Travolta's career) but it is interesting and will appeal to any John Travolta fan or anyone into cheesy '70s music.",,Anonymous,Music
What did they see in each other?,"Except for the music, this movie was completely detestable.  Stephanie Mangano was an arrogant, pretentious, snobbish fake; Tony Manero was a preening, cocky, prejudiced jerk.  Tony revealed a single redeeming quality in the last part of the film when he protested the unfair outcome of the 2001 Odyssey dance sweepstakes, but it didn't outweigh his behavior up to then.  I doubt that either of these two believed that the sun rose until they got up in the morning.  What on earth did they see in each other?An attempted rape, a backseat gang bang, a gay-baiting incident, a caricatured ""Whatsamatta you!"" Italian family that slaps first and asks questions later:  something to offend everyone will be found here.  Loaded to the brim with racism, homophobia, and superficial priorities, this movie might well be considered a chronicle of the worst seventies excesses: drugs, disco, and doin' it.  Not sure of the order.  But if you're looking for a movie that will be an uplifting experience ... of the toilet lid, for you to blow chunks ... here it is, folks.",,Anonymous,Music
Whatta Movie,"Saturday Night Fever, one of the greatest disco dancing movies ever made. John Travolta played the character Tony Manero. Tony was a slick dresser with his bell bottom trousers get up and let us not forget about the slicked back hair. The theme revolves around a young man that wants to be accepted and want to fit in. Tony feels on top of the world when he is dancing. Without his dancing he feels hopeless and has really nothing else going for him. When Tony is in the club performing his dance moves he has so many people routing him and gets the attention he is seeking. At home he received nothing but negative attention and his family is not routing him on and thinks he has nothing going for him at all.The lighting in the film made those white bell bottoms and moves come to life on the dance stage. I enjoyed the dancing and disco music during the show. The outfits with the help of the lighting seem to bedazzle me during the dancing scenes. Even though the move had a lot of dancing it revolved around a young man wanting to be accepted and gaining that acceptance through art. The lighting angles showcased his moves and allowed the glistening of the light to reflect just right and made Tony shine on the stage, man he is good.Amazing to see a man getting ready for his night on the town, different perspective from other movies and these extreme outfits and slicked back hair provided him with the acceptance he desired. The movie also shreds light on unexpected pregnancy and men in general even in this day and time wanting to have sex with anything that walks in the back seat of car and even Tony basis his attraction on physical attributes. The film even though it took place in a different time era the message is still loud and clear even today. Looks seem to be the most important factor.However like the song Neil McCoy sings that has a line that ""looks are not that important just icing on a cake. The world has came a long way with stereotyping and discrimination but there is still work left to do and Tony begins to understand by the end of the movie that there is more to live this looks. Lets not forget that we all get old and loose are hair or gain wait and we won't have our looks for very long.",,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful film that captures the spirit of adolesence,"This film was Gene Siskel's personal favorite film for a very good reason. This film captures the spirit of youth, and uses the metaphor of the dance contest for the struggle of life. It is appealing on many levels, and effectively conveys the idea.",,Anonymous,Music
Disco hits the big screen,"This film was great. It scores with fun and excitement, and paints a perfect picture a young teens life in Brooklyn New York, revolving around the Disco scene. For those who remember what it was like, being young and indecisive about where they wanted to go, and how to deal with being in love once the fun stops in the 70's, this film will touch your heart in a musical way.",,Anonymous,Music
Fun at the club,"This is one of my favorite dance movies of all time. Saturday Night Fever has a very atmospheric and sensual vibe to it. It's definitely a feel good movie and a cult classic. The movie takes place in New York City 1977 where disco was blowing up the airwaves. John Travolta plays a guy name Tony who is a cool Italian blue-collar worker and a nighttime club dancer. This movie besides then hit TV show ""Welcome back Kotter 1975"" gave John Travolta a lot of popularity. Saturday Night Fever covers romance,suspense,and drama. As for the movie to take place in New York City,there's always gonna be some type of drama. But besides all that this movie puts the nail in the coffin when disco is at its best. That's why disco will always be remembered as a remarkable dance era. For even today people get on the dance floor and learn to boogie.",,Anonymous,Music
Gritty urban tale,"1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music charts. How ironic then that Debbie Boone's ""You light up my life"" should end the year off at the top of the US single's charts. While I don't think the punk movement has ever been suitably documented in movie fiction, the more commercial and mainstream disco culture has had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was undoubtedly Saturday Night Fever.The snag is, SNF is NOT a disco movie. Yes, it has some dazzling dance sequences, yes, it has a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes are shot in the local discoteque. But I have always felt that the disco setting is peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the sanctuary and acceptance they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, even the film's title is somewhat misleading. Nik Cohn's magazine article on which the film is based (and which he later claimed was a fake), ""Tribal rites of the new Saturday Night"" would have been more apposite. As Tony Manero, John Travolta perfectly captures these rites, preening himself religiously in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and escaping the drudgery of his job and homelife to the battleground, the dancefloor where he is the tribal chief.Gritty, foulmouthed and downbeat, SNF starkly captures the darker underbelly of the disco subculture.",,Anonymous,Music
"Its not cool, its not bad, it's just a 70's movie","When I was 16 in the 1970's we had a choice. You were either a punk or a seventies disco dancer!!! So I didn't go and see Saturday Night Fever. Fifteen years later I recorded it and I have watched it half a dozen times since. Its not a great movie, but it is a great reflection  of  New york in the Seventies. It could have been directed by any of the  great directors of the time, (Scorcese, De Palma etc)but it is Travolta that makes the movie. The music is fantastic, and althought the story is pretty pedestrian, it is entertaining in a a 70's New York kind of way. it's not great in any intellectual kind of way way but it works, and you're pulled in by the characters in the movie. In a purely movie kind of way, its not great, but as a movie that reflects the time & the place watch it coz it works.I would place it in my top 20 movies of all time. purely because I lived through it, and its good to watch. 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
Doreen is the most underrated character in the film!!!,"Definitely one of the best films of the 1970's!  My favorite character is the Doreen, played with finesse by Denny Dillon (remember Toby from HBO's ""Dream On""?)  Although she only gets about one minute of screen time, her line is probably my favorite in the entire film:""Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?""Go out and rent this one!!! Don't forget your Billy Beer!!!",,Anonymous,Music
OK,"The highlights of this film were the music and dancing scenes (obviously), Tony and Stephanie rehearsing their dance number in the studio, the opening sequence with Tony strutting down the street to ""Staying Alive"", and my favorite line of the movie: ""He hits my hair!""And did every other word have to be a swear word? The only version I've seen of this movie is the R version; maybe if I viewed the PG rated version I'd enjoy it better.",,Anonymous,Music
Film Appreciation,"Saturday Night Fever is an original film that leads the way for other dance and music films in the 80's to present. John Travolta plays the lead role of Tony Manero who doesn't know much about his future but knows that he can dance. Tony Manero lives for Saturday nights at 2001 with music and his friends. There are many themes of this film social problems being one, struggling for human dignity, and youths coming of age. A major theme point of this movie was Tony realizing that he could not remain a young teen forever and would have to get serious about his future since there was not preventing it. Another great movie with some of the same themes is Fame. The editing is superb in this film. The viewer feels apart of every scene, it makes the viewer want to relive their youth or anticipate their youth. The soundtrack to this movie put the viewer right there in 1977, with the bell bottoms, and Farah Faucet hair. This movie is excellent for any youth coming of age or someone that wants to relive their youth and see how far they have come.",,Anonymous,Music
A MUST SEE FOR THE FAMILY!,"Without a shadow of a doubt, Saturday Night Fever is undoubtly the greatest movie ever filmed in New York. The Disco era was an amazing past time with the illest styles. I lived in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn where Saturday Night Fever was filmed, for 18 years and that film was portrayed perfectly. The ""Brooklyn Guidos"" were played so true it was funny. And all the night clubs and the views of the Verezano Bridge brought back memories. The question is, when will this be on DVD? Hopefully for the 25th Anniversary! (Which is 2002)A true walk down memory lane....1 Love Joey Minchia, Brooklyn",,Anonymous,Music
the movie ken starr and buddy richard jewell never saw,"I'm almost on vapors here..like vespers. SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a meshing of religious overtones and secularism for a commentary on a generation and a clash between the religious world (briefly) and the secular world. The film tells the tale of lost souls at the disco as seen through the eyes of father frank and the higfh flying antics of a popular disco celebrity played by TRAVOLTA. The film is high art and pop culture rolled into one. The film captures the spirit of the disco era and set a new standard in soundtracks and soundtrack marketing. (along with STAR WARS and GREASE) The movie has a moral to it about life and the cruelty of it and trying to get by yet the clash between father frank and his walking away from the clergy was a great subplot I loved. That subplot gave the film believability and substance. The family setting for the character played by travolta was also believable. It was almost like a real family. The plus points:plot, music and acting. A film about nobodys who are trying to be somebody having been a nobody all my life I have nothing to hide. One of travoltas best movies. I liked him as a villian in BROKEN ARROW.",,Anonymous,Music

A Classic...if ever there was one,"Saturday Night Fever is a classic film. I can remember well watching it over and over again on HBO as a teenager. Tonight I saw it again (R rated version) for the first time in forever.... what a joy. It will forever live in American pop culture, and rightfully so. The music, the casting, the story and yes, the dancing. This film has that rare quality of erasing time. What a magnificent job of directing. I have to wonder if those involved knew what they were really achieving.A realistic and tangible storyline is the underlying star. It's a gift of a movie for all those who know how to discern without prejudice. It's Travolta at his most vulnerable and best.",,Anonymous,Music
WOULD YOU JUST WATCH THE HAIIIR??!!,"SNF revolutionized disco and the style it brought. It also established Travolta as a star. SNF is indeed a wonderful film. Although it features gritty realism of young-man life in Brooklyn, it's true stuff. Travolta excels as the troubled Tony Manero, a 19-year old who works at a paint store in the day to party at the local disco at night (and he still lives with his parents). He is flocked by the women and nearly idolized by Annette. Then he meets Stephanie, who truly opens his eyes at life. After dancing with her in the big contest, Tony realizes that his cliched life is bringing him nowhere and he vows to change it. Travolta makes his character so deep you almost believe it's real. In general, the movie is a wonderful classic and it should be included in every moviegoer's collection. AAAAAAAAAL PACINO!!",,Anonymous,Music

Don't judge a film by its costumes...,"Saturday Night Fever is a terribly misunderstood film; I don't know anyone in my age group (growing up in the 70's but too young to have been part of the disco scene) that doesn't think that it's a silly film about disco dancing.  But it's not.It's not the greatest film in the world, and certainly it's dated.  The dancing is important -- it's the backdrop, it's a catalyst for character development -- but it's not the focus of the film.  Saturday Night Fever tells the tale of an aimless Italian-American kid (Tony Manero, ably played by a very young and very thin John Travolta) whose only escape from his unhappy life is dancing at the club on the weekends with his friends; and it walks us very objectively through events that catapult Tony from a boy who can allow himself to escape to a man who realises he has to deal with his life.There's a little bit of everything in the film (and a lot of profanity) It deals with personal and religious disillusionment; it deals with frightening problems like teen pregnancy and the choice of whether or not to get a post-secondary education in favour of working.  It's not a light-hearted movie!  But I highly recommend it because it's an analogy for the process we all have to go through as teenagers -- stuck in the odd limbo where we're not quite children, not quite adults, and no one quite knows how to",,Anonymous,Music
