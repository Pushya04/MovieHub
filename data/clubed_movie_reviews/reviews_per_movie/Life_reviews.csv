Not as bad as people make it out to be.,"The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.I don't get how people even compare this movie to ""Aliens""; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally Serviceable Time Killer,"I'm seeing a few negative reviews for this one that I don't understand. Life isn't a cinematic masterpiece exactly, but it's thrilling enough to hold your attention for one hundred minutes.The story is simple: something horrible gets on a space ship and wants to waste the crew. We don't know much about it or how it thinks except that it's extremely hostile and needs oxygen. After the very well-paced and beautifully-executed set-up the remainder of the film consists of the humans trying to outwit and destroy this thing.And that's it. It doesn't get boring. It does the job. It has a couple of pointless moments we don't really need amidst the exciting chaos, and then it rumbles to a slightly weak finish.You don't except a mind-shattering gourmet meal when you order a cheeseburger and shouldn't get bent out of shape when this isn't Alien or 2001. It's a very solid film. Switch brain off and give a go if you like space stuff.No much else to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid alien/horror film,"Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after.I liked how this film in contrast to Alien seemed very plausible and realistic, focusing on the 'science' part of sci-fi. The mission in search of extra terrestrial living organisms is a very interesting topic and this film made the possibilities of this seem so much more plausible. At the same time Life also brings up an interesting idea of how little we know about the universe that we live in and how inexperienced we are. How alien life form could be so different to our expectations and hence the debate of whether we should explore and the consequences of human curiosity.It carried a good amount of intensity and suspense and was gory and terrifying at times.The performances were quite good, the cast is pretty great though so there was no surprise there but it did fall flat in writing though, not that it was poor but it's a very straight forwards and rather clichéd trope that we've seen many times even though it was indeed well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sleek thrill in space...,"""Life"" is one of those type of movies that snuck under my radar. I hadn't even heard about it prior to it being released. And I got the chance to watch it by sheer luck. So of course I did so, because I do love watching movies. And with the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds on the cast list, what's not to like?First of all, I must state that the story presented in ""Life"" was actually surprisingly good and interesting. It is the type of movie that creeps under your skin and sticks with you, leaving you wanting to see more.A Sci-Fi movie is bound to have great CGI, especially if it is a movie that is reliant on proper effects, which was the case of ""Life"". So luckily they had a great budget for the CGI and special effects, and it bore fruit. The CGI was amazing in the movie and it all looked so life-like and realistic, all which definitely contributed to the overall enjoyment and outcome of the movie. Which leads me on to the creature design. Wow. Just wow! I don't know how to explain or detail this, because it is something that has to be seen and experienced with your own two eyes.""Life"" is a very intense movie experience.Of course they had a rather impressive cast ensemble to perform in the movie. With the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds, you know it is going to be good.This is the type of Sci-Fi movie that combines horror in a nice way, and it is definitely a movie that is well worth investing time and money in, if you haven't already seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Turns out astronauts aren't that smart,"It starts of interesting and moody, then it's suspenseful but 20 minutes in it turns stupid and stays that way till the end. The characters make one stupid decision after another and that takes you out of the movie. After the third stupid decision/action you lose interest. Good actors, great sets, good SFX, crappy script. It's entertaining, but just barely.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's LIFE Jim, but not as we know it...","I enjoyed this movie. It has some great jumpy moments at the beginning to pull you into this movie's orbital trajectory.But to enjoy this movie you do have to suspend your essential disbelief that America and a consortium of other product placement regions, sorry I mean Russia, China and Japan, could spend ""well over $200bn"" putting a science station in orbit and then man it (or should that be ""woman it"") with half of a dozen of their most stupid scientists (convincingly played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson). ;-)If you can do that, you'll love it and even find some of it funny.And if you've never seen Alien (1979) or Gravity (2013) before you might even find the plot line highly original too. ;-)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting concept but such STUPID characters!!!,"I wanted to believe the positive reviews but the negative reviews were right!!!! The characters in this film are frustratingly stupid and annoying!!! The amount of dumb decisions they make for scientists and an advanced space crew is beyond believable. Emotional and stupid decisions. Jake Gyllenhaal, who is a superb actor, was even poor in this! His character was so annoying in this movie and he literally ignores all logic and rational thinking, and acted off pure emotion throughout the entire movie. This film had a good cast and still couldn't carry this film. This film is just frustrating beyond words!!! Utter disappointment!!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Expect the Expected?,"Not such an original premise of a sci-fi film, but it seems to tick along ok. The cast and production values are quite good. It's a reasonable viewing mind you, but the climax is more inevitable rather than a twist.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Give it a try. It's pretty interesting.,I wasn't expecting much from this movie because of the reviews that I've read. But it turned out pretty good. Not a great movie but it's pretty interesting. Some of the intense parts actually had me at the edge of my seat.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unbearable ""mistakes"" by movie characters","I was highly annoyed by the unprofessional and error-prone behaviour of the movie characters. Throughout the movie, you will ask yourself: How can he be so stupid? Why is she not doing the obvious? Why are the astronauts emphasising proper procedures, then five seconds later breaking their own rules? How come a former soldier is breaking the chain of command? There is nothing realistic about the behaviour of these characters. In the end, I just hated them. I do not believe that there is a demographic that likes movies like this. Either the script was written by an incompetent author, or the directors are ignorant of what makes a good movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good quality sci fi horror,"Just got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was a really good film.I see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space but that to me is where the similarity ends.Alien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of facing any problems up there.The effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out. Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little blind will help your enjoyment.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't let the Generic Title fool you.,"Yes it has generic title. Yes the plot seems to be a copy of other Sci-Fi movies that have come before, especially, well you know which one, but this movie still manages to feel fresh and ends up doing some things better then what it set out to copy. The suspense is thick with a feeling of hopelessness against a foe that holds more surprises then expected leaving you with a wonder of what can come next.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Life after Gravity,"Mankind is on the verge of a major milestone. The ""Pilgrim"" probe is returning from Mars containing soil samples that might spell the discovery of the first palpable evidence of life beyond earth. Proving that earth scientists are not completely incompetent, the probe is being returned not to earth but to a lab on the International Space Station where strict quarantine can be maintained. This key mission requirement is the responsibility of Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson, ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation""). Supporting her is an international crew including fellow doctor David Harris (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Source Code""), professional astronaut Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds, ""Deadpool"") and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), the lead scientist studying the samples. Needless to say, the soil samples yield more promise than Derry could have ever hoped for (or North could have feared). A crisis of growth and death ensues in a manner that fans of ""Alien"" will be suitably familiar with. Can the crew survive against all the odds?Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors with a raft of quality films in his CV such as ""Nightcrawler"" and last year's hugely underrated (and almost Oscar-ignored) ""Nocturnal Animals"". Rebecca Ferguson is also a class act and one of my favourite actresses of the moment. Here they are starring together for the first time and they don't disappoint. Whilst neither gets enough quality screen time to really hammer their roles home, both connect to the audience in different ways: Harris is heading for an ISS endurance record, and starting to mentally disconnect from earthly connections as his body also starts to atrophy. North, with a clear attraction to him, tries to hold both him and everything together with steely determination, while carrying more knowledge of the mission directives than anyone else has.The supporting ensemble cast also work well, portraying a real mixture of nationalities from the cock-sure American played by Reynolds to the sultry Russian commander Golovkina, played by the lovely Olga Dihovichnaya. A special note should also be added in the margin for one of the most surprising portrayals of a disabled character in a recent film.Unfortunately the material the actors get to deliver, by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (co-writers of ""Deadpool"" and ""Zombieland"") doesn't match their ability. The first 30 minutes or so of the film I found to be totally gripping, but even here some of the dialogue is sufficiently clunky to distract you from the ongoing narrative. Some of the rest of the dialogue becomes head-in-the-hands awful in places: a scene during a de-pressurization episode being particularly painful.Some dodgy dialogue might be forgivable in an action movie if supported by a strong story. Unfortunately, while the premise of the film is sound (if not original), the story leaps from inconsistency to inconsistency from beginning to end. The writers never seem to settle on whether the 'being' needs oxygen, likes oxygen, likes hot, likes cold, etc. and this lack of credibility distracts from the whole film. While the screenplay delivers some seriously suspenseful moments, and some decent jump scares, this is not satisfactory enough to serve up a cohesive movie meal.This is not helped by 'bad science'. As I have commented upon before, I'm a physicist by training and unscientific scenes annoy me to distraction. I've had to learn to live with the basics of explosions and other 'noise' in space (something ""Star Wars"" started 40 years ago, damn those TIE fighters). But there is a scene in ""Life"" involving an airlock breach that just completely beggars belief, acted out as it is like a stiff breeze on the front at Skegness! (It's almost – (almost) – as bonkers as the 'reactor venting' scene with Chris Pratt in ""Passengers"".However, the film has its strong points too. Like ""Gravity"", this is another special effects triumph with the scenes outside the ISS being gorgeously rendered. ""Gravity"" was a clear 10/10; this is probably at least a 7, and a reason for seeing the film on the big screen. A key question though is why there wasn't a 3D version of the film released? Heaven knows I'm no fan of 3D, but ""Gravity"" was one of the few films that was genuinely enhanced by the format: in fact it is currently the only 3D Blu-ray that I own!In general, the whole film seems a little half-cocked and lacking in its own conviction. You wonder whether the production company (Skydance) got rather cold-feet about the film in releasing it when it did. Yes, ""Deadpool"" did very well with its February release, but this is a much more suitable film for a summer audience than a release in this post-Oscars doldrums.In summary, its a moderately entertaining watch, but at heart just another retelling of the old 'something nasty in the woodshed' yarn that we've seen played out countless times before. Here though the swanky setting and special effects are diminished by a lack of credibility and consistency in the storytelling. Redemption was on hand though, for while it was heading for a middling 6* rating, it managed to salvage another star in the final 60 seconds: a memorable movie ending that might prove hard to beat during 2017.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"Good movie, not original.","""Life"" is a movie directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick about a team of scientists aboard the International Space Station that discover a rapidly evolving life form, that caused extinction on Mars, and now threatens the crew and all life on Earth. Looking at the plot, it seems very similar, if not equal, to Ridley Scott's Alien. It's very much inspired by it and Cuaròn's Gravity, so it's not really an original film. Is it good? Yes. Let me explain, step by step: 1) Directing: the movie starts with an amazing sequence shot in the Space Station, it's impressive and features every character and the ISS, there are a lot of upside-down shots which are beautiful to watch. The overall directing is very well done, it's one of the best things of this movie. 2) Cinematography: the Oscar-nominated Seamus McGarvey directed the photography of the movie and it was well done, with some impressive shots. 3) Acting: while not featuring any Oscar-worthy acting, it's pretty good, especially Jake Gyllenhaal. 4) Atmosphere: since it's very much inspired from Ridley Scott's Alien, people could expect the same kind of atmosphere, but, sadly, this movie doesn't capture the perfect anxious and claustrophobic atmosphere of Alien and you don't really feel tension in all the parts of the movie like in Scott's masterpiece. 5) Horror & Gore: it's not the scariest movie ever, it wasn't particularly scary, actually, it wasn't scary at all for ME (I've heard people being scared by it so this is subjective). It doesn't feature a lot of gore scenes, but there are a couple of violent scenes. Still not the extreme violence of Alien movies. 6) CGI: I found the CGI pretty believable. 7) Alien Form: while it's not an iconic alien creature like Giger's Xenomorph of Scott's Alien, it's interesting. While it's not an original movie, Espinosa's Life is enjoyable by sci-fi/horror fans. Don't expect a masterpiece and you will probably like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Catching and stressful,"After recently watched movies about cosmos - Interstellar, Gravity, Arrival - I was expecting to see something similar. Something mysterious, thought-provoking and more or less calm... This movie appeared to be way more stressful! I was nervous almost all the time and some moments were even disgusting. It was nice in a way, because it really catches attention and you are super curious about what will happen next. On the other hand, some moments were just too much. I felt like this movie was more about the emotions rather then having some deep sense.Still, my 8 goes to unexpected moments and catching plot. This is a nice entertaining movie, making you to overthink the life on other planets. Watch it if you lack stress and adrenalin in your life;)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Life will find a way!""","Some Haters of this Suspenseful and Well Mounted Sci-Fi-Horror, especially those that Cry ""Foul"" because of its ""Alien"" (1979) Roots might not know that the Ridley Scott Franchised Hit was itself Rooted in a B-Movie, ""It the Terror from Beyond Space"" (1958). So let's not Forget to Remember that virtually Everything is Derivative of Something.Anyway, on its own, this is an Unoriginal, but Satisfying Space Thriller that takes place in a place of Limited Space.

The Superstar Actors like Gyllenhall and Reynolds were not Needed but Welcomed Aboard. The Movie is not in the Least built on Character, it is built to Terrify and Unsettle and that it does.Overall, Above Average and Better than ""The Martian"" (2015) even with its more Limited Scope and has some Brutal Claustrophobic Carnage. It's Gruesome at Times and Gory, but Never Relinquishes its Tone with Unneeded Jump Scares and Cheap Cop Outs.It's a Mature Movie that has Wide Appeal Across Audience Demographics.

"Bonechilling, frightening and unexpecting with...empty characters?","I'm starting to notice a trend in movies throughout the beginning of the year. Ever since January, we've been getting quite a few different horror/thriller films this year. The results have been mixed to generally positive; Split and Get Out have received positive attention for instance. And now we have Life.Life is about a group of six astronauts who discover a single cell on Mars. They all research it for a while, the cell grows into a life form, and they discover that the life form is very deadly, and the astronauts must work together to keep it from reaching earth.I'm going to start with what I didn't like about the movie. My main issue with it has to be the characters. For the most part, they feel very dry and empty. So much so that I couldn't remember a thing about them. There were only two characters who felt like they had any sense of character. The two I'm talking about are Ariyon Bakare's character since he is a scientist and holds a lot of focus in the beginning as the main researcher. Then there's Hiroyuki Sanada's role. His reasoning for wanting to go back to earth makes him the only character I wanted to root for. Aside from that, it's hard for me to care about the movie's characters.If I were to talk about the things I liked about it, I would like to start with the overall feeling of the movie. After the first act, everything begins to feel tense. There are many tense scenes that have left me feeling horrified, and that's what I believe is the main strength of the movie. If you're going into a thriller movie, you'll expect many intense moments. That's what you get throughout the movie. Something I find very impressive throughout it is that almost the entirety of the film takes place in a space vessel. It's amazing how well it plays into the movie and how well the director, actors and cameraworkers perform their duties and how the movie works so well in such a small, boxed in area. I had my doubts walking in, but what works works really well. Another thing I liked about it was how it ended. I'm not gonna go in-depth with it because that would lead into spoiler territory.Overall, I thought this movie was very frightening and unexpecting. It had many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the movie's weakness would have to be the characters. But I can forgive that with its gripping and thrilling plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm Mixed On LIFE,"Not your typically directed sci-fi movie, or any movie for that matter.I was a little annoyed how quickly the film jumps straight to the unfolding plot with basically zero character development. There is no real lead actor accept for Jake Gyllenhaal, and just barely.While the camera work is innovative and presents believable scenes, I found the spinning and whirling techniques dizzying and over the top.But then something happens about twenty minutes in. The story becomes truly terrifying.""Calvin"", the name originally given to their new pet from the planet Mars, awakes, grows, learns, and makes his prime directive known very quickly: Assimilate all available life forms and kill them.With each kill, Calvin grows bigger, faster and stronger. And he/she/it is one ugly bastard. Calvin looks like a cross between an octopus, dragonfly, and a man eating plant.After failing to burn Calvin to death, the remaining crew quickly assumes Calvin could probably survive re-entry to earth as their damaged space station suffers one calamity after another putting them into a decaying orbit.Many desperate decisions are then made that only prove to make the situation worse.Aside from the odd mix of basically one-dimensional characters and screw-ball camera work, I did find LIFE something of a genuine nail biter and would recommend it, but not for young children.Several of the scenes are very intense and I'm not sure you would want your eight-year-old watching it.Nightmarish stuff for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unremarkable and Kind of Dumb,"Okay, so we're used to Hollywood recycling all the same basic stories into some newer and usual inferior version. With sci fi, whether that's horror or space opera, it's with more special effects. Life is one of those movies. While nothing truly special, the effects in this movie do try to take us to a different reality by making just about every scene in a weightless environment. We've seen that before but not quite to this degree.Too bad it's wasted on a typical puerile story, with little suspense and cardboard characters. This is one of those movies where the actors have to simultaneously look drugged -- as though they feel no real emotions -- while also acting in frenetic ways -- because, you know, the action comes at us 100 MPH.Now, the characters here are all the stock types. We have the stalwart commander, the sensible junior officer, the scientist who goes too far, and the various cannon fodder for the creature that, of course, will stalk them all. You've seen this story a million times, and with smarter people. In fact, these are among the dumbest scientists presented in this sort of film, even though ostensibly, they should all have graduate degrees.Their first mistake is taking what appears to be a single-celled organism from Mars and messing around with it about the International Space Station. You'd think NASA, at the very least, would have protocols for such, but these folks behave more like camp counselors in one of those ski mask killer movies. Oh, there's a protocol in case something gets out but apparently anyone can just mess around with new life however they want in the meantime.In some ways, the movie want to be The Andromeda Strain, but that movie was smart, told in a semi-documentary style. This movie is like a videogame, with little time to think (even though some scenes drag the action out while the crew seems to react in slow motion). If that's your thing, you'll be amazed by this movie. If you're someone easily impressed who scoffs with the usual tripe of ""Huh, huh, huh, it's only a movie, man,"" then you're actually on to something but for the wrong reasons. Yes, it's only a movie. That's all it is.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The so-so love-child of Alien, The Andromeda Strain, and Gravity","In general, horror films tend to follow the same formula: introduce main characters and their friendship, introduce monster, monster kills them off one by one, and there's some kind of twist at the end.Life follows this formula as well, and there are absolutely no surprises.The story centers around a group of scientists aboard the International Space Station, who analyze soil samples brought back from Mars and discover a form of life from Mars. They work on it in space so as not to risk Earth, which proves to be a wise precaution as the Mars life form (which is named Calvin by schoolchildren planet- side) grows rapidly and decides it doesn't want to be a lab specimen anymore.There are many obvious parallels to Alien/Aliens as it is set in space, revolves around a small crew aboard a space vessel getting picked off one by one by a creature, and they can't risk it getting to Earth.However, at least with Alien we know it's predominantly a horror film with a sci-fi setting. Life, on the other hand, can't seem to decide if it's a sci-fi film that happens to have horror elements, or a horror film that is trying to be a sci-fi film. In the end, it's trying to be both and kinda failing at both.To be fair, there are some good character moments. Ryan Reynolds is a bright spot in a cast of otherwise one-dimensional characters, and even though Reynolds' space mechanic character is also one- dimensional, at least he's enjoyable to watch.The rest of the cast gets fairly cursory character set-up, and by the end you just don't really feel a sense of loss when someone inevitably dies.Finally, the creature itself, while intriguing when starting out small, turns into a pretty generic space monster by the end, which is fine but breaks no new ground and leaves you feeling kinda blah about the whole thing.All in all, this film is not terrible, it does not make for painful viewing, nor does it make for edge of the seat thrills. It's a very average film with some big star power attached to draw you in, and if you go into this film knowing this, then you'll be fine.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great sci-fi flick for normal people,"And by saying normal I mean those, who watch movies for entertainment purposes, and who have a vivid imagination. And who know what they are watching. I love sci-fi movies, I've seen a lot of them, and I was really looking forward to watching this one. There are many reviews that say it's full of dumb and illogical things and so on. Well, I still decided to watch the movie and there was not a single moment, when a had a smile on my face, thinking - what a nonsense! Maybe there were some logical errors in the plot, but I don't think about things like that when I know I'm watching a movie about aliens, and not some sort of wildlife documentary. Aliens, Carl! Things that don't exist! (Well, maybe they do, but that's another subject). If you work at NASA and you've had a really bad day and now you're just searching for some incentive to start smashing your TV in order to release all that bad energy - this movie might do the trick. But if you just want to watch a good movie about space and stuff - there's quite a big chance you'll like it! Just remember - this is not a math test you have to correct. Don't search for mistakes, just relax and enjoy. It's a really well made thriller, definitely better than the last Alien movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Flat and derivative,"If you have been around the science fiction film block a reasonable number of times, you will almost certainly see that the premise of ""Life"" is heavily derived from the movie ""Alien"". But originality in Hollywood these days is a rare thing, and I was open to seeing the same story again as long as it was done with style and a few original touches. Unfortunately, the end results pretty much lack those ingredients. The first third or so of the movie is surprisingly dull - the movie can't find awe and wonder about the premise of finding alien life from another planet, believe it or not. Then when the alien lifeform subsequently becomes a threat, you would think there would be plenty of scares and tense moments. But surprisingly, that's not the case. The so-called terror feels... well... flat. I think a big reason for that is that the human characters are not well developed. They are so bland that it's hard to care about them and feel the so-called terror that they are experiencing. The only saving grace the movie has are a few good special effects, though there are also some special effect moments that comes across as surprisingly crude and clunky (bad CGI rears its ugly head in a Hollywood movie once more!) You'd be better off rewatching ""Alien"" than this clone.",,Anonymous,Horror
Solidly Entertaining Horror Sci-Fi,"Had I not seen ""Life"" the same weekend that I also watched ""Alien: Covenant,"" I might have dismissed it as a cheap ""Alien"" rip-off. But because ""Alien: Covenant"" was such a dirty piece of cinematic toilet paper, I ironically ended up liking ""Life"" more than I might otherwise have for coming much closer to giving me the experience of watching an ""Alien"" movie than an actual ""Alien"" movie did.""Life"" has modest ambitions and meets them admirably, thanks to competent direction, a pretty decent set of actors, and a system of internal logic that follows its own rules. I have no idea how realistically scientific the movie is and don't much care, but the things that happen make sense within the context of the movie, and that's what matters to me. There are some truly disturbing moments -- like one where the alien life form kills off a major character early on by eating him from the inside, or another in which a crew member drowns in her own space helmet -- and the film is paced well. Its twist ending is handled a bit awkwardly and doesn't have as much impact as the filmmaker I think wanted it to have, but overall this is a solidly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Grade: B+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Goodnight Moon,"If the Alien franchise never existed, 'Life' may be considered a groundbreaking movie in the sci-fi genre, but obviously that's not the case. The good thing is, 'Life' doesn't hide the fact that it's clearly inspired by the original Alien film. Because it's extremely well- acted, paced, shot, and structured, the similarities don't really matter. 'Life' is just a heck of a thrilling time at the movies.I can appreciate original science fiction as much as the next guy, but when you have a film that is as entertaining from start to finish as 'Life', I don't need every scene to be something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 'Life' stars Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare; written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (same guys who did Deadpool); and directed by Daniel Espinosa. There's nothing overtly new or refreshing with any aspect of 'Life', but at the same time, the film fires on all cylinders.At a brisk run-time of 103 minutes, 'Life' never slows down. It reminded me a lot of 2013's Gravity in that way. The only time these films stopped to breathe was to add subtle but vital character depth to the story. Scene after scene is filled with terror, intrigue, and impressively shot action. It doesn't have the polished cinematography that the aforementioned Gravity or Interstellar does, but what films do? Life succeeds in nicely timed long takes, shocking deaths, and a terrifying creature named Calvin, but it doesn't always nail the emotionally gripping sequences.However, what struck me most was the film's intelligence. All of the characters acted exactly how I would imagine these particular people would act in real life. Although some choices could be perceived as illogical, you have to put yourself in their shoes. Having an extremely dangerous life form trapped on your spacecraft isn't the most ideal situation, after all.With stellar performances from the entire lead cast and it's single celled antagonist, 'Life' is one of the best films of the year thus far. Shocking, gruesome, and relentless, 'Life' manages to avoid falling into the forgettable sci-fi territory. It's better than I could have hoped this Alien knockoff would have been. If everything goes accordingly, we will have two great Alien films this year.+Great cast+The best Alien film since 1986+Relentless tension-Doesn't pack enough emotional punch9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun, predictable space horror film","Life is currently playing in cinemas. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson who is known for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. This film basically plays out exactly the same way as Ridley Scott's Alien. A small group of scientists discover a probe on the planet Mars. On the space station ISS the scientists analyze the creature. It is rapidly growing and starts to get violent really quick to point it out without spoiling anything. What really worked for me was the creature, it was terrifying and mysterious just like the alien and the predator. The acting too is very good, Ryan Reynolds has a lot of charisma and so does Rebecca Ferguson. They really did make me care for them, unfortunately that is the only real detail given to any character. I only cared about Reynolds and Ferguson as they had charisma, Gyllenhaal on the other hand really did let me down. He gives a good performance but his character simply isn't interesting. Unlike 'Alien' which has characters that are like actual real people. 'Life' makes it too easy by just giving the audience two dimensional characters. Some of them have charisma but most of them I fear were plain and dull. The story too is incredibly predictable, you know how everything will play out fairly quickly. This would've been okay if the characters were interesting and likable. Overall this still is a fun sci-fi horror flick with some really scary scenes and charismatic performances.

"The ""Gravity"" We Wanted","Even with its flaws, the movie kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat.Many of the reviews are negative due to ""illogical"" or ""stupid"" narrative events... well guess what, it's called science fiction for a reason. If you can suspend your disbelief while watching this movie, you will enjoy it. Science fiction is not meant to depict reality, it's meant to take you to another world, and that's what this movie achieves.The cinematography and visual effect were a highlight, and the story has a lot more depth than ""Gravity - which actually tried to depict real scenarios but failed miserably. Sure some of the character development is weak, but the movie overall is a fun watch and I recommend you see it for yourself.

minor shades of Alien,"Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya), and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) are six astronauts aboard the international space station orbiting the Earth. They manage to catch the capsule from Mars containing life from the red planet. Derry is able to reanimate the dormant single organism. It grows into a danger to the station and Earth itself.There are moments of over-reaching while the best of this movie is reminiscent of the classic horror Alien with a good dose of Gravity. It's definitely not quite at those levels. The small alien has a cool look but it could never shakes its CGI construction. The bigger alien has some crawlies goodness. The movie starts with manufactured action that seems overblown in hindsight. The initial experiments is stretching the tension too much and it becomes unreal. There are some poor decisions that go too far. Nevertheless, this creature feature has some good creeps and I like the way the creature attacks. Crushing is not the usual method in a horror and this does it well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Holds Your Attention but the chars' decisions are annoyingly stupid,"Starts off very promising with great tech and effects and astronaut/space science characters who aren't Wunderkinde fresh out of high school. Their circumstances go south pretty as they break one safety protocol after another. Thankfully there are no earthbased chars or subplots that weaken the mood or tension of their plight. Very watchable with a slightly predictable ending that could have been written to be more shocking and sad. I'd like to see a well-crafted sequel but nothing is showing up indicating anything in the works. As mankind gets closer to finding extraterrestrial life, LIFE can serve as a preview or reminder that we need to be careful and also expect the unexpected including chemicals, compounds, life forms and energy forces we are 200% not ready for.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horribly Beautiful or beautifully horrible ?,"Im huge fan of scifi so couldn't missed it.. nothing is perfect including this film, but come on, don't be like those guys who criticize every scene in logical,physical,scientific point of view..it has great freshness in it, very welcomed ending, great build up and working start of the second act. film has numerous scenes where you get goosebumps, especially girls will be shocked no doubt. Only thing is that Reynolds is predictably the ""funny guy"" of this crew and it seems bit annoying. he maybe wanted this role and be similar like in dead-pool or so.. he is funny guy and i like this person in real life but he should try to play very reasonable, pragmatic, calm guys.. maybe he should play Gylenhaal's role.. Characters are only weak point. you must like em from another movies to wish them luck here. you don't know em much. you see who's got family, who's got spooky sense for living in space, but is it enough ? Yes movie has ALien (1979) DNA in it, yes its modern-like horror, but first of all it has power to scare you or spook you (at least), because the monster is pretty awesome, scary and it has all horror ingrediences in that monster design.

Had a ton of potential,"I've got to admit that this is a lot better than I remembered it being in 2017. Obviously it is technically excellent in every way. Cinematography, special effects, you name it. It's outstanding. It also has an extremely strong cast, but for reasons unknown this is its first failing. The only actor giving an interesting performance is suddenly gone at around the 40 minute mark and that would be Ryan Reynolds. The film weakens from that point on, but it would still be interesting, and some of it is, if that downslide did not lead to a very predictable twist near the end with a finale that is no crowd pleaser. Rebecca Ferguson gives a solid enough performance, but Jake Gyllenhaal is like a mannequin that can communicate.

"Slick-looking, fast and brutal enough to satisfy those hungry for some blood and guts","A space crew discovers life on Mars! But it's never too late to copy the seminal sci-fi classic ""Alien"" (1979), so it decides to kill everybody on the International Space Station, and do it fast. I hope they will not let it reach Earth, because that would spell doom for all of us!Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada. They do a fine work with all the usual genre staples – pretending to be awed by new life form, then scared, brave, desperate etc. – but it's not really an actors' movie. You will only probably remember Reynolds because his character's fate is the most surprising.If you like the kind of movies where humankind meets extraterrestrial life that turns out to be fast and efficient killer(s), then you will mostly enjoy ""Life"". If you find the original ""Alien"" blueprint shamelessly overused during the last 40- some years, then you will... also mostly enjoy this. It's fast and brutal enough to satisfy those hungry for some blood and guts, and slick-looking. Good luck searching for this movie online, though. The word ""life"" is a popular part of many movie titles, including some which are also just called ""Life"". Like this Eddie Murphy's and Martin Lawrence's 1999's comedy which is way more original but way less entertaining than this new actioneer. ""Life"" has been released two months earlier than initially planned, to avoid competition with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"". A wise choice! Or maybe it would have turned out to be an excellent counterprogramming for those who would rather be killed by extraterrestrial than watch another Johnny Depp big summer movie?Directed by Daniel Espinosa whom you probably don't remember by competent actioneer ""Safe House"" (2012) and mediocre thriller ""Child 44"" (2015).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Life is like an unofficial reboot of Alien with a shocking climax twist.A decent watch for its thrills.,"Life (2017): When a movie stars both Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds,one would expect a mind blowing one for sure.But Life is nothing like that.It is our typical sci-fi horror which will remind us Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien.During the period of epic space films like Gravity.Interstellar and The Martian,a film like Life should have some distinct qualities to standout from those but unfortunately Life doesn't have those except from an amazing climax.Plot: Set on-board the International Space Station, Life kicks off with its crew performing the successful capture of a probe that's returning from Mars with a sample inside. This crew is made up of Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Sho Kendo (Hiroyuki Sanada), Ariyon Bakare (Hugh Derry), and Katerina Golovkin (Olga Dihovichnaya), and they're ecstatic to learn that the sample includes the first proof of extraterrestrial life. But the organism soon starts to grow and evolve at an alarming rate, and after a test backfires, it becomes hostile, threatening the lives of everyone on board, as well as those on Earth below.My Review: The problem with Life is that it's almost too aware of the films that have come before, and it always feels like it's striving to be held in the same regard.Life just plods along a bit too predictably. After concocting a gripping enough concept, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are happy to follow the well-worn path of the film's predecessors, as six becomes five, which becomes four, and so on..Life is termed as horror but it is nowhere a horror.It doesn't even try to be one.It mostly depends on thrills of how the organism attacks its next victim.But what really surprises is its nail-biting,shocking climax which is the life of the movie.That particular scene at the end is spine chilling when we guess the consequences.Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as usual as it is a cakewalk for him.Ryan Reynolds is wasted in a small role.Others are decent.Director Espinosa,who earlier directed Child 44 (which is bad) did a decent job by unofficially rebooting Alien with a shocking climax twist.Cinematography is good and BGM is soul of the film.Especially at the climax,BGM makes sure that we suffocate with tension.So,Life is like an unofficial reboot of Alien with a shocking climax twist.A decent watch for its thrills.My rating 6.75/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is filled with unpredictable twists and turns, a few in particular but let's not spoil such an amazing movie. ;)I would definitely say this is a must watch for any sci-fi/space and thrill lover as the never ending tension builds up with the progression of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

You know they're doomed. They know they're doomed. But they don't believe it yet.

You will scream at the screen and hide behind your popcorn. Your stomach will twist up in knots of dread and you will feel hunted.

"Inspired by Alien, succeeds on all but the most important one!","First let's get one thing straight, I love these kind of movies. Alien has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it.Life clearly got it's inspiration from it. You can't deny it. And seeing as Alien was it's inspiration, you'll wan't to compare it to it.But if you do that, like I did, you will not have a good time and will think it's not a great movie.The story of Life is simple in its design. A probe comes back to the ISS with soil samples from Mars. In it the team finds a single celled life-form which they are able to revive from it's dormant state. They start testing and things go wrong and the whole movie goes on a decent into a roller-coaster of tension.In the tension department this movie truly excels, it has a few good jump scares, a few brutally gore filled sequences. But that's all there is.Comparing it to Alien, which is similar, it does almost just as well. Don't get me wrong, the design for the life-form is great. Unique to be exact.But why is this not going to be a classic or overall great horror- SF like Alien? It has all the same base elements as it's older brother. And the answer to this is fairly easy. The tension in Life compared to Alien is stale. Alien started out a lot slower, giving you a false sense of security. When the action starts, you just can't seem to think of any means of escape or survival. And Alien tops it off with a different kind of tension than Life.Where Life has a tension built on the idea of the life-form itself, the tension in Alien is not because of the alien, but because of the surroundings. Giving you a claustrophobic feeling preying on the primal instinct of fight or flight. Life doesn't even consider this. The setting of ISS should have given you the feeling that there is no escape. But you never get that idea. Because of this small, but key, difference, it makes itself inferior to its own inspiration.One other difference between the two is not it's cast, but it's crew. The crew in Life seem to always make the wrong decision. Although I love it when a good plan fails over and over again, that was not the case in this movie. Most of the decisions seemed like they would not have been made by professional scientist and astronauts. These people should have been trained to deal with any situation, even a breach in quarantine. But apparently they never trained for any of these situations. In Alien the crew were just work-class civilians who just happened to stumble upon something extra-terrestrial. They were people like you and me. This made all their decisions the same as we would make them, improving on the dread and hopelessness of the situation.All in all, it's still a fun movie to watch. It has a great cast, a great creature design and a magnificent plot twist at the end, but don't go in thinking this could be the next Alien because you will leave disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Life, So Delicate, So Fragile, So Detailed In Terms of Death","What is life? That is a question that so many researchers have tried to answer over the centuries. And what better way to try and answer that question than with a Hollywood movie production starring Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. My last review this weekend is on the movie called Life, a science fiction/horror film hoping to provide the scares of the March season. But will contact with this film give you the chills, or send you running to the illswith disappointment. Robbie K here with another review. Let's get started!LIKES:  True Science Fiction  Evolution of the creature  Creepy and horrifying  Good charactersSummary: We know most science fiction movies fall short of the genre, focusing more on the fantasy element and special effects (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) Life though hits the genre right on the mark, dropping us amidst an international space station where research about Mars is underway. As the chaos unfolds, the crew has to use their training, knowledge, and science (and not gigantic guns) to try to outwit the beast before it gets them. And speaking of the creature, ""Calvin"" as it is called has an interesting design at the start looking like a fungus. Yet the spores quickly evolve into a deflated looking star fish, and from there began to evolved into a truly destructive creature. Calvin's metamorphosis is perhaps the creepiest aspect of this film, as his search for the crucial ingredients (food, water, and oxygen) drives it to savagery (it will make you look at star fish in a whole new way).Outside of that though, some other factors that brought the thrills and chills start with the realistic setting. There rendition of the international space station looks pretty close to our own world's, minimizing the fantasy component to keep one ground in the horror the team tries to present, establishing a feeling that this could happen. To go alongside this, the other factor is how alone one feels on the station. Much like the first Alien movie (to which this pays homage to), you feel the isolation of the station as if you are the prey Calvin seeks. This added edge truly brings the horror aspect full circle Finally, the characters also help amplify the horror component of this film. It is nice to see the human cast not be a bunch of idiotic, shallow teens for once, but instead educated scientists fighting for survival (while also not being the single-minded buffoons that often take these roles). The cast was dynamic, each specialized but capable of covering their team members should something happen. Such development led to characters you actually rooted for, instead of against them as we often see in horror films. And the actors all played their roles fantastically, from Ryan Reynolds sarcasm, to Jake Gyllenhaal's scary accuracy in someone with social anxiety.DISLIKES:  Unneeded dramatic opening  More evolution of the creature  Predictable ending (though nice twist)  Savagery of killsSummary: A minor dislike I know, but Life's dramatic capturing of the capsule in the first twelve minutes was really unnecessary. All I gleamed from this opening was technical displays and a little excitement to get the mood going. There are probably a few other scenes that could have been left out as well, but these were minor compared to the big stink they made with this opening sequence.Unnecessary scenes aside, the other thing I would have liked was more development into the creature. Don't get me wrong, the final form was creepy, but after all the changes happening in the beginning (which were a stretch mind you), the team suddenly brought it to a halt. Yes, they tried to explain it via ""science"", but this abrupt halt just broke pace/balance the movie was establishing, which felt a little off for me, right down to the end.Speaking of ending, Life's trailers hint at what the conclusion is, and based on my observations I had a good idea where it would go. I wanted things to be different, but sadly the ending can be predicted within 30 minutes of the show time (assuming again you haven't watched the trailers). Albeit there was a nice twist to try and throw you off, Life's directors didn't go the full distance to prove my observations wrong.Yet the biggest beef I have with this movie is the dark, disturbing, savageness the directors instilled. If you're a fan of watching gore filled deaths, suffering, and depressing looks this movie will send ""out of orbit"". For me though, these moments only take away from a movie if done too much or in the wrong manner. My biggest strike comes from the graphic death of a lab mouse (which broke my heart as most animal cruelty does). That's only the start of Life's grotesque hunt as Calvin finds disturbing ways to attack the band of researchers in immense detail. Why the directors felt the need to focus on such disturbancesI don't know, but in this case less would have been more, as the first Alien flick did long ago.The VERDICT:Overall, Life is one of the better science fiction, horror films I've seen in years. It drops the grandiose serial killers and idiotic victims, and upgrades to an adapting monster hunting intelligent people. This realism crafts a more suspenseful tale that kept me engaged, while crafting that horrifying atmosphere I love. While most of my dislikes are small, the mutilation involved, alongside some scientific imbalances, really didn't impress me in this movie and the predictable ending didn't necessary wow me as well. Is this worth a trip to theater? If you are looking for a good horror film, then by all means hit the theater for it. As for weak constitutions, skip this one and save some time.My scores: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It's life, Jim, but actually as we know it.","Life is an average sci-fi picture, one that gets by on effects and general sci-fi values. Plot is utterly familiar. OK! It's always going to be unfair to judge a film of this type by the bar raiser that was Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), but really the familiarity on show here is tantamount to being naughty.A group of space explorers discover an alien life form and after the initial wonderment and excitement subsides, things quickly turn bad, with the potential for threat to mankind as we know it...That's pretty much it, really, the cast go through the motions of being in a play that is basically the characters being picked off by an alien manta ray thingy. Standard formula takes a grip of the viewer, who will be killed? who is next? will anyone survive? and etc. The makers - just to continue the unadventurous theme - throw in a Deep Blue Sea moment, while Hiroyuki Sanada has wandered in off of Sunshine's Icarrus II to feature aboard the International Space Station. The ending has and will infuriate many, but personally I liked it, very much from The Twilight Zone dimension, to which it lifts the piece just above averageville.Not recommended with any conviction, especially to sci-fi fans stung by serious science defects and logic holes, while casual sci-fiers would be better off with the brilliance of Alien or something more fun packed and unpretentious like Leviathan (1989).

"Intense for sure with a justified ""R"" rating.","I was fortunate enough to go see this movie as part of an advanced screening on Wednesday 03/22/2017. Overall this move is a solid ""B"". To start off, the set-up is critical. It does border on almost too long, but just as I began to realize that, the movie did ramp up. There definitely is suspense, and the plot did require a bit of disbelief in the lack of protocols I believe actual scientists would take in ""growing"" the life-form, who quickly by the way becomes the actual star of the movie. This is a pure monster movie though, and after a bit more time, the creature solidly shows who is boss. What really kept this story higher than a ""C"" rating is that the alien really does cause murder and mayhem in ways that are completely unique to other Sci-Fi or horror movies like Alien(s), SE7EN, Final Destination, etc. This movie is not for children, 14 years old minimum, and even that is a stretch. Language aside, LIFE definitely earned it's ""R"" rating from the sheer shock value of the deaths in the movie. Very few movies can do that. Think about how the original Poltergeist, Predator, or Jaws did this. In fact several, (about a dozen) people actually left the movie. Not because I think it was ""bad"", but because of the scare and squeamish factor. The movie however, lacks - something overall. Maybe it's just the cheap (possible) sequel set-up the director included. It has a Mark Wahlberg Planet of the Apes feel to it.Or, the fact that it just seems that once again humans are portrayed as completely stupid when it comes to strange, extraterrestrial organisms. Don't get me wrong, I liked it overall, and a 3-D version would be awesome. LIFE is a fun, (gory but fun) trip to take.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary Thriller,"First 30 minutes of the movie is mainly space station and the standard protocol. Then comes research, and it starts as boring piece of Botany class curriculum. Then I was clinging to the edge of my seat until the very end. Some portions of the movie are quiet tense and tragic and other portion are really tense moments. The structure anatomy and behavior of the alien life is simple forms and complex forms but very intelligent and powerful life.

Finally a scary horror movie,"Life (2017) is a sci-fi/horror movie that tells the story of a team of scientist charged to analyzed sample from mars soil from the confine space of space station in orbit around earth. The discover in one of the sample a simple cellular life form that will soon evolve into something far more deadlyThe film's context might not be the most original you've ever seen. Yet, in my opinion, Life (2017) has a lot of things going for it that makes quite special in the modern horror genre.What I mean by that is that he movie never falls in many of the easy old tricks we are so used to in horror films : There are no so-called suspense scene that drags for long minutes, where you're supposed to be scared but in fact you're bored to death because nothing happens. There are no jumps scares. It is not overly gory (just enough). And last but not least, it's a monster movie where the monster doesn't hide off camera or in the dark for 90% of the film.Instead, everything happens in plain sight of the viewer.The fact that, without using any tricks, Life (2017) managed to be so scary is, in my opinion, an achievement that very few horror movies have reached.This is mostly due to the creepy nature of its creature.Without giving anything away, just know that it is a strong, smart-ass piece of filth that will make you reconsider your positive opinion about extraterrestrial life and squids.The movie is also served by a good cast, excellent cinematography, a creepy yet discrete score and top notch special effect. It is clear that everyone involved put a lot of care and effort into itOf all the horror movies I've seen in my life (a lot), I can count the finger of my right hand the ones that I can consider really scary. Life(2017) is one of them.I really hope it will get the credit it deserve, but it's already a favorite of mine.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Their historic discovery was not celebratable.,"As I mentioned many times before, now is the trend of the space exploration in films. So there were many films like this one, but not all of them are received well. It was a decent flick, if you consider from the real world aspect, but definitely a very nice entertainer. Very tense plot, especially in the second half till the final scene.This is a minimal cast film and the entire story takes place in an Internation Space Station in the Earth orbit with a lab facility. They've come from Mars with a soil sample to study for any sign of life. Their historic discovery does not become a happy event as they encounter life threatening trouble on-board. The remaining is to focus their rest of the mission that how it'll end.This is the second film with the same name I've seen in the recent time. The other one was a biographical-drama starring Robert Pattison, but this is an sci-fi-thriller. Lots of big names in it, but the film did not make that kind of a big buzz. It was considered a good fictional space film. Kind of inspired by other similar themed flicks.Lots of thrills, fast paced narration, a simple story with the nice visuals. From the Swedish director of 'Easy Money' fame. There were lots of speculations about its connection with other films. But nothing was confirmed by the filmmakers.

"They should have named the film ""Stupid"" instead of ""Life""","Seriously, if real astronauts were a millionth as stupid as every single character in this film, we'd never have ""slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.""Hell, if the average person on earth was as stupid as the characters in this film, humanity would have gone extinct millennia ago. The entire plot of this film is driven by characters making obviously terrible decisions, one after another. A single good decision in the course of this film would have ended the story, because all that was required for the humans to ""win"" was to just not be completely, utterly, and overwhelmingly stupid at every turn.Others have broken down the endless parade of stupid decisions that drive the plot, so I'll spare you and keep this spoiler free. The only word you need to describe this film is STUPID, and the only thing required for you to enjoy this film is to start off by lobotomizing yourself with a power drill.

When a Martian wants to hug it out,"We know the scenario, but the filmmakers set themselves the challenge of doing it better than we've ever seen it done before - and they almost succeeded.The movie is set on the International Space Station orbiting Earth. There are six astronauts including Dr David Jordan, Jake Gyllenhaal's character. They are awaiting an unmanned probe returning from the surface of Mars with soil samples. When it arrives, what at first looks like a piece of Martian snot, turns out to be the organism that wiped out life on the red planet. As it grows, it threatens to do the same to Earth if it can get down there.You can probably guess what happens if you have seen ""Alien"" or ""Apollo 18"". However the effects in this movie rock; they would have to be the best ever for a movie like this. I remember back in the 1950's when you could see the fishing line holding up the spaceships - we can thank Stanley and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the special effects leap to hyperspace; they just got better and better until now you can't believe your eyes - maybe it is proof aliens have visited Earth.However special effects can't be the whole show; the heart of the story has to be the characters. There are six of them and we get to know them a little before the Martian organism, nicknamed Calvin, starts to pick them off. I must admit I liked these guys a lot more than the crew of the Nostromo in ""Alien""; they are a classier bunch altogether and less foulmouthed.As the Martian entity grows, it hunts the crew down one by one in some truly terrifying scenes. Anyone who has battled an Australian huntsmen spider around their bedroom will identify with the plight of Jake and the guys.But a film needs to end right for it to be truly memorable, and I don't love the ending of this one. It's a bit tricky and doesn't have the weight of the rest of the film; it would have been fine for an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"".Even an ending like the one in another close encounter with Martians, 1950's""Rocketship X-M"", gave more satisfying closure. Despite primitive effects and laughable dialogue, it finished with a sense of sacrifice as the surviving crew stoically accepted the inevitable. But maybe that's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Death,"Not the Eddie Murphy comedy of the same name, a more appropriate title might be ""Death"" as this film focuses on a spaceship crew gradually eliminated by an ever-evolving Martian lifeform. The film has earned unfavourable comparisons to 'Alien', however, the plot differs in unexpected ways. Most notably, the crew in 'Life' initially befriend the lifeform and raise it in an artificial atmosphere with some great early moments and excellent CGI as the minute creature curls back and forth and forms retractable limbs. The alien's motives are also very different here as it only kills in defense, with the crew bringing the horror upon themselves by their unorthodox administering of electrical shocks and then trying to kill it when it understandably defends itself. This agenda would, however, work better with more credible characters. For highly trained scientists, the team often let emotions get in the way and recklessly break safety protocols. The film also lacks characters as interesting as Ellen Ripley, but Jake Gyllenhaal has some good parts as an astronaut who -- after spending over a year in space -- would prefer to stay there for the rest of his life. With lots of mindless carnage and less interesting creature effects as it increases in size, the film sometimes feels like wasted potential. It is, however, capped off with a really powerful ending and Jon Ekstrand's brooding score is great throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In Space, no one can see the stupid things you do, over and over, and over, and over","It seems like Hollywood wants us to believe that every single person being sent into space, being astronauts, scientists, engineers, doctors, specialists, theorists and experts are morons. People who's actions are subnormal at best, over and over and over, which of course leads to easy script writing, because when you have morons in space, anything can happen, at any given time.We have recently seen this in movies like Prometheus and Alien Covenant as well, and there is no other reason to portray these characters like idiots, unless you want to write a movie faster, there is no other reason. Therefor it is lazy and without passion.Why do Hollywood think that i will feel anything for characters that basically signed Darwin's Law before they went to space?. People making stupid decisions that put themselves and everyone else at risk at any given time? I say screw them, let them die.Which then kinda ruins the purpose of this film, which tries to bring some heart to the story before manure hits the fan (That other word that starts with S is prohibited here on IMDb.......). But the character development in this film is absolutely horrible, and the characters are bland and uninteresting. I have difficulty understanding why Reynolds and Gyllenhaal signed up for this, as this movie can only damage their careers.This movie has basically nothing going for it story and character wise. What this movie does well, is the CGI, which for the most part is pretty nice. But i could not help noticing this movie tried to replicate Gravity (2013). And throw in the essence of Alien (1979) just to try and make it interesting. But the story has no logic to it, the plot is carried by foolish decisions, the entire movie insults my intelligence to a point i hardly could find it in me to give it 3 stars.I am so glad this movie was a flop. Some times horrible films earns hundreds of millions, even billions, this is not one of them. It has earned far less than it cost to produce.I hope Gyllenhaal and Reynolds is more careful choosing roles from now on, they are really good actors and can carry a film on their own. Just look at how good Gyllenhaal was in Donnie Darko and Nightcrawler for example, And Reynolds in Buried and Deadpool. They should not have signed up for this train wreck.I'm not sure who to blame for everything here. The direction isn't really bad, but the director took on this job, he is responsible for the outcome, even though i suspect studio executives overruled him on so many occasions. It's sad that the industry has come to this, where only a few directors are allowed to present their true vision, but that's not saying this director ever had one.But none the less, the script is the biggest problem in this film. It is just ridiculously poorly written, I'm simply amazed this movie got green-lit to a budget of 60 million dollars.Avoid this one.If you want a space horror movie that works, you watch Alien and Aliens. Or if you just want to watch space movies in general, see The Martian or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Or Gravity. Just not this one, and also, stay away from Passengers, which is also a horrible recent space movie.3/10 - Bad",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Attack of the Martian Octopus......,"This film could just have easily been called Attack of the Martian Octopus.Sorry if that initial description sounds depreciating but there's really not a lot to this film. Its a fundamentally simple premise that, in a basic way, is akin to the likes of Alien, just not as exciting.The acting is reasonable but this is not a film run by narrative, for the most part. Its an exposition driven affair, that is action focused. To be fair too, there's a good amount of action but the nature of the film is restricted by the narrow confines of the space station, in which it takes place.I'd say not a bad film as such but not doing anything terribly innovative . A few more risks and maybe a more expansive setting, would have added some depth. Six out of ten from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sci-fi-horror film set in deep space. I also recommend you see Europa Report (2013) and Harbinger Down (2015).,"This film is a hybrid of Alien 1979 and The Thing 1982. In short, this is a ""creature"" film.This film casts two well known male actors Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. I think this is the first time these actors have acted together in the same film. The female actresses in the film are Rebecca Ferguson and Olga Yuryevna Dihovichnay. The rest of the cast are experienced actors Ariyon Bakare and Hiroyuki Sanada.Plot: six-member International Space Station (ISS) crew capture a probe returning from Mars with a soil sample that might contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. Exobiologist Hugh Derry(Ariyon Bakare) revives a dormant cell from the sample, and it quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name ""Calvin"". After an atmospheric accident in the lab, Calvin becomes dormant.If you have seen The Thing 1982 and The Alien Trilogy of films, this film will appeal to you in the sense of sci-fi horror coupled with intense action scenes. The background music effects are also superb as is the cinematography. Swedish director Jorge Daniel Espinosa directs his first full length U.S. feature film and he does so professionally. Also those of you who like surprise endings will not be disappointed.Thanks for reading my review, may you lead a full and happy life and proper.More creature films: Lifeforce(1985), Star Crystal(1986), Moontrap(1989 stars Walter Koenig of Star Trek fame), The Dark Side of the Moon(1990), Critters 4(1992), Pitch Black(2000).I have seen tons of films in my life most of them sci-fi horror, sad to say I can't remember all of them. These above films are a good guide into the genre. I also recommend you see Nightflyers(1987) based on the novella by George R.R. Martin.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The problem here is not the action or the visuals, but rather derivative story line that hadn't been told too many times to count. This can only hurt the SF genre. Continuing this type of story line, will actually have many believe that space Sci Fi is just about this plot. Except for Star Wars, or maybe Guardians of the Galaxy. Many will stop coming to theaters to pay, on this principal alone for the alien on ship plot. This movie may be a sign of this, as it was clearly a bomb to end all bombs at the box office, and missed its cost to make by a large margin.

"Just another movie about an improbable, implausible, unstoppable - already seen alien","Cast is the best part of the movie, but they all feel underused so the whole movie feels overstaffed. That means they were there in those numbers just so they could be disposed, which suggests poor writing.Emotions are forced on us, character build is generically created, connections between them as well their families on earth feel generical, artificial or are left ambiguous so much so that they all seem in the beginning stages of romantical involvement with each other and therefore any drama attempts don't really work.The terror and enigma of the just discovered alien species seems promising in the beginning, but not for long - and the whole movie ends up carrying that already seen stench from the beginning till the end.Until the very end. Although predictable twist, the ending scene offers some light. The possibility of expansion into the new and not so explored territories. And if they decided to build up the story from there, that could be something new and inovative.But the movie probably flopped, so they won't and so even the ending falls into same cheesy ""already seen, predictable, disappointing basket.Shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It could have been better,"Life (2017) from director Daniel Espinosa is not original movie at all, but has it's own unique moments.Movie follows group of 6 astronauts, group itself works very well, you can see and believe they are real group of astronauts and friends, not just actors playing them, where the movie lacks is when u divide group and look at characters one by one, you don't have much, some characters are developed more than others, but that's normal, problem is some of them make very stupid choices for smart people, but that's due to writing, not acting.Character I liked the most was Hugh (Ariyon Bakare), his motivation was best in movie, his character was very well developed and used, also there is one very horrific part of the movie, that could be done only with him, and it was done very well. Other characters were pretty much forgettable, some more than others.Also I see this movie as having 2 parts, first part is where movie shines and where it has most of it's originality, there are some beautiful shots of space station, earth from space, inside of station etc. Cinematography big + from me.Second part is where it falls apart for me, when alien creature starts growing, movie loses it's mysterious tone and becomes horror, that for me is done just for the sake of horror. And biggest problem of all is that movie loses all of it's little originality, although not original, it could have done something original, by that I mean how story progresses and finishes, because ending also was unoriginal and predictable.In conclusion, I can't see this movie as being very well remembered, for me personally not bad movie, but nothing new and memorable.

"Not a masterpiece, but okay horror flick","Now, I'm a huge fan of horror movies and have seen my fair share of sci-fi horror. ""Life"" is definitely not in the top, not even close, but that said it's not one of the worst, either. Many of the latest reviews are making ""Life"" seem like something you'd be better off without, but they clearly were expecting something more like ""Alien"" (even though they're screaming they did not) and got pi**ed off when the two couldn't compare.Originality is far from ""Life"", as are the characters and the plot. When you've seen as many horror films as I have, you learn to expect certain things to happen and you can usually pick out the least possible survivors. About half way of the film I predicted two possible endings for this film with the twists, and got it right.Acting is very mediocre, but the directing is something I found well done. The characters are very, very simple and roughly written, so don't expect to get too much out of them. A lot of the film was saved by the gorgeous CGI.My recommendation for this film is to watch it like you'd watch a late 80's or early 90's horror movie with updated CGI and special effects.

"No at all ""Like Alien""","Smartest creature ever. Super adaptable, evolutionary. This is by far the bad assiest being ever imagined. The science in the movie was up to my extremely lofty standards. For the first time, ever in a horror movie, this thing could theoretically actually exist makes the movie extremely interesting. The main reason I gave it a 9, is due to the fact, they should have sacrificed the first guy, immediately. I had one other issue, but that would tip spoilers. Other than that, this is a great, thrilling, mind bender of a horror sci-fi movie.And for those who ridiculously state this was ""like Alien"". This movie had a super intelligent, highly evolved bacteria. This was never done before. Actual physics and biology was implemented. It wasn't just some creature out of the mind of a teenager. The crew were attempting to contain and survive. Never before have I saw a movie, that was about containing an entity while above the planet. This used an actual space station, that is real and does exist. This was not a fairy tale of a movie, as was Alien. No one was hunting this thing down with guns and such. This movie is about what can actually happen as we go frolicking around our solar system. This is something that we should actually be worried about. That is completely ground breaking in every way possible. The Europa Report was closer related to this film, but even that was not as real of a threat as this movie, since it was on a Saturn moon, using theoretical science and fictional equipment. Life used all actual equipment, actual science, and actual crew reactions, although, I would have sacrificed the first guy, immediately and launched the immature state of Calvin at the first sign of an issue. And one last thing, Calvin didn't even kill anyone, except the first guy, who was attempting to incinerate it. I bet in part two, we will find out he is actually peaceful.This movie was nothing like Alien. Besides the fact that the setting was in space and there was a creature hunting them down (or was he?).

Alien Out to Lunch,"'Life' has state-of-the-art production values, but its sophomoric science and slow-witted scientists would be sneered at by kindergartners. The story begins when a robot probe arrives in melodramatic fashion at the International Space Station with a cargo of Martian soil samples. The follies continue inside the station's 'fail-safe' isolation lab, after a biologist revives an organism which has been in suspended animation for the last 3 billion years. The tiny creature seems cute at first and is named Calvin, but he soon escapes from his cell in the orbiting Supermax prison - and like all toddlers, he starts to misbehave.What follows is an 'Alien' copycat plot, except with generic characters, dull dialog and a total absence of original ideas. Calvin's cuteness wears off fast as he bulks up into a starfish-squid hybrid with the strength of a gorilla, the intelligence of a chess grand-master and the empathy of a cobra. The crew decide to neutralize him, but he demonstrates some impressive natural defenses and the ability to scamper about the station's exterior in a vacuum.

A movie which should be evaluated with a different point of view,"The amount of joy you get from this movie depends on your expectation.

But the tension, the intensity is so suitable for those who look for these factors. A good ending too.The main idea of the film is quite engrossing to be honest.The curiosity about aliens has come along for hundreds of years and the information we have about them is pretty limited. So with that, we can't really expect anyone (mainly NASA) to share every research with the world. They might have contacted with aliens, or found critical information about them, but it might not be too good.Think about it, NASA announces the first sample of an alien has been found. What would people think? Many would like it and welcome the news excitedly. But many would worry too. As long as we don't know that aliens can surely be trusted, humanity is not ready for them. I think this is the main reason behind NASA insisting to inform regularly.The movie is pretty accurate to understand what I'm saying.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Some call it an ""Alien"" rip-off. Haven't you seen that classic? Give this one a chance.","""I feel hate.

They call it a scientific breakthrough and the final proof that there's indeed life on Mars. However, the euphoria is quickly reversed when this lovable organism, which name is ""Calvin"" by the way, threatens to kill the entire crew. And in hindsight, it's a danger to the entire universe. Including peaceful Earth. Before they know it, this single-celled alien friend turns into an overgrown shammy. The result is crew members being crushed and consumed. Apparently, it's extremely intelligent and it succeeds in escaping from the observation lab. And then it is up to the rest of the crew to make sure that the alien, moving like a Patrick Star across the space station, doesn't reach Earth.""Life"" is a nerve-racking SF story. And unlike ""Arrival"", the creature's intentions aren't friendly. The fact that many comparisons are made with the ""Alien"" saga is inevitable. The same conditions and surroundings provide for a similar cat-and-mouse game with a crew trying to survive. But even with this in mind, I can only say that the pacing of this movie was scorchingly fast. Before I knew it the movie was finished. The end is not really surprising but probably it'll keep running through your mind the next few days. It was also remarkably how many times someone mumbled ""It's beautiful"" while looking at Calvin. Of course you can predict it won't be a happy ending.The story on its own isn't original and has been used countless times in other movies. But visually it's a gem. The space station has been worked out down to the last detail. And despite the fact that it's a huge ship, you still get the impression as if the compartments are rather limited in space and therefor creates a claustrophobic effect. But in particular the moving of crew members in zero-gravity looks fascinating. The tilting and rotating station ensures that you can no longer distinguish the bottom from the top at certain times. I'm sure the CGI department has had a lot of work to make it as realistic as possible. Even the bloody scenes suddenly become fascinating scenes, demonstrating how drops of blood behave in a weightless state.Also the cast wasn't bad. Every single one excelled and contributed to this exciting space horror. The most famous names are of course Ryan ""Deadpool"" Reynolds, as space cowboy Rory Adams, picking satellites out of space and always the first one to break a rule. And Jake Gyllenhaal (still my favorite actor at the moment) as David Jordan, an ex-marine who's about to break the record of ""longest stay in space"" because he hates the attitude of people on earth. Hiroyuki Sanada, who played a major part in ""The Railway Man"", gets the most human role in ""Life"". He can see the birth of his first child because it's being broadcast live on the ISS. Rebecca ""Mission Impossible"" Ferguson, Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare complete the crew and join the others while trying to escape the fluttering alien.Despite the obvious similarities with ""Alien"", Daniel ""Child 44"" Espinosa succeeded in making a creepy, dark and intense movie. It won't go down as a classic, but the film is successful on several levels. Still I hope when future Mars expeditions discover the slightest form of any kind of alien life, they are wise enough to leave it be and certainly don't bring it back home as a sort of trophy. For movie lovers who haven't seen ""Alien"" yet (that's impossible in my opinion, but still), this exciting SF will definitely be worthwhile to watch.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely not as bad as the one - and two -star reviews make it out to be.,"The crew on the ISS examines an organism brought back from Mars. 'Crap enters life-support' and the eerie happenings occur in fast pace with little room for anything but characters acting on guts, rather than a medium-long term plan. However, most of what they do, makes sense in the moment - if they aren't quickly patching up some part of the stations machinery (If you don't do that on a vessel in the vacuum of space, you don't do anything anymore) they are awestruck watching the extremely powerful and versatile little being do its thing. A few, but not so many as to be mind-boggling, unfounded and unthinkable mistakes were made by characters - compared to others in the genre; the ratio of unthinkable mistakes in this movie pulls the average in the right direction. Also, discover them on your own - Many of the reviews here spoil several scenes, ick.I thought this movie was way more, forgive the pun, air-tight than some of its' recent genre-siblings.

"a ""realistic"" space monster movie? sadly no","I enjoyed it - plain and simple.

But it is not sooo bad as seen in countless other horror/monster movies.The Achilles-heel of many horror movies is the poor communication between the protagonists... something that for a positive surprise - does not apply here.However - the entire movie is ""decision-driven"" as it is primarily a story about action vs. reaction. And so - the quality of the decisions make or break the movie. As said before - the decisions are not entirely bad - but they are also not good - and when a casual movie viewer get the feeling that those supposed-to-be much smarter people make one poor choice after another - the immersion breaks.So whats left is a good movie that could have been much better had the story allowed it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien meets Gravity,"This film isn't as bad as some say, but while it's not great, it's quite gripping if you can get past some dumb mistakes the astronauts make. The ISS is a great location for this film, although some minor script-driven changes were made to the interior (such as fully-enclosed sleeping pods that you just KNOW will become relevant).The casting and acting are good, which helps the audience suspend disbelief. But WHY the alien, which is adept at hibernation, was fed and coddled so much (before better safety equipment could be sent up) remains a massive logic failure. Why the huge rush? A LOT of unnecessary risks were taken with little-to-no justification.Some of the things-going-wrong mayhem is over-the-top, but thankfully not as bad as Gravity. Speaking of gravity, the zero-G environment is portrayed very well here; it's impressive.There's a plot twist at the very end that I saw coming, but it's so nicely done that I still enjoyed it.This film is non-trivial to rate (lots of pros and cons), but I give it five stars plus a BONUS star for the haunting ending. That's six (6) stars total.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perhaps a better riff on Alien(s) than recent franchise fare.,"Life (2017)
Just shy of 40 years since Alien, i think it was ok to use some of it's devices. Set in the very near future on the International Space Station gives it a brilliant reality and helps make this a properly scary movie. What helps more, is the design of ""the alien"" which is at its scariest early on when the fear of the unknown looms larger than after its first reveal. The characters not being ""tooled up"" brings it slightly further away from Alien, with the characters being arguably more vulnerable.
The ""Space"" is done well and in comparison with other is perhaps limited by reality. Futuristic space movies don't have to be compromised by awareness of its setting. The sound is good and the tension, though never turning you foetal quite like the first scene in the lab, does maintain well.
Gyllenhaal is decent, as is the ever excellent Rebecca Ferguson, though i felt Ryan Reynolds was a bit too Deadpool and not enough ISS type. His character felt out of place, or at least should have been toned down a little.
While I was happy enough with the direction the ending took, I felt it could have been far better implemented and was the only real error for me. In conclusion it is the best space horror i've seen since the aforementioned genre topping Alien(s), so not bad at all. SEVEN",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A bunch of astronauts/ scientists while en route from Mars to earth discover an awakening hibernating life form that is an apex predator they named Calvin.Thoughts:
This is Alien. Absolutely, just Alien. However, I really liked it, and the creature creation for this alien is original. Kind of looks like the aliens from the movie the Abyss, yet deadly.To quote my British friends, it was a banger, a long as you ignore it's a riff on Alien. Didn't bother me at all. Tons of fun. Filled with A-Listers: Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson.The director went on to direct Morbius... oof, but this movie was a riotous good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Entertaining. The haters shouldn't be watching sci-fi.,"If you're anal about everything being realistic, then you probably won't like this. As there are some occurrences where you'll be shouting at the characters on the screen, as they often behave in ways that are illogical.However - I think that's partly why it was so entertaining. The fact the team messes up, allows the story to get deeper.As a minor critique - I do wish that things were explained a bit better. To explain, the characters often had a plan, but I wasn't able to follow what that plan was, as I don't know the inner workings of a spacecraft, nor the technical jargon they use.But overall, if you want to watch an entertaining movie & you like the horror genre - then I say defo watch it. And btw, it's a scary movie (as in jumpy) & if you don't like spiders / creepy crawlies, you probs will be grossed out a little.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Someone does not follow protocol, and allows life from Mars, to begin growing at the ISS, and before long the evil human munching life has got out of control, killing off crew. It is a gripping story to the end. Great effects and very holding attention all the way through.

Thought Provoking In A Very Scary Way,"The critics must be on crack, this is definitely the best violent alien film in a long while. One thing that makes this film stand out among many other similar themed films is the sheer plausibility of it all.

Something very similar to this could happen one day you find yourself saying, and that's what makes it extra chilling. Much of the science in this film is very real. In fact we are seeing some of these exact kinds of things this film is concerned with in our very own modern day forests, as the trees, plants, animals and insects continue to change and battle for space/survival.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The plot was way too predictable but that's not because of bad writing or dumb characters, in fact i think the characters made best decisions available to them from their perspective. It's because the tone is set right from the cover poster that this looks like a doom ending type of movie, in order to set itself apart from the original alien movies with ripley. Because truly the only thing that separates it is that this alien is an existential threat to humanity.

Decent film well worth a try. Ignore the 1/2 star ratings here until you have the chance to form your own opinion,"First of, this film is a solid 7/10 in my mind. Way better than Mummy/Wonder Woman. It is not a masterpiece but it is entertaining enough and well made, despite its some questionable (science related) logic.Now lets talk a bit more of such questionable science, which I have found to be the major complaint point for many on IMDb (i.e. those who gave this film very low ratings and felt compelled to vent their anger in long negative reviews). My personal advise is: ignore these and do try this film.I have to stress that I am one of those who, regardless of the overall IMDb rating, would more than likely to overlook a film as soon as I see a couple of very low rating reviews. I do believe that IMDb ratings are often hyped, especially for the big blockbusters (such as Wonder Woman which I found to be incredibly boring and childish). Before I took time to watch Life, there was hesitation due to the many low rates here; yet for some reason I gave it a try, and thus came to my personal verdict that this is a half decent and entertaining film.This particular experience with Life and its reviews on IMDb thereby highlighted one thing for me: people these days can be so cynical and shallow in so many ways. In this instance, and to those who thought it was necessary to go on and on about the plot holes and ill logic of Life, my advice is to relax and stop being so serious for all the wrong reasons. I am fairly confident that the majority would feel the same (regarding the film itself and those low reviews) as soon as they finish watching with a light heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beautiful looking but no different then the movies it copies,"Apart from its admittedly interesting and unexpected ending, there is little here you haven't seen before. A movie attempting to recapture the same thrills and chills that we have already been given in movies such as Alien, Predator and The Thing has a lot of work to do. It needs to hit as hard and have as much visceral and gut impact but sadly, this does not reach that bar. Gets into the nasty things jumping on people part too quickly, with great actors playing uninteresting characters, though Jake Gyllenhaal is mildly intriguing but not explored enough. The high production value and great score also makes it so much more disappointing that it doesn't strike the memorable chord. It's 2 thirds of a good movie, with the missing third being the pacing and genuine suspense. Thankfully isn't the queasy shaky cam of Daniel Espinosa's last movie Safe House, this goes the traditional route hold the camera in place and cut cut cut. Too bad I couldn't cut to the good parts in the theatre, there was a lot of dead space in between them.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good graphics, science out of the window, decent acting, formulaic","I don't know what Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and even Hiroyuki Sanada (I love the guy, but he played in some really awful stuff) were doing in this film. The film isn't bad, but it did not require actors of their caliber other than for baiting people into theaters, and that is a big sin for a movie.I have to say that I liked the alien design and the direction. Some of the scenes were amazing. Unfortunately, the story is dumb and formulaic, going for the same cheap ""we are the good guys, so we must feel and shout and do stupid things to prove it"" and an implausible form of life that defied any possible scientific rule (or space station design feature). It probably is in the interest of film makers to not make horror movies too plausible, but I hated that.Bottom line: you get to feel for the characters, mostly because of the sound performance, but the ""oh, come on!"" moments ruin the mood to the point of annoyance.

I found it definitely better than the above mentioned movies in horror and quality aspect (not characters though).Problem this movie has is, you just can't care about any character except for the the Japanese astronaut who was the only person they gave some sort of character depth. Others are just, doctors and scientists. So to feel anything for any deaths or to root for any one except Sho is not gonna happen. Only thing you might feel is, no one should die like that and yes there's just tad bit of gore and good amount of brutal kills.The film peaks when someone's dying on screen so yeah you end up cheering for the Alien probably. Acting is just about alright. The actors and actresses do the best at what they've been given.

Modern update on Alien,"I rarely review movies here but could not help myself in light of all the negative reviews of Life. 1 and 2 star ratings abound; Really?I had some issues with this movie too; as with most movies, we viewers see things and think of things that we in our minds would not do. Monday morning quarterbacking. However this movie was mostly smart, beautifully shot, and a lot of fun to watch overall. A good eye on technical details, and EXCELLENT creature, and unlike it's doppelganger Alien, it was very bright and well lit. The actors were fine by me, and the space scenes and ISS interior were totally believable and well thought out.My only beef with the movie was the somewhat predictable ending; I think most viewers saw that coming. But it was a very good, if not great, sci-fi piece that I recommend to those that enjoy suspenseful and scary space epics.

A good enough sci-fi horror movie,"Life has more achievements than mistakes, but it fails the most at the repetition of a well-known plot.
If you haven't seen a lot of sci-fi horror movies, it will surprise you and keep you with it, from beginning to end.
If you have seen enough (Alien is enough), it will be just entertained.I think a repeated story can't be judged as a bad one, but Life falls into the same mistakes than other movies in that genre: A little predictable, quite repetitive.Anyway, putting that aside, it has its achievements:
A direction that is interesting since the movie starts; a pretty good cinematography; an excelent use of sound that keeps you in the terrifying atmosphere, even closing your eyes; good actings, better than the characters themselves; great visual effects and a good use of montage, particularly in the conclusion.Now, it certainly has its biggest mistake in the repeated story, but also in its flat characters, that you can't believe sometimes 'cause they don't really act like scientists, and on how predictable the argument can become.
It presents a strong plot point, so the rest of the movie you can expect more than you receive: Some jumpscares and the constant repetition of the same event.While it is a story we've heard before, they know how to tell it you in an interesting way, so if you haven't listen it before, this is going to be a really good first time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best made big-budget horror films in a very long time,"I saw this at SXSW in Austin, Texas when it first premiered and I was blown away by it. I just saw it on DVD and I must say that I'm still blown away by it! Life is a science-fiction horror film with a massive cast and an even more massive scope. What I enjoy more than anything else in this film is the cinematography and the direction. There are several minute-long long shots all over the film, including the first shot which lasts four minutes long. It could've been very easy to just lamely film a scene and cut back and forth between the dialog, but the director and his team did an amazing job with these creative cinematography tricks. There's also this big feeling of actually being on the spaceship with these characters, which doesn't happen often I tell you what! I could feel the cold metal walls and the freezing air in space. The script is okay at best, just a generic alien- on-the-loose Alien knock-off, but so what? Alien rules, and I wasn't born yet to see it on the big screen. Even then, the directing jazzes up the story as much as possible, and the most disturbing scene in the film is when the characters read Goodnight Moon on the verge of death. Scenes like that really boost up the film, not to mention the extremely shocking ending that I still think about to this day. The CGI on the alien is also very well done and I think is still this year's top contender for the Oscar for Best Special Effects. It probably wont even get a nomination because of the Oscars always going to Marvel superhero films (which is completely fine), but I swear the texture and movements on the alien were very realistic and most of the time I couldn't even tell it was CGI. So to summarize this: The story is standard but the writers, directors, and crew do so much to make a mediocre Alien rip-off into a first-rate, state of the art horror film in space.

Life gets sucked out of Life by bad direction.,"Life is a simple story that has been told many times before, most notably by Ridley Scott in the 1979 film Alien. A group of diverse astronauts discover an alien life form, which eventually becomes a threat to their lives.Life starts out as an intriguing enough plot, a crew is assigned to intercept a damaged satellite that contains soil samples from Mars. Once these samples are retrieved, the on board scientist begins to discover what becomes the films protagonist, an intelligent life form with a brutal determination to survive.Unfortunately Life fails to make use of a great cast and a fairly fresh take on the classic alien versus man concept. To make a long story short, the Direction is poor. You never really connect with any of the characters, therefore the order in which they are inevitably dispatched not only makes little sense, but doesn't affect the viewer on any emotional level. The suspense is forced, the twists although not particularly predictable are underwhelming and the ending lacks closure.Wait till On Demand to view this one :)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A rather failed attempt of delivering a quality space thriller,"After receiving samples from Mars, scientists aboard the International Space Station start to investigate if any traces of life are present. Their discovery will prove to one of humanity's greatest leaps but also one that leaves a lot of mysteries to be found, especially some very dangerous ones.It's a movie which, to be honest, reminds me of the Alien franchise, at least its most recent instalments. The only major difference is that in this case, everything is treated with much more care, intelligence and knowledge. Although this one leads to a similar conclusion, you have the feeling that it doesn't insult your intelligence and that it also tries to tell its story in a rather acceptable way. Speaking of which, although very predictable most of the time, it manages to keep it all together, generating plenty of suspense along the way.The characters are also ok, while not very well described, they tend to be likeable, thus their suffering doesn't leave the viewer without any emotion. The producers could have done a lot more in this compartment, but the result is quite ok, at least for the plot that it tries to deliver. The action is rather static, with a couple of rushes now and then, generating a dark but interesting atmosphere in which the characters can take their ""fight"".As a result, I was left with some mixed feelings. Although predictable, even with the twist in the end, the movie somehow manages to keep the viewer interested. The suspense it creates is also a very big plus, while the actors do their job quite well in portraying their characters, which once again, could have been much better described. Its biggest let-down as far as I'm concerned is by far the plot. It could have done a lot more than being as linear, predictable and also generic as it is.

The characters are good there likeable you don't really hate any of them and you get some time to know them. Ferguson's more the head of the operation, Ryan has his one liners and quirks.

The Cinematography is good many shots of the outside look good and the rotation of the camera to simulate the lack of gravity claustrophobic atmosphere traveling through the tubes of the station.

But this movie violated one of my rules for a good movie in that it needs a beginning, middle and end, and this movie doesn't end it just sort of stops. This also caused me to hate the movie ""The Mist"" but I'll review that one later.It's about finding a lifeform in space that initially is benign but turns malevolent and starts to gobble folks up. Sound familiar a la it's template Alien? Yeah, but I still wanted to see what they'd do with it. I was ok with most everything until then end which I won't give away here, but I was very dissatisfied with it.

"Decent Enough Alien Sci-Fi Thriller, But With Quite A Few Problems","Pros:
1. The set design is incredible. Not only does it resemble a real space station, but it gives the film an increased sense of claustrophobia thus adding to the horror.
2. The score does a great job at adding to the dense and thrilling atmosphere.
3. There is fantastic creature design and CGI to go along with it.
4. There are some really impressive visuals, especially in regards to the outer space scenes.
5. Jake Gyllenhaal (David Jordan) as usual gives a really good performance.Cons:
1. Some lines of dialogue look dubbed, or they sound as if they were added post-production.
2. The CGI blood looks utterly horrendous.
3. There are a couple of plot-holes. For example, how did Calvin attach itself to Hugh Derry's (Ariyon Bakare) leg without him or anybody else noticing?

A Really Good Piece Of Space Horror Fun,"A team of astronauts & scientists discover a lifeform on Mars & bring it aboard their space station but the small creature begins to get smarter & more dangerous as it grows bigger.""LIFE"" is a fine piece of Sci-fi Horror in that cool mould of Alien, where a creature is on board the space ship & starts to pick off the humans. Amongst the crew is some great actors such as Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson & a few other's. The movie looks fantastic with lush cinematography that shows off the spectacular futuristic looking space station & a cast of actors who all deliver top notch dramatic performances.The Alien lifeform starts out tiny but grows bigger & gets more smarter as the film goes on until it's a beautifully created Alien creature that moves so organically with the use of top CGI. I do prefer the old school way of movie magic creature making, puppetry & animatronics but i gotta admit they filmmakers wouldn't of gotten the fluidity & beautiful movements of the creature here with a puppet. The alien creature is a very cool looking thing & is as smart as it is deadly.Life is a thrilling little movie actually & never gets boring & is another good film in the sci-fi thriller/horror genre. The movie is fun & gives you a small crew of characters that you like & want to live.Life is an expensive looking movie & delivers on the suspense & monster sequences.In a way the simplicity of its story & setup does feel old school like other sci-fi Horror films like Alien or Deepest Six or Leviathan to name a few.Life is a very good movie & i enjoyed it from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This film should signal a Warning,"This is just exactly what I have been talking about for over 50 years.

If it were introduced, however mistakenly, onto our planet it would be absolutely disastrous.",,Anonymous,Horror
A good visual spectacle with a derivative story that it works in its own smaller terms,"I recently re watched this film and I must admit it holds up much better than other recent sci-fi pics like ""Alien: Covenant"". I cannot have enough of space movies: that is the perfect realm to have a bunch of characters faced with the unknown, to reflect on the fragility of the human condition within the grand scheme of the universe, and our limitations in understanding how we fit in it. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would be probably the most poignant ever, raising a myriad of mind boggling questions and yet movies like this insist on taking the most predictable road around it. The one that leads to just another survival endurance test with lots of cgi blood and an undistinguished monster in the middle of it all. Hollywood really has a knack for making the unknown look so familiar I have to say. However, if you can come to terms with the fact that not all movies need to have the ambition of ""2001: An Space Odyssey"", you might end up enjoying this flick quite a bit. The film starts by hitting some high notes courtesy of the production design and special effects departments, and with the introduction of some very interesting character bits. The story hints early at one of its possible themes, through Jake Gyllenhaal's character: the notion that maybe, to be able to function in space, one would need to be some sort of social outcast, incapable of being able to connect with people on Earth anymore. But this theme is dropped soon enough, and even as a source of suspense, it is downplayed later on in the movie to the gain of mere mayhem. ""Life"" should have stayed on the path of a science procedural in space, in the vein of ""The Andromeda Strain"", but probably the screenwriters haven't read enough grown up sci-fi literature to go that way, and it wouldn't have been a ""commercial"" enough of a choice to grant the big budget. From the entertainment standpoint, the film delivers a couple of good set pieces at the beginning and a surprising and thrilling first death, but then the story settles for the survival fight. I found the alien design and its behavior to be rather to be rather goofy (some of which seems to belong more to Disney's ""Flubber"" than to a space horror); however, its slushy nature and ability to squeeze in and out of the spaceship contributes to the suspense of many scenes. This is overall a good looking movie with a decent, admittedly tense first half, a rather muddled second act and a twist ending that is B movie gold.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid entry to the space monster genre,"'Life' was good, a respectable 3.5 out of 5, and it would have been a 4 but for the cop out ending, which I think reflected a lack of confidence on the part of its team in the quality of their output.The writers and director did not disguise their debt to 'Alien' and to a lesser extent '2001', and their overt referencing of those films was sensible - after all, with a plot like this one nobody can ignore such masterpieces. 'Life' stands up well to comparisons, being a well scripted and capably directed effort. I liked the way the members of the crew were fleshed out with backstory and some character development. There was a cost in terms of slackening tension but it was worth paying because you cared more about their fates. The creature was very well managed as was the spaceship interior. Action scenes were lively and full of impact.Yes, there were plenty of implausibilities, but I can live with those if the result is worth it. And in 'Life' it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cute Little Alien,"Well, I'm going to take the middle road on this one. Positives: 1. The hardware and related physics for our space station were, for a syfy movie, quite accurate and gave as good a feel for what goes on as I've seen, including actual ISS footage.2. Our little Martian monster performed it's role quite nastily, so kudos to it. So, all you ""Alien"" precursors, you've just been one upped. However, one small problem with our little alien - see negative. Negatives: 1. The biology for our Martian alien (who incidentally was better suited for a more dense fluid than gas e.g. water) failed on all counts for biological believable - almost laughable (actually it was laughable, but scary). 2. Yes the twist was a bit predictable, but they hid it well, and yes, once the ending was revealed it too had a bit of predictability.

Life dares to take some serious risks,"Everything is familiar in Life since we've already seen this concept masterfully being developed back in 1979. Alien is the guide. And of course no one has ever touched its greatness.Life is no exception. Still i really enjoyed it because Daniel Espinosa does a great job in direction creating a claustrophobic, nightmarish atmosphere and, assisted by the functional editing and the ominous music score, setting at least 3 great scenes. The screenplay doesn't offer a real character development and even the dialogues are problematic but it dares to take some serious risks, promising the biggest one at the ending which is the most daring since The Mist. 6,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mediocre sci-fi thriller that is carried by it's stars,"""Life"" is a mix of ""Alien"" and ""Gravity"" and while that might sound good it is not. The movie was hyped and highly anticipated but it was not worth the wait. This movie proves once again that a great cast isn't everything. The movie starts with an amazing opening sequence using a tracking shot similar to those in ""Birdman"" and right away gives us a inside into the characters. However, after this 10 minute sequence the remaining hour and a half is rather disappointing. The acting is good but nothing special and there is really nothing sophisticated about it and the movie is carried by the three stars. The cinematography, except for the stunning opening sequence, is also nothing special and really doesn't convey the danger and fear as well as it could have. That is a real shame. There is so much potential and especially with this story the tension could've been build up so well with better camera work. The story definitely has great potential but as previously mentioned it would have been expressed so much better with some good camera work but is at least for the most part compensated by solid direction. The best aspect of the story is the ending. The score is also rather disappointing for it could also have helped to underline the emotions that were expected. The direction here is a strong point. There are many good elements that were considered in the set and building of surprise in some scenes. In conclusion we can say that ""Life"" is a solid sci-fi thriller that builds some suspense and is quite entertaining. The story and emotions could have been underlined better by the camera work and score but otherwise it is a solid thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Life""-  An 'Alien' knock-off for sure... but a decent 'Alien' knock-off.  It's appropriately gooey, gory and thrilling and never mistakes itself for being more than it is.","You can't keep a good classic down. Nor evidently, can you keep others from trying to replicate the success of a classic for years- even decades- after. This is especially true about the 2017 Sci- Fi/Thriller release ""Life"" from director Daniel Espinosa. Yes, for all intents and purposes, the film is very much aping off of one of the great classics of the genre... that of course being Ridley Scott's phenomenal 1979 release ""Alien."" From tone to character to basic structure, Espinosa and the wicked screen writing duo of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick craft a film that is either lovingly paying homage to the iconic Scott picture... or drastically ripping it off. Either way, it isn't the first 'Alien' knock-off... nor will it be the last. The best we can hope for it is that it ended up being one of the better 'Alien' knock- offs...Thankfully enough... I'd say it is.Yes, despite a few major problems with the pacing and a few questionable choices with the structure, I found ""Life"" to be completely entertaining and a lot of fun for what it was. Sure, it won't win any Oscars... but there's nothing wrong with a good, old-fashioned thrill-fest. It's got all the goo and gore you'd expect from a deep-space creature-feature, and boasts a massive budget and top-notch talent on-screen to boot. It honestly reminded me of an old nostalgic favorite in that respect- the Kevin Bacon thriller ""Hollow Man"", which similarly boasted a big budget and big talent for what amounted to a cheesy slasher movie. A lot of people complained (just as a lot of people are complaining about ""Life""), but they seemed to miss the point... these movies are meant to be pure, visceral fun. Not mind-bending or even all that complex. And in that respect, I think ""Life"" works quite well.In the near future, a six-person crew aboard the International Space Station intercepts a probe returning from the planet Mars with soil samples for study. Soon enough, it is discovered that a microscopic organism exists within the soil- the first real sign of alien life beyond Earth. After managing to revive the organism (nicknamed ""Calvin""), it begins to grow and display signs of intelligence and thought. However, things take a turn for the worse when Calvin escapes his ""habitat"" and begins to act in an aggressive and defensive fashion... eventually beginning to kill off members of the team in order to feed. And so, the remaining crew must work together to try and kill this martian beast before it is able to reach Earth...I really gotta hand it to the cast- they all knock it out of the park, despite the film zooming through their establishment a little too quickly. Our leads Rebecca Ferguson and Jake Gyllenhaal are a lot of fun, and both are given just enough motivation to help you care about their characters. Supporting roles by the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare and Olga Dihovichnaya are all very well-played and are given just enough quirks and defining features that you actually do kinda feel bad when the creature starts to attack them one-by-one. It's a case of good casting overcoming a few missteps in the narrative.The script by Reese and Wernick is quite entertaining, and they show that they have a knack for suspense and thrills. I've been seeing a lot of reviews nit-picking the minute details or trying to poke holes in the logic... but you gotta remember: these are the same guys who wrote ""Deadpool."" If you think they're trying to deliver a hard-hitting and cerebral drama set to the backdrop of a Gothic horror picture, you're clearly not in the right mindset. They know exactly what they're trying to do... pay homage to Sci-Fi classics like the aforementioned ""Alien"" while delivering as many jumps and disgusting displays of bodily- fluids as possible. It's not tongue- in-cheek per se, but it's also not 100% trying to be overtly realistic. They're crafting a fun movie... not a complex one.The tones and style that Espinosa injects into the film are incredibly invaluable. It's a very competently made movie, and there's a lot of really fun visual nuances and nifty camera-work on display that lends much to the proceedings. From an opening sequence told almost entirely in a single complex (and breathtaking) shot, to more subtle moments like allowing the camera to linger on the various crewmembers as they cry at their terrible situation in one genuinely touching scene... there's a lot of really smart moves being made in the storytelling thanks to top-notch visual guidance. I'm not overly familiar with Espinosa's filmography... but if he's able to do so much creative and original work with what is essentially an homage-picture, I'd keep my eye on him in the future.All that being said, however... there's some issues I cannot deny. And they do bring the whole thing down a few points. Despite allowing the story to truck along quickly, the pacing does rob some much-needed moments with the characters and I would have liked to have seen some more development in the supporting roles. A few of the ""scares"" are telegraphed from a mile away, which annoyed me a bit. And I do think that despite aiming to pay homage to the classics... the film could have subverted expectations a bit more than it ended up doing. It would have helped it stand alone a bit more.But in the end, for what amounts to a fun-albeit-generic creature- feature in space, ""Life"" is very much an enjoyable time. It's not going to break new ground and I certainly wouldn't call it a great film. But it's more than adequate and I know I had a lot of fun seeing it on the big-screen. I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Put Yourself In Their Place..... better still DON'T!!!,"Watched it last night on TV. Wide screens and fantastic quality made it very present in my sitting room. One of the most terrifying films I've ever seen but I was glued to it. The technology was brilliant and the fear and terror tangible. Space looked massive and so real, and suddenly the most dangerous place to be. I did wonder if they filmed it in the International Space Station, but dismissed it of course. Lets just say 'I couldn't see the joins' ...and the Entity (lets call it) was terrifying. Imagine a massive muscular rabid, ravenous, snarling, mouth foaming Rottweiler galloping in your direction with one thought in its mind (not love that's for sure) with few places to be safe, and you can't run as fast, as it barrels towards you. Total PANIC! It has a brain and can work out how to get to you! You can't beat it though you must. You and your crew begin to realise that you are outnumbered by just One. Its intelligence is superior and yours is collective and inadequate, unless you can beat it at every point of contact. Your only hope is to get it out and to keep it out.

"A dumb, typical doom and gloom Hollywood script.","Great actors, great effects, yada yada, but terrible script. ""Predictable"" isn't a fair word to use for most films these days because so many stories have been retold. However, the ending is very predictable and in a bad way, so it just makes the whole experience pointless. If you enjoy innocent people suffering for the sake of an alien ""just trying to survive"" (a quote from the movie) then maybe you'll like it, but it's poorly written. A good movie is entertaining. A great movie has a solid theme, preferably a clear one. This movie doesn't have either and it's bad.

"Maybe if I hadn't seen ""Alien,"" or ""Aliens,"" or ""Alien 3,"" or....","SciFi fans; if I say ""A space ship crew is trapped in space with an unstoppable life form that they must prevent from getting to Earth...."" what comes to mind?If you don't start naming ""Alien"" titles, I don't think you're really a SciFi fan. And that is my problem with ""Life,"" I've seen this story in various permutations too, too many times. And ""Life"" despite the fact that it has a really neat creature and spectacularly good production values, wastes my time by telling a familiar story with familiar characters. I found absolutely nothing in this movie that felt original except for the development of ""Calvin."" Early on, the science and the CGI depicting the creation of the creature gave me chills and great hope that something new and interesting was coming. But eventually the movie found its rut, somewhere between the afore mentioned ""Alien"" films and John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" And once it fell into that rut, the only thing the makers did was decorate. ""Life"" is a beautiful film, with some Earth-from-space shots that made me melancholy for the fact that I will never be able to go there and see that. But once I realized that I had seen the story before, the cinematography and special effects were ALL that held my interest.Maybe for movie-goers who haven't seen the earlier versions of ""Life,"" this will be ""their version"" of ""Alien."" ""Life"" is well-made, well directed and well-acted and may be worthy of becoming the ""Alien"" franchise of this generation.One final note, and I don't think this is a spoiler: At the beginning of ""Life"" the narrator delivers the information that Pilgrim was hit by space debris and knocked off course. I think that could foreshadow the resolution to a situation left unresolved at the conclusion of ""Life.""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A little too much like Alien, but surprisingly exciting and tense nonetheless","This was a surprisingly exciting film. For a movie that looks to effectively borrow the premise of Gravity and Alien, Life is actually a very well-directed, well-acted and entertaining sci-fi horror. With a threatening villain that works well throughout, and a rapid pace, it's the sort of film that'll definitely make you tense, even if it's not quite the edge-of-your-seat thriller it could be.But let's start off with the obvious. We've pretty much had this exact story before. A group of human space explorers come across life, and it turns out that life is hostile and threatens all of human civilisation. That's the premise of the sci-fi horror classic: Alien.So, with the same plot, I expected Life to be an underwhelming remake of Alien. On the one hand, it doesn't quite have the unique haunted house feel of Ridley Scott's classic, but on the other, it takes the formula and makes it work very well from start to finish.The plot does lose points for originality, but when it comes to making a sci-fi horror, Life is a surprising success. With an effortlessly simple story that involves a few astronauts under constant threat from a seemingly invincible alien, with the even bigger worry that it will reach and destroy Earth, there's a lot of fun to be had from this film as a tense and exciting thriller.I can't say that any of the characters are so well-developed, however. You've got the same sort of backstories as the leads of Gravity, which aren't really that compelling. So, what is it there to make you care about the main characters of Life staying alive?Simply put, it's the performances. Again, they're nothing on the level of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, but the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Jake Gyllenhaal and others are so likable that you do want to see them stay alive. Their characters aren't the most intelligent, but the performances that the whole cast put in here are excellent, and that's why you can care about the fate of the few astronauts under threat, something that makes the whole film a lot more entertaining to watch.When it comes to the film's villain, it's pretty much the same as Alien. A well-designed creature that's very threatening to see on screen throughout (although its evolution throughout the film is a little much), it's the reason that there's any real sense of horror in this movie. As director Daniel Espinosa doesn't hold back when it comes to gore and gruesome violence, the alien here has the same effect as the villain from Alien, a relentlessly evil creature that will stop at nothing to brutally destroy all those who it comes across.Of everything, however, Espinosa's direction is the best part of Life. Apart from the fact that the visual effects make this look absolutely stunning throughout, Espinosa gives the film a very fast pace that keeps it exciting, as you're almost always watching the characters desperately trying to escape from the alien menace.I do think that this film could have had a more claustrophobic atmosphere, bringing it a little closer to what made Alien work so well, but on the whole, it's fair to say that Espinosa does a great job at getting as much tension and excitement out of this story as possible by making a fast-moving and visually thrilling spectacle.Overall, I really enjoyed Life. It's not a perfect film, and not on the terrifying, nail-biting level that it perhaps wants to be, but as a blockbuster horror movie, it's exciting and tense throughout, whilst its stunning visuals and very strong performances help to make it even more entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wait for Netflix,"Who doesn't love a good horror story in space? Brave and attractive people stuck in tight quarters with a hostile alien, without gravity, surrounded by the deadly vacuum where no one can hear you scream? Sign me up.Ryan Reynolds easily steals the first few scenes as the cocky and humorous space cowboy, Rory. Jake Gyllenhaal joins him as David Jordan. Ariyon Bakare plays what is easily the most interesting character on the ship, Doctor Hugh Derry, the scientist in charge of studying the newly discovered life form.Olga Dihovichnaya plays Kat, the leader of the mission on board the International Space Station orbiting Earth. Rebecca Ferguson as Miranda, Hiroyuki Sanada playing Sho, round out the crew.The first act of the movie contains some epic cinematography, including one scene of Earth from space that almost brought tears to my eyes. Many of the shots are from strange angles, giving the viewer the impression that they are floating weightless with the crew. It can be disorienting so you may want to have some Dramamine on hand.I won't spoil any key elements of the story but honestly? Anyone who has seen Alien will not be surprised by how it develops. Its plot may be unoriginal, but ""Life"" does manage to deliver a few great moments of genuine horror. The first time the alien shows the depth of its intelligence is startling, to say the least.Creature design was superb although I wish they had taken it a few steps further. As the story unfolds, the plant-like alien grows and adapts to its environment, molding limbs and something like a face. Unfortunately, its evolution stagnates in the last third of the movie. What starts as a fresh take on body forms is reduced to ""space squid"" by the end.One of my biggest problems with this film is characterization. With the notable exception of Doctor Hugh (the scientist working with the alien), it's unclear what each crew member's role actually is on the space station beside floating around waiting to be killed. Rebecca Ferguson's character Miranda talks continuously about how firewalls are her responsibility as quarantine officer, but she is the one providing physical therapy to one of the crew. Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal is supposedly the ship's doctor but later claims to be the pilot (who hasn't done anything remotely piloty up to that point, or doctor like for that matter).I was equally confused by Gyllenhaal's portrayal of the character. At times he seems simple, at other times strangely intense, sort of like someone's creepy bipolar uncle.The confusion doesn't end there. As the diminishing crew makes repeated attempts to rid themselves of their alien passenger various parts of the ship begin to fail (of course) and they run out of fuel (naturally) so they have to result to extreme (but not particularly creative) measures. In one scene I think what is happening is that an escape pod is coming loose. A crew member and the alien are struggling against the pull of the vacuum. Space wins and both are sucked out. It looks like the escape pod floats away.At this point, I was thinking, 'Yay! The alien is gone! I wonder what marvelous twist they have in store for the rest of the movie? Maybe they can save the plot after all!' Nope.The creature must have somehow managed to survive, hang on, and find another point of entry. The rest of the crew did not seem either upset or elated so I wasn't sure what exactly I was supposed to be feeling at this point. The pace vacillates between long drawn-out moments of reflection and warp speed, anxiety ridden races to defeat the big bad.This leads me to the extremely predictable ending. I won't bore you with the boring details but trust me, you won't be surprised.By the end of ""Life"" I was ready to go home. And maybe watch Alien on Netflix.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Tense and good looking, but lacks originality","The trapped-in-space subgenre is one of the most common within the cinematic sci-fi realm. In order to stand out something special is required, a spark of inventiveness that shines a new light on a well-worn plot. This mainstream thriller from Safe House director Daniel Espinosa doesn't have that spark; in fact, by all outwards appearances, it's not even attempting to breathe fresh air into its decades-old formula. It's just trying to entertain. Essentially a C-grade outing decorated with A-grade trimmings, Espinosa stretches every dollar of his relatively modest $58 million budget in order to employ cutting edge CGI and a ridiculously talented cast, which goes a long way in disguising the entirely unoriginal story. The set pieces are executed with flair, often mounting tension and unease before culminating in unexpected violence; an early death establishing the uncompromising tone that permeates all the way to the very end. The lack of narrative innovation aside, the other major blunder is the visualisation of the otherworldly threat. All muscle and all brain (as we're told numerous times), the design of the creature is rather dull and unmemorable. As for the humans on screen, they all bring their best despite tackling some wooden dialogue and clichéd character traits, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson having the biggest impact. Life doesn't add anything new or ground breaking to the sci-fi genre, but it does serve up a suspenseful, good looking and solidly acted outer-space thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid creature feature,"Life (2017) - A claustrophobic thriller set in the wide expanse of space. It tries, but ultimately doesn't measure up to the success of Alien in this regard. The result, however, is a better than average creature feature.It has intense moments of peril and anticipation that had me saying ""c'mon, c'mon, c'mon"" in my head. The score complimented these moments extremely well. The creature is altogether creepy and eerily smart. It had a unique look that set it apart from anything I'd seen in other films.I did actually care about the characters though there is next to zero character development. But even with the minimal exposition, the sense of camaraderie and history within the crew comes through perfectly. The casting of Ryan Reynolds in an ensemble movie, however, struck me as strange. He's just too big of a presence for me to buy in a supporting role nowadays. It doesn't help that he basically just plays Ryan Reynolds in a space suit. Usually I like his shtick, but it pulled me out of the movie from time to time.I know this next part is going to be vague, but there is one basically inexcusable choice that a character makes just past the halfway mark of the movie. It seemed wholly unnecessary to do this in order get them where the writer wanted them to be. They in fact had a built-in way that they could accomplish the same result without dumbfounding the audience with this backwards motivation. After you see it I'm sure you'll recognize what I'm referring to.It has plenty of great moments, but didn't quite reach where I thought it could go. It deserved more than the measly $12 million opening it received, though with the marketing and seemingly generic storyline I can't say I'm too surprised. If I had to rank them, I'd go cereal, this movie, then the board game.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Analyse this,"Not one for over analysing what I watch. Movies either hold my attention or they don't, make me feel something or leave me cold.Many have made comparisons with Alien and it's easy to see why. Alien is a classic, it genuinely scared me and still does. In the same way that Psycho will always generate a palpable feeling of unease no matter how often I watch it. I knew nothing about the movie Life so I watched with no expectations, free of the reviews of others. I guess I knew things were gonna get nasty once they began to poke the bear...or rather the alien micro organism but what followed was a growing feeling of discomfort as a single cell rapidly evolved into a terrifying life form. Not a Predator/Alien like monster but monstrous and pretty damp scary all the same. Derivative maybe, echoes of Alien and The Thing definitely but still effective even if you do want to scream 'no, don't do that, please don't' at the screen more than once. And of course they do it anyway, things spiral out of control and just when you think the day might be saved....well, with analysis comes conclusions.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Surprisingly Good Film If You Don't Look Too Deep Into It,"Life is a perfectly adequate movie.

There are a good chunk of people giving this movie unrealistically low ratings like a 1 or a 2. I understand the points of view of people who dislike this film, however giving it such a low rating is insulting to the intelligence of anybody reading the reviews of this movie. Even if you hated this movie, you must still admit that there are plenty of things that would elevate this movie above the lowest possible ratings. I will talk about he good, the fine, and the bad about this movie, however the good alone is enough to keep this movie away from cinematic trash like Avatar The Last Airbender and the likes. Also this movie has definite flaws so a 10/10 or even a 9/10 isn't too warranted either, even if you were overjoyed by the movie. Basically I am saying don't listen to either extreme.Before I get into my lists of positives and negatives, I would also like to address one specific complaint; the professionals act stupid. I personally am the exact kind of person who watches a movie ant thinks, ""oh don't go back to save the cat when the ship is about to explode you idiot"" or ""the chances of that happening are so low it is funny"". Hell, when I watched Arrival for the first time (and this isn't really a spoiler because it is literally the opening scene of the film) I thought ""oh yay this woman's daughter died of cancer so now they want us to be emotionally invested in the heroine without putting any effort in."" And now Arrival is one of my favorite movies of recent memory but I digress. In Life there are plenty of stupid or unrealistic decisions made by people who should know better, but more often than not you have to be actively seeking that kind of stuff to notice it. Unlike many other horror movies where the poor decisions are so blatantly obvious that it could make you laugh (think Prometheus' running in a straight line to avoid a crashing ship when you could run 50 feet to the left or right and be safe) most of the poor decisions made are less obvious. They are certainly there but if you go into this movie wanting to enjoy a movie most will fly right beneath you. Only if you go into this movie looking to actively dislike it will you find the reasons to do so in the first place. The surface stuff is really no more than your average fine to good horror movie.Now I'll get into the good, the fine, and the bad.Good: Plot- While the idea of finding alien life and realizing that it doesn't like humans sparking the events of a horror movie is nothing new, however it was done in a new enough manner so I didn't feel as if I was just watching the same movie I have already seen countless times before. Horror- The horror/suspense is actually pretty good. The movie refrains from easy jump scares (there are probably some in there that I have forgotten, however they were never used as a crutch or to the point of being annoying). Back to my point earlier, the suspense and horror mainly derives from the thought of what will happen to our characters. The actors do a fine job of making them likable and if you don't seek to dislike them, you will have an easy enough time attaching to them and worrying for them. Even if you manage to not like the characters, than there is the whole ""what happens if this gets to Earth"" thing. Effects- There were plenty of special effects in this movie, and at no point did I actively dislike them. Even the big scenes taking place out in space showing the station were good enough to not break my suspension of disbelief. The design of the alien is commendably unique and the effects are enough to do the design justice. The zero gravity was also done very well. Tone- The movie starts off relatively light heatedly enough, showing you the whole ""we just found proof of life outside of Earth"" elation you would expect. At some point relatively early in the film, there is a scene where it takes the expected turn towards horror/suspense. This particular scene was quite good and it makes that transition feel quite natural. Past that it was pretty consistent.Fine: Music Pacing Acting CinematographyBad: Sound design- There were odd jumps between music and no music, volume got dialed in or back way too quick, and that sort of stuff. At times you couldn't hear what someone was saying and that was quite jarring. Decisions- Some of the more obvious poor decisions made were actually understandable, like under extreme stress, however there were points when characters just did the dumbest stuff without reason.All in all I would give this movie a 6.5/10 (but IMDb makes me do whole numbers so I will give this movie the befit of the doubt and raise that to a 7). It is a good movie to watch while you are bored on a rainy Sunday. Just don't go into it with any real expectations of it being good or bad and you will get the most enjoyment possible out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actual Science Fiction!,"This is actually SciFi. I normally do not like enclosed area films (like a film set on the ISS) but this film is good, and it is actually SciFi. With this kind of film, I was surprised that I began to relate to any of the characters, but I did. If you are looking to reenforce your political belief system, there is no alien wearing a blonde wig or eating an ice cream cone and falling off its bike so avoid this (read the bad reviews.)

It's fun and not pretentious... but lacks ambition,"In 2017, there is a case to be made about movies that are fairly short, fun and easy to watch.

Tense and thrilling,"Science fiction horror film ""Life"" (2017) is a fascinating and dramatic examination of the perils of alien life and the extent to which humanity would go in order to live.The supporting cast, which includes Rebecca Ferguson and Hiroyuki Sanada, is also excellent, and Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds provide excellent performances as the astronauts on the International Space Station. Seamus McGarvey did an incredible job behind the camera, while Jon Ekstrand did a wonderful job scoring the film.What really sets this picture different, though, is its examination of both the primordial drives of survival and the perils of inquiry. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have crafted an exciting narrative that puts viewers on the edge of their seats as they watch the protagonists face off against an extraterrestrial invasion.Overall, ""Life"" is an exciting and stressful picture that benefits from excellent acting and a deep storyline. If you like science fiction horror films or are just searching for a fun and thought-provoking movie, this is a great choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alien + Gravity - Everything That Made Them Great = Life,"There isn't much wrong with what Life aspires to be. It borrows an already existing template to tread a well-worn path, features a clichéd set of characters with base-level characterizations, makes fine use of tension & suspense, unfolds at a consistent pace throughout its runtime, and manages to be quite engaging despite its highly predictable storyline. But it's far from a great film.The story of Life follows a six-member crew aboard the International Space Station who intercept a space probe returning from Mars with soil samples that could provide the first ever evidence of life beyond Earth. On studying the sample, they discover a dormant single-celled life form that quickly evolves into a multi-celled organism and proves to be far more intelligent than they anticipated.Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Life brings nothing new to the screen and is derived from numerous existing & much superior examples. The movie's plot outline is lifted from Ridley Scott's Alien, its camera-work is inspired from Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, and the scripted people inhabiting its tale are a result of a lack of imagination. Espinosa's direction is good, for he manages to make its dull plot at least a bit interesting.Its poorly written screenplay uses the hackneyed formula for the plot and doesn't even attempt to add something that would make its characters compelling on some level. They are supposed to be astronauts yet the stupid decisions they keep making throughout the movie is astonishing. It's just Rebecca Ferguson's character who showcases some sort of common sense while the remaining crew is too bland to be worthy of any emotional investment.The technical aspects are well executed. Production design team recreates the International Space Station in splendid detail and the zero gravity ambiance is convincingly portrayed. Cinematography makes fab use of the camera, opening with a long, unbroken & single-take scene and encapsulates the whole picture with a claustrophobic aura. Editing provides a steady pace and keeps everything firmly stacked, and its intermittently rousing score has an overpowering feel to it.Coming to the performances, Life features a star-studded cast in Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare & Olga Dihovichnaya amongst whom Ferguson manages to impress, that too in bits n pieces. Gyllenhaal could've done a lot more had there been more meat on his character's arc. Reynolds is there to play himself and does it without hassle. But the alien happens to exhibit more attributes than all the humans present at ISS combined.On an overall scale, Life is marred by numerous shortcomings and is severely lacking in originality but it still makes up for an adequate sci-fi horror that's quite enjoyable & moderately entertaining. The available resources are expertly utilized by Espinosa, the thrilling moments keep surfacing at regular intervals, and it is well aware of its limitations but there was still room for improvement, for the movie never really takes advantage of its R-rating, is filled with cringeworthy dialogues, and wraps itself up with an ending that it thinks is clever but is actually as trite as it is irrelevant.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, not great.","Good MoviePros - special effects, action and sets. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the alien. The way it looked and moved looked good to me.interesting ways of getting the crew members picked off.interesting to see Ryan Renolds in anything other than an action comedy. As always, he plays himself --- the wise cracking action hero. But it's in a serious movie.Cons - too much melodramatic emoting. Real astronauts are trained to handle life threatening emergencies. This crew screams, freaks out, and cries too much. For example, the first time the alien attacks, immediately the crew freaks out, and starts screaming in hysterical confusion. Not realistic. And too much time spent on crew members crying with sad music, and reflecting on personal feelings. Not only was it real eye rolling and annoying to me. It really slowed the movie down.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The tension is at 100% constantly, there's no slow parts to help balance it out, especially from the 20+ minute mark.

Really?....this is a bad  picture?,"Wow. It amazes me that this has rated under 8. I can't understand why so many people feel the need to compare this to Alien. The bare bones of this is similar to Alien, but beyond that it is refreshingly unique, and unlike Alien, much more plausible. This is not just horror Scifi. This is a genuine thriller with an excellent cast. I love the fact that I didn't have to put up with all the usual stupid clichés that ruin movies like this. Neither did the writers feel the need to include much humour, and this really added to the atmosphere in a similar manner to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". What is dumbfounding is the reviewers that think that this film is ""illogical, unoriginal and so flawed. It is closer to perfect that virtually every film in this genre. Like ""The Thing"", it is a masterpiece. Take note of the sound track in the dying seconds before the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a film with good craftsmanship and acting all around.  that said...,"Life works like an efficient and competent B movie with some A-movie window dressing and talent up until it's final minute. And while I'm sure people will immediately jump to the Alien comparisons due to the trailer, I thought of a lot of different sci-fi movies that I'm sure the writers behind Zombieland (a much better take-off, and funnier, than this film by a mile), so in its first moments it calls to mind 2001, and some of the camaraderie of the people on the ship and their functions as various scientists and engineers and, well, Ryan Reynolds, was like Event Horizon at its most entertaining, and I'm sure some Gravity worked its way into the script as well (the outside space scenes, and how the ship looks and moves, feels very much in tune with filmmakers who saw that movie and, naturally, it takes some time to translate that phenomenon to a 'take' on that).Now, this is for those who have seen the film (though I'll keep it spoiler free): I didn't like the ending, or I should say the final minute and what may be a denouement (the climax itself is thrilling and for a moment I thought Sony might make up for the wasted potential of their last sci-fi release, Passengers). It's not the spirit of it in and of itself, it's the execution of certain details of where actors are at a particular moment. It felt like it was a Shyamalanian-ish ""ooh, twist, gotcha"", only it leaves things as... I dunno. Empty, actually, and that the studio asked for two endings and tested both, and this one somehow wound up not testing *as* bad, so they went with this. It just left me feeling 'ugh' - though having ""Spirit in the Sky"" over the end credits feels like an extra cheeky kick in the groin.The rest of the movie's alright as a straight-forward, very science-filled piece of science/action fiction (until it isn't, which is... half an hour in) with a capable and spot-on cast. Actually, because of the cast alone (especially Gyllenhaal,n Bakare as Hugh the scientist that sets off nearly all of what's to come in the film, and Rebecca Ferguson who gets more emotionally intense in the last reel) and that the movie *is* well-paced, I'll bump up its rating a tad. But it could have been more than it was.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
4/10,"Abroad the International Space Stations a team of six astronauts is preparing for the approach of a probe carrying a most valuable treasure: a cell of alien life. When the scientists try to give life to the cell things seem to go smoothly until the alien life form starts to become conscious and scary events start to unfold.Not even the fact that I am a huge Sci-Fi and Horror fan, nor my love for the actors involved could manage to save this generic, bland piece of directing that left me utterly uninterested and bored. This feature is an endeavor in terrible character development and embarrassing storytelling that manages to arouse fascination only in small components of an otherwise messy picture.As much as I am against at turning hate towards filmmakers of films, which should always be appreciated as a work of craftsmanship and effort, I am sadly over Daniel Espinosa. Once OK, twice try again, three times I'm out. He has directed some of the worst and most soulless films of the last years and he has consistently demonstrated to me an inability to control plot or develop character.This isn't meant to be a hate letter towards anybody or anything, rather than just an analysis of what bad filmmaking is. Lets starts with the camera, possibly the worst part of the picture. Espinosa's camera does not tell a story, it describes a situation. I mean you have possibly the best cinematographer in the world (for me at least), Seamus McGarvey, and you manage to screw that up. There is no philosophy behind the camera. It is just placed around stuff and looks at the situation from the most generic points of views possible. There is no style, no over arching theme given to it. Maybe a couple of repeated patterns, but even then, they are used in different situations and at that point I did not know what to think anymore. The aimlessness of the camera is just enough to take away any grit or interest to this film, it looks like it could have been directed by a computer, there is no rhythm to the shots, no artistic beauty to be taken from a pantheon of images that are almost always in the wrong place.This has many effects on the movie. Character and plot are a fantasy. Even with only six characters Espinosa struggles to give any of them any relevance. Jake Gyllenhal manages to be the only one to emerge with something but even then, characters are always and only talking and explaining the plot to one another. There isn't half of a decent and genuine conversation, very single scene is exposition time, it almost becomes mind numbing. And this is to be considered even worse once you realize that they are explaining the plot, but you are not understanding it. I was lost by the feature in at least four points. I went to see this with a friend and we had to feed each other almost constantly on what was going on because we didn't understand it. There is no order or hierarchy in how plot points are presented to you (all due to the camera, again!). They introduce one plot point early on then they take it back one hour later, or they do the exact opposite or even worse there is a button that solves the problem. Story and plot are literally put all over the place.One could also go on in explaining how many things do not make any kind of sense: the plot holes are everywhere, the logic in this people is ridiculous and worst of all the mythology established behind the alien life-from is broken at every further step in its evolution. Then the score, god the score of this film is insanely bad. It is loud and overdone, it does let moments breathe, it's just big drums and heavy music in the moments of tension and high strings in the moments of emotion, my ears were bleeding by the end.As much as this is a disaster from any kind of emotional or visual point of view, I can give it little moments of premise magic meaning that there are some scenes, mostly early on because then it goes on a train-wreck, that engaged me in the questions they were presenting, the alien life form works really well at the start and the scenes of the sessions with were definitely the best the movie had to offer. Moreover, none of the blame can be shifted to the actors, they are all top tier talents and show it here, none of them give a bad performance they are just surrounded by generic shots that give no context to their performance.""Life"" is a really bad film and I rarely find myself saying that. I wish all the success in the world to Daniel Espinosa but after this I am out of seeing any film of his from now on, unfortunately his particular vision is one that sits really badly with me and always leaves my mind numbed by the blandness of the visuals and consequently of the feature itself.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Excellent One-Time Sci-fi Horror Flick,"Life is the kind of sci-fi film that I really enjoy watching once, but will unlikely watch again.I honestly hate horror films, but I appreciated the realistic approach and sequential consequences of each action.This movie is perfect for people who dislike gory horror (Alien), pointless sci-fi (Gravity) and CGI bloated sci-fi films (Guardians of the Galaxy).Most horror films overuse jump scares, subliminal images and nonlinear sound to stimulate generic responses.Instead, Life uses the disturbing reality of isolation, the unknown, interpersonal conflict to deliver an intense and emotional ride.I think the film is a realistic portrayal of what actual alien life will be like and the uncontrollable dangers therein.A much more epic and scientifically accurate sci-fi horror film is Danny Boyle's (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire) Sunshine (2007) which coincidentally has the same actor Hiroyuki Sanada.",,Anonymous,Horror

Stands firmly on its own,"One of the trivia says the movie is based on Alien (1979). That wouldn't be respectful to Life. Life indeed is in space, but in closer orbit to the earth, but also with a more realistic threat that feels close to home.But the real surprise is that the actors carry the movie, and not the alien. The threat is real, looks real and feels real, but never turns this movie into a science fiction / horror movie. The movie is a thriller/drama that evolves with the choices that people have to make, their vulnerabilities, naivity and bravery. And as the characters evolve, so does the alien.So as much as the alien is a threat to all of humanity, it also brings forth the humanity of all people on screen. And they do that with limited props, limited space and limited screen time. Therefor this movie succeeds in what other movies couldn't.Life is claustrophobic, scary, intense, and all too human and all too real. You'll believe the characters and dangers, which will both keep you on the edge of your seat.The only minus is the ending. Personally I'd suggest to consider it a 'what if' ending, and don't ask for a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid 'monster in space' movie,"Set aboard the International Space Station a team of scientists are preparing to analyse soil samples that a probe has brought back from Mars. A single cell is found in the sample; tiny but enough to prove that there is life of non-terrestrial origin. It gradually begins to grow and appears to react to stimuli. The news is greeted with excitement on Earth and the lifeform is quickly dubbed 'Calvin'. Inevitably it isn't long before things go wrong. After an accident in the lab it gets out of its quarantine container and attacks the crew. They struggle to keep it in the lab but it manages to get out and as it feeds it grows. They have to contemplate the fact that their mission is now to stop it getting to Earth rather than merely saving themselves.Given that this features a deadly alien creature and is set aboard the ISS it is hardly surprising that it is described as 'Alien' meets 'Gravity'; that is a little unfair though. I didn't think it was as good as those films but it didn't feel like a rip-off to me. Even if the central idea wasn't the most original it was effective. Once Calvin is on the loose the tension rises quickly and there are some fairly disturbing moments. The location provides a great sense of claustrophobia and unlike most space based films there is no artificial gravity. There are some questionable moments but occasionally these are required to advance the plot... there wouldn't have been much of a story if they didn't make the mistakes that led to Calvin's escape. The cast, including some big names does a fine job; most notably Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Hiroyuki Sanada. The special effects are pretty impressive; both the realistic space shots and the creature design. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of sci-fi horror; it may not be the best in the genre but it is very far from the worst I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Professor Doctor Alien vs NASA,"This movie is obviously heavily inspired by the Alien franchise but this movie is even worse than the Alien franchise.Long story short they find a single cell life form on Mars but it doesn't seem to be alive. For no good reason in a space station that orbits Earth people try to resurrect this life form and they succeed in it (Why not do it on the moon or a secure place on Earth?). This life form starts to grow and grow fast. Initially it was not hostile, even cute a bit but after a lab incident they realize the life form doesn't even move anymore so without even questioning if it sleeping or something they electroshock the life form repeatably which results in the alien becoming hostile to them. Up to this point the movie is okay. What's not okay is in a few minutes the alien figure outs how space station and space suits even work and many more so much it's just ridiculous. A smart life form cannot figure out things without prior knowledge. That's not being smart is. Without key you cannot unlock a door that you cannot destroy. Same logic is valid for understanding a reality. For example you cannot know how to drive a car without learning how to drive it because you have no idea if it has a gas pedal and whatnot. The alien can even strategically hunt people by understanding a person doesn't feel his legs because he is disabled. How the hell?The movie is stupid in many ways. For example, the people in the space station who are tasked with dealing with an alien life form for in case it becomes hostile have no way to even protect themselves against the alien. They could have killed the alien in many ways if they weren't so idiots. Like why there was no way to lockdown the room alien was in the first place? No poison gas, no burning the room, no way to send the whole room into the deepest part of the space, et cetera. If these had happened but if the alien had still survived then the movie would make sense. For a long time you watch an alien being a threat like a rabid rat and suddenly it's like The Master is the villain of the whole movie so pathetic primitive humans cannot handle a Time Lord The Master except this life form is not a Time Lord but somehow has the capacity of a Time Lord. The funny thing is when people captured by the alien they don't even think to punch, kick, use an object as blunt weapon to hit the alien, et cetera. When they are captured they wait to die like a sheep.The guy who is supposed to be an expert on life forms has no idea on Earth there is an animal that can survive space called a Tardigrade so the guy is surprised when this alien can survive space. For an alien that regenerated like a lizard/Time Lord fast and survives in space they really kept underestimating it.The movie has stupid plot twists. For example they didn't tell the people in the space station that they will be sacrificed if things go south which ironically makes things go south as well as Dr. North instead of north. In reality when you don't let people know about such serious matters and don't make them sign a paper with their free will it will become a law crisis. So the families of these people can sue NASA and earn lots of money, USA government has to fire lots of NASA people. In real life such legal matters don't work like that. Also the ending was obvious but the director believed it could be shown as a plot hole by butchering cinematography. Mr. Director, you just fooled yourself, not the audience.The ending of the movie is another stupid aspect of the movie. Some fisherman saws the damn alien captured a man in a space capsule and they decide to open it. Just LMAO. People wouldn't even open the damn capsule if it was filled with rats.Overall the movie is so amateurish the script seems like what a primary school kid would write if their homework is writing a space station crisis story due to an alien.Lastly I wanna mention how boring it's when certain actors/actresses keep playing the same kind of character in every movie. For example Ryan Reynolds is always the funny action guy, Jake Gyllenhaal is always the person who has problems with society and Hiroyuki Sanada is always the serious emotional guy. You just gotta stop with generic people for generic roles logic. This movie was not for a funny character as well as a person who is done with society. Thus it was like I watched a movie about Deadpool and Donnie Darko dealing with an alien in space.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Someone Actually Wrote ""Waist of Time""...","...and then rated the film a '1.' I'm sorry, but if you can't even spell a five letter word correctly, why am I listening to anything you have to say? For the record, it is 'w-a-s-t-e of time,' not 'waist.' Maybe when you learn to spell, I might actually listen to your opinion. But probably not. Because it's obviously uninformed and unintelligent.Plot In A Nutshell: The crew of the International Space Station gets way more than expected when they examine soil samples taken from the planet Mars.Why I rated it an '8': Many people have commented that this film borrows a lot from other films, most notably ""Alien"" and ""The Thing."" And they are right. However that doesn't mean a film can't be good if it has a similar story. Who says it can't? OK so it lacks originality. But is it still interesting, gripping, suspenseful, surprising? Yes, it can be. It owes a debt to those other, groundbreaking films, and that being the case, it should be acknowledged that it's not as good as them. However, to dismiss it as 'bad' because it's not original is just silly. Have you listened to any music lately? The amount of sampling that goes on is off the charts. Borrowing doesn't make something bad. Lighten up.The truth is, ""Life"" is a pretty good film. The sfx are believable and the story never drags even if it feels somewhat familiar. But the film does have a different ending from those aforementioned ones, and that deserves to be recognized too. Some of the reviewers here have complained about the characters' actions or decisions, but it's easy to make judgments without walking the walk. Who's to say how someone will react in an intense, life-threatening situation? You cannot know. It's foolish to think otherwise. Bottom line: ""Life"" is pretty good and doesn't have the ""Hollywood Ending."" It deserves a few points for that alone.8/10. Times watched: 1. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as Good as I Wanted It to Be, But Still Very Good","Director David Espinosa does a fantastic building tension within the film. As the stakes grow, the tension rises, and it's incredibly palpable. I would say this tension that was built was far scarier than really anything they showed in the movie, because it's all about the setting. This atmosphere encapsulates the movie in its entirety, and it makes the experience all the more enjoyable. The performances across the board are also really good. I'll talk more about the characters themselves, but the performances by the actors are very good. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, and Hiroyuki Sanada all delivered, though I was expecting them to be good. I was surprised with how good Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare were, simply because I haven't really seen them on screen before. They were really good in this movie, and I enjoyed them quite a bit. The wire work in this film cannot be praised enough! The entire movie takes place in zero gravity, and everything they did to seamlessly make it feel like they were actually in space paid off tremendously.

Life is a real treat for the audience.,"The film ""Life"" is a test-tube baby, born from a blend of old-school monster-movie DNA and state-of-the-art digital effects. At times silly — yet surprisingly satisfying — this tale of sci-fi suspense and horror, set in the weightless environment of the International Space Station, gives Emmanuel Lubezki's vertiginous ""Gravity"" cinematography a run for its money. While this ever-more-nerve-racking game of cat-and-mouse is well calibrated by director Daniel Espinosa, the film's real interest derives from the human interactions. Life never reaches greatness, but it's solidly good, from its earned scares to a spot-on ending.My Rating : 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror in space,"""Life"" is a horror film in space without great surprises, but very entertaining. The movie tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. Those who have seen Alien will have a pretty good idea what's coming, at least to a point. The film has good digital effects, real suspense mix with horror, an interesting twist and also A-list stars. The truth is that ""Life"" will not go down in history as the best film of the genre, but it's a B movie product with a good budget, which disguises itself well as a blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Where ""Alien"" meets ""Gravity"": thoroughly entertaining","""Life"" (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the story of a 6 person crew on the International Space Station. As the movie opens, we see the crew getting ready to intercept a capsule flying through space. The capsule contains samples retrieved from Mars. Having caught the capsule successfully (which is filmed in one long shot, just beautiful), we get to know the crew, with members from the US, the UK, Russia and Japan. The British biologist finds there is life in one of the samples, and he nourishes it, and even giving it a nickname (Calvin). But alas, things don't always look what they seem, and before we know it, trouble is brewing... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to reveal more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Swedish director Daniel Espinoza. If you have seen the movie's trailer (which has been hard to escape in recent weeks), you know exactly what to expect. In essence this is a mash-up of where ""Alien"" meets ""Gravity"", the latter due to the spectacular in and around the ISS and space. The real question hence is: how does the movie measure up relative to the ""trapped in space"" genre? I am happy to tell you that the movie measures up very nicely, thank you. Almost from the get-go, tension is palpable and I found myself screaming out loud and even looking away from the screen a couple of times. When that happens, you know the movie is getting to you, in the best possible way. There are just enough plot twists to keep the action going quasi non-stop. Jake Gyllenhaal as the senior medical officer who is starting his record-breaking 473rd consecutive day in space (""I like it up here!"", he says) leads the cast. Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is yin to Gyllenhaal's yang. Ryan Reynolds as the ISS pilot has a much smaller role. Last but certainly not least, Swedish composer Jon Ekstrand (who has scored several of Espinoza's earlier movies) delivers an excellent orchestral score that matches the film perfectly.""Life"" opened wide a few weekends ago and has done okay at the box office, although for a movie of this caliber (and budget) with this cast, it certainly feels like it should've done much better. Cut-throat competition from higher profile movies like Beauty and the Beast, Kong: Skull Island, Power Rangers and now Ghost in the Shell certainly isn't helping. I can only say that I was more than pleased, and thoroughly enjoyed ""Life"" for what it was. I'd readily recommend you check this out, be it in the theater, VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What ever happened to gray little humanoid aliens?,"Let me just say that I started watching this movie having high hopes. First of all, the characters don't have depth and we don't really get to know any of them in detail. I liked that there was no romance involved, whatsoever. Second of all, the alien looks so strange, like a cross between a jellyfish and a praying mantis. I miss those humanoid gray little guys we are all accustomed to.

"""That's Life, That's What All The People Say!""","Life (2017) -""The Chances Of Anything Coming From Mars Are A Million To One They Said. . .""""Life Finds A Way - Dr Ian Malcolm (Jurassic Park)""There were definite similarities to 'Event Horizon' (1997) with this film and it reminded me of the 'Doctor Who' (2005-) episode 'The Waters Of Mars' (2009). It also shared some very obvious likenesses to 'Alien' (1979). As such it was nothing very newIt was easy to see who was going to croak it and who would survive. Unfortunately after so many of these films, the formula has become a bit easy to predict.I did however like the fact that the film showed a future where Earth had United to work together in space. With a wide diversity of people from around the world on the space station orbiting the planet, it was almost like watching something that might lead up to 'Star Trek's' Starfleet, as it suggested a unity amongst our people and a desire to explore boldly, having a established a peace at last.It was unclear if ""Calvin"" the '""Alien"" sample was related to 'Audrey II' from 'The Little Shop Of Horrors' (1986) though, because he looked very similar, which made the fright element a tad comical.Other than that, I wasn't sure that Norman Greenbaum singing 'Spirit In The Sky' was the most appropriate song to play over the end credits for a couple of reasons.I did like it in general and enjoyed it was enjoyable enough. The cast did a great job and apart from 'Audrey II' the production values and effects were all very good.If this film had come out before 'Alien' or maybe if future generations watch it before that film then it could be considered great, but as another replicant, it just lacked enough difference to stand out.610.83/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

If it is true that the premise is the same (poor miserable ones are trapped in a spaceship with a very bad creature that wants to kill them), but there are several differences. This pretends to be as realistic as possible, it tries to show how it could be a first encounter with an alien entity that does not come with good intentions, with a more or less serious and scientific tone and in a more or less current moment.

Its music, tension and rhythm and casting could've been better, but the movie is still good enough to watch at a movie theater. The director tries to add some depth to the characters, but it somewhat fails, too, due to its not-so-long running time probably.In conclusion, if you are into sci-fi movies, you should totally give it a chance.

"We've seen this before, only better","""Life"" despite being a very well finished film and with a direction that does not leave to be desired, we notice that it is the opposite of original, it is a fragmented of at least another 10 films of the same genre that is inspired, that goes From ""2001, a space odyssey"" to ""alien,"" through ""apollo 18"" and ""interstellar."" I like the script of the movie, although I find it lazy in some ways, but it's smart to start with a slow pace until it shows what it really is, and we have a forced ending, but at the end it's a bit of a cliché. We have the story of a crew of six astronauts who collect and analyze a microscopic life analysis of Mars, until it begins to develop ... yes, we have seen before, and in a much better way. Technically the film does not dislike, as everything is a copy of a copy, we have an attempt to simulate something of ""2001 - an odyssey in space"" and to use angles of ""Gravity"", but in a way inferior, but that visually pleases , And we are very careful in the details, and the direction of art is effective, even if the whole style is reused, it is well reused, and the director has some whim, at least in that, we have a soundtrack that tries to be epic and pass a Feeling, but it fails completely. Making a broader philosophy about life, the film leaves a lot to be desired, because it creates a scope of who will debate the theme, and in the end becomes a blockbuster. We do not have any relevant acting, nor does Jake Gyllenhaal save here, despite fulfilling his role. What does not let the film be a waste of time is its direction, despite being copied from other films, it is a good copy -Technically-, it does not impress, it does not bother and it amuses a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than expected; a new alien with new conditions,"Went in today into the first showing. I like 'Alien' and similar movies, whereupon 'Alien' is the origin and reference of the genre. Only if you watch 'Alien' nowadays, it has a very long and slow introduction, but it's unbeaten in building up an eerie atmosphere. 'Life': There are some flaws, but all in all it was also successful and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe here the introduction was a bit too brief. The fate of Ekaterina (the commander) was very realistic, I saw a documentation and the astronaut there had exactly the same problem - exempt the alien organism, of course. Even though the premise strongly reminds one of 'Alien', the differences - and there are significant ones -, lie in the details respectively in the extraterrestrial form of life. The ending was satisfying to me, however it was also illogical (no explanation was given for that 'change'). So, if you liked 'Alien', this one is recommended to you. I hope that the forthcoming 'Alien: Covenant' will also meet my high expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tries too hard to be next Alien, but fails...","Life tries really hard to be next Alien. Life is not bad, but you hardly can compare it to classic like Alien. The biggest problem in the movie is monster itself. Found from Mars life form, which starts to kill space stations crew one by one. Everything is like in Alien, so what is wrong with it? Actually everything. Monster is too pretty to be horrified. It is too sleek and smooth and looks too digitally made, not scary at all. Besides the terror for crew is not grotesque enough. You hardly see blood and monster looks a little like octopus, too cute to be scary. It might sound corny, but in these days when you find many TV shows more graphic and violent, monster here and it's ways to kill staff is too sleek. Besides the international space station feels too big and doesn't feel any claustrophobia at all, like space craft in Alien.Still Life is not too bad at all. It's visuality is stunning camera run is breathtaking. It is too bad that this movie is not in 3D format. Space station looks quite realistic and spacewalk are very enjoyable to look. Even though Life is quite OK space monster movie, it hardy can compare classics like Alien. In some parts story starts to meander and fumble, but script is good enough to tighten the story back to basic. The end of the movie is more funny than scary. After all Life is quite descent space monster movie and it leaves great expectations for Alien Covenant movie.

Life is Unexciting,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 )GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Life disappoints.SYNOPSIS: Life can be quite deadly as a group of astronauts discover in this typical sci-fi thriller.No one may hear a scream in outer space. But in Daniel Espinoso's well-crafted Life, the latest sci-fi horror film which follows that successful Alien formula, you do hear, with added certainty, an annoyingly loud music score that regularly blasts its notes to warn of impending doom. Six internationally diverse NASA professionals find life amid the soil samples from Mars. As this multi-celled organism begins to take form, so does the predictability of this film. It's par for the course, that the trained astronauts grow dumb and dumber while our little plant monster (affectionately named Calvin) grows stronger and bigger. There's no account that there will be room for human error on the screen. Dinner will be served soon enough!However, the behind-the-scenes human talent have made a technically strong film. One can definitely observe that the filmmakers took a more intellectual and earnest approach to this genre with their willingness to spend more time with the characters and setting before the initial scares begin. Shamus McGarvey's fluid camera-work is above reproach as is Nigel Phelp's production design. Mr. Espinoso's direction builds some nice tension too.But the script is a mere clone with its ""been there / done that"" formula. It's not that Life's screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is lifeless...it's just redundant and unexciting in its lack of imagination. It's not as if the writers don't try to create compelling characters by establishing background exposition on the six astronauts aboard. And there is some nice sleight-of-hand moments in the film's climax. But all that skill cannot disguise the simplistic plot mechanisms so intrinsic with the sci-fi nature of its origins.Life begins as a serious film odyssey about space exploration before it take the rote route into the horror genre and settles into a standard monster flick to see who gets offed next and how gruesome the death can be. The monster itself isn't very scary. It's not hideous or creepy, with its octopoid tentacles and jellyfish form undulating quite gracefully before lunging at its helpless victims.The actors (or human entrees) along for the ride are an impressive group of performers who have done much better in other outings but are saddled here with stock characters caught in a familiar plot, no matter have solidly Mr. Espinoso directs them. They are: Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and lesser known actors as Olga Dihovichnaya, Hiroyuki Sabada, and Ariyon Bakare, all rounding out the sextet of space travelers.To summarize: Calvin is actually Audrey III of Outer Space, a toothless, less terrifying creature that preys on other lifeforms. Its appetite may be insatiable but moviegoers should take heed of this simplistic horror film with its cheap thrills and gory kills. As the saying goes, Life can be full of disappointments.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds lead a stellar cast, injecting life into a space horror that's both claustrophobic and heart-pounding. The film editing is a tightrope walk, maneuvering through the tight corridors of the International Space Station with a tension that builds like an interstellar symphony. The strength of Life lies in its ability to tap into the primal fear of the unknown and the consequences of humanity playing with extraterrestrial fire. While the music might not be a standout element, it effectively heightens the suspense in key moments. The weakness, if any, is in the familiarity of the sci-fi horror tropes, but the execution elevates the material. Cinematography captures the vastness of space and the terror within the station, creating an immersive experience.

An actor can only do so much if the material is not there.I will say that the pacing was fast paced and kept you on your feet. It was an entertaining movie in general, but ultimately very average and forgettable.Unfortunately the story did feel a bit unoriginal in many aspects and that just hurt the movie all around. Overall a average film that didn't try hard enough. 6.25 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Way better than the rating,"At the time of writing, the rating of this movie is only about 6.6/10 and I don't get really get why.Of course, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a pretty good movie in its genre.

You won't find bright new ideas in that movie but the ones inside are exploited in a correct way, enough to make this movie pretty entertaining and suspenseful at time.The actors are convincing, the music is very well balanced...

"Forgettable, By-the-Numbers Alien Monster Movie","You've probably seen this movie before: astronauts encounter an unknown life form, they bring it on their ship, it turns out to be a human-eating monster, and then they get chased around the spaceship. That's exactly what this movie is, but it has Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhal, and the lighting is pretty dark most of the time. They did a good job with the gravity effects and outer space shots, but I have mixed feelings about the monster. The pacing wasn't bad but I still got kind of bored towards the end. The characters only have the bare minimum of backstories, so there's not much to invest in, but the acting was pretty good. I didn't guess the ending, but I should have, because at its core it's trying to be a Ridley Scott film.It's serviceable background noise made by people who know what they're doing and have a decent budget, but it fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table that would make it stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Throwback to original Aliens, solid sci-fi movie",I'm watching this in 2024 for the first time. I think I always mixed it up with arrival from 2016 (another solid sci-fi film). It's does a lot well with a real original 'Alien' movie feel to it.Genuinely scary in some parts and the spaceship looks good and the affects hold up even watching it 7 years after release.The creature is not as scary as a Xenomorph for example but still a good movie for it's time and the reviews are overly harsh.The sets and the outer space shots outside the craft look very good.

6/10 Life but not as we know it,"OK I had hoped for more , the trailers were enticing and Jake was doing the rounds in the UK drumming up interest . It's not a bad film , it's above average not spectacular, some elements may be scary in 3D but it wasn't Alien by a long shot , the CGi was great but the suspense wasn't there neither was an emotional engagement with the characters .Good all-round performances by the multi national and lingual cast . Rebecca was very convincing as British ( though her upbringing in Sweden was multi lingual ) I had to blink as I thought Will-I-am was in it .What was a let down was the actual ending , the build up was superb but there could have been much more mystery at the end with a cliffhanging ending.What was best about it? A) the first 30 mins B) the lack of gravity felt realistic C) the song in the closing credits d) the science and hope for lifeIs it worth seeing ? YesIs it worth more than 6/10 ?

Decent But Derivative Sci-Fi Thriller,"There's nothing wrong, whatsoever, with 'Life.' It's a good film with some good characters, good sequences and, as the thriller genre demands, thrills. Indeed, in places 'Life' goes beyond what you might expect. Its characters are far better rounded and developed than some of its lesser cousins and cliches which could easily drag it down are avoided in clever ways. The performances, across the board, are good and the dialogue feels natural.Despite this the film suffers from an obvious derivative nature. All films are derivative, nothing is original and almost all films pay tribute in one form or another, either obviously or subtly, to those films that inspired them. The problem with 'Life' is it feels too much like a modern day 'Alien' tribute piece than something fresh.I enjoyed the film and it certainly excels in some areas. It is thrilling, it is scary in parts and there is plenty of well placed tension. That said, the overriding feeling of watching the film is less, 'This is good', and more, 'Aren't Alien and The Thing really brilliant.'",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad sci-fi flick for seeing it once and nothing else,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Life"" (2017) is a movie which will probably appear to those who like sci-fi movies in a first place - more for fans i think. The premise of this movie isn't original to say the least, but i like these ""kind"" of movies when they are done good. ""Life"" could be best described as a guilty pleasure - it doesn't offer you absolutely anything new or very exciting. Yet the craftsmanship of this movie and the A list cast makes it for a pretty not bad movie overall.The weakest thing in this movie without a doubt was script. There many predictable moments, and some eye rolling lines like ""my place is in a space - i don't want return to 8 billions of the motherfxxxers"" - seriously - this line should have been movies dramatic punchline yet it sounded kinda bizarre. This movie also borrows heavily from great movies like ""Alien"" or ""Gravity"" - ""Life"" unfortunately is by all possible moons not as good as any of those movies.Overall, ""Life"" is a not bad sci-fi flick for seeing it once at home. It doesn't provide anything new or very exciting, script is pretty weak, yet craftsmanship, music and great actors do deliver. And by the way to call it a creature in a movie with a name ""Celvin"" does not work. ""Bob"" should sounded more menacing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Red Dwarf,"An abducted Martian fights back against his oppressors.Well, I thought I'd invert the logline to see if that might bring more insight - sadly, no. This is a well-paced action adventure that hides it's 'sciency stuff' exposition pretty well, and just about qualifies as horror through its monster element. The main mistake is in the sentimental lull before the climax - I actually tuned out to perform some complex engineering on a noisy fan: a rubber washer fixed the whirring sound.The characterisation is promising, since we're introduced to a scientist released from his wheelchair by zero-gravity and another, a misanthrope, who abhors the ways of mankind - so both have good reason to prefer life away from earth. The latter character's fate does provide irony, but nobody else's life gets flipped or switched or twisted round (apart from dying), so the story is not much more sophisticated than The Thing From Another World or yet another episode of The Twilight Zone.The production values are quality, with impressive CGI and effective music.P.s.

Movie Bingo. Full House !,"Getting a bit bored with watching Iranian New Wave cinema I stroked my chin wondering what would qualify as the complete polar opposite . Sci-fi horror ? Maybe. After all for the vast majority of human beings we simply go to the cinema to be entertained and being thrilled and chilled by far fetched fictional horror is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Hollywood has been churning out science fiction big hitters in the last few months via ARRIVAL and PASSENGERS but this film LIFE - yet another SF movie with a minimalist title - seemed to be one that would really appeal to me . Only downside is that even critics who liked it such as Mark Kermode noticed it's a film without an original bone in its body!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!Well one thing we can all agree on is that the professional critics are all singing from the same hymn sheet . Right from the out-set when we're introduced to the international multi-ethnic cast and when you've got that then it's best not to become attached to anyone who doesn't have white skin and speaks English as a first language. It also helps if you stop asking yourself questions like ""If they're supposed to be clever scientists why do they so many dumb things ?"" You know why . It's because scientists in films - unlike the audience watching - have never seen this type of genre film and if they did something sensible the film would stop long before the 90 minute mark. It's what is known as ""The Idiot Plot""Unless LIFE is the only sci-fi horror film you've seen then if nothing else you can have a lot of fun spotting all the other movie references . By the one hour mark I'd ticked off every box , shouted ""FULL HOUSE"" and wondered if I'd be getting any award for my observational skills . Nothing was forth coming but any rewards come via the traditional escapist way of storytelling . LIFE is rather diverting escapist popcorn entertainment . The predictable manner of the narrative isn't really a negative criticism though the director's technique of constantly using close ups to generate tension and having constant intrusive music be played is slightly overdone. You'll also probably work out the shock ending before it arrives on screen but despite all this - or maybe because of it - I found LIFE a very entertaining movie",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

To make things worse, there doesn't seem to be anything they can do to kill it! And, what if it somehow makes it back to Earth?!In so many ways, it's like a more realistic reworking of ""Alien"".

A modern day 'Alien' made with a lot of class,"I was not surprised to read that 'Life' was inspired by 'Alien'. WIthout calling it a remake or a reboot, it is basically a modern day re-imagining. By the time I was old enough to watch 'Alien' it had aged a little too much for me to truly appreciate it, and so I felt I kind of missed the boat. There is something very unique about space films. Because it is something that very few of us will ever get to experience in our lives, and yet remains a very realistic film subject, it can be quite a wonderful thing to watch a movie about. Even without the prospect of aliens it is quite an unsettling environment. Throw aliens (and dangerous ones at that) into the mix and you should have a hell of a film.Having said that there is no guarantee of high quality simply based on that premise. You still need a talented set of filmmakers to make it work. 'Life' obviously had those though, because it is a very fine film. Firstly, it's quick to get about its business. One thing I do remember about the original 'Alien' is that it took a long time to get going. That is not an issue here. Secondly, the film's creature is created in such a way that it feels particularly realistic. It is very menacing, yet also very grounded and believable in a way that is hard to explain exactly. Only by watching the film will you truly understand what I mean.It is a well paced film too. At no stage does the story stall. An impressive cast also does a good job of keeping the audience tuned in. One character played by Olga Dihovichnaya was quite hard to understand at times with a very heavy accent, however that would be the only acting fault I noticed. Then to top off an already fine film, there is a very fun and interesting ending that will be heavily discussed I suspect. 'Life' is a very well made, tense, interesting and thoughtful film that I see the majority of audience members thoroughly enjoying.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It wasn't exactly rushed, but scenes seemed to be mashed together to move the plot along too quickly at times and it tarnished my overall opinion of the movie.It's worth a watch and I give it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Life Finds a Way (To Kill You),"Originality is overrated. While many bemoan Hollywood's lack of originality while awash in a sea of reboots, remakes, sequels and franchise building, they forget that everyone has to get their ideas from somewhere. Everything is a remix, nothing is original anymore, and every new idea is just the culmination of ideas from the past. Or as Pablo Picasso once put it, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" The thing that separates the inspired ideas from the uninspired ones, however, is what they do with their plunder. Life is a terrific example of this. It may not have a single original bone in its body, but it at least knows how to use its stolen ideas effectively.Our story follows a team of researchers (Jake Gylenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ryan Reynolds) aboard the International Space Station after a mission collecting soil samples from Mars. One of the samples contains a revolutionary discovery: a dormant bacterium that they were successfully able to revive, giving definitive proof that Mars was once able to sustain life. They kept experimenting with this new lifeform (which they name Calvin), and the things they discovered became more and more unsettling: it grows at a substantial rate, it's strong, smart, hostile, carnivorous, it can survive in the vacuum of space, and it grows bigger and stronger with each new kill. Now it's on the loose, and the scientists must do everything they can to figure out how to kill it and escape with their lives.Life is basically a B movie on an A-list budget. It doesn't really have much to say beyond ""Hey, what if we combined Alien and The Thing with the budget and filmmaking skill of Gravity?"", but what saves this from being just another Alien clone is the execution. This is a technically gorgeous film. While it does steal a couple tricks from Alfonso Cuaron and Ridley Scott, they at least remember to steal the best ones. This is all evident in the opening scene, which is a one shot take of the astronauts floating through the narrow corridors of the space station, the camera twisting and spiraling around them weightlessly.The CGI is also spectacular. Watching Calvin's evolution from a microscopic organism to a symbiotic mass of fractals to a translucent starfish/orchid hybrid to a tentacled monstrosity is both awe-inspiring and horrifying, especially when his bloodlust starts to kick in. Both the zero-gravity cinematography and the nightmarish alien design are combined for maximum effect during a series of grizzly yet mesmerizing kills. Although most of the astronauts get their turn to be executed in increasingly gruesome fashion, the most upsetting one has to be when Calvin gets ahold of a lab rat. Animal lovers beware: it ain't pretty.The movie also has a great sense of suspense. There's a good reason a lot of suspense thrillers are about killer aliens: it's an isolated, claustrophobic area million, or even billions of miles away from help with a monster that we know nothing about. What makes Calvin different from the Xenomorphs or the Thing is just how fast it adapts and how strong it gets. Even when it's a little starfish it's able to figure out how to break out of its prison with a level of intelligence and problem solving skills of a chimpanzee. Every cell of its body is simultaneously a muscle, a brain, and an eye. No matter what our crew tries to do to get rid of him, he always seems to be one step ahead, all the way to the very end, from messing with the airlocks to even sabotaging their spacesuits. It's even hypothesized that this species lead to the extinction of all life on Mars, and the planet's lack of atmosphere was all that was keeping it from thriving. Eventually things get so bad that the captain, who up to this point has held science and logic above all else, to throw science to the wind and declare that this thing needs to die.Of course, these murders are meaningless without a reason to care about the victims, and as it turns out, space was originally a sanctuary for most of our cast. Gylenhaal is a jaded military doctor who's seen up close what kind of cruelty humans can inflict on each other, Ferguson is a disease control specialist who's the first to realize that Calvin needs to die, Bakare is a biologist who becomes attached to Calvin at first and who's also paralyzed from the waist down, so space is one of the only places where he can move around freely without any assistance, Sanada has a family back home and Reynolds may not have a tragic backstory but is still the most likable member of the crew. These conflicting personalities lead to some bad decisions, which is bad for them but good for the movie. Screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese (who are also responsible for the brilliant script for Deadpool) tend to fall into the familiar trappings of this sub-genre a lot, with the crew locking themselves in airlocks nanoseconds before the monster can get in and contending malfunctioning equipment. Aside from a rather shocking twist, the plot's predictability is probably what will be the film's undoing for some.Overall, Life is a fun little suspense thriller that makes up in skill and polish what it lacks in originality. There are better and worse things out in theaters right now, but it's still worth checking out, even if it's just for a late-night rental.7/10.",,Anonymous,Horror

Not too bad but the science was lacking,"Basically a remake of Alien except that the alien is more like the Blob. Absolutely no new thoughts went into the making of this movie. They did attempt to make it more scientific but they failed badly at that. The glaring problem is that you in reality, you would never try to resuscitate an alien life form even if its just a cell. The reasons are plain as day for anyone with an inkling of biology knowledge. Given it was biological in nature (dna based or similar), if you do revive said organism, it is highly likely that your microbes will destroy it or its microbes will destroy you. The odds of two organisms from two completely separate ecosystems to be compatible on a micro scale are practically zero which is the flaw of almost all alien based movies that have physical interaction. So anyway, the science was borked from the second they found the cell. No scientist over the age of 12 would have done what these morons did. But then you wouldn't have a movie right? Not an action movie at least. Which is where this one was not too bad in the same way that Alien is not bad. But the big difference is the age of each movie. Alien was great in its time, but today, such films are a dime a dozen and boring. Since there was no originality here and even less research, I cant see myself ever wanting to see it again.Watch it once as an action film if you like semi-realistic action.

Average science-fiction horror movie.,"I found this movie to be really average for a science-fiction horror movie goes. The story is standard for an alien movie, which goes with a group of characters discovering an alien species that slowly kills off them one by one. It's gets kind of predictable throughout and seems similar to Alien. But I do like how the movie builds up this type of alien by showing what it can do, and it becomes more deadly. The movie itself is suspenseful, with the characters trying to survive against this thing and do their best to deal with the issue. Also, the movie does a good job with its pace with its build-up towards the threat and the characters trying to figure out what to do. But I didn't like how the movie ended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not perfect, but a great alien science fiction addition","As the crew of the International Space Station begins to conduct research on recovered samples from Mars, they discover evidence of extraterrestrial life that proves more intelligent and dangerous than anyone ever expected.Director Daniel Espinosa with a keen eye and discipline offers a solid addition to the sci-fi genre. The visual effects are impressive, from the crew's weightlessness and the space station itself to the presence of the alien organism. The CGI work integrates with practical effects (and finely crafted sets), offering a sense of realism and danger as the characters navigate their precarious situation.The small cast ensemble play against type-cast adding some depth to their characters. Jake Gyllenhaal adds on screen emotion, with Rebecca Ferguson bringing authenticity and weight. Ryan Reynolds is memorable, and Hiroyuki Sanada is particularly notable.Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick drop surprising character deaths throughout to pique interest. As well as drawing from obvious space-themed movies like Alien (1979), it borrows story elements and surprises reminiscent from The Last Days on Mars (2013), but places the action in space rather than on a planet's surface. However, Reese and Wernick's script also shares similarities with Prometheus (2012) in its portrayal of questionable logic and decision-making by characters. Some actions may detract from the overall believability of the story, but the film still manages to deliver thrills and suspense thanks to Espinosa's relentless visuals and set pieces.Despite its occasional lapses in logic, Espinosa delivers an intense sci-fi that's worth checking out.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great ending,"Yes, I agree with others that there are definitely some questionable decisions made by the crew on more than one occasion. Putting that to one side, the movie is well worth a watch if you like science fiction. I've watched it twice now.

Sci-Fi-Themed Thriller,"Continuing my foray into sci-fi films, I recently went to see the movie Life, starring Hiroyuki Sanada, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare. Before I went to see it, I identified the movie as ""that space movie with Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal."" While that description is accurate, the film actually stars all six main actors equally. Truthfully, I am disappointed that there isn't more of Ryan Reynolds; he plays one of the most, let's say, ""infrequent"" characters. I was impressed with how pretty much equal airtime is given to every one of the characters, and the audience is not forced to focus on only one character's timeline throughout. I guess in a storyline based entirely on the International Space Station there isn't much room for extremely varied plot lines.I have to imagine that, while the cost to make this film was probably beyond my greatest guess, they must have saved some money by basically only having to pay six actors. IMDb lists only 17 cast members, 11 of which simply being extras, and the stars are a mix of unknown and popular actors. Even though there are only six main characters, any actual character development and exposition is lacking, although there are some slight attempts.As far as the plot goes, they get right into it really quickly. In the opening scenes I had the feeling that the events that transpired before this movie could have been their own movie altogether, and we were just coming in in the middle. The ending is equally as notable, and an audience is left with the potential for a sequel. The ending in particular came as quite a surprise to me. In hindsight, I could maybe have seen it coming, but the film does an excellent job of leading its audience to believe one outcome and then concludes with another. I don't want to say too much about the end, I fear I've said too much already, but rest assured it is a good one.One thing I also really like about this story is its complete lack of romantic interests. In a world that seems to revolve entirely around love, it is very refreshing to watch a movie that can carry itself along without having to use a crutch of romantic tropes. The closest thing to a love story is when we see Sanada's character in a video call with his wife, watching the birth of his baby. I'm sure you'd agree that this doesn't even come close to making the movie a love story, so we can just ditch that label altogether.At the expense of the romance genre, the movie was much more of a thriller than I anticipated. There was much more gore than I was expecting and little actual science: a horror film disguised as a sci-fi.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I left the theatre feeling a bit mentally exhausted. I don't watch a lot of movies at home, but I can foresee myself making an exception for this one! This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test.Read more of my reviews at mindovermoment.wordpress.com.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not as bad as people say.,"This movie is actually quite good. I have seen countless reviews from people who think they are critics and not one highlights what is good about this movie.

Life (2017),"The space genre is booming and on top of that we've had a number of close contained space horror films. Alien really popularized this type of film and since then we've had a number of good and some terribly bad films of the sort. The trailer for Life didn't spark a lot of interest for me as it seemed too generic, however some of the review for it were quite good so I was interested to check it out. The film is solid, despite not really offering anything new or overly original to the space horror genre.The film is about a space crew who come into contact with a life form from Mars. Although the world and space crew are initially excited about the contact that was made, it is soon discovered that this mysterious life form (named Calvin) is dangerous and smarter than initially thought. Calvin starts killing off the space crew one by one and becomes bigger and more dangerous as the crew scramble to try to kill the life form and save their space station.The film isn't exactly original and you can kind of see where it is heading, however the film does provide thrills and keeps you entertained throughout. The film benefits from having a pretty excellent cast, Gyllenhaal and Ferguson especially. Calvin is a menacing villain and you do want to see that sucker get destroyed but you have to stand by and which as it becomes stronger and stronger and more invincible. There is a long take and the cutting in the film is good for a space film and is sufficient enough for depicting thrilling moments. I really liked the ending of the film, its shockingly great and has potential for a future.As far as Venom connection goes, yes stock footage was used in the trailer from Life and Spiderman 3 and the writers of Life did write a script for a Venom film. However, I think maybe its a coincidence. I wouldn't be bothered by this actually being a horrifically brutal origin story for the symbiote that is Venom. Honestly, the studio could reel it in later and use it to lead into the Venom film that is supposedly planned. Life still works just as well as a stand alone film, prequel or not prequel.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
In five words: Alien for a new generation.,"Good movie with a good setup, focus, character development, tension and great pacing. It isn't original in anyway and certain parts are quite predictable, however the movie delivers everything marvelously with a great pacing and balance. Furthermore, the movie is very short only 1 hour and 30 minutes. So stop reading and start watching.This may all sound familiar, we find a sample or organism in space and we try to analyze it only to find out it is hostile. It is the basic setup as Alien and/or Species; however is that a bad thing? Alien is considered a master piece by most and it is a recommended watch, Species not so much. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and when a movie is good we don't need to compare them, just enjoy them.As aforementioned Life is quite short and within this short time the director is able to give us a hopeful beginning, tense middle with good character development, and a well enough ending. The cinematography is similar to the movie Gravity (2013) with a realistic view of space and the ISS. The music isn't anything special but it does its job to underscore the moments. What really stands out is the balance and pacing of the movie. The director knows how to setup a moment and how to pay it off later. Together with a fast pacing the movie almost never felt like it dragged on for too long (maybe a little at the end).The movie's protagonist isn't one person but a group. It consists of 5 astronauts on the ISS doing research on a Martian specimen. Each member has their own function on the ISS and gets their own moment to shine in the movie. The antagonist, is off course the Martian organism, however the movie tells it from a neutral perspective, basically it isn't evil it just tries to survive.That is it really. It is a shorter review than usual, but hey it is a short movie. Off course I can nitpick every small detail and give you all a detailed comparison with other movies, but this time it isn't about that. It is just me telling you that I liked the movie and that I can honestly recommend it.It is a good watch.I give this movie a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hooks you in from the very beginning, Lures you in with curiosity and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting more.",This was a great Sci-Fi horror movie. It doesn't have long drawn out periods of time where nothing is happening. The writing is busy and not lazy. It takes us on a long journey in a short period of time without making us suffer through front character stories.

Boy Scouts to the Front!,"I will make it short - what you get is Carpenter's The Thing playing on the ISS-Station.First the positive features: a good cast, good setting, cam and cgi- effects-department.

I rated 5. With a fine, well-crafted plot, especially not so many logical flaws and dumb actions from ppl who are in reality handpicked and well trained and tested but act in the movie so dumb that I have the feeling boy scouts would have done better.Without a with dumbness ""infected"" crew this movie could have been a new classic of space-horror.

Realistic in the effect and unrealistic in the plot and what the characters have to do,"Life (2017)A meld of ""Aliens"" and ""Gravity,"" with strengths of neither. The underlying point here was to make this idea—a Mars life form discovered and in quarantine on the Space Station—seem possible. And the big question: then what?But they make it impossible. There are moments of reasonable acting and believable responses, but mostly it's exaggerated and sometimes just plain stupid. That is, the characters do really stupid things, given the situation. ""Gravity, for all its visual excess, was also weirdly down to earth and believable. ""Aliens"" made no pretense of truth, of course, but it had actors that had intensity and depth. ""Life"" it a parade of obvious clichés in the booming space movie business.It's not impossible to watch. There are well orchestrated effects, and a feeling of weightlessness that's good. The acting is a mixed bag (and the leading name on the list, Hiroyuki Sanada, is just one of the crew, nothing notable). I think it gets passable ratings because it's kind of fun, and if you don't really care about the feasibility of this life form in this manner, and you don't care if the plot is absurdly unrealistic, then go for the ride.And for the great, improbable twist at the end.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another Big Budget Total Derailment,"Starts out plausibly enough with a lot of expensive CGI and convincing effects. Right away you begin to notice the acting is sort of flat and unconvincing like this was a rehearsal run-through for the film,The next thing you know, one ridiculous set of behaviors which has no explanation is leading to another ridiculous reaction which makes these top notch ""scientists"" and ""astronauts"" look like passengers on a special needs bus to mars. At no time was the cast engaged, believable or doing anything with their roles but phoning it in.I've watched a dozen super low budget films with abysmal production values this week and what they all had in common was that not one of them was as lousy or as disappointing as this latest car accident in a series of big blunders by Hollyweird.Increasingly, you can predict which movies are going to really stink nowadays by their budgets. The bigger the budget the more likely the film will be completely unwatchable. That hollow gourd feeling hit me the first couple of minutes I was watching Batman VS Superman recently but here my stomach was sinking in seconds. It could not be more obvious that the entire film was just kind of heaved together and thrown into the cinemas.

I don't need to mention Prometheus but, hey, I just did. Prometheus is far better than Life, though.The best line in ""Life"" is Ryan Reynolds telling the Ariyoon Bakare to stop treating the Mars bug like a buddy, ""Im' your buddy"". Yes, very good point. Unfortunately Hugh the Scientist is more interested in caressing it in a sexually loaded manner. It completely kills the suspense.Like, is Hollywood mandated to make as many movies about evil ETs and ravenous super organisms as possible? What the hell is this? It's like propaganda almost. Can anyone ever make something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind again (not counting Paul)? Also, did we really need a moody, deer eyed Jake Gylllenhall's character to remind us how much our leaders are messing up our planet and that's why he really likes ""ISIS""?

Although given what this film was set out to do, failing to live up to ""Alien"" is understandable. However, this film was tense and well-directed, but really didn't offer anything new. There wasn't even an attempt at character development, the first act bored, and the movie was quite predictable and by-the-numbers.

Fast Entrance and Pacing,"Movies like Life are having the disadvantage of comparison to a great classic movie. In this case it's a little movie called Alien.

In this case a futuristic version of the international space station.But the director of Life is clever enough, to just speed up the tempo of this movie. There is no long introduction of characters or alien. The situation is pretty clear within the first few minutes. That fast pacing, the great but sub-challenged actors, like Gylenhaal, Ferguson and Reynolds, some small surprises and the good visuals are making Life as enjoyable as it is.Will this movie be a classic and re-watched many times?

"A good, fun, suspenseful film... Don't expect anything more","""Life"" is the story of some scientists that discover alien life on mars and try to study it. Surprise! It doesn't go well.I watched ""Life"" yesterday and can say that it is a very fun movie to watch. I really did have a good time in the movie theatre. The movie is suspenseful, the performances are good, the CGI is very good, and overall... its a fun movie while we wait for Alien Covenant.It is impossible not to compare ""Life"" with ""Alien"". Both movies have similar plots and are kind of a slasher film but in space. Of course ""Alien"" is a better flick and ""Life"" is not trying to be better, its rather trying to remind the audience of the sci-fi horror genre which has been forgotten for some years now.There are some problems with the film however. The movie tries to be this grounded and realistic scientific film but if you know a little bit about science, you can tell some things are pure bullsh*t. The movie also has an inconsistent tone, since in the beginning of the film, the creature only does things to survive and the movie seems pretty realistic; while in the last half, the creature just becomes a slasher killer for the sake of it.Another thing to mention is that the cinematography is pretty dull and the screenplay is not that good by itself. Also, the characters are largely under-developed and you really don't care to much about them.I must say that I really enjoyed the score of the film which is very suspenseful.In the end, ""Life"" is nothing more than a fun movie you can go watch with friends and family and have a good time. It is nothing out of this world, but it does not try to be anything out of this world. It is just a reminder of the sci-fi horror genre with a killer ending (no pun intended).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Life (2017) Film Review,"This afternoon me and my friend Niall Ferguson went to Cineworld Union Square to see the new space sci-fi film Life starring Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson.Life tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station which consists of Rory Adams (Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds - Deadpool, Safe House), David Jordan (American actor Jake Gyllenhaal - The Day After Tomorrow, Nightcrawler), Miranda North (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson - Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, The Girl On The Train), Sho Murakami (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada - The Wolverine, Rush Hour 3), Ekaterina Golovkina (Russian actress Olga Dihovichnaya - House Of Others, Two Days), Hugh Derry (English actor Ariyon Bakare - Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Jupiter Ascending) that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars the red planet. As the crew begins to conduct research, their methods end up having unintended consequences and the life form proves more intelligent than anyone ever expected.Overall Life is an alright space sci-fi film filled with science, aliens, technology, space shuttles, the atmosphere in outer space, some violence, on the edge of your seat stuff, some close shaves or calls, some odd bizarre moments, sadness, tragedy, team work, togetherness, space suits and other things throughout the film.So I will give Life an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Life is worth seeing if you like space sci-fi films like Gravity, the Aliens films, Prometheus, Interstellar, the Predator films, Apollo 13 amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Life in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A modern day doppleganger to 1979's Alien,"Life is not going to be this generation's ""Alien"" (especially when we have another one coming out this summer) but I will say it is probably one of the best movies that repeat the old formula of Alien.Director Daniel Espinosa of Safehouse and the writers of Deadpool, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick give a fresh and grounded take on the old monster-on-a-spaceship formula. Imagine 1979's Alien but set closer to the present with the realistic NASA science and technology seen in 2013's Gravity. Seeing the film's events take place in these zero-gravity compartments with close quarter rooms creates a claustrophobic effect while still being stunning to look at. Espinosa creates an amazingly long opening one-shot sequence that shows how large the ship is while introducing the characters but also showing how tight and confined they are within it. Also expect to hear a big nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey in the opening score.The characters work as these great personalities with whom you develop some fondness over. No one is an antagonist or a selfish jerk but serve as real people who become desperate in a situation they are unprepared for. While Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson are decent in their roles, the supporting cast members like Olga Dihovichnaya and especially Ariyon Bakare were the real standouts of this film. Bakare's character as the scientist Hugh who develops a fondness for the creature at the start was really the most compelling and complex character out of the entire crew.But the best character is the monster of the movie nicknamed ""Calvin"". While the lifeform's design is not as original as compared to the classic Xenomorph, its personality, and intelligence makes it scarily unpredictable. When Calvin ""awakens"", it starts as something innocent and almost cute. But once it feels like it is threatened, Calvin goes on the offensive and evolves to become a more formidable and deadly being. The creature's methods of killing are disturbing and feel very malevolent and twisted.What throws me off from completely loving this movie is the final act. The first two acts are great because they are simple. Act one is discovering the lifeform and Act two is trying to kill it. But Act three becomes overly complicated without being properly setup and leads to problematic decision-making. And the way the film ends I was not a fan. The twist felt very cynical and depressing while still being very easy to predict. I enjoy certain twist endings like recently in Snowpiercer and 10 Cloverfield Lane because they elevate the story and themes. The ending this movie chooses felt like it was just there to be different without having anything to offer. In the end, it makes the efforts of the characters feel like a waste of time and progression.Life is not original by story-standards but knows how to capture the same moments of tension and suspense that made the first Alien film memorable along with great characters. While the ending is its biggest weakness, its strengths work to make this one of the more enjoyable sci fi movies in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but Could Have Been So Much Better,"A small team of astronauts on-board the International Space Station bite off more than they can chew when they are given the opportunity to analyze Mars soil samples. The samples hold the first incontrovertible proof of extraterrestrial life; made flesh by a multi-cellular organism they have dubbed Calvin. Among the crew are a mission leader (Dihovichnaya), a couple of pilots (Reynolds and Sanada), a biologist (Bakare), a doctor (Gyllenhaal) and a quarantine officer (Ferguson) all of whom find themselves at the mercy of the dangerous new life form which learns and grows with each encounter.If the plot sounds familiar its because Life takes the high-concept of Alien (1979) and boils it down to its absolute essence; that being a slasher film taking place in the void of deep space. In that regard the film aptly capitalizes on its nihilistic themes complete with a creature design that resembles something out of H.P. Lovecraft. Our cast dwindles, their hopes of survival constantly dashed by an escalating barrage of set-pieces as the suspense slowly shifts from whether they will survive to whether we will.The small ensemble cast does a worthwhile job with the characters their provided with. No one really gets an edge over the others, with the story using every moment of exposition dialogue to color their motivations. While it would have been nice if the movie had the economy of thought to translate that exposition into actual action, the downtime provided by people's bullet-point backgrounds actually provided a bit of breathing room.Yet given the fact that the film tries so hard to ground its story in reality instead of the far-flung future of the Alien franchise (1979-Present), its easy to assume or expect more to Life than a B-movie with a big budget. I mean the film is called Life, a title that positively pounces on the screen the moment Bakare's biologist character prods his protozoic organism out of hibernation. He later muses that Calvin ""may even provide life's meaning.,"" a grandiose statement that comes across as just plain goofy.The structure of the film really begins to strain as the film enters its third act. By then Calvin and the remaining crew are basically at the same IQ level, which is to say smart enough to open doors yet stupid enough to think hiding in a glass cage is a good idea. A last plot point is dropped, the results of which will either come across as blatant half-a**ed pot stirring or give less picky audience members reason to give off a collective shrug.That in conjunction with its chintzy, undeserved Twilight Zone (1959-1964)-esque twist sinks Life to the point of being a just another marginally entertaining sci-fi horror that's riding on the coattails of its much better predecessor. If it simply kept its head down and delivered on its pulpy premise, it could have gotten away with being a zero-gravity throwback. But since the film hints at something more then never delivers on the goods, Life might just go the way of Mission to Mars (2000) and Sphere (1998).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tense thriller reminiscent of Alien,"As faithful readers of the BankofMarquis Movie Reviews know, I am a sucker for ""Ten Little Indians"" style monster flicks.  You know...the kind of flick where a finite group of people are stranded in an isolated location and a monster (or an Alien) picks them off one by one until just one (or two) are left to battle the monster/Alien.  I even put out a TOP TEN list of these flicks a few years ago.LIFE, the new movie from Swedish Director Daniel Espinso (Safe House, Child 44), follows very nicely in  the footsteps of these films as it tells the story of 6 Astronauts on an International Space Station orbiting the Earth that encounter an Alien Life Form that will threaten the very existence of life on Earth unless they can figure out a way to stop them.This film could have been another ""pleasant enough for a rainy, grey Saturday afternoon sort of thing, but Espinosa did something interesting here, he cast some VERY strong actors in this movie and their work sets this standard monster movie just a slight notch above others in this genre.Jake Gylenhaal has become a ""mark of quality"" actor for me.  He just doesn't pick bad movies to be in and he doesn't give a bad performance.  Such is the case here.  His Dr. David Gordon is fraught with what Gylenhall usually brings to the table, quiet, confident quirkiness that is tinged with just an edge of uncertainty.  Add to this the ""charisma a go-go"" of Ryan Reynolds and the steady sincerity of Rebecca Ferguson and the core of this film is strong indeed.  Add to this an International cast of Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare and we have one of the strongest groups of ""cannon fodder"" that we have seen in a long, long time.But make no mistake, these films rise and fall on the Monster/Alien that is attacking and in Life, they have a darn good one.  Named ""Calvin"" this alien (like the one in ALIEN) starts small and continues to grow throughout the film to become a formidable, seemingly indestructible force.The effects work well enough (though you can tell, at times, that the Astronauts aren't floating but, rather, being pulled on wires) and I wish I could have told the Director to be more original in his ending, but all-in-all I was very entertained.I read somewhere that this film is being called the third ALIEN film.  I don't think so - that would be John Carpenter's THE THING.  But, if you wish to call LIFE the 4th Alien film, I would be fine with that.And so will you.Letter Grade:  Solid B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent sci-fi/horror,"LIFE, which I gave a 7 out of 10, fits right between 6-and-under ""crap"" and 8-and-above ""excellent."" LIFE is par for the course for sci-fi/horror. Doesn't bring much new but doesn't trip up too terribly badly. Acting, cinematography, and directing were mostly solid. There were a couple nice shots, but also some cribbed from Gravity. CGI was a little spotty in parts and the music was just for backround ambience.Couple things I wish were better:Although the acting was good, and I'm a fan of all the actors, I never felt like these were real people on board the ISS and I certainly didn't feel like they were scientists. There's also a lot of ""seal the air lock door before the air escapes and we're doomed if the air escapes""-type dialogue instead of ""seal bay 1138 before depressurization and increase to .3-make that .4-on outer O-ring imepedance."" I'm just making that up, but it would have been nice to hear more science jargon instead of Hollywood dialogue.They had sound fx in the vacuum of space.Like a lot of average sci fi and horror movies, there were quite a few times when you go, ""ahhhh, don't do *that* thing! It's so stupid!"" Never really rose above that to be clever or refreshingly new, but the movie was executed well enough not to be complete nonsense.So it lands at a semi-wobbly 7 out of 10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's like slasher movie in space setting,"Life takes my interest due to the usual premise but there are A-star Hollywood actors in the cast list. What makes it so good? Upon watching up until the 30 minutes or so mark, the movie only reminds me of a slasher flick with space context, no additional comment. But, at least this movie invent new villain unlike Jason X.Honestly, by the time demise happens, some of their actions are laughable, because the only argument lies in the ""protocol"" and there are no exploration of the space station, the true nature of the thing, the raw problem solving, and others elements that make me gain interest to the movie. I believe other sci-fi movies trying to give lots of technical procedures to make us enchanted, this movie follows pretty much the same, instead they don't make it real catchy/smart. You'll going to remember stupid actions by targets in slasher flick are comparable with this movie. The only thing that makes me keep watching this movie is to know whether the ending or the climax will be similar like slasher movies.The actors in the movie also don't have many scenes to show their acting, however some of them fall flat and just makes the buildups using backstories and so on went off. Is it the direction they are going? If yes, I feel this movie is too prolonged on telling the stories that never going to be used. It's like a slasher though, how many times you told this family is so lovely and attached, they die and it's over.The only thing that I like is the ending that so different than many sci-fi horror films, it is brave to be that unconventional. Since this movie doesn't attract me in the first place, the ending just makes a nice touch to make me think ""Okay, you just redeem yourself.

Alien meets Gravity...sort of...,"Daniel Espinosa (Child 44, Safe House) gave us his best effort yet in his space horror thriller which is a thrill ride executed very well.Overall setup is pretty much already known and used before multiple times. Space station - alien life. Like many others that are mentioning this, I too must point out that it is easy to see the resemblance with ""Alien"" but still ""Life"" offers something fresh and new. It is never boring and you are at the edge of your seat throughout the most of the movies' light hour and 43 minutes run-time. Jake Gyllenhaal gives yet another fantastic performance but the supporting cast does an above average job (especially Rebecca Ferguson). Visually it was done very good (with scenes that were resembling ""Gravity"") and I think that the design of an alien form was done superb. There were some creative ideas concerning death scenes as well which is always a welcome surprise. Still, there have been some moments where I was afraid that scenario is going to become a little bit cheesy but luckily that never completely happened (which can't be said for aforementioned ""Gravity"").With that being said, it probably won't be anyone's best movie of the year but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it.

Great sci-fi horror,Life essentially takes the original Alien and transposes it into a current day setting for a tightly paced thriller that takes full advantage of the International Space Station setting for all the set pieces. It's got a couple of neat twists which aren't affected by their predictability and it's the rare example of the bleakest ending also being the most satisfying one. It's only original in the literal sense yet still the sort of thing Sony should prioritise over Madame Web and Morbius.The characters are generically likeable but it's up to the star studded cast to make them really work. Jake Gyllenhaal's natural intensity and endlessly expressive eyes do a lot of heavy lifting here and Ryan Reynolds is a reliably strong comic relief as well as getting some more dramatic material. Hiroyuki Sanada is always a welcome presence regardless of the thankless role he's given and Rebecca Ferguson does the Ellen Ripley role with tremendous stoicism.Daniel Espinosa's direction uses the biggest creative flourish straight away with the standout opening one take and everything after still has a solid amount of technical craft. Every set piece finds something new to do whilst being suitably tense and the CGI is convincing enough to make Calvin as threatening as possible for a CGI creature. Jon Ekstrand's score is ominous and grandiose even as it gets suspiciously close to other people's work.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good thriller and a horrible SciFi,"If you love scifi movies you probably won't like this picture. But if you love thrillers you'll definitely enjoy it.

Underrated movie!,I had never been a big fan of the Alien movies as I found them to be a little to sci-fi for my tastes. This movie is an awesome bridge for people looking for an alien space horror film that is believable enough to be both extremely entertaining and frightening!With the bill of cast the acting as expected is excellent. They do a great job building a team feeling with an undertone of frustrations that one would imagine a duration in space would cause.I never have been a fan of sequels and I'm not entirely sure how they would spin a Life 2 but if they did I would certainly tune in!,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An average alien movie with some highlights,"Life is like most of alien-themed movies from the last 20 years. There's a space station, there's people with interesting backstories and there's... well, the alien in one way or another. I'm sure you can expect where the plot leads. I think that it's unoriginal, but it's well written and it works, so I can't complain.Also there's the cast. The cast is good: some known faces, some non so popular, but there's a lot of talented people, and it shows. This combined with a lot of moments that make you feel unconformable, not scared but a bit uneasy, make the movie good to watch.The problem I have with this movie is that is really forgettable. Nothing really stands out, there's nothing innovative. It's like one of this sagas that keep using the same formula over and over again, with the difference that this movie comes out of nowhere.I can't give it a bad rating because is not a bad movie, but isn't that good either. My recommendation is to just skip it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Like Alien, except not at all","Alien was a dark and suspenseful sci-fi horror movie that built on strong characters that felt unique to themselves, and slow building tension that gradually feeds your anxiety. It was a masterpiece. This is not Alien. But, it wasn't horrible by any means.What went right?The actors. They did a great job casting this. Rebecca Ferguson is amazing in pretty much everything she does. The rest of the cast follows step by bringing in solid performances. Really, I can't think of a single person that did a bad job with the material.It's fun and pretty fast moving. I never really got bored because everything moved pretty quick. You didn't really need to put a lot of thought into it, so it made for just a fun romp.The ending was cool. Not gonna spoil anything. And it isn't really anything that you don't see coming. But the final three scenes jumping between the two characters was well done and enjoyable.What went wrong?The people are dumb. All of them. These people are supposed to be smart, but everything that happens, does so because of stupid decisions made by scientists. Really, the movie could have ended at any time in the first one and a half acts if any character made one good decision.It was over-lit. There was no suspense because you literally see the creature so early on. And because it is CGI, the brightness of the scenes makes it look like a cartoon at times. The creature was cool looking. I am not trying to take anything away from that. But because you can always clearly see it, you lose that suspense that was so prevalent with the use of shadows in Alien.It doesn't really build. Sure, the creature itself gets bigger. And they say it gets smarter. But the energy is pretty constant. Once the creature starts killing people, it is just the team running (floating?) from the creature into different areas of the space station.All the characters are pretty much the same. Doctor is the same person as mechanic, is the same person as scientist, is the same person as other doctor. You don't really get a huge backstory on anyone except that one's wife just had a baby. None of them have an individual personality that really stands out. They all basically just want the same thing and they all get along... but in the same way you get along with yourself. There is no reason not to get along because they all react the same exact way to everything.They could have spent more time explaining the creature. It would have been interesting at least. Seems like they just rushed to get to the killings.So, while it may look like a disliked it, I have to say that I did enjoy it. Sure, compared to something like Alien, it is going to be garbage. It's not good in that way. But it is still a very fun watch. Like if Alien was made by Michael Bay. Yeah, that movie would be objectively bad. It wouldn't be a good movie. But, and hear me out, it would be so much fun to watch. This is like that. Like Deep Blue Sea with a floaty starfish alien. They rush to the action and just keep it flat. But, it keeps you entertained and watching. For all the bad, I still give it a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another disappointment, the movie never really left the space station. I'll make some comparisons to really successful space movies - Alien, Interstellar, Gravity. Those movies at least took the viewers out of the cabin into space, and they took time to develop characters. The theme of smart alien life out of control was a relentless pounding on the senses. Better to lighten up on the viewer periodically, and then start the pounding again. Gee, this could have been really good.

Life (7/10),"The outer space setting for a horror/sci-fi film was a common theme in 2017, notably Alien Covenant and Life. Seeing the influence, the original Alien had on Life is as plain as day. This aspect knocks down Life's originality pegs somewhat and leaves the story-line very predictable especially at the very end. However, Life has a couple film aspects that were great to see on screen. First, this was truly an all-star cast lifted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. Second, the monster's CGI was excellent, and its own origins and development are interesting to the story.
As a whole, the storyline and editing where managed with precision and made the movie very fluid and go by fast. It'll be exciting what to see Daniel Espinosa has for the future after his first big budget film he successfully managed.

I got more or less what I expected from Life and that was good enough for me,"A team of scientists discover a rapidly evolving species on Mars and bring it aboard their International Space Station in order to study it. Things quickly get out of hand when this 'being' manages to break free from its isolation chamber and begins to hunt the crew down one by one.Life borrows from a great number of films, but it's clearly most heavily influenced by Alien. This in itself doesn't make it a bad film - although on the same note it's also far too safe, predictable and by-the-numbers to be considered as a great work of art. To its credit though once the 'being' escapes the film does become relatively entertaining and the idea of the being picking the scientists off one by one does give the film some intensity - director Daniel Espinosa uses the isolated setting well giving the film a real claustrophobic feel to it - anyone think he's watched the original Alien film on a number of occasions?As entertaining and enjoyable as Life is to watch it does have certain issues such as poorly developed characters who we don't really learn much about. Naturally this leaves them as merely fodder for the creature rather than people we can actually care about. You'll also have to endure the usual rigmarole of characters making dumb decisions which seem to happen to get the pulse racing as opposed to these decisions being based on logic for example.Overall then there is some good and some bad here, but I expected an entertaining and enjoyable Alien style knock off and that's pretty much what I got.

Another lifeless addition to an almost dead genre,"Life is the newest horror sci-fi inspired by Alien (1979), it is pretty fun, has a great cast, some action scenes are very well directed, but the problem is: Life has absolutely no reason to exist.It doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before in Alien, Gravity, or any other great science-fiction. It's predictable, uninspired and completely devoid of compelling characters. I mean, it's not a bad movie. You'll probably gonna have plenty of fun watching it, but it could've been so much better, and there are so many better movies of the same genre out there, that you are left with almost no reason to watch it.But if you're still interested and just want some scares and exciting scenes, go for it. Although Life is not a memorable movie, its fast pace and terrifying villain will keep you entertained until the very end (which, believe me, you'll never see coming).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
so confused on what it wants to be.,"life,as in real life, life the movie is a story about major ""whats if's"". don't be fooled life is out there. but first things first. this movie is trying to be a new version of aliens or alien wanna be. its sci-fi. so i'd forgive it for the massive amount of actual plot holes it has. if you really like the leads and enjoy their work then by all means go watch the movie. acting from the main cast was good. horror movie this is not, as it lack in building that suspense, and we feel no fear from the creature. and the worst thing that did was give it a name. (when u give an alien a name you're humanizing it hence the fear of the unknown goes away) the gore factor is there but on par with pg rated movies. there is no back story to the characters so you really don't care about any of the crew as they have no connection to you the audience are, on two characters in the movie, well lets just say that they wouldn't be allowed in a high priority mission like this.all in all a lot of missed opportunities. i give it a 1 out 10 but then again that wouldn't be fair because there are movies out there like passengers. which i gave 1 out of 10, so i'll give this a 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wasted Potential,"The cast was great with what they were given. The first and second acts had me intrigued, but sometime after that first hour, things really began to derail for Life. The direction is certainly a problem for this film, which had all the essential components of a great flick, but ends up being a rental at best when you've exhausted all of your other options.The movie tried to be Alien, but ends up being closer to Prometheus by falling into the same traps. It fails to capture what made the original Alien franchise so interesting. The dialogue is lacking in many ways. The characters, while well acted, lack anything that makes them interesting. It even falls prey to old tropes about scientists in film.I think the greatest tragedy of this film is Calvin itself. This life form seemingly has no weaknesses at all. Even in Alien, there was this overlying sense of hope that the Xenomorph could be beaten. In Life, we are presented with the unbeatable. The unstoppable force, and while this can sometimes translate well in literature and comic books, it does not make for an entertaining watch.Final score 6/10. It's watchable. it has a few moments. But you are likely to forget it exists within hours of watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The last thing we want to find in space is life.,"...and this movie follows that thinking. With any luck at all we won't find anything alive or even remotely alive if and when we journey into space. All the touchy feely ""we're not alone"" nonsense that seems to be driving most of our near and deep space exploration is incredibly stupid and dangerous. What we want to find in space is WEALTH. Wealth with no strings attached. That's what I believe anyway.So the trajectory of the story line here is very gratifying to me. Starts out with all the warm and fuzzy universal love and then..... Ha! See? I told you so.I think of it more as a cautionary tale rather than simply another space monster movie. And that is very different than the Alien franchise. It's really more like the wonderful Twilight Zone episode ""To Serve Man"". Both accentuate a fundamental truth, humans are basically stupid.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watchable,"Is it the best film ever made... no. Is it the worst film... no. It is however, a watchable sci-fi ditty. Though the characters may lack a little depth, the acting is fair enough and the plot is reasonable. Yes, there's flaws, but it's sci-fi, you're allowed flaws. You're always going to get nerds dissing films like this, but I didn't feel that it was and hour and fifty minutes wasted.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
not a straight horror but still worth picking up,"Now that I have seen this science-fiction horror I do understand the low ratings. I mean, for me it wasn't that bad after all but it surely isn't an Alien look-a-like. Not that it has to be but by which I mean. There is action between the crew and the creature but there's more in the story then pure horror.By doing so you move away from a scary flick into a deeper story all about love and friendship. But look, I don't want to be negative. It is still worth picking up because the creature from Mars is still a nasty one. The strength of Life lays in the fact that all characters do have a leading role and that some die rather quickly. It's a new way of making films or series these days, Just look at Game Of Thrones or The Walking Dead, they do the same. But mentioning both series, they do offer gore and horror and a lot of red stuff.Life doesn't do that but the effects are also stunning. For example blood do moves strangely out of bodies, weightless remember in space.I liked it and the ending is indeed super even as I thought this could happen, it simply did. Worth seeing for the creature and the 'space' effects.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Science Fiction Flick,"The invasion of the 1's and 2's rating this movie is unbelievable. I thought it was a great film - lots of tense moments, great acting, excellent direction and a terrific script. It kept me on the edge of my seat and by letting my mind wander I was totally engrossed. Thanks for making a science fiction movie that kept me entertained - something I see less and less of these days. BTW some excellent effects also.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
