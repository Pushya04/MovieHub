Every positive word written about this movie is absolutely true,"I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.Sebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian, dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma, he's the best German-speaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie, Ulrich Mühe as the State Security (Stasi) agent whose task it is to monitor Koch's suspiciously free thinking playwright, brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted (something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn't have to rethink my opinion of). Weisler reveals himself as a lonely, isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of near-adoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman (Koch) doesn't even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie, which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.As I said, without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan's Labyrinth, this one really did deserve it's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A wonderful film that deserves a wide audience,"I saw this film in its North American premiere in a packed theater at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival this past week and was pleased to be part of a standing ovation at the end for the director and star, who were both on hand.""The Lives of Others,"" set in East Germany not long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, tells the moving story of a police investigator forced to confront himself and the work he does. In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie's characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.This is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.Ulrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film. Some have compared ""The Lives of Others"" to Coppola's ""The Conversation"" but the two have completely different story arcs and are only superficially similar.Both my companion and I felt this was our favorite of the six films we had a chance to see at the festival.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstandingly great movie,"I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany, inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall, there are many Stasi, 90,000, overseeing the populace, aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted (threats to children and loved ones) and a few obliged voluntarily.What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.First is Georg Dreyman, a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch, a tall,handsome actor dressed in writerly rumple, shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and exists within the strictures of the state-sponsored theatre. He is a decent man, and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.For reasons that become quite clear, Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd Wiesler,(Ulrich Mühe). Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence, dressed in gray, he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes, the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a non-descript arborited apartment, much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.And he is in a dilemma now, as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding, it was the only one possible.A must see, I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best film in years,"After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth, I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film, let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.Putting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.In summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you'll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You'll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.10 out of 10 is too modest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent,"I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent and moving dealing with GDR history,"East Berlin, November 1984. Five years before its downfall the GDR seeks to maintain its power with the help of a merciless system of control and observation. When Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz puts loyal Stasi-Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler on to the famous writer Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa Maria Sieland who is a famous actress herself, he expects career advancement for himself. For most important politicians are responsible for this ""operative act"".What Wiesler did not expect: the intimate view on the world of the ones he's observing changes the snitch as well. Looking at ""the life of the others"" makes him aware of the beggarliness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude. But the system can't be stopped anymore and a dangerous game, which destroys the love of Christa Maria Sieland and Georg Dreymann and Wieslers present existence begins.Until the fall of the wall each of them has paid a big price. After that a whole new world begins.My personal opinion - though it doesn't count that much - is that this one a an absolute Must See. I can hardly remember such an intelligent and moving German movie especially not including the whole topic of GDR history and the dealing with it. I think this is the first German movie which shows this system as it used to be (which has been confirmed by several contemporary witnesses) and not turns it and its people into comedy though there have been several good ones, of course.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A German Expat Feels his first pang of forlorn German patriotism,"This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The globe's best . . .,"""Who knows the secrets of the human heart?"" Col in The Crying GameWhenI saw 2006's Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan's Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe's best film of the year, no argument.Lives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It's set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall's fall and Gorbachev's ""glasnost"" and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler's List and Serg Lopez in Pan's Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists' lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others' lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It's rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here's looking at you, best film of the year.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Valid story from the Communist era,"The story presents an era of total surveillance where anything not in line with the will of the party leaders is punished. Arguments do not exist, just the use of power. I think the story is valid. However it only reflects how people from the West can imagine, interpret and understand life in East Germany. During watching this film I had ambivalent feelings. Ulrich Mühe's performance really gives an authentic example of a Stasi officer and gives us a real feeling what the totalitarian system means. However I think the film lacks authenticity in some sense. Only those feel this subtle lack who have lived in an Easter European country. As a verification I guessed which actor has grown up in East Germany and which not. Then I checked their biographies that 90% confirmed my guesses. Those who have not grown up in East Germany only act. Those who lived in the totalitarian system really give us the authenticity. In summary, I think this is a very good film and the only I know of that exposes the surveillance of totalitarian systems. The performance of Ulrich Mühe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler alone make this film worth seeing. For those who might be interested in the topic I recommend reading the book Celestial Harmonies: A Novel from Péter Esterházy and its second part (Celestial Harmonies: A Novel (P.S.)). In film you could watch any film from Krzysztof Kieslowski, Péter Gothár or Péter Bacsó.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great story and screenplay with less of the usual scene montages,"The story unravels nicely although a bit too slow for my taste. Yet I really like how the opening exposes the meticulous practice of the Stasi. The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice. I like how Ulrich Muhe played the calm yet meticulous and then the affected version of Wiesler. Martina Gedeck also shows a good performance and went total on this movie. Sebastian Koch does well in completing this movie with his performance of quite an undecided character.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I didn't fall for them.....,"Memories of the 70's and 80's visits in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) flood my mind while watching this film. Some are revolting, some comical and others are frightening. As a student of German, I visited the GDR several times to see pen pal friends. I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many ""IM's"" (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.I visited a representative of a magazine for western countries about the GDR and spent one memorable weekend sightseeing with her. Near the end of my visit, she asked me if I would work for them regularly by writing my opinion of ""GDR Review"" and its suitability for readers in the West. I would be paid in GDR money to use during further visits. After politely refusing this ""offer"" (""The police at home might not like it!""), I always had a sneaking suspicion that that was an attempt by the Stasi to recruit me.Years later I applied to see my ""Stasi File"". I will never forget the feeling deep inside me when I read in it: ""..is not suitable for our use due to his apparent connection to the police in his homeland."" The beautiful, friendly lady in Dresden had been a Stasi informer all the time! All of my visits to the GDR and the people I visited were listed in that file. For me ""The Lives of Others"" is an authentic representation of that totalitarian state. I am glad that those times have ended.Congratulations on a well deserved Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters' psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.In this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we're getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.A must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most underrated film of 2006.,"Holy cow! What a terrific movie! I am a voting member of the Academy (actor's branch) so I get all the films for free. I've seen everything---60 films.

"A Quiet, Meticulous, Well-Made Thriller","In the very first minutes of The Lives of Others, the unassuming Captain Gerd Wiesler (Muhe) sits in a small office interrogating a prisoner of the East German Stasi. He records his progress on tape and within hours Wiesler exhausts his prisoner to the point of confession, The tape stops; Wiesler is in a classroom teaching pupils at the university how to do the same. Within those first minutes we get a strong impression of his character; calculated, reserved and above all meticulous. It's those traits along with his dedication to Communism that make him a perfect surveillance man, at least according to Grubitz (Tukur) his supervisor.After attending a show by the popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), Wiesler and Grubitz take an interest in the internationally acclaimed artist. A nationalist, a pro-Communist and loyal to the government; he must be up to no good figures the curious Wiesler. With the coaxing of the Minister of Culture (Thieme), Wiesler sets up a surveillance operation in the attic of Dreyman's apartment complex and places bugs throughout his abode. It is only after weeks of listening does Wiesler realize the Minister has an interest in Dreyman's mistress Christa (Gedeck). Grubitz sees room for advancement if they manage to find dirt on the playwright but Wiesler becomes enveloped in the complex and intriguing lives of Dreyman and Christa. Wiesler even starts to participate quietly in the shadows, making decisions that could change the fate of all involved forever.The essence of The Lives of Others script is essentially political. The workings of the Stasi serve its own self-survival by becoming a tool of Ministers and party elites. What matters more isn't the innocence or guilt of those who commit crimes against the State but whether those under suspicion have the political clout to protect themselves. Those who don't have two remedies, arrest or suicide. It is in-fact a suicide that initiates Dreyman's disillusionment with the entire system and kicks the torrent of dramatics into high gear. That and Christa's abusive relationship with the Minister.Yet there's something much deeper and beautiful about the story than merely being a manifesto against big brother. The acting is so nuanced and superb that the characters become the focal point of audience emotional investment and story tension. Ulrich Muhe especially deserves praise as a foil to Sebastian Koch's Dreyman. Both become disillusioned but for opposite reasons. While Dreyman starts seeing the forest through the trees sort to speak, Wiesler starts seeing people as people instead of abstractions or obstacles of a Communist ideal.There was much ado about The Lives of Others winning Best Foreign Language film at the Academy Awards over the heavy favorite Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Both are beautifully rendered political parables with tenacious emotional strength yet while one has a sense of exhaustive grandeur and filigree, the other is muted, meticulous, and pensive in its plotting. While some may balk at the thought of a reticent thriller, The Lives of Others uses its less ostentatious style to its advantage as evidenced by the dark green mis en scene of Stasi HQ, the faded warmth of Dreyman's apartment and the sooty grays of the attic where Wiesler quietly listens.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie but something's missing...,"The first scene is amazing : you're watching a STASI class, where an interrogatory is meticulously analyze and deconstructed with a scientific method : if the person calms down after a while, she's lying, if she tells the exact same story twice, she's guilty... After this introduction to the method, we're about to watch its application. But unfortunately, watching the live of the others without interfering their live isn't that easy. And the cold Stasi agent will share empathy for his future victims.The way the inhuman agent (greatly plays by Ulrich Mühe) slowly becomes an anonymous hero ( he'll stay a serial number to the end, hidden in the shadows of more brightly people) to the contact of passion, love and art (music, theater and literature), symbolized by the couple he's suppose to watch, is very convincing and greatly develops. The direction of the movie is sober and matured, the actor are all good, and the script is clever enough to give an impression of realism to the all story.For all this ""objectiv"" reasons, this movie is definitely a good movie, and you leave the theater with the impression of having watch a serious piece of art of quality. But still, you wondering... If it was so good, why haven't you really been moved by the story, why this indifference toward the characters, why have you watch it with so little passion ? Of course, the theme, the period and the atmosphere of the film appeals sobriety, it's voluntary made that way. Right, but still, you can't help having the impression that something is missing to this movie, that this lack of passion doesn't necessarily have to move from the characters to the spectators, that the description of a cold and sad age doesn't have to be manufactured that way.In fact, it's madness this film lacks : it's missing a surprising event that wakes the spectator from the monotony of a ""interesting"" feature. Of course, this could have broke the harmony and unity of the movie, and make another ""Black Book"" instead of a so ""well done"" piece of art, but at least, you wouldn't have the impression of watching a nearly scholar movie, made by a good student, who gives you everything you're waiting for in a German movie about the STASI setting in 1984, and doesn't really leave any room to surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truth is stranger than fiction,"Can you imagine a world where people are continuously spied on, where the police set up surveillance equipment in the attics, where even typewriters are registered and, in spite of this,a world accepting of refugees? I am not talking about science fiction. I am talking about real life, the real events that took place in East Germany before the Fall of the Wall.While I was watching 'The lives of others'I couldn't help comparing it to another film, 'Good Bye, Lenin'; both are widely applauded approaches to the recent history of East Germany. But I think one of them is definitely superior to the other; read on if you'd like to know which.Both films are German and were released more or less at the same time -around 2005- and they share factual accuracy and the atmosphere of that historical period, although the first one takes place mainly in the years before the Fall of the Wall and the second, in the years immediately after. Both films have a lot in common, such as an appealing theme, plausible dialogues, lots of moving scenes and convincing acting. In spite of sharing a common theme, they have different approaches, since 'The lives of others' shows the story of a playwright who is being spied on by 'the Party'. What is a cold relationship at the beginning of the story turns into sympathy, what seems love turns into treason, what should have been informing on somebody turns into respect and admiration. On the other hand, 'Good bye, Lenin!'is very innovative mainly because it has a large dose of comedy, which is remarkably powerful. When his mother suffers a heart attack and awakes from a coma seriously weakened, Alex, the main character has to pretend that nothing has changed, that East Berlin is the same as it was before the Fall of the Wall, because a great shock like that could cause her death, so there he goes doing the impossible to keep the 'status quo'. This situation leads to entertaining scenes and appealing dialogue. In addition, both films were recorded on set and on location -we can enjoy watching what Karl Marx Allee looked like almost thirty years ago.However, although both films portray our recent history very convincingly, I strongly recommend 'Good bye, Lenin!'because it is funny, moving and grabs your attention from the very first moment.

We all have something to hide.,"Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich Mühe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.For complex reasons, Wiesler is investigating a prominent couple-- Christa-Maria Sieland, a beautiful and talented actor (Martina Gedeck), and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) an accomplished author and playwright.Artists in East Germany were strictly controlled by the state. Some of them played an intricate cat-and-mouse game with the Stasi--going just far enough to attract notice, but not so far as to bring about arrest. The problem with the cat-and-mouse game was that the cats had very sharp teeth, which they didn't hesitate to use. Blacklisting was just one of the state's weapons--a single word from a high official and you never acted again, or your plays or music were never performed. Although both Christa-Maria and Georg have been careful and discrete, they haven't been careful and discrete enough to escape the Stasi's interest.The movie, although in color, looks as if it were shot in black and white. The mood and the locations are drab and muted. Obviously, the color reflects the political and social situation of the time. The camerwork and editing were outstanding. Every other aspect of the film is equally excellent, particularly the work of the supporting actors.Not only does this film represent a riveting thriller, but it provides a powerful political message. After you've seen The Lives of Others, you won't keep quiet when someone tells you ""I don't care if the government taps my phone; I've got nothing to hide.""This is an extraordinary film--well acted and directed, with a compelling plot and message. Das Leben der Anderen is the finest movie I've seen this year. It's definitely worth seeking out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exceptionally Good Movie,"I have no words to describe the beauty of this movie.... I am awestruck.

His portrayal of a stone-cold government- official-turned-soft-hearted-Being was almost unreal.

One word: Magnificent,"Before the Berlin Wall came down, the government was very interested in ""The Lives of Others,"" a brilliant 2006 German film directed and written by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.The story concerns a dramatist, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and his actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). As artists, they are revered by the party. In private, however, their politics are somewhat different, but they're careful to keep them quiet. The Minister of Culture isn't convinced of Dreyman's loyalty - in part because of his own interest in Christa, so he assigns an agent, Weisler (Ulrich Muhe), to spy on them. This entails wiring their apartment for sound, listening in 24/7, and providing reports to the Minister. Weisler becomes drawn into the lives of these two people and their friends, and therein lies the fascinating story.Poignant, occasionally funny, scary, and thought-provoking, ""The Lives of Others"" is a fantastic film about the human soul in the face of politics, bureaucracy, fear, and desensitization. The director captures the tension-filled, drab atmosphere of East Berlin. I found the ending especially emotionally powerful.The acting is wonderful. Muhe is great as a colorless puppet of the state, and Gedeck and Koch are excellent as the theatrical couple. The entire film is well cast and well acted.This film won 61 awards internationally and deserved every one. Its best foreign film Oscar came as a big surprise - until people saw the film.

Sonata for a Good Man,"This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the ""Shield and the Sword"" of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film ""Sonata for a Good Man"" is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"it's for me... and you, and everyone","A soulless Stasi agent goes about his work diligently and thoroughly, training fledgling agents in the various techniques required to strip their fellow citizens of their humanity. His life is disrupted when the humanity of one of the citizens under his surveillance seeps under his skin...This is a life-affirming piece, delicately and lovingly charting the journey of one man from joyless cog in the wheel of a tyrannical state system, to collaborator in a rebellion based on personal freedom and dignity. The setting is East Germany before the fall of the wall, but the message ripples out to all individuals who feel their society offers them a life less dignified than they deserve.I hesitate to say any more for fear of despoiling a cinematic experience you should come to unencumbered by the biases of any particular reviewer.

best German dramatic movie in years,"having had the joy - while not living in the old gdr itself - to have some ""accidental"" run ins with the good old stasi then, i found it awkward that a German director from the ""west"" would have the guts to take on the subject of this ""ministry of greyness"".writer/director florian henkell von donnersmarck (nice name for a teutonic director, me thinks, very fancy - makes you bang your heels) not only survived this bout of pretension which could have let him drowned in a swamp of reproaches and allegations about executing the ""justice of the winners"", but he transformed the tale into a story that can and will be understood anywhere in the world: a tale about power, treason and the almost anarchistic potency of emotions.while at the same time not falling into the trap of moralizing with a waving finger but showing us ""the system"" as an bureaucratic nightmare powered by - eventually - once even good intentioned human robots of socialist self-righteousness who actually destroy all real positive socialist impulses in the ones they plague, this film is - even if one disagrees with it's premises - probably the most important political drama coming out of Germany for years.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A conversation or two.,"Set primarily in the 80s, 'The Lives Of Others (2006)' tells the story of a writer who finds himself on the wrong side of the East German government via the man whom has been assigned to listen into his every word. The movie is interesting in that we're essentially watching someone watch someone. Each story can only exist within the context of the other, which leads to a complex and mature experience that touches on resonant themes of privacy, loneliness and personal freedom. The protagonist is a bit of a blank slate. However, as he slowly becomes more and more invested in the lives of those he monitors, he definitely undergoes a full character arc. The movie itself is often surprisingly suspenseful, brilliantly constructed to eek the most out of each potential moment of tension. Its main asset is, I suppose, its natural dramatic irony, which is used wonderfully throughout. Sometimes, the thing is a little too slow for its own good. It also has an extended denouement that seeps the life out of its otherwise superb climax. These final moments do provide a nice bit of closure but they mostly recycle old information and don't feel efficient at all. The decision to end on, essentially, a joke is questionable, too. Still, the piece is an entertaining and effective thriller overall. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
THX -1138--the German version and very tedious,"Remember Total Recall? The sci-fi movie about people who get memory implants? Looks like that just happened to the viewers of The Lives of Others (LOO) , who are now convinced they know all about the GDR.  It was always cloudy.  Everybody wore either a uniform or tasteful clothes in muted shades of gray, blue, or brown.  The streets were empty.  Only two kinds of people lived theredissident artists and police spies.  There was a major shortage of women.  Everyone spoke in a flat, lifeless way (flat and lifeless--in Berlin??).  Nobody ever wore red or put on ugly flowered polyester shirts, nor did they raise kids, go to bars, shop for cold cuts, play miniature golf, or listen to Elvis Presley.Of course, as soon as you think about this, you realize that the movie is not about a real country at all, but about one of those abstract, generic totalitarian dystopias1984 (Winston and Julia ratting on each other), Minority Report, bits of Star Wars (the slimy toad-monster molesting Princess Leah) and above all, THX 1138, with gray hairless people grimly marching along gray sunless corridors while security forces keep flawless records on everybody. In other words, LOO creates a montage of spliced, recycled images from sci-fi movies to implant a generic image of ""the totalitarian state"" in our minds as our ""memory"" of the GDR.If we accused the director of playing games with these images, he would probably respond disingenuously that he made a movie about a state of mind and not a historical documentary. Funny though how many people (to judge from the reviews) believe that now they know something about the GDR. Well, what's wrong with a false memory, as long as it's anti-communist?And on the subject of falsehoods, take a look at a little sleight of hand the director tries to pull:: 1) The protagonist is understandably unhappy about the suicide of his friend. 2) The GDR did stop publishing suicide statistics (actually even earlier than 1977, as is discussed in a 1972 Radio Free Europe research report that you can see online). 3) Before the GDR stopped publishing the figures, it had a very high rate, probably the second highest in Europe after Hungary. So far, so good, but now keep your eyes open as the rabbit is pulled out of the hat! So it logically follows that the communist regime caused the high suicide rate-- right? Wait a minute! This conclusion is a logical non sequitur and a misrepresentation of historical facts. The regions comprising the GDR (especially Saxony, Prussia, and Mecklenburg, with Brandenburg not far behind) already had some of the highest suicide rates in Europe as early as the period from the 1860s to the 1880s, when these data were first systematically made available. The rate in Saxony (think Dresden and Chemnitz) was consistently the highest in Europe throughout this period. But these historical and sociological facts might inconveniently interfere with the simple anti-communist message.Don't worry, I am not about to undertake the Herculean task of defending the GDRand indeed there was a lot not to like. But if you really want to know something about it, not just wallow in feel-good anti-Communism, see Goodbye, Lenin, an infinitely better movie than LOO. Two negative perspectives, but both of them more serious than LOO, are Jan Schutte's Abschied/Farewell: Brecht's Last Summer and Peter Kahane's The Architects, about a group of young urban planners. And try some GDR movies, many of which had a more critical and humorous edge than you might expect, such as Egon Gunther's Der Dritte, a comedy about a slatternly, feisty single mom and bus cleaner. Yes, ordinary working people actually existed, rode on buses, drank beer, ate cold cuts, went to jobs, raised kids, enjoyed sex, and stood up to their bosses (the chronic labor shortage allowed workers to be far less subservient at the workplace than the ""free"" and pathetically insecure American employee has to be). The subject of the relative autonomy and equality of women is way to big to get intoChrista-Maria's limp victim-hood was not typicalyou can check this out in Christel Lane's article on women in the GDR in Sociology, Volume 17, no. 4, November,1989.Bottom line on LOO: Don't believe everything you see; and you will see disappointingly little of the very attractive Sebastian Koch, whose talents are wasted in a glum and sexless part..",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent Film,I won't go into the plot.The film concerns East Germany during the eighties at it's most oppressive.The film is engrossing and so absorbing that I forgot I was reading subtitles all through it.Well worth the evening. The Lives of Others is what film is supposed to do which is to make one think about one's life and the society one is living in.I should say that the promotional poster is very misleading and I fear it will hurt this outstanding film.Those nude couples is absolutely not what this film is about.This is not some film about a group of self-absorbed adults jumping in and out of beds to put some excitement into their dull lives.This is a political film involving adults who are trying to live life freely in a very oppressive environment.The publicists should really re-think their promotional campaign.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Character development,"I have already found a lot of useful comments on this film, so my intention is not to repeat those comments. For me, this movie was really good, so I am a follower of the positive reviews I have read.What I would like to do, is comment on the negative reviews I have read about the character development, and in particular the role of Ulrich Muhe (Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler).A lot of people state that the transition from a very strict Stasi agent to the helpful 'friend' isn't realistic and human. When you look at how extremely strict and haunting the man was beforehand, he just couldn't turn into a good guy all of a sudden, they say.I disagree with that. When you look at it from a psychological point of view, it makes clear sense to me. It is very well known that just before a person admits his wrongdoing, he is at his most extreme in denying it! The more he is confronted with the fact that his methods are unethical, the more he will try to find arguments to defend his methods. A great example of this is the scene where the student in Wiesler's class comments on the brutal interrogations Wiesler has pulled off. Wiesler answers by saying that this is just the way things go in the DDR, and that the student better get used to that.Another example of why the transformation of Wiesler is so credible, is the fact that he hasn't got a life of his own. This is perfectly illustrated by the scenes in Wiesler's home. Every evening he returns to his home, finding it empty. He cooks (awefull) for himself and orders prostitutes to satisfy his sexual needs. In that particular scene he even asks the prostitute to stay longer. This illustrates even more how lonely the poor guy is. Also, this loneliness and 'lack of own life' perfectly illustrate the title of this movie. Wiesler doesn't have a life of his own, and therefore 'lives the life of others' when he's sitting in the attic listening to the lives that happen beneath him.A final argument for the credibility of the transition is the piano play Georg Dreyman plays after his good friend, the director and writer Albert Jerska, dies: 'die Sonate vom guten Menschen' or 'The sonata of good people'. This is the key moment for the transition. Wiesler then perfectly realizes that his work is pointless and unethical. That by doing it, he will never become a good man, and will never have a worthy life of his own. He is confronted with the rich life of the poets and artists, and discovers how beautiful a normal and free life can be. From that point on, he changes radically, and decides that he is no longer a part of an unethical, inhuman system. To me, this all perfectly fits.In my opinion this is one of the best movie in years. And I hope that I have offered clear arguments on why the transformation of Wiesler is not a wrong and unrealistic move, but instead a great enrichment of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Think Twice Before You Hand Over Too Much to Government,"The Cold War is the center of all this. We were guilty of allowing the division of Germany and the splitting of the city of Berlin. What transpired was a Soviet controlled city with as many informants as citizens (exaggeration, but not that great a one). Of course, the true journalist is going to be the first to go. Don't say anything against the government. The focuses of this film is a young author who has to keep a low profile, and a man who lives right next to him, whose job is to use heavy surveillance on him. Eventually, this man begins to realize the results of his actions and he tries to pull back his invasiveness. The scariest part of this film involves the tactics used to get confessions out of those singled out. Of course, when they can't get to the person, they threaten their wives and children.

Others' Lives,"I am a huge fan of German intellect. Their Philosophy. Their Literature. Their Science. One thing relating to the Germans that I am not that big a fan of is their entertainment. And my impression is mostly limited to the free television progammes they offer and honestly I get verily bored by those when I stay there.But with so much hype associated with this movie (being included in most of the top 10 lists of movies after 2000), I couldn't resist my curiosity and decided to go for it. I am so wrong about German movies. This one in particular is definitely one of the best movies I have seen.Before the Germany reunification, East Germany had this totalitarian government that was accused of infringing privacy of the citizens putting them into 24 hours surveillance to monitor any anti-government activities. The story involves an interrogation and surveillance specialist STASI (State Security) officer given a task of monitoring the life of a writer. But soon he discovers the misuse of power of the higher officials for personal benefit and his faith in the system withers down. And more he listens to the life of others he gets slowly absorbed in their lives living it with them. But the question was how far he could go?The direction is absorbing. The performance of the actors are fantastic. Remember 'The Green Mile'? This movie grips you like that one. It starts slow but becomes so engaging that it drags audience into the movie living with the actors. I was moved and intrigued with the dilemma each character was facing. I was living the lives of others.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Profound tale of morality.,"This is an absolutely fantastic film, with a very suitable soundtrack and great performances from the whole cast, which performs perfectly.Little things, like facial expressions, reactions, etc. are so important on the big screen, and are so difficult to get right. It says a lot for the talent on set that this film was an absolute joy to watch, especially as all these 'little things' were executed to perfection. As Wiesler grows to love his subjects, it is, of course, a gradual change, and Ulrich Muehe, with the help of a tender and fantastic script, pulls his character off so convincingly.What is very interesting about this film is the way in which it portrays West Germany. Von Donnersmarck has not directed a love-letter to the West; he portrays its faults just as he portrays those of the East, and of the Ministerium fuer Staatssicherheit (Stasi), and there are some very thought-provoking issues and ideas within the film.Ultimately, whether the right thing is done or not, a transformation occurs within the film, one for a more fulfilling existence. I'll leave you to decide whether or not it is for the better, but I truly believe that this film is an enriching experience for all who watch it. You really get the sense that the actors cared for the themes and issues that the film raised, and this can only ever make a film better.The film is not without tension, which is expertly tackled by fast editing and music, and not without sadness, loss, and pain. Characters are more deeply explored than you first realize, and, often, they are not so different. They are, after all, all socialists.Not often does one come across a classic film, one with just the right amount of classiness, messages, and imagery, amongst other things, and it is a genuine pleasure when one falls into your lap. Watch this film. I promise that you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You'll be watching it like the Stasi!,"Films like ""The Lives of Others"" don't come around very often, as the film industry is dominated by loud Hollywood blockbusters with no real substance (Helena Bonham Carter would agree with me :) this, an overlooked film because it's foreign and quieter than dominating films, deserves a much wider audience. Anyone could watch ""The Lives of Others"" and be touched and perhaps moved by the wonderful acting and deeply drawn out characters (unless you're under 5, but we'll let you off!)If you appreciate fine acting, this is a great film to watch. Because in foreign films you can't understand what they're saying (generally) I usually find it difficult to tell if they're acting well or not, but in ""The Lives of Others"" you can tell that they're delivery and performance is fantastic. Right down to the main characters walk! It also helps it to flesh out the wonderfully drawn characters. They're in-depth and you find yourself being emotionally attached to them as the Stasi man watching them! You increasingly want to see more of them making for truly compelling viewing!The directing also adds to how compelling the film is. It's very delicate and clever in the way he tries only to show the couple in the way Wiesler also sees them, so when his shift is over, we as an audience also stop seeing the family which helps us to understand how Wiesler is so compelled with their lives and also makes it exceedingly gripping! Although, I think that the directing could've afforded to be more intense than it was, but that's only a small flaw.The writing is incredibly intelligent and also gives you good insight to the split Germany before the Berlin wall came down. It's interesting and moving with a very touching ending. The screenplay also doesn't fear about delving deeply into the characters either. It's full of excellent characterisation and brings up some delicate themes in the correct manner.""The Lives of Others"" is a truly masterful film, every element that makes a classic film comes together perfectly.

Nests,"Regular readers of my comments know I go on and on about noir and folding. When I see these narrative techniques used, I often remark that the technique is wasted, because the film has no heft once it has charmed us into investing in it.Not so here. The thing we get from this is simple, the value of passion in art. We get it viscerally and it matters. The basic device is as usual, commitment to art as a commitment to a lover. We also get the common technique of mapping personal challenge into political challenge because you can ""show"" it.The folding here is complex. Our watcher in the story is literally a watcher. We are getting a film written by the filmmaker that features a play and ultimately a book by the main character. The watcher and writer have other watchers, and indeed the woman has other attention concerning performance. We have writing or performing (in life, in sex, piano, play...) at every fold. Its very tight in its construction and effective at what it sets out to do.Quite apart from that, its timeliness in the US is apt.

Even spies have a soul,"A Stasi trainer, Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), is ordered to place a famous play writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) under constant surveillance. The orders come from the highest echelons of the government, but Wiesler slowly begins to understand that the motives for them may not be as patriotic as they should. And at the same time the life of these two content souls begins to lure him in.Despite this film being just over a decade old, it feels much older. And in this case that works in the film's favour, giving it an authentic feel, like it could have happened right there and then. it gives the film weight, which is good, because Stasi and their human right violations are some of the darkest aspects of East German history. And yet, at the same time the film tries to shy away from black and white moralizing. Wiesler's character, despite being a high-ranking Stasi officer, is not a monster, does posses a soul and certainly has his sympathetic moments. This has apparently caused certain amount of controversy, some believing that Stasi and its legacy should be shown no mercy, no sympathy. Which seems uncomfortably harsh to me.Then again, I was only a few months old when the Berlin Wall came down. For me, this is history, something that happened in the distant past. It's funny for me to think that the events of this film took place when my parents were teenagers or young adults. The world has certainly changed since then.For me this film is more interesting than it is good. Certainly it's acted well and directing is superb, but it still seems more like a gateway into a subject, a conversation starter, rather than a great movie in its own right.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sonata for a Good Man,"In 1984, in East Germany, the popular actress addicted in pills Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) becomes the pivot of an investigation of the successful writer and her boyfriend and mate Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) by the secret police. The Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and former lover of Christa orders the ambitious Chief of Police Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to find evidences that Georg is not loyal to the party to get rid off him and stay with Christa, and the efficient agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to conduct surveillance on Georg's apartment. Wiesler does not find any evidence that could compromise Georg, until the day of his blacklisted friend and director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide. Georg decides to write an anonymous article to Der Spiegel about the hidden numbers of suicides in East Germany. However, Wiesler becomes fascinated with the lives and thoughts of George and Christa and covers his findings from his superiors.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is another powerful German movie, showing the repressing and corrupted system supported by fear in East Germany in times of Cold War. This movie is practically perfect: the screenplay and story are engaging, disclosing a triangle of love that causes a political surveillance of an innocent man based on several characters that are perfectly developed. The pace is neither slow nor fast but very adequate, and uses an awesome cinematography. Therefore the work of the director and writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is outstanding. The performances are top-notch, but the actor Ulrich Mühe is amazingly perfect, deserving an Oscar, and Martina Gedeck gives a great credibility to her abused character. I usually watch many movies , but ""Das Leben der Anderen"" is certainly among the best recent movies I have seen, if not the best. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Vida dos Outros"" (""The Life of the Others"")",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"1984, East Germany - Shield and Sword of the Party know everything","""The Lives of Others"", the 2007 very deserving Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Film is IMO, the best film of last year regardless of the country it was made in. It took its writer/director several years first to thoroughly research still very painful events of the recent German history, the ones that deal with infamous and evil STASI (State Secret Police) and how it infiltrated and affected almost every aspect of GDR life. Before the collapse of the Soviet system and its most ominous and infamous symbol, the wall in the end of the 80s, life in East Germany of 1984 had imitated art precisely like in the prophetic and terrifying George Orwell's novel. Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was ""Shield and Sword of the Party"" and its goal, ""To know everything"". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.I was shocked to find out that such astounding movie was a directorial debut of 33 years old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - so artistically impeccable this honest, human, horrifying, harrowing yet hopeful film is. The film makers had recreated successfully and precisely the 1980s with its dark suffocating atmosphere of constant abuse of individual privacy in the former German Democratic republic. The locations, the huge dominating gray apartment buildings of the big city where every wall seems to have the ears and the eyes , the old cars on the streets of East Berlin  everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically . As great as ""The Lives of Others is"", it would not have been the same without Ulrich Mühe, as Captain Gerd Wiesler, a highly skilled and efficient STASI officer and a loyal member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who spies on successful playwright and his actress girlfriend by the order of corrupted hypocritical member of the government. While listening to the Lives of Others, Wiesler's own life would change in the way he had never expected.Once you start watching the movie, you'll see how Ulrich Mühe effortlessly over towers every other performance on the screen, and they are all excellent. The real life of Ulrich Mühe could make a great and compelling movie and the script for ""The Lives of Others"" was written with him in mind. He was born, grew up, and became a famous actor in the Eastern Germany back in the late 70s of the last century. By the words of von Donnersmarck, STASI began spying on Mühe right after he had graduated from High School because STASI realized that he would be great even before he himself realized that. After German reunification, Mühe discovered evidence in his STASI file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theater, but also by his second wife, Jenny Gröllmann. This was denied by Gröllmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent Mühe from repeating the allegation in a book. Mühe's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was simple, ""I remembered"". Mühe passed away few months ago, in July 2007 due to stomach cancer at the age or 54, and when I read it, I felt emptiness - like a very good close friend has gone forever. His performance in the film ""The Lives of Others"" will live always as one of the best and most memorable given by any actor of the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An emotional drama...,"I remember when this came out it got quite a lot of critical acclaim. Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a 'must see' for me. I'm really glad I saw it, it's somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, it's in German with subtitles. For me, this isn't a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is East Germany in 1984, five years before the Berlin wall would fall. The East German people are constantly watched by the secret police, The Stasi. Anyone deemed to have strayed from the party line was arrested and interrogated. They could even end up in jail. When playwright, Georg Dreyman comes under the spotlight of the Stasi, at the behest of party official, Minister Bruno Hempf, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is assigned the case. Dreyman's apartment is bugged and Wiesler begins to listen to the comings and goings in the flat. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who has a big part to play in the events that unfold. As time goes by, Wiesler begins to empathise with those he's listening to. He realises that not everything has to be reported, to the extent that he even scales down the operation so he alone reports on the couple. He uses this position to protect them when Dreyman begins to do things the party really wouldn't like. I will leave my summary here so as not to be subjected to a 48 hour interrogation by them Spoiler Police.This is a very well made film, although I did find the surroundings very stark, but then again, I guess that's just realism. Great performances all round, particularly from Ulrich Mühe who played the rather serious Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler with great dignity. I thought Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as Christa-Maria Sieland were both superb. Ulrich Tukur did a good job as Wiesler's boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz, as did Thomas Thieme as the loathsome Minister Bruno Hempf.I was surprised how much emotion was brought out both in, and by, this film. In the end it becomes a very heart-warming story. The beginning, on the other hand, I found really hard to follow, but once it settled down it was much easier. It has a slow, deliberate pace, but I didn't find it a chore to watch. I did find it was a little long though, but the extra scenes at the end are a real pay-off. So, if you're not scared of subtitles, and you can spare 137 minutes, then this one comes highly RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 93,806 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93/100 (based on 150 reviews counted when this review was written).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Who's listening?,"It is rare to see a film that is so totally convincing as Das Leben der Anderen.The movie focuses on Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), and the wiretapping of Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a famed author, and actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).The whole film from the architecture to the furniture is beautifully bought to life.But much more than that is the sense of menace through the banal that the film draws you into.Extraordinary performances by all involved, wonderfully understated and suppressed and controlled, and the overall washed-out tones add to the surreality of a world whether you are either a listener or listened to.A perfect paranoia for all involved the film unfolds and builds with a tremendous sense of pace. For a film this long it is beautifully handled.Of course, the film is about the need for freedom, but that sells it way short; perhaps, it is more truthfully a film about good in unexpected places.Definitely deserves its Oscar: one of the outstanding films of German cinema, and for my money the best German film since Das Boot and Run Lola, Run.Hugely recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent insight into the Iron Curtain,"The suspicion of the Eastern Germany's Stasi and the depression inflicted on the creative intelligentsia is incredibly well-portrayed. Even though I remember the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and celebrating the joy of freedom and democracy, I had no real comprehension of the deceitfulness, suspicion, and depression that was so prevalent in Eastern Germany.This movie presents and excellent portrayal of how the weak were forced to sacrifice their morals, but it also The sacrifice of morals by the weak, but it also showed redeeming qualities of even some of the most despicable members of the Stasi.The unexpected ending of the movie is well worth the two hour and 15 minute wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Lives of Others - A Life Spent Watching Instead of Living,"The Lives of Others is a powerful drama about total surveillance, espionage, and the transformation of personal convictions under the weight of an oppressive system. The film presents the grim reality of East Germany in the 1980s, where anyone's private life could be scrutinized by the state at any moment.The protagonist, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, initially appears to be the perfect instrument of the regime. However, as he monitors playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, he begins to empathize with them, realizing how empty and meaningless his own existence has become. The film's central message is clear: a life spent spying on others is a life devoid of personal meaning.The plot is relatively simple, but its minimalism allows the audience to grapple with profound questions about power, morality, and the essence of human existence. The film raises timeless concerns: how far can state control go, and where is the line between duty and humanity?One of the film's greatest strengths is its outstanding performances. Ulrich Muhe delivers a deeply nuanced portrayal of Wiesler, brilliantly capturing his inner turmoil and gradual transformation from a devoted officer into a man capable of compassion.The Lives of Others leaves behind a haunting silence. It lacks dramatic twists, yet its atmosphere and masterful storytelling are deeply compelling. This is not just a film about politics-it is a film about people, about freedom, and about the price one must pay for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average espionage documentation and too long,I heard from my friend and from the press that DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN is a must see. I am surprised that it had such a great success inclusive the Oscar for the best foreign language movie. The story hits no doubt a very important theme of nowadays that let even me a little bit shocked at the end. The running time therefore is too long and some scenes too slow paced that could have been cut. The sceneries and the atmosphere took me really back at the end of the eighties years. The actors especially Ulrich Mühe did a great job. For all these reasons I give with my wife a solid 5/10. I think it's too overrated on this site. If you liked it I recommend the other German documentation DER UNTERGANG that is much more thrilling and not so boring as THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Sonate vom guten Menschen"" also made this reviewer dewy-eyed!","A deserving Oscar winner if ever there was one, though I was never one to pay special attention to the Oscars, I was almost shocked by how perfect this debut movie by a 34-year-old director very nearly was. Set in East Berlin in the mid-80s, some five years before the infamous Wall crumbled, it follows the STASI as they plot to find incriminating evidence against playwright Georg Dreyman, who'd been the regime's darling until a ruthless minister frivolously develops a lecherous desire to possess his girlfriend, renowned stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland. Though both Sebastian Koch (last seen by me as the Nazi Captain Müntze in Verhoeven's Black Book) and Martina Gedeck are excellent as the central couple trapped within the STASI's web of eavesdropping and paranoia tactics, the real hero and star of the movie is without a doubt Ulrich Mühe. I had last seen in Michael Haneke's Funny Games, where he played Georg, the unfortunate husband and dad who comes to a sticky end. In The Lives of Others, Mühe memorably fills the shoes of the STASI agent Gerd Wiesler who listened to Dreyman's daily life through the bugs in his flat. Balding, physically non-descript Wiesler conveys more with one subtle shift of an eyeball than the whole stellar cast of an Oliver Stone movie. This actor is so charismatic, he blows even the undeniably talented and handsome Sebastian Koch clear off the screen. In this movie not only are things seldom what they seem, but humanity and redemption can be found in the most ridiculously unexpected places.Shocking, humane and moving yet never predictable, heavy-handed or melodramatic, the movie is also blessed by a solid script, a very plausible storyline free of plot holes and an immaculately researched scenario. I've read that both the movie's director and Mühe remember their experiences living in the Communist regime. Though the former was still very young, he claims to clearly remember the climate of paranoia he grew up in, while Mühe later discovered that he had been spied upon by his own wife! Oddly enough, one accusation levelled against the movie by some IMDb reviewers is that of misogyny. Being normally very sensitive to a discriminatory portrayal of women, I was very baffled by this. I've come to the conclusion that some touchy viewers expect their movie characters  especially those of women or ethnic minorities  to be paragons of virtue or role models, rather than simply human beings with flaws and plausible weaknesses. In my view Christa-Maria's main sin was not to be ""weak"", as some other viewers here claim, but simply ""human"". If anything, the movie also provided a damning portrait of the brutality of the regime against women.Perhaps my only, very minor complaint with the movie was its ending, which felt a tad rushed - though it was a beautiful ending all the same - uplifting and sad, poetic and yet also grounded in the starkest reality.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A defining moment for a good man in the midst of corruption.,"While the credits begin to roll, and as Captain Wiesler's (Ulrich Müle) face - transformed by muted joy - fades to black, I pondered, for a long time, the sheer brilliance of this finely crafted narrative from an equally brilliant first-time writer/producer/director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.This film is positive proof that, for the most part, it is the story that makes or breaks. That's not to say this film is without flaw; but, I'll come to that below.Fade in starts in 1984 - a nicely ironic touch, I thought, given that the setting is the police state of the GDR  East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Wiesler is employed as an interrogator with the East German State Police, or Stasi. In the first few minutes, you witness his cold, calculated finesse in destroying a prisoner's claims of innocence. So also, you learn that Wielser is as cold as the state that produced him, perhaps colder than the concrete walls that house the hapless prisoners. Real joy is apparently beyond Wiesler's ken; his only smile is when he knows he's trapped his prisoner in a tissue of lies.His superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), knowing Wiesler's expertise, gives him a new task: dig up some dirt on one of the state's favorite sons  Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright and novelist of international repute who still manages to toe most of the Party line. Or does he?Grubitz, however, has a hidden agenda: he wants damaging evidence against Dreyman because his superior, the lecherous Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) lusts after Dreyman's girl friend, Christa-Maria (Martina Gedek), a well-known and acclaimed stage actress. Wiesler, initially unaware of that tangle, jumps at the chance because he knows such a high-profile case will help his career along. Or so he thinks...Hence, Dreyman's apartment is bugged and then monitored by Wiesler and his assistant, Udo (Charly Hübner), from a hidden loft at the top of the apartment block; and so 24/7, they begin to listen to the everyday lives of others. And, in doing so, something happens to Wiesler: he becomes interested, curious, inquiring, concerned and finally involved directly. Thus, his transformation from a cold automaton under state socialism into an engaged and sympathetic human being begins...and is, I think, also a metaphor for the transformation of the GDR later, when the Wall comes down.These are the times that I wish I knew German better. The sub-titles, however, are very good. Hence, don't be deterred: this is an unhurried story that is told with a minimum of words with the camera in medium close-up and close-up for much of the time, thus allowing the actors to let their emotions say what words often cannot.The plot itself is completely linear, each scene naturally following, so there is little chance of confusion for the viewer. Hence, when the tension comes, you're ready for it; when an ironic twist occurs  and there are many - you immediately know why, and either smile, cry or cringe; when tragedy strikes, you almost know it was going to happen anyway. But, it is at the end, when Dreyman and Wiesler both realize, at different times, the common thread that binds them irrevocably, that the full impact of the title hits: when you come to know the lives of others, you come to know yourself for who and what you are. So only the hardest of hearts will turn away from the thrill, the sheer joy, which lights up Wiesler's face as the final scene fades to black. That ironically beautiful ending, I'm sure, will be much discussed, debated and admired for years, if not generations, to come.As Wiesler, Ulrich Müle, with a striking resemblance to Anthony Hopkins, is simply outstanding; his performance is flawless. This is his movie, no question, despite the quality of the rest of the cast. Equally, the cinematography, direction and editing are first class. Moreover, it's quite obvious also that the production was not expensive, attesting to the fact you don't need a lot of money to craft a brilliant story and film. In that regard, the Cohen brothers' first film, Blood Simple (1984) comes to mind as a (lesser) comparison.And the flaw? Perhaps not so much a flaw as two narrative quirks: why was it relatively easy, in the Dreyman case, for Wiesler to throw off years of loyalty to the party and the state? Perhaps it was just the straw that broke the camel's back? And, while listening to others' lives, why does Wiesler go to the trouble of typing up a concurrent report summary instead of using tapes to record all the conversations and do the typing later? It seemed such a backward step, operationally, because he was so used to recording his interrogations of prisoners. I have some ideas, but I'll leave you to sort out your own.Some may complain about the length (137 min); others may yawn at what they consider to be unnecessary scenes. In my opinion, however, there's not a wasted shot, frame or scene: this is filming and story telling at its best, and deservedly won the Academy Award 2007 for Best Foreign Film.As a final point, this story is  perhaps unintentionally - also an obvious and timely warning about the excesses that any state, regardless of politics, can initiate and maintain in the name of national security.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Surely an Oscar for Germany for this somber ""feel-good""story","Germany has during the last few years produced a number of very worthwhile films that take stock of their somewhat chequered past. The incredible ""Untergang"" and the very funny ""Good Bye Lenin"" have to be the two most prominent ones. They have now been joined by the very classy ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others). It is a must see film for everyone, and especially those with an interest in our near history. It is this incredible to think that less than 20 years ago such totalitarian regimes existed all over Europe. It is even more disturbing to realise that they still exist in places today.Based around one surveillance case that offers many different takes on the same story ""Das Leben der Anderen"" brings home the totalitarian regime that was East Germany. It offers a great historical perspective while making you feel hope and joy. The acting is extremely good, it feels just as downplayed as I imagine life in the old DDR was. I don't imagine it will propel any of the actors to Hollowood greatness (many are already German acting veterans) but I really hope writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who also co-produced the film get his due credit.It would be liberating (pardon the pun) to see this film claim top hon ours for best international film instead of the usual line up of Almodovar or Kaurismäki.

Prime example of an Overrated Movie,"After watching the movie last night, I just couldn't fathom the reason why this movie is so venerated and awarded. At best its a passable account of life in the GDR serviced by a fairly decent script ruined by insipid and lifeless direction. Oh actually the script is also nothing home to write about.First the movie has absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever and each frame looks like it could be anywhere in Europe in the 50s, 60s or 2000s. Is the Stasi something to be feared? Yes we know that already but the movie never attempts to make you feel scared, or feel claustrophobic or paranoid of the environment in which everything you see or do is under the watch of some Big Brother. A key plot point of the movie brings in a comparison with Hungary. I happened to visit the the Hungarian equivalent of the Hohenschönhausen in Budapest and it made me quake in my boots when I saw the prisons there. The movie steers clear of any 'fearful' portrayal of the Stasi.Coming to the acting, Sebastian Koch as Dreyman maintains a one-note expression throughout the movie. You could never tell from his crinkly half grinning half squinting expression whether he's tense or happy or scared or what. As a result you never come to care about the predicaments of the central character. There are a couple of good performances by Ulrich Mühe as Weisler and Thomas Thieme as Minister Hempf but thats all there is to it.I couldn't really point out whether there was something wrong with the Script or the Direction in the end but ultimately it looks like it's a bit of both. A central character has a change of heart which is abrupt and I could never really point out why it occurred, considering how the initial introduction of the character was laid out. The last 10 minutes of the movie borders on the ridiculous when it spends undue amount of time to 'explain' everything that happened (or maybe Dreyman WAS stupid).All in all the movie was decent but nothing to be wowed over. When I learned that the Director of the movie also directed 'The Tourist' I was not in the least bit surprised.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But if I had a nit to pick, it would be the 'free thinking' and even more incongruously 'free acting' character - the playwright Georg Dreyman. *Truly* believing in the system whilst somehow being a dissident? That is a bit of doublethink that was impossible in the old Socialist world, even Orwell wouldn't have penned it.But otherwise marvellous film. Marvellous.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most overrated film of the latest Oscar.,"It is overrated because critics talked about a poignant masterpiece, and it ended up being just a well-done yet trivial political drama. When it gets to the Academy, I have quite a lot to talk about. In this highly personal review, I have to discuss the Oscar thoroughly, since ""The Lives of Others"" won the 2007 award for Best Foreign Language Film, in a monstrously unfair prize. Have I seen all the other contenders? No, but I've seen one, that being ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and the quality of it is so superior to this overrated German production that the latter should't have even been nominated beside the former.Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad movie. On the other side, all the buzz around it (the Academy Award, high scores at the IMDb site, superlative reviews) made me expect a flawless work of art, while this is just a good political drama. There are many average things in ""The Lives of Others"", enough to make it pretty much like a trivial movie. The screenplay has plenty of redundancies (the fingerprint, some over-explicative lines, the excessive ending), sign of a cowardice that aims for giving lazy audiences a circular, closed plot. Many explanations are passable, and most of them weaken the narrative, which could allow mystery and admittedly unanswered questions.Another problem is the lack of rhythm of director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck. The first hour is incredibly slow, focusing only in the spied couple, and, all of a sudden, things start to happen every minute, to maintain the grasp that wasn't achieved in the previous moments. Many of the plot twists are, as already cited, unnecessary, and some are pretty formulaic. For an example, the discovery of a character that knows about the wiretaps, and the encounter, where a plan unravels, is derivative from countless movies. Another case is that of Wiesler's trajectory: far from his unexplained fascination on Dreyman and Sieland, the big issue about his character is the ending. That kind of redemption is derivative as well, a huge copy of Hollywood's formula (here goes a hint for why the Academy gave the prize to the film)  and the last scene is so artificial that it almost ruins everything that was constructed until there.While formulaic, trivial and occasionally exaggerated, the screenplay has its assets. Other characters, especially Sieland and Dreyman, have much better conclusions (and the latter's one is the best turning point of the movie, and a strong moment). On the other side, the distinct issue that Georg discovers, because of his friend's death, is not an easy choice to facilitate his decision to publish a critical article. Some dialogs are brilliant, like Wiesler's second interrogatory, which makes an elegant connection with previous lines and delivers tension and even frustration. More tense moments are unevenly scattered throughout the projection, but work wonders, thanks to Donnersmack's good direction, whose highlight is the deft use of the sound: the score is not only distinct, but well-placed. Silences are blended with noisy moments or clean dialogs, and the cork scene is the most relevant one: it marks the time when Wiesler has heard too much.Wiesler hears all that he needs for his job, but it ends up being too much for his convictions. Something in him tells that the Stasi is wrong, and that Dreyman mustn't be stopped. Some part of him wants to save the couple from the closing menace, and the viewers are not given a straight reason. The best aspect of the screenplay is the unexplained motive, portraying, maybe, Wiesler's own doubt as to what makes him be so fond of those people. Mühe plays this role wonderfully, portraying the spy as a cold man at first (cold but not dead, since he is shown with a prostitute), without many emotions to show. Later, on the other side, his lack of expressions is used to hide feelings. Paradoxically, doubt and confusion are present in his blank face, as if he doesn't dare to feel anything before knowing what it is (the last scene, as bad as it is, confirms that), and that results in beautiful, long takes of his null expression.Stealing the show every time, Ulrich is the very best cast member, but the others do not disappoint. Koch portrays Dreyman as a great defender of the party in the beginning, but his intellectual mind manages to find, in a strong sentiment of loss, the wit and courage to criticize the system he used to defend, and, ultimately, leaves the doubt: was he just faking his support to Communism, or did he truly believe at its leaders at first? Actually, this asset is more of the screenplay than of the actor, whose work is adequate, never outstanding. In Sieland's role, Gedeck has some beautiful moments, as a woman whose loyalty is always tested, and whose choices are not always altruistic. Her ambiguity appears as strong as Dreyman's, and relates to his in an elegant way. Two other important characters, Paul (Hans-Uwe Bauer) and Albert (Volkmar Kleinert), have small roles (too small, let's say), but amuse because of the first's subtle irreverence and for the second's subtle melancholy.Had the screenplay tried to avoid stupid clichés, easy resolutions and over-explanation, this would have been a true comment-inducer. As it is, occasional assets cannot hide all the triviality that reigns over in the film. ""The Lives of Others"", curiously, was awarded for following some strict Hollywood rules, and not for being a respectfully distinct foreign film. It is just a good political drama, with some comment on the German History and decent character development. The Oscar shows again how intolerant it is, awarding a good movie while a truly masterpiece like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is put aside because of its daring format. The Academy proves that it doesn't praise originality, nor even quality, but adequacy to its prehistorical single-mindedness.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wondering why the hype?,"We saw this movie as it came highly recommended. Honestly, I struggled. Normally I'll watch anything German, just for practice in listening, but this was terribly slow. The plot was not involving. Perhaps it was a bold drama that made some statement, and if that is what one is looking for than look no further. If one is looking to be enlightened or entertained, look again.Now, regarding the dramatic look into GDR, what can I say? I am not German, but I am eastern European. My family lived on the other side of the wall and we had to be very careful until the wall came down. Even now, my relatives are careful amongst the party members. Still, they are happy proud people.I have also stayed in a hotel in Berlin that was very popular East German hotel amongst party elite. Those elite had far different lives. I think the grey look of the film was pointed and did remind me of the bunker buildings so common in the east. The film showed people who would have had bright lives, in contrast to the grey.As my girlfriend pointed out, it looked like a news report and not the perception we had from her east German friends nor my relations, so we didn't find it moving.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Stassi reigns supreme with the enlisted help of a multitude of informants such that no one can be trusted. One can easily imagine how North Americans have cause to worry if we continually give up our liberties for the sake of combating terrorism.It is also a movie that speaks to a European culture that is now forced to assimilate the old USSR bloc. We get new sympathy for the hell that the East Germans and for that matter the citizens of other totalitarian regimes had to endure.Yet, like in Schindler's List, the good in a man's heart ultimately triumphs. The juxtaposition of ""good man""/ ""bad man"" plays heavily throughout the film.Without any chase scene or over-the-top special effects, the film pulls off what is arguably the best thriller of the year. It is well-deserving of its Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Powerful human movie that everyone must see,"I'm a big fan of German movies, I always have a feeling of a very deep and human message that they can only understand and express. This movie might be about moral dilemmas, but does moral dilemmas really exists? Do we really have a difficult decision to make when we know what's always the right thing to do? This in my point of view is the real thread of the movie, moral choices. What's the right thing to do? To who we owe a good moral act? Can we be part of something that might be immoral and feel good about it? This movie is superb! The final line of the movie almost made me cry alone in my room. Very moving story, with great actors and a superb direction. I would watch this movie again and would definitely share it with a lot of people.

worth seeing but...,"First of all: Yes, it is a very interesting film and it is worth seeing. I think it is a good start for thinking about the DDR, I hope it is a start for ""Aufarbeitung"". There has not been a real discussion about what happened before 1989, yet.I am thankful that the film gives a kind of insight and an emotional impression. I doubt that most of the people would feel emotionally involved when reading a nonfictional book about the German Democratic Republic.There are a lot of things I could name which I liked about this film. Ulrich Mühe and Ulrich Tukur are great actors, I always enjoy watching Ulrich Mühe.I think some of the actors playing bit parts are really worth to keep in mind: Ralf Ehrlich who appears twice (he is the one who tells the joke about Honecker); Volker Michalowski who plays the expert for typewriters; Marie Gruber (she must be the one who plays the sad neighbour with the secret) and the prostitute... I cannot find the name of the actress at the IMDb.I believe other will emphasise what they do like about ""Das Leben der Anderen"" so I would like to write down what disappointed me. The soundtrack music was much too strong for my personal taste. This is the problem with most Hollywood films or films in Hollywood style: There is so much music in the foreground that it leaves no places for your own thoughts, ideas, impressions and feelings. Sometimes the music *dictates* what the viewer is supposed to feel and how he should react. To explain my problem I always give the example that in some scenes the viewer is simply forced to grab the next handkerchief. Most people might enjoy that, but I do like to *choose* how I feel when watching a scene. I want to be able to concentrate on how the actors deliver the scene, how it is put in pictures and everything else the is to notice beside that overwhelming music. Maybe you get an idea what I try to say.I do not want to be mean but I have to say... to the end of the film I had the impression I was watching a kind of ""Schindler's List"" about the DDR. (I won't explain that to Spielberg fans!!!)Still I do believe it is a start. I hope there are more films about that topic to follow!",,Anonymous,Mystery
How do you say 'overrated' in German,"This film is unquestionably well put together. It has all the elements in place, a good story, good actors, good directory of photography, good set design and good music. So how is it that this film is 'overrated'. Simply because it receives overly gracious marks being that it is a foreign language film. This film is quite comprable to ""good luck, good night"" or other past regime type thrillers. For it to be considered #55 on the IMDb list is too high in my mind. Is it one of the best 200 films of all time, perhaps, I would be forced to say yes, like most people because you just can't think of a better German movie, Run Lola Run was an fantastic and fun film but this is truly a piece of stern and forthright filmaking. If I have to rate the film it is a 7 of 10, losing points for it's somewhat lackluster pace and also for it's lack of humor and exciting events until the finale sequence, I hate to say a film is lacking anything because a story is a story and what it has in it, it has in it, but this film wouldn't have suffered from an exciting or pointed moment of tension if the middle of the film. I believe #55 is a little too high for this film to sit but it was overall a very solid film. (note these comments come after seeing the film 4 times)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Wall,"In 1984 East Berlin, an agent of the secret police (Ulrich Mühe), conducting surveillance on a writer (Sebastian Koch) and his lover (Martina Gedeck), finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.Apparently, this was one of the first post-Berlin Wall films to be a drama rather than a comedy (such as Wolfgang Becker's ""Good Bye, Lenin!""). Certainly the best, if not the first. Today it is somewhat hard to imagine that not long ago Germany was split, with two sides spying on each other, when they were really one people under two governments.Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, describing it as ""a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires.""

An interesting character study with excellent performances.,"West German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted an engaging drama in The Lives Of Others, his first feature film. At the center of this film is the impressive performance by Ulrich Muhe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, an officer of the Stasi. Wiesler is an efficient and loyal employee who goes through changes he didn't expect. After listening in on Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), two fine artists whose lifestyle is different from his he begins to doubt his work. In addition to the excellent performances from the cast and Donnersmarck's effective direction the film is aided by Hagen Bogdanski's expert cinematography. Some reviewers stressed the feeling of paranoia in The Lives Of Others but my opinion is that instead the film amplifies the relationships that all people have every day. By picking these characters Donnersmarck stresses humanity. This approach leads to a satisfying emotional ending. While The Lives Of Others is a very good piece of filmmaking it's certainly not a history lesson. The German Democratic Republic was perhaps the state with the most surveillance in the Eastern Bloc but even there there were only a few Wieslers and personal or even erotic motifs played a somewhat subordinate role in the musty atmosphere of East German socialism. The film is not an accurate presentation of life in the Eastern Bloc, and it was intentionally made to look gray. Another factor is the film's Best Picture win at the 2006 Academy Awards, which by the way is a tentacle of American propaganda. The film that should have won was Pan's Labyrinth, but instead The Lives Of Others was picked for ideological reasons. Despite these obvious flaws and problems The Lives Of Others is still one of the best German films of recent years, and internationally it grossed an impressive $77 million.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably the best film of 2006,"Even though The Departed may be judged by most to be more powerful and shocking, this film shocks but it also saddens, and then encourages the heart in a unique way that senses-bludgeoning films like The Departed cannot...in the inexorable and certain life-draining way that only stories detailing the harsh realities of a life without hope can do, and then which show a complete about face and tell the resulting story of total transformation and its effects on the same people. Always difficult to do, but was done with brilliance in this film.Most of this film was about people's unhappy lives without hope under Socialism, but then come the transformations, individual and national, that change everything. This film develops the story of dreary but threatening communist ""hope oppression"" better than any I can remember since the '50's film, ""1984"". Without hope to encourage us, what else is there to the real value of life?The very soulful and talented Urich Muhe(his features hint of Kevin Spacey) plays the role of a hardened national police captain who is the central screw on which the story turns, a totally committed socialist party cop who undergoes a complete, but not overtly joyful, change of heart that works to alter forever the fortunes of the story's foil, a writer/playwright of increasingly ""questionable"" political views who, as a result, becomes a central target of the Stasi, the national security police that was shown to be ubiquitous and all-powerful, and every bit as formidable and scary as the outrageously inhuman ""Big Brother"" that terrified citizens in ""1984"".Early on, Muhe played the police captain as a Jack Webb/Joe Friday-type cop.....humorless, cold, stiff and ruthlessly committed to doing the best but also the meanest job he could do in a mean business to root out any and all political dissenters. Muhe's role interpretation in his gradual but complete transformation to the other side personally and politically was nothing less than acting brilliance, and probably the best acting of the year in any film. Don't miss it, as you will be missing rare acting greatness if you do, and at least the equal to the brilliance of Massimo Triosi in Il Postino.Also, along with the greatest movie-ending lines in history, the very last line in this film summed up everything that happened before in the best and fewest words possible, and it will surely move you greatly, not only from immense sadness and pity for what happened to the disgraced former cop but also from great hope and gratitude for the people in this world who finally see the true light as did Muhe's transformed police captain, and then put it to work bettering the world even though the personal cost may be great. An heroic act of course, but even more, one worthy of emulation by all of us.""The Lives of Others"" was so emotionally powerful throughout but nearly overwhelming at the end, as it showed so well one of the greatest life-lessons that can be learned by anyone, and one never to be forgotten....some of your good deeds will be rewarded in some way.(added 1/23/08: one of the best movies and lead role acting in decades. Urich Muhe died recently, and what a tragic loss of talent and person. His death makes me also sadly grieve the similar fates of the magnificent Massimo Triosi of Il Postino, and the creative genius Adrienne Shelley of Waitress....both also died much too young right after their highly acclaimed triumphs in those films.)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrific screenplay and solid performances for a powerfully gripping drama,"It is the second time I have seen this movie. When I first saw it I remember feeling upset by the idea that just a little more than 20 years ago, in the heart of a civilized and enlightened Europe, there dominated such cultural repression and such terroristic means of questioning. Not that history of the former DDR was unknown to me, but probably because undeveloped at school, or probably because a little disregarded also by cinematography, it was rather upsetting. On a second watching, having assimilated the strong impact of the first one, I could better analyze the quality of the movie from a cinematographic point of view, and really appreciate it. It has a solid structure which makes every shot perfectly match with the whole, and contributes to an overall clear, lucid and perfectly built drama. The story proceeds with a quick pace, each scene is the preparation for the next one, everything is under control and follows a well marked and gripping path. The cast is simply outstanding: the actress playing Christa Maria is truly convincing in showing her deep inner laceration between her love for the stage and her love for Georg, the handsome and attractive dramatist, who knows where the right side lies, but finds it hard to assert it explicitly. But who leaves the most emotionally powerful mark is Ulrich Muhe interpreting Wiesler: he stirs thought and emotion, he is so dramatically contained, as his character requires, but, in a single hint at a smile (whe he reads Brecht's poems), conveys such a desperate yearning for true life, I think an Oscar deserving interpretation. In the end, a movie I would absolutely advise: it is intelligently thought-provoking, intellectually honest, and solidly built: a high-level piece of cinema. Really worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stasi a lesson to us all,"It has been suggested that the story of Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a senior, dedicated and zealous Stasi East German (DDR) secret police officer who starts to empathise with the subjects of his investigation is rather improbable, but to me it rings true emotionally.His subjects are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright currently in party favour, and his actress lover Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Sooner or later, an inhabitant of the chill world of secret policing with no private life to speak of sent to investigate ""artists"" is going to feel the warmth and charm of the milieu he is spying on, especially where, as here, he soon realises that his superiors' motives for the investigation are corrupt.Apologists for the Stasi (and given it employed 100,000 and had at least 200,000 informers these are numerous) say the DDR was a system that ran according to laws which were designed to protect society, but as is inevitable in totalitarian regimes the laws were perverted by those in charge to serve their own ends. Thus loathsome culture minister Hempf wants to get something on Dreyman so he can have the lovely Christa Maria all to himself, and Wiesler's slimy boss Grubitz is only too happy to oblige.Wiesler's conversion from dedicated servant of the regime to furtive dissident is an amazing process to watch, and Ulrich Muhe, who happens to be an ""ossi"" (former DDR resident), makes it very plausible. Despite tragedy, the movie has a surprisingly upbeat ending. The complacent Hempf believes people don't change but this does not mean they are entirely predictable.We see a fair amount of the Stasi at work. The rank and file are not portrayed as monsters, or automatons, just ordinary workers prepared to crack jokes about their masters at work. Most of what they do is minor harassment directed towards encouraging conformity. It is not hard to break the rules in a society where you need permission to subscribe to a foreign newspaper. It is an interesting irony that one of the catalysts of Wiesler's silent rebellion is the work of Bertold Brecht, at one time an enthusiastic supporter of the DDR.Whatever you think of its politics, this is a very fine film, with not a single one of its 137 minutes wasted. It is certainly an antidote to the ""ossie"" nostalgia said to possess some residents of the former DDR and wonderfully satirised in ""Good-Bye Lenin"". But it also asks all of us how would we behave in similar circumstances. If it might be to your individual advantage (and to the disadvantage of your enemy) would you do it? The Stasi had even otherwise loving couples informing on each other. We can only hope that, despite our own overzealous secret policemen who are doing their best to undermine our civil liberties in the name of anti-terrorism, we never get to such depths in this country. I do hope Phil Ruddock (our Attorney-General) gets to see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Slow Burner,"About half-an-hour into the movie I thought I was in for a bit of a rough ride, you know... that force-yourself-to-the-end type of film. Fortunately, the movie got better and more intriguing as it progressed, turning out to be a very rewarding piece of entertainment.Luckily, I managed to bypass my initial negative preconceptions, such as the German language, having subtitles and no recognisable actors, deciding to give the film a go based on my very positive experiences of foreign language films this year, in the place of the usual insult to your intelligence, spoon-fed Hollywood fodder.It's a rewarding film that requires a certain amount of perseverance at the start. It's educational, thought provoking, visually intriguing but not beautiful, almost beleaguering your senses with the grimy weather, the drab clothes worn by practically all, the use of greys and browns for furnishings, the austere colour palette, the depressing standard of the cars and vans, and virtually nothing joyous or warm to look at. We're instead reliant on our involvement with the characters and their insights and motives for doing what they do.A film that seems to adapt and improvise as it goes along, the characters feeling their way through events as well, entering uncharted waters and discovering the need to swim. Yet again, film that establishes the value of historical diversity that Germany has to offer from the 20th century. Only, the language/subtitle thing may put a few people off from the start, which is a shame if you're young and looking for action-satisfaction.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Voyeurs in the DDR.,"To be taken back to the brown and greyish days of the German Democrat Republic is a fascinating trip, which I enjoyed in the same kind of voyeuristic way as how I imagine Stasi agents followed the lives of the citizens of the Workers State. After watching Das Leben des Anderen, I didn't just feel I had seen a movie about 1980's East Germans, I felt I was a 1980's East German, my blue Peugeout was a lightbrown Wartburg, my lovely wife was an undercover agent. In other words, the movie caught me with its accurate realism.My few objections go on the ending, and how I feel the director doesn't have much faith in the historical insight of his audience. Not a few times we had to be reminded that Glasnost and die Wände was on its way, so I guess not even Paris Hilton would miss the point. The film was already on the wrong side of two hours, so a couple of the final scenes could easily have been cut out and a little more could have been up the viewer. I have felt this lack of subtility in other German movies and I think it's a shame.Those are just minor flaws though and it's by far one of the best movies I've seen this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Important and Terrifying,"I remember when the NSA/ Edward Snowden scandal broke there were a few differing opinions on the topic; either you were outraged (though not entirely surprised) that the government had been keeping tabs on you (as I was), or, you shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. ""I've got nothing to hide,"" was one of the most common things I heard stated. ""If the government wants to spy on me they'll probably be pretty bored."" To me, that kind of nonchalance about this very serious issue is just as terrifying as finding out that the government is spying on us.Sure, you might not have anything to hide now, but what happens when suddenly your friendly neighbor, whom occasionally talked brashly about the government, just disappears and no one goes looking for him? What happens when your wife or daughter starts getting approached by public officials and blackmailed for sex? What happens when innocent protesters end up detained in windowless prison cells for months? These are not situations I've made up to scare you; these are things that have happened and will happen again. If we don't keep those in power in check, it will happen in our own country.To the people that approach the idea of surveillance states with lackadaisical ambivalence, I think they need to see movies like ""The Lives of Others"" or ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days""; they need to read books like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. This issue is not one we should approach with a shrug; it's an issue we need to fight, tooth and nail, with every scrap of energy we can muster.Anyways, that is why I personally love this movie and think it's a masterpiece (my second viewing has cemented its place in my top 100 films of all time), but from a cinematic standpoint, this movie is absolutely incredible as well.

Moving,"Since about 2004, Germany has been producing some interesting films looking at and reworking its history (Sophie Scholl, The Downfall, Napola). This is one of the first 'serious' films to go into the dark aspects of the old East Germany. It's all about the Stasi (secret police) undermining and ruining people's lives, in this case the lives of prominent writers and actors. In the process -- and this is one of the unbelievable parts with no known historical precedent, as far as I'm aware -- the main surveillance person (Ulrich Mühe) warms somewhat to his victims and sees the emptiness of his own life.Unfortunately, the film muddies the waters by making sex a major motive. This is unnecessary, irrelevant and also without much historical foundation.It is very well acted by all concerned and successfully conjures up the required atmosphere.It is one of those very 'small', low-budget German films (like Sophie Scholl) that in Britain would be a TV film and would never make it into a cinema. Presumably for financial and prestige reasons, films like this are shown on general release in cinemas in Germany.In fact, it does not require a cinema at all, since there is nothing that calls for a big screen.

"Bad Idea, Good Execution","Why and how did this film win the Oscar for best foreign language film 2006???? Clearly ""Pan's Labrynth"" should have won. I was eager to see ""The Live of Others"" after it had won the Oscar, and now that I have seen it my my question is why did it win? Politics? The Lola prize? Preferences for German films? Color theory? Actor preferences? Discovery Channel fans? This film had a major inauthentic hole. It is completely PRETENTIOUS to believe that a police investigator changed his attitude towards his work and towards his victims because of his exposure to art, specifically to his exposure to music from Beethoven. Was this a comedy? This film had almost everything else going for it, but the premise was so bogus that it made the rest of the film unforgivable. The acting was good. The scenery gray and tyrannical. The reality of East Berlin was authentic, but once again the premise was NOT authentic. No one, no one changes because they heard a score from Beethoven and or saw a play. They may be affected by that for a little while, but they go back to being themselves thereafter, especially a cold-blooded, career-oriented police investigator from the Stasi. Maybe if he had taken piano lessons for five years he would had changed and had seen his humanity, and the humanity of others, but not because he heard his victims playing a piano piece. BS!!!

A Masterwork Of Pristine Quality That Deserves A Broader Audience!,"Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Lives of Others has a very serene ambiance when compared to other entries in the spy genre which are usually filled with chases, action or violence for this German drama tries to paint an authentic portrait of life in East Germany and is a silent observation of human nature.Set in 1980s East Germany, the story of The Lives of Others (also known as Das Leben der Anderen) focuses on the monitoring of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi; the secret police, and concerns an agent who's tasked to conduct a surveillance on a writer & his lover, but over the course of his duty ends up becoming too infatuated with their lives.Written & directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, The Lives of Others is crafted in an incredibly calm n composed manner, and presents the filmmaker in firm grip of the story he attempts to bring to life on the film canvas, which sounds even more astonishing when noted that it is his directional debut. And the proper execution of other aspects only work out in its favour.Set pieces & locations do evoke an authentic-looking atmosphere of East Germany. The camera-work is carefully employed as the movements are static for the most part, use of lighting & colour tones is skilfully done, and the drama is captured in fine detail. Editing unfolds its 137 minutes of runtime at a very relaxed pace, and the performances by its entire cast is simply outstanding.On an overall scale, The Lives of Others is an engaging drama that manages to create & sustain its tension amazingly well, gets better as the plot progresses, and concludes its tale in a very satisfying manner. The script is definitely its biggest strength and rest of the stuff is wonderfully handled too but its glacial pace & quietness did bother me at times. Not as rewarding as I expected it to be but definitely a work of pristine quality that deserves a broader audience.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent base, mediocre story","Firstly, as I see, most of the good things are already written down in other comments, so I guess I'm the one who pulls this down a bit. Yes, now, just after seeing this, I guess it's a bit over-hyped. But that's a good thing.Please note that I live in Hungary (you know, highest suicide rates... even after 20 years, we still are in the top 10) so I've seen a lot of films dealing with agents, stasi, both dramas, comedies, or comedic dramas. Because of this, maybe I've seen this film a bit differently.For an average movie-goer, where Lives of Others mostly fails is the original, film-like dramatic storytelling. Most of the plot twists can be guessed. Supporting characters, and even some not-so-supporting, are one-dimensional. Dreyman remains totally uninteresting. But surprisingly, in this movie, this is the part, that is the less important one.Lives of Others is probably the one, and icon-like movie every post-communist country should make, not for the global market, but for themselves. Dealing, and accepting the past, that the dictatorial system wasn't built up of some leaders, not even party members, but thousands of people, is a trauma, that we couldn't accept until now. Where Lives of Others truly shines, is the completeness of the story. Revealing all the sides, all the emotions, figures and personalities around an institution like the STASI, and this is the point. Not the actual story.I'm glad that it had an impact like this in the USA - as anyone can read from comments, most of the Americans taught that a communist nation was an absurd, funny, sometimes hard, but overall likable system. I truly hope this movie will shed some light on something else.Please give a minute thinking of the fact, that in these countries lived millions of Dreymans.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Lives of Others,"Is it possible for a man to be good if he's part of a bad system? This is just one of the many questions raised by the 2006 Oscar Winner for best foreign language film. Set In 1984 East Berlin, Gerd Wiesler is an agent of the Stasi. A good one. So good he conducts lectures on interrogation techniques of enemies of the state. He's tasked with an assignment to monitor Georg Dreyman, an influential playwright with on the surface seems a poster-child of the GDR.What unfolds is a thoughtful and thought-provoking drama. Wiesler observes not only his target but the nature of the system he works for. His observation, near silent most of the time, reveals not only the complexities of Dreyman's personal life and political beliefs but also the corruption of a system he holds steadfastly to be perfect. It's a beautifully profound human drama that asks suitably profound questions. Can bad acts be legitimised if the perpetrator believes them to be inherently good? Can art be true without the freedom of expression? What are the limits of loyalty? The performances are uniformly excellent. Ulrich Mühe shines as the torn Stasi officer. Playing him as a blank canvas reflecting the world around him yet wrestling with his own loneliness. While Martina Gedeck is excellent as the tragic and trapped actress whose relationship with Dreyman is stretched to breaking point.The film is subtle, observant and never feels the need to over-state it's key argument about the corruptive and corrosive effect of the Stasi on the GDR. Yet, the historical and political trappings are a framework to a touching human drama that works on almost all levels. Outstanding.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Could be good; an English language version would open up this poetic and universal human story to an even wider audience. But what if the re-makers forget to remove their Made-in-Hollywood hobnail boots before stomping all over it? You see, the great thing about this movie is its authenticity and understatement. It explores its themes (political power, personal evolution, the nature of hope, compassion, integrity, loyalty...) with enormous power but also with an audience-respecting feather-light touch.For all its subtlety, its muted palette and moderate pacing, this is a gripping and rattlingly well-told tale which unfolds with twists and turns towards a satisfying, intelligent conclusion. And, as is so often the case with a directorial debut, this film is bursting with fresh ideas and a real creative passion. Oh, and it's also very well cast with excellent performances.Perhaps not exactly a barrel of laughs, but by the end of the film you may find your faith in humanity is repaired and your spirits lifted. Please pass the Kleenex.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mature, engaging and thoughtful drama across many aspects","In 1984 East Germany is ruled by the Stasi, the secret police whose goal is to know everything and root out any signs of disloyalty to the ruling party. Whenever writer Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria are placed under suspicion the Stasi are put on surveillance duty over his whole life, the task being given to one of their most trusted and experienced men, Captain Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler learns of the true motivations behind the surveillance and at the same time finds himself more and more drawn into the lives of Sieland and Dreyman from his unseen vantage point.The few critical remarks on this page have mainly focused on one aspect of the film  its pace. I will concede that the film moves quite slowly and that those looking for ""Enemy of the State"" type thrills will be disappointed. However this is more to do with them as viewers rather than the film because for the majority of us the ""slowness"" will be patience and the lack of action set pieces just leaves more room for character and plot development. What it then manages to do is all the more surprising for being the directorial debut of writer/director von Donnersmarck, the outcome is a solid and satisfying story that may not make everything clear as day but in not doing this it actually respects the viewer rather than disappointing them.At essence the story starts about the surveillance mission but, much in the same way as Wiesler is drawn in, the viewer find the attention then split between the characters, all of them on quite an equal footing. The themes of power and ""good"" are explored within the characters in ways that I found to be interesting, challenging and very well done. It is usually a mark of a good film that one is still thinking about it a few days later (well, apart from some films that are so bad I'm still thinking murderous thoughts about them days later!). Donnersmarck has done very well as writer to build the themes into the nature of the characters and their stories so that repeat viewings or reflections on the film provide more of interest. His direction is strong as well, producing strong shots that stick in the memory and also make good use of the sets.The cast are roundly good. Mühe is the main one that people draw attention to and rightly so as his grey little man manages to fascinate with few words or direct actions. Gedeck is good but in a different way as her character carries much more of the weight in regards the pressure of the Stasi and also the thoughts over the morality of her character  she brings these out well. Koch is not quite the presence I had wanted as I found him a bit bland but yet still serviceable in the character. Support is suitably menacing from Tukur and Thieme and the cast doesn't really have a weak link in it.Overall then an excellent and mature film that deserves the praise and the awards it has garnered. Those complaining that it is ""slow"" are correct in their statement but I do not agree with it as a criticism  just an observation of the pace. Instead the steady delivery allows for the gradual development of characters, story and themes that are surprisingly rich, engaging and ultimately satisfying. One of those films that provides food for thought for some time after viewing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Oscar???,"I was disappointed on seeing this film, and surprised that it won the foreign-language best-film Oscar in competition with 'Pan's Labyrinth', since PL is a far better film, with imaginative depth and visceral feeling quite lacking in the worthy German semi-documentary.The odd thing is that the two have a similar theme, resistance to totalitarian rule -- and both after the fact, since both the East German Communists and Franco's Falange have passed into history. The difference between them is the difference between fact and myth. Fact can be compelling, but surely not so much so, after the fact; myth is always compelling, before the fact or after, and 'Pan's Labyrinth' is myth, folk-tale, Marchen, full of motherhood, blood and mandrake root, grim and beautiful by turns.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Humanity behind the iron curtain.,"I grew up hearing about the horrors of living in an Eastern Block country. The blandness of life, the constant looking over one's shoulder. The Trabant! I was always fascinated by the irony that Soviet Russia reacted to the fall of the 3rd Reich with a socialist mask upon their fascist faces. This movie was a wonderfully intimate look at the grim reality of the Iron Curtain, and the humanity that simmered under the surface eventually leading to the wall collapse. Reagan didn't bring the wall down, the people did.... and Roger Waters. ha-ha This was a compelling movie. I can see why Depp and Jolie fell in love with the director.

A Monumental Triumph!,"The acclaimed German-speaking film, The Lives of Others is a well-written, addicting thriller that talks about a time in very modern history that not many movies have covered. This film covers Eastern Berlin in the 1980's, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Unlike many thrillers, this film doesn't rely on drawn-out car chases or bloody gun battles, but more so on tense character development and I welt so moved by the film, I literally thought there would be members of the Stasi creeping up behind me while watching the film.Florian Donnersmark's film, which was awarded an Oscar for best foreign film, is about a member of the secret police named Captain Wiesler who listens into people he believes to be enemies. But when he is assigned to listen to the famous and beloved playwright, Georg Dreyman, his life is about to take on a big change.This film is great in part to the wonderful acting. The late Ulrich Muhe does a wonderful job as Captain Wiesler and all his scenes were just perfection. In fact, the final scene he is in should be enough to move you to tears. Sebastian Koch does a great job as Georg Dreyman, a playwright who is also bent on escaping over the Wall.Overall, The Lives of Others is a very well-made thriller that will teach you about the lifestyle of people back then and how the citizens had to live in fear. There are no car chases here, but there is an actual story that is worth checking out. These kind of slow-burners are the best thrillers of them all and this made for an engaging thriller. Despite being spoken in German, I think Americans should watch this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"not such a bad film, after all","so I finally got to see the film everyone has been talking about. I have also seen the talk show in which the director gets into an argument with East-German actor Henry Hübchen. I must admit the director comes across as arrogant bordering on annoying. He is obviously a wunderkind or something but he is actually such a smart-ass that I can't imagine a character less likable. Watching his discussion with Hübchen made me want to boycott the film (even though I adore the actors in it, Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Mühe)I am glad I didn't. It may not be historically accurate. I am from East Germany but I am too young to know. Yet, most people say the GDR as portrayed in the film was not the GDR of the 1980s but rather the (Stalinist) GDR of the 1950s. In the 1980s, most actors, singers, the famous people were able to extort the GDR government as they could just go west and embarrass the officials. If the writer/actress couple were really as famous as the film suggests, in 1984, the GDR officials would have given them anything they wanted. (the pivotal point was 1976 when dissident Wolf Biermann was denaturalized)In that respect, I understand Hübchen's criticism. He said he lived in the period and doesn't agree with the way it was portrayed. He fears that the will now stand testimony to the era and people may well think that this is the way it was. His grandson asked him why he didn't do anything about it, how he could live in a system like this etc. I suppose he is afraid Donnersmark steals his biography, in a way.However, it is still a work of fiction and people who watch a film should know. It is a good film, if overly dramatic, a little obvious, and Hollywood-IA. It has some great moments, actually. Mühe is fantastic as the man in grey.So, it's definitely worth checking out. I have a feeling it may get more appreciation abroad than in Germany. It was obviously produced with the foreign (esp American) audiences in mind. And I think it may translate pretty well into foreign territories as it gets enthusiastic notices from critics abroad.My favourite German film this year is still Sommer vorm Balkon, yet it appears foreigners don't get the subtle and sweet Berlin humour.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great picture details but definitely too educational.,"It has been paid a lot of attention to the details in this film.

Not that the actors don't perform well. On the contrary, but there are nuances missing. For example there is too much self-conscious coming over in their figures ... this is definitely not the aspect you would have met in GDR.The plot is O.K. We have to remember the dark sides of life in these states. Its also enough to remember about George Orwell.The film has a much greater ""educational"" value (""the good and the bad"") than an artistic one. It emphasizes too much the way the viewer should think about the situation once.Overall nice work for a debut movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting but flawed,"What I like about this movie are the sets, the locations and the editing. As a viewer I could really believe that I am looking into Eastern Germany in the 1980s. The wiring and the ensuing connection between the artist's flat and the cold, drafty attic with the listening post perfectly showed the perverseness and the absurdity of that particular totalitarian system. The highlight for me was, when a guest in the apartment, an enthusiastic journalist from the West, pops the cork of a bottle of champagne. The cork hits a light switch in which a hearing device is hidden, a very quick and short cut to the attic shows how the guy with the headphones winces in silent pain. The movie also makes it very clear that the Socialist systems outmaneuvered themselves with their paranoia  what remains of them are vestiges of Russian style secret service systems (but that is older then Socialism and probably has little to do with it).What I dislike about this movie is primarily that it is designed as a melodrama. The story is by nature an obscure one. The actions are stealthy ones, almost all that happens happens in the dark. This is transformed into long epic scenes which might attract a mass audience but do not fit the subject matter. I found the overbearing (and often praised) musical score hard to stand. In order to appreciate a melodrama you have to identify with the characters. And this I could not do. It must be said that the people who in this movie were the victims were also people of that totalitarian system. They were successful artists who made a career. They knew amply well how to play"" that system and basically supported it. I am sure it was a great privilege to live in a spacious flat in the center of Eastern Berlin. The victims are not half starved idealistic artists who would die for an ideal, they are rather  let's face it  fat cats with a healthy sense for survival. I found their intellectual whining rather sickening. One has to assume that with such a privileged lifestyle it was easy to generate jealousy in members of the surveillance squads (and I am certain this was systematically, tactically done). Therefore it is difficult to believe in the development of goodness"" in the main character. The movie intimates that it is triggered by music the listener hears in the apartment. I did not find that very convincing.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some movies simply tell the truth - this is one.,"This a movie that had to be made and must be seen by as many in the world as possible. If I were to comment much on the story, it would become overly political so I restrain. The movie is political but it says more about conflict of conscious and redemption than it does about political beliefs. A powerful story of tragedy and triumph, of greed and grace, of love and deception. It is a story about the cost of sacrifice and the cost of compromise.The screenplay is masterfully written and and the story carefully directed. So good is the crafting and telling of the story that the movie transcends borders - any audience can appreciate it. The art direction was very well balanced and added to the emotions the story brings out. Its only obvious weakness in my opinion were the few times it lacked continuity causing the editing of some sequences to be a bit awkward.For those who believe that government knows best and the populace needs the government to care for its needs - they need to see this movie.

This is a FANTASTIC movie!!!,"The locations, sets, cars (& trucks), costumes and characterizations were all PERFECT!! My husband and I lived and worked in the former DDR for almost 10 years, and this movie brought everything back to us, as if it were yesterday. Because we were working in various theaters there, the theater people were very much like former associates. Gerd Wiesler's apartment and apartment building were almost like the one that we lived in for 7 years, except that our building had no elevator. The kitchen and linoleum were exactly the same as ours. His neighbors were much like the people who lived in our building. The television was just right. If they didn't want to watch DDR propaganda, they could flip over to ""MOSCOW 1"" to get Russian propaganda or American films dubbed in Russian!. We almost expected to see someone we knew in the crowd scenes. This re-creation was accurate to the last detail, even the sounds of the car and truck engines.

Can you dance as if there's no-one watching?,"Maybe you know the saying, ""Dance as if no-one were watching, sing as if no-one were listening""? I wonder why we say that? Is there something magical about privacy? Something that lets the spirit free? Our story starts before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, East Germany's Secret Police, has refined its way of dealing with artists. No violence. Psychology. Persuasion. Surveillance. The lives of others are not their own. Most artists give up. Many commit suicide. Your best friend. Your lover. Georg Dreyman is lucky. He survives.The Lives of Others spans seven years - from 1984 to 1991. The first hour sets the scene so we are completely immersed in Communist Germany. Then Dreyman and his partner confront the fact that their lives are being compromised. The emotional intensity is in gut-wrenching contrast to the bland story so far. Finally, as the Stasi surveillance kicks in, they wonder if they can survive - or even if they want to.One of the film's strengths and weaknesses is that the characters are so believable. Dreyman is a sophisticated intellectual, a successful playwright. His partner, Christa-Maria, is an acclaimed actress. Then there's Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler, a heart-felt supporter of the communism, who is assigned to spy on them. Wiesler has a crisis of conscience and decides not to prosecute Dreyman. The Lives of Others has created debate and furore in Germany. Firstly, because the ex-Stasi now try to portray the regime as none too harmful. Secondly, because the facts show that, with the system of double-checks that were in place, no such character as Wiesler existed or could have existed. The film's director says it is about the ability of human beings to do the right thing, no matter how far they have gone down the wrong path. It seems like a good story (as long as we don't re-write history in the process).As I came out of a packed multiplex auditorium, I marvelled. People turning out in such numbers to see a subtitled movie. And so they should. But, its Oscar win (Best Foreign Language) apart, The Lives of Others is particularly poignant to British audiences. A poll published at the end of 2006 indicated almost 80% of us agree that Britain has become a 'surveillance society'.This is why The Lives of Others strikes such a chord. Thousands of new offences, limitations on freedom of assembly, on privacy, freedom of movement, the right to silence, and freedom of speech. Privacy International ranks the UK ahead of the US, Europe and most developing countries, as a 'world worst offender' for surveillance, and as 'an endemic surveillance society' (in the same category as Russia and China). We are by far the most-watched nation on earth, with a CCTV camera for every 14 people. Apart from such corrosive effects of surveillance (notably, in our film, on artists), new technology (including DNA and tracking of non-suspects) raises nightmarish possibilities of abuse. When disaster hits Dreyman's life, it is because a high-up official is abusing the system. Dreyman and Christa-Maria's lives are shattered, and he becomes determined to help expose the disease in their society.As I catch the bus home from the cinema (watched by more CCTV), I read a newspaper report of an Aberdeen University study finding tough government policies aimed at curbing Islamic radicalism are having the opposite effect. Since 9/11, Britain has eroded the principles it claims to be defending, and people fear (with some justification) that the Government's 'bottom-up accountability' is a blueprint for a 21st century version of a police state. A vicious circle? The Stasi had many more times the secret police that Nazi Germany had - but under a politer system. And modern technology even does away with the need for so many human operatives. The Lives of Others does not feature Gestapo tactics (and the Gestapo only had 30,000 secret police, against the Stasi's 200,000). This is the 1980s, and the Stasi are modern-looking officials, not hit-men. Most of them have been convinced that their work is for the public good.Dreyman is criticised for minor offences - possessing Western newspapers. It gives them a polite excuse to keep tabs. One perhaps thinks of the UK DNA database (the world's largest) that samples those who have committed very minor offences - or no offence at all. The official reason for diversifying surveillance on Dreyman is, ""lack of suspicious acts."" Our fictitious 'good man' in this multifaceted masterwork, (and to whom Dreyman eventually dedicates a novel) is in some aspects played by Ulrich Muhe. In a strange irony, Muhe has examined his own Stasi files - from the days when he was an actor in East Germany. He found his former wife had informed on him through the six years of their marriage. For Muhe, the Brechtian self-awareness that is referenced (but never directly used) in the film gives it a meaning beyond mere entertainment. The movie's style is mainstream - as if 'no-one was watching'. We just identify with what is happening on screen. But then we think about our own lives. Whether it is ""the grey men who ensure safety in our land"" or the emotional ties, and how far would you go to protect a loved one, or how far someone could go to mess with your head.Watch and listen carefully: the Lives of Others is a film that can cut deep.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of the last decade,"I've read this film compared to Coppolla's The Conversation, both favourably and unfavourably, on the discussion boards here. It should be noted that the two films bear only superficial similarities, mainly that the protagonists are middle-aged surveillance operatives who get involved with a case.However the styles are very different. The Conversation is a classic, and magnificent, piece of 1970s US paranoia-thriller, the best kind of film which came out of Hollywood in that decade of scandal that signified for many, the death of the American dream. Das Leben der Anderen is an equally intelligent and artful film, but one (from what I can gather) typical of modern German cinema, drenched in a sadness about its past, featuring strong themes of divided loyalties and moral dilemmas, but hopeful (unlike Coppola's film) about the future. Less suspenseful and pacey than The Conversation, this is a tale that gives a human face to the victims of the Stasi in East Germany, and, although it keeps you on the edge of your seat, is more of a drama, more sentimental in tone.A wonderful film, its magic is in the feeling it generates in you for its characters, and the almost gentle tragedy that unfolds. A serious, well made and superbly (that should be underlined: superbly) acted film that isn't ashamed to tug at the heartstrings a little. Small wonder it won the Oscar for best film of 2006: I can't imagine a better film was made anywhere that year.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

However after thirty minutes or so of watching the film, I stopped it and removed it from my player because of the exasperating inadequacy of the English subtitles. It appears that just about twenty-five percent of the dialog is subtitled and much of the subtitles presented appear to be just summations of what is being spoken rather than word for word translation.

The actors are brilliant. The script is perfect. The sets are historically correct and give you a good impression of how it felt to live in the DDR. Not really a ""feel good""-movie but a message to set the records straight about the DDR-regime and its StaSi-system.

Das Leben der Anderen: Subtle But Touching,"A movie I'd long been intending to watch, Das Leben der Anderen has many accolades to its name, not least of all its Oscar. Add to this the generally intarnishable excellence of modern German cinema, and you have a sure recipe for entertainment.An exploration of Cold War Germany, Das Leben der Anderen is the story of GDR espionage officer Gerd Wiesler in his duties spying upon playwright and actress couple Georg and Christa-Maria. Initially a faithful servant of the East, Wiesler is slowly romaniticised by the ideals subtly instilled within his subconscience by those he surveills.As one might expect from a film set during this era, Das Leben der Anderen is heavily political. We see this immediately expressed through several characters, primarily Wiesler. Cold, austere, and unemotional, he shows us the filmmakers' view of East Germany and its agents, conveying to us the sinister notoriety of this infamous entity. It takes perhaps half an hour of the film's running time before we observe a trace of humanity within the character: a veritable needle in a haystack of socialist stoicism. The gentle unravelling of his personal life is wonderful, giving us a detailed picture by showing a blank canvas. As Wiesler's vacuous life of monotony and iciness rolls on, the shared life of his assigned targets seems ever more appealing, the romance between them something entirely foreign and unknown to him. This juxtaposition, purveyed through colour schemes of respective apartments as well as the actors themselves, is for me more appealing than the film's significant political commentary. The extent of the effect of Georg upon Wiesler, despite the fact that they never actually meet, is fantastically enthralling, slowly coming to show us the human side of the previously authoritarian figure. Undoubtedly, the praise for this belongs to Mühe, his performance calm, collected, and capturing. As well as the gripping characterisation, the film's plot is involving; a well paced drama that effectively shows us life behind the wall. The film is rife with subtle but touching moments, beautiful in their simplicity and impact. Not least of these is the closing line, its delivery absolutely perfect and hard-hitting. Tonally, the film is consistent and insistent, evidencing the eagerness of von Donnersmarck to tell this important story.Accurately portraying the concomitant fear, uncertainty, and disillusion of the GDR's command, Das Leben der Anderen propels us effortlessly into the world of its characters. Slowly and comprehensively crafting a complete picture of its main character, one which gradually affixes itself forever to our affections, this is a very fine film indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sonata for a Good Man,"Artists watching this will shudder at the callousness of politicians and at how little they mean to government, unless the all-mighty entity decides they need something from you.

We all have our agendas, apolar from Gods' will. What a sad existence our characters found themselves in as East Germany was artistic quicksand.

A highly masterful rendition of good old-fashioned human decency that is both compelling and thought provoking!,"Set mostly in the 1980s and during the cold war, Das Leben der Anderen tells of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army by which the Socialist Unity Party kept control of the German Democratic Republic, aka GDR) and how GDR citizens lived in a world of repression. A state security captain, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is an expert in interrogating dissidents and is assigned the case of spying on a playwright called Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). It is for this reason (of being a playwright) that he is put under surveillance. As Weisler's investigation progresses he becomes unwittingly aware of his own limited existence and empathy for those he watches ensues, taking precedence over his obedience and loyalty to the Stasi  so much so that he begins to falsify documents and lie about events in Dreyman's life. Regarding the films treatment of the Stasi, Das Leben der Anderen has caused controversy upon its release, especially in Germany with people comparing the members of the Stasi to that of the Gestapo, 40 years previous. Recent German history is littered with examples of the Stasi's uncompromising approach  some of which are still coming to fruition. In brief the Stasi spied on, imprisoned, and ruined the lives of anyone it chose and in the immediate aftermath of the war there were a lot of deaths or ""liquidations"" of opponents. In later years the Stasi abandoned this approach in favour of psychological torture and exile. They would routinely brake into peoples flats, steal underwear (to be bottled as odour samples) for identification purposes and use psychotropic drugs on those under house arrest, this would mostly happen due to tip offs from fellow GDR citizens turned informers, as once an informer certain liberties would follow. Artists and those of a creative nature (writers, poets, journalist etc) were a favoured choice of the Stasi and their work was often either stifled, scrutinised, compromised or even destroyed  similarities with the manner in which Nazi's burned books are blatantly apparent; the film also makes plenty of references to books being a source of provocation. Because of all this GDR citizens lived in world of fear and paranoia, as individuals they were afraid and suspicious of all those they met. It was, without question, a totalitarian society.Das Leben der Anderen is very low budget, but it is outstandingly written capturing the essence of people's feelings at the time  with some great lines being ironically delivered by a government minister, the greatest line in the film though has to be the last because of its emotional connotations. The direction and the cinematography capture a sombre and monotonous East Germany with its drab lighting and muted colours, perfectly illustrating the despondency of its citizens. Performances throughout the film are excellent, Gerd Weislers girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is a joy to watch, most notably the uncomfortable anxiety she displays during a scene in the back of a taxi cab manages to be felt by all those watching as does her expression of guilt and betrayal towards the end of the film. The greatest performance however comes from Ulrich Muhn. The opening scene in Das Leben der Anderen shows him lecturing some students on the art of integration; he plays them a cassette of one of his own interrogations. The man on the tape complains of being tired, to which a student declares that it is inhuman to deny him his sleep. Wielser scribbles a mark next to the students name before he retorts  this act alludes to the possibility that this individual will face some sort of punishment for his remark. Weisler continues teaching and, in accordance with the cassette, states that a guilty man will become quiet and reiterate his rehearsed lies, whilst an innocent man will shout and scream. This behaviour and this carefully constructed scene beautifully underpins the Stasi regime, it sets forth and establishes the type of character Weisler is, whilst allowing for the understanding that any deviation from this way of thinking results in you becoming an enemy.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding accomplishment because of its proficiency at utilising old-fashioned narratives and placing them into a malevolent world - that was once real. Unfortunately it tells of a story that did not occur (the director and his researchers underwent four years of research for the film and could not find one example of a Stasi man empathisising with dissidents or even suspected dissidents) and although accurate in many other areas the films core values are untrue and almost propagandarous. To assume that a man like Weisler could change his beliefs questions the very understandings of a totalitarian state, it ignores historical accuracy to feed cinema's desire to misrepresent and fabricate history for the purpose of entertainment and it is this that is simultaneously the films strength and its weakness. In a nutshell the film is about hope, it is a word that is mentioned a lot and it is something that propels the characters and narrative forward and it is how the story finally resolves itself - by pandering to this sense of hope. Despite its short comings, Das Leben der Anderen is one of the first films to look back at the GDR and not reminisce or gain humour from it (""Good Bye, Lenin!"", 2003) and it treats them with heavier hand than many other German films to date, but it also lets them off lightly. I am a strong believer in film as an art form and had the film been more truthful to itself then it would have been an incredible piece of art, but in sticking with recent trends laid out by current German film-makers (a common attribute of New German Cinema) the film has fused both art and entertainment thus leading to Das Leben der Anderen being just an incredible piece of entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrific analysis of this subject,"Whatever the director will make after this film, I am sure it won't be better; good, yes, but not better. This pure gem is one if not the best film ever made about life in East Germany, at least spoken of in the Western side of the former Iron Curtain. Far from being a simple propaganda film, it is a subtle, powerful, brilliant, intelligent and pulled by a jaw dropping acting too, though the actors are known outside Germany. I am not surprised that it was so widely seen over the world. It is accurate and thrilling, scary and poignant in the same time. It is impossible to think about something else after watching this film. Another movie, however, was also a pure masterpiece, but told on a lighter way: GOOD BYE LENIN, speaking of a cousin subject, related to the East West Germany problem, but told from another angle.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life behind the Iron Curtain,"If you want to know how was it to live in a so called socialist country in central/eastern Europe in the 80's, this is the movie to see. It's the most comprehensive mirror of that time period that I've ever seen. Whether the name was STB, Securitate, KGB or Stasi - in this case, the movie contains a very realistic portray of the secret police and the surveillance methods used. The movie deserves a better score, is a 9+ movie, I think some people gave it a lower score only because of the dark atmosphere, which I consider is very realistic. Ulrich Mühe, who unfortunately died in 2007, gave here one of the best portrayals of the 'watchdog', a policeman without a personal life, that lives only to spy 'other people lives'.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A powerful film about the dilemma of being human in an inhumane world,"This is a phenomenal piece of film-making. A rare gem and a must see for anyone who has an interest in serious dramas.

What will he do? What is the right thing to do? Can you make choices without people being hurt or killed?

Captivating and sensual.,"'The Lives of Others' is an interesting movie. It is dramatic, sensual, sexual and captivating, and offers quite a few twists and unexpected events.Sebastian Koch is very good as Georg Dreyman, a writer under surveillance. Unbeknownst to him, his love life, every day routine, and conversations with his friends - and even plans to smuggle a friend across the border - are being recorded, as his entire apartment is being monitored. Instead of reporting him, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler - who is in charge of the investigation - can't wait for his surveillance turn to follow Georg's life. Wiesler is excellently portrayed by Ulrich Muhe. One can't help but become absorbed by the characters, wanting to see and hear more.There's so much irony in the film. 'The Lives of Others' definitely deserves more than just one viewing. Although it might loose its appeal with a second viewing, it will still be worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Excellent Movie About...The Life of Others.,"I'm amazed. After watching and enjoyed 'Goodbye Lenin!', I've waited for another German masterpiece. I can't say anything about 'Der Untergang' because I haven't seen it yet, but saying something about this movie, that's already another thing, that's possible: amazing. Just amazing. Such an excellent movie, and one of the most brilliant and excellent masterpieces I have seen in years. This automatically entered my top 10 of all time. This will please the most prolific and most exigent movie lovers plus the drama and history ones, I have no doubt.First, what I really liked in this movie was how the reality is so well treated. The movie is cold blooded and shows with no disturbing how far went STASI before the fall of the Berlin wall. It just shows it and that's it, that's the reality. There's's no other ways to be told, it was like that. And this, I found it very interesting and I enjoyed a lot.Then the performances. These actors aren't very known in the movie business (for me, if they are well known, then I apologize my ignorance), but still, they achieve to deliver performances so realistic and so powerful, that simply amazed me and I think they brought a lot of depth to the movie, specially this being a drama. It really improved the movie's seriousness. For me Ulrich Mühe was the golden star in this movie, and I am sad for his death, because he really achieved something here. May he rest in peace, forever.Then the script. Excellent, no twists, and absolutely amazing as the writer managed to focus on a real theme, but also achieved to drop other themes, such as love and friendship, that in the end turned into back stabbing. And this opposition created by the director slash writer, was very, very interesting.So, 'Das Lieben Der Anderen', is really one of the best movies made in the last years, and I am sure, that it is also one of the very best of all time (IMdB's Top 250, you bet it deserves being there). This movie really got a point, and it's to denounce how far the STASI went. Sure, there were more politic polices, but what they did, wasn't normal. I at least, don't think it was normal. I mean...where were privacy and liberty? - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
over-rated but nice drama,"I am happy for the German film business which is doing better and better, and Americans like this movie even though it's not about Hitler! But I think it is a bit too sentimental. It tells a touching story, but of course it takes the story of a Stasi who is really ""good on the inside."" But I would rather see a movie about the truth, about how the stasi was mostly not so moral. But I guess it's nice for people to see, because they think that if they were in his shoes, they would also be ""nice."" But the movie never really explains why he decides to be a good person, so it's just ""boring guy is a good guy""...I think it is better in subtitles, because in German it felt sort of obvious, but when you read subtitles you think it must mean more!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
'won't  get fooled again',"I watched this movie only by chance after first reading many eulogies it received among reviewers. As the theme developed and I began to enjoy the immediacy of the plot I slowly realized this wasn't quite the sensitive searching look back upon a failed social experiment I'd been led to believe. As you would expect modern performers are convincing actors - I think the sharpness and no frills approach of modern TV drama has over the years lifted the profession anyway. Can anyone imagine how long an temperamental Joan Crawford type of artist would last in today's climate! The plot whilst rather transparent was adequate. As it developed and later seemed to hinge upon the DDR suicide issue I could see the female lead was probably doomed - but then I remembered another real life suicide 'urban myth' from my younger days. In those days Sweden was (somewhat irritating for certain quarters) successful in its social policies. Its 'progressive' politicians with their caring 'populist' internal behavior and humane foreign approach won a great deal of admiration - after a while assertions started circulating in the media. ""Ah yes but""...suddenly it seemed they had the highest suicide ratings in the world - seemingly there was insufficient excitement in Swedish lives. Boredom caused them to dive under buses, jump into rivers and hang themselves under bridges. Hmmm! I expected an intelligent and genuine examination of a top/down flawed new approach to Societies problems - a filmed reversal of the many failed attempts over thousands of years to overthrow the stifling elites by revolt from below. I'm afraid this movie is being hailed by the same people who convinced me that Obama saw things in a different light....his was a new approach....the tone is certainly different but nothing has altered. 'The lives of others' is yet another example - you've seen it before, nothing is changed it is just another predictably praised - I noticed for instance Wm Buckley and one of the Podhoritz clan - two of the foundling godfathers of the NeoCon mafia lauding it as 'The greatest movie I've ever seen' in one case and 'One of the greatest movies ever made in the other'. We've been conned again I'm sorry to say it's just another 'Commie Bashing' production. The movie was seen eventually on a business trip with a well known Airline - I am flying again a few weeks time and am look forward to a viewing of Michael Moores latest item 'Capitalism - a love story'. Ahem....I'm sure it will be freely available.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

To Know Everything...,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others"" is a searing portrait of East Germany in the early 1980's before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The era of paranoia, suppression of free speech, and total state control of everything and everyone is masterfully displayed here in the intertwining stories of the Stasi police officer, his morally questionable superiors, and the actress and playwright they are spying on. Once again, the German people's love affair with authoritarianism and meticulously detailed records is featured here as the most intimate details of these people's lives are examined and we see the quiet tragedies of their everyday life stemming from their bizarrely married desires for freedom and attempts to rationalize their place and survive in the State and the Socialist movement. Superb acting, an excellent music score, and no-frills direction keep the film taut, sparse, and utterly transfixing in its evolving melodrama.On an obvious surface level, ""The Lives of Others"" is the most psychologically astute look at voyeurism since Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" What makes the film compelling in its slow build up of tension and suspense, is that it is working on so many other levels. It can also be viewed as an allegory for the art of film making (or stage directing and writing) and the craft of acting, as we see the fractured psyche of the Stasi police officer--much like the blacklisted director character who commits suicide-- who so desperately wants to intervene and direct the troubling lives of those he surveys (the writer and actress--both wrestling with their own internal demons as their lives soon become not their own). So while it serves well as a timeless psychological case study into such minds, desires, and paranoia, it also functions as a very timely discussion about how much interference a government has the right to run into the lives of ordinary citizens.""The Lives of Others"" suffers from one major flaw, which will not be discussed at length for fear of giving away some of its intricate plot twists and theatrical climaxes. In the end, the film misses the final beat as it runs about ten or fifteen minutes too long past what would've been two serviceable and profound endings to arrive at a series of closing scenes that are all too pat. The first two hours were so rife with dramatic irony and subtle tension, that it's a shame the film rolls on beyond what would've been a sublimely ironic and stark conclusion (that arrives at a most pivotal moment in world history). Still, there was so much multi-layered and engrossing minutiae in those first two hours that the film's ultimate brilliance can not be denied because of one false note.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The HGW XX/7 has a real dignity and the way he turns and separates his way from meanness to heroism is unspeakable. He doesn't talk too much and never gets to talk to Dreyman. The soundtracks are really fit into the sequences and the movie gives you the feeling of being ruled by dictatorship.It is also thoroughly instructive how Georg Dreyman treats his wife when he finds out about her compulsory affairs with the minister. That's the right way to handle these events in life.It deserves to win the Oscar and even a better award if existed!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The watchers and the observed,"This is a spell-binding film. Absolutely captivating. Before the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone they suspected of harboring thoughts and opinions against the Communist rule of Eastern Germany. We follow a man employed by the DDR to listen in on a specific household, and how he gradually becomes emotionally attached to these two people that he, unbeknownst to them, is recording the actions of. This gives a psychological and realistic look at not only the people who are the subject of a constant invasion of privacy, but also those who are responsible for it. There is tremendous authenticity, in this. It is dramatic, engaging, suspenseful, and, frankly, beautiful. The plot is excellent, and develops rather well. This has spot-on pacing, and it's never boring. The acting is beyond reproach, every single performance in this is stunning. All of the music and score fits. The writing is incredible, the credibility, the characters, the dialog, the scenes... I could go on. Since I only followed what was said from the subtitles, I cannot comment on whether or not there is harsh language in this. There is sexuality and nudity, and I would say that a certain maturity level is necessary to appreciate this anyway. The DVD holds a trailer, some previews for other movies, a showcase of the actual equipment used and several interviews, all of them worth the time. I recommend this to anyone who has a chance to see it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Vivid Reminder,"I begin this review by quoting Jesse Vint III. Mr. Vint is a character actor seen in numerous films and television programs. Of The Lives of Others, he states, ""This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless."" I couldn't have said it better. That's why I am borrowing Mr. Vint's words. As a matter of fact, when I first started watching this film, I was thinking that it wasn't going to be worth over two hours of my time. I soon discovered that it is worth far more. It turned out to be a deeply personal experience for me as it reminded me of certain shattering events in my own life. I actually had nightmares last night relating to those events which, I'm sure, were aroused by viewing this extraordinary film set in East Germany a few years before the fall of The Wall.The element of the film that caused me to continue to watch even though I first thought that I was not going to be entertained was the depiction of the lead character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mühe. Mühe's interpretation of a man who appears totally devoid of emotion is hypnotic. The character Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi - the secret police in charge of following the movements and activities of every person the country.The Stasi employed some 100,000 people to keep track of some 16 million citizens. In addition, the Stasi had a huge network of unpaid informers reporting the activities of their friends and neighbors. Imagine - one person to spy upon and report the lives of just sixty people. Horrifying! Mühe is an actor who grew up in East Germany and was the victim of both the Stasi and ""friends"" who were informers. That surely had to add to his insight into the character of Wiesler, but whatever his resources, his performance is surely one of the finest ever recorded on film. Wiesler is a man so imbued with Communistic doctrine and devotion to the state that he has become an observation and interviewing machine more than a man. There is a revealing scene early in the film in which Wiesler summons a prostitute to his house. He sits on his sofa with his shirt buttoned to the top, trousers and belt still fastened, while the prostitute plies her trade - machine sex. The only hint of any human emotion is at the end when he buries his head in her ponderous breasts. At this point in the film is when I began to feel sorry for this pitiful man rather than hate him for what he does.Wiesler is assigned to observe a famous playwright who has always openly supported the government - but why? We find that Wiesler's superior is having an affair with the lover of the playwright - a beautiful and famous stage actress - and wants the playwright out of the way. The motive behind the observation goes totally against the principles to which Wiesler has devoted his life and career. Thus we see a seed planted that will grow to change the life of this man. That change takes place as he observes the lives of others.Along with this totally breathtaking film, the DVD contains features which truly enrich the viewing experience. Through these features, the viewer is treated to the history of the research that went into the film, the writing process, the historic locations, and the thoughts of the actors. They are not to be missed.If you are reading this review, you probably have an interest in film. As a film viewer, you must see The Lives of Others.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good German(s),"Since the early days of film-making--actually, since the first plays were written--the gold standard for a good dramatic work is one that combines an intriguing plot with complex characters, to illuminate something about human behavior. It's surprising, then, that so many movies still fall short of the mark. At the risk of oversimplifying things, plot-heavy movies tend to ignore character development, and character-study movies ignore a streamlined plot for the sake of a series of episodes. It takes something like ""The Lives of Others,"" an excellent and moving drama, to remind you of how great a movie can be when it combines these elements.Not only does this movie have a suspenseful plot that follows the logic of cause-and-effect until everything ties together beautifully, but the workings of the plot are unpredictable, and intimately linked to the characters' psychology. For drama does not result merely from watching external events happen to characters, but from seeing them actively make choices that affect their own lives and (forgive the pun) the lives of others.The set-up is simple but highly resonant: in 1984 East Berlin, by-the-book Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to wiretap and listen in on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). But because Dreyman has always presented himself as a loyal citizen, Wiesler dimly begins to realize just how paranoid and corrupt his government is. Also, he becomes fascinated with the couple's warm, semi-bohemian lifestyle, which contrasts with his own solitary existence. Wiesler thus finds himself reconsidering his values, while at the same time Georg and Christa-Maria reconsider theirs. Should Georg use his writing talent to reveal the horrible conditions in East Germany? Should Christa-Maria submit to a lustful government minister, who could ruin her career if he doesn't get his way? These choices are hard, and only lead to more hard choices.This plot allows for scenes loaded with the great dramatic irony and subtext that results from one character knowing something that another does not. The movie's complex and intelligent themes include theatre/fakery/acting versus real life, and the voyeurism of a spy versus the voyeurism of a cinema-goer. And above all, ""The Lives of Others"" is a moving exploration of ethics and humanity. Not many recent movies ask the question ""What does it really mean to be a good person?"" and even fewer answer it with the honesty and depth that this film does.""The Lives of Others"" does not over-explain itself--none of the characters can confide in anyone, so they make their difficult choices without talking about why they've acted that way. Yet everything that happens in the movie has the ring of emotional truth. Thanks to the beautifully realized performances, you never doubt that the characters would behave in exactly that way, nor that they feel deep anguish in coming to their decisions.I haven't seen all the acclaimed movies from the past year yet, but as it stands now, ""The Lives of Others"" is my choice for the best movie of 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

From what I have read about the Stasi I doubt that anyone would have talked freely on a telephone line in this era but I could see how the writer, after years of keeping within the party lines, would think that his home was not under surveillance.""To think that people like you once ruled a country.""

Outstanding,"Artists are dangerous to dictatorships as this film so ably proves. A work of art, such as this film about life in the GDR, has the power to influence opinion in a way that history books cannot. In the interview with director Donnersmarck on the DVD extras he mentions that he spent a year and a half doing research for this. He read everything he could on the GDR and conducted extensive interviews with former GDR people, including ex-Stasi agents. Many of the actors are East Germans including Ulrich Mühe who was himself under surveillance by the Stasi. All of this reflects Donnersmark's stated desire for authenticity, down to using original surveillance equipment and filming some of the final scenes in the actual Stasi archives. In any case, if we were to abstract this story from any basis in reality and view it as fiction, it is still powerful. By concentrating on a few individuals it presents a chilling view of the effects of living in a repressive dictatorship. I found this movie to have a keener effect on me than Wells' ""1984.""The movie poses the question of what a good man is to do when living in a fascist regime. Those who wield the power have the techniques down as to how to control the citizenry - threats to family, threats to job, brutal interrogation, and even torture. If someone knows enough about you, it is a trivial matter to exploit your vulnerabilities to keep you in line. How much would you compromise? How much would you risk in order to be true to yourself?The most fascinating aspect of this film for me deals with the moral dilemmas faced by its two main protagonists - the theater director and writer Georg Dreyman and the Stasi agent Hauptmann Wiesler who sets up full surveillance on Dreyman. Both are torn between loyalties to their professions, their county, their friends, and ultimately each to his own conscience.Mühe plays Wiesler with subtlety - he turns in an awesome performance primarily achieved through facial expression and body movement. His gradual transformation is wonderful to behold and there is enough ambiguity to keep you guessing as to the causes. Does his surveillance of Dreyman provoke jealousy, sympathy, sexual longings, shame, enlightenment, all of these, or what? And Dreyman's transformation is no less interesting, albeit more easily understood. If you like movies where events change people, you will like this.The colors are a bit drab - grays, greens, and browns. But they reflect an implied drabness as to what life was like in the GDR. I wish there were more commentaries on IMDb from those who lived through this.The musical score offers a perfect backdrop.""The Lives of Others"" is absorbing and virtually flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film of the year,"The first mention should go to the actors, who gave such engaging and moving performances. The plot and directing are superb, in fact it is incredibly hard to fault this film.The topic of the Stasi in East Germany shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall is one I have only seen dealt with in the more light-hearted ""Goodbye Lenin"". ""The Lives of Others"" portrays a far more dark side to the regime. I defy anybody to find a reason not to like this film, as the message goes far deeper into investigating the impact of espionage upon human relationships and emotions. The ending is amazing, and without giving too much away it is implicitly simple in its insinuation of the bond which has formed between the two principle characters.If you only see one film this year, make it this one.

Powerful and emotional,"Another honourable mention, which also didn't make my top 30. This film is phenomenal. The loneliness of Wiesler, the charm of Dreyman, and their close yet distant relationship is captivating.

This is bound to provoke strong emotions in any viewer. Lots of great performances here, notably Ulrich Mühe.

A masterpiece.,"Similar to the communist witch hunts that alarmed American's in the 1950's, ""The Lives Of Others"" offers a riveting view of life behind the Berlin Wall. Director von Donnersmarck engages us in the life of a cold, dispassionate character then takes us on a journey that transforms him from detached observer to involved partisan. The film is careful to avoid overt melodrama, but at the same time, it engages the emotions. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is the complexity and intelligence evident in the screenplay. The unique angle of the film is in itself unusual, a thriller that follows the villains.It's 1984 in East Berlin, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi who investigate civilians suspected of undermining government authority. That's why when Stasi Capt. Wiesler first sets eyes on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), he doesn't like him. Dreyman, by all accounts, is a loyal socialist, but the captain sees the playwright -- handsome and self-possessed, at home with himself as he watches his latest play -- and pronounces him ""arrogant."" Dreyman is a happy man -- an artist in love with his work and with another artist, a great actress (Martina Gedeck) -- and that in itself makes him an enemy of the state. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are simply to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story, and although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption.Wiesler is a fascinating character, a blank slate if you will, trained to reflect no emotion whatsoever. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. He begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier of the state, to a man embracing emotions for the first time is the film's most compelling aspect throughout. The seduction depicted in ""The Lives of Others"" is inadvertent, and it's the allure of the beauty found in art, the exploration of the meaning of life, and the possibility of love, all of which are absent from Wiesler's existence. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desires leads him to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law, and places his career in jeopardy.The strength of ""The Lives of Others"" is that it works on numerous levels - especially in the way it approaches Wiesler's complexity as an individual, and that none of the characters are one-dimensional. An arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, accompanied by phenomenal performances and a terrific screenplay.

It's hard to imagine taking such a risk knowing the government is probably tracking your every move. Muhe (Wiesler) acted very well, forced to live vicariously through the people he spies on, desperately hoping for the same kind of personal connection that they have. In a world so closely monitored, the only retaliation one can take is relatively minor, so it's never a very thrilling or dramatic film.

"Life spared, life given","I watched this movie 10 years ago for the first time - today was my second, and barely anything has changed: Das Leben der Anderen is still a true masterpiece and one of the best movies of the 21st century. I am amazed that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck could have created something as powerful as this fantastic motion picture but then again I remember that he was the one behind Werk ohne Autor (2018) and, having checked his filmography, I see that he literally hadn't created anything in between those movies and I start to believe that miracles do happen, just not often enough. Das Leben der Anderen tells a story of a Stasi officer who is absolutely perfect at his job; he can crack anyone and he knows every bit of human psychology there is to know about to do the job well done, but the only person he wasn't able to have cracked turned out to be himself. There are a lot of things that we regret to have done but there are just as many that we regret we haven't and our whole life builds up on those deeds, right and wrong turns, and in the end all that's really left to ask yourself is if you can live with yourself despite everything you've done. After the movie's over you're left with this question on your hands too. 12/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well made, though certainly short of spectacular","Donnersmarck's much talked about film is certainly an impressive debut, pitting a suspenseful tale of political intrigue against East Germany's ultra-shady governmental proceedings during the mid-late 80's, but as per usual with most films containing any sort of bona-fide talent these days, remains over-hyped and over-rated. ...And a little overlong as well. Eventually many of the fairly dumbed-down script's (though certainly not by American mainstream standards) plot-twists become unimpressive, leaving me almost apathetic nearing the final stretch of character ambiguities. The film does end on a high note, rounding out some of the former repetitious tension (an oxymoron, no doubt) and lengthy chronology on a fairly just note. Just another one of the thousands of examples of excessive and lavish praise being heaped on a certain project, thereby dwarfing the effect from high expectations. The Lives of Others may gently explore many potent themes remaining crucial in our society today, though the film itself felt underwhelming to it's rewards ratio.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wild Trip into A Democratic Regime,"Today I watched the film for the second time along with my friends. After so many years, most details of the film have faded away from my memory, leaving only blurring sihouelletes. The altruism of the Stasi agent is one of the only impressions that remained unwashed before the revisit. However, this time what attracted my attention was not only the heroic act of Wiesler, but more keenly on the living state of those who suffered from a Orwellian society that they had no power nor courage to change.The main factor that may have reshaped my impression towards the film is my visit to North Korean last year, a regime whose first name is also ""Democratic"". As a consequence, I have had this surreal experience while those characters are walking around those bleak stone buildings in the dead of night, since I have also tried, albeit the discouragement of my guide, to take a walk on the street in Pyongyang after dinner. The tram, the quiet pedestrians who walked around, the deadly atmosphere were somewhat ignited in me, though most of them do not really bear any resemblance to the scenes in the film. My guide panicked after my disappearance from the hotel for about 15 minutes and summoned a few other guides to search for me. I was duly admonished on being found, and reminded that secret police might also be wandering the streets at the same evening, expecting an unexpected encounter with some hapless tourists who dare to step outside the prescribed realm. I was only to learn the story of Otto Warmbier after my brief adventure into the heart of DPRK, which gave me quite a shock when I look back at some of my casual behaviors that could have been perceived as disrespectful.I have gone on a tangent line here. I don't think it's a movie review anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An expertly filmed exposé on state-mandated voyeurism.,"Quantum Physics holds to a belief that you can never truly observe something without affecting it. The mere act of observation alters the state of the thing being observed to the point where we can never be sure of the accuracy of the observation. I say all this to set the stage for the wildly tense and enthralling Best Foreign Film Oscar-winner, The Lives of Others (2006). There's this weird dichotomy between voyeurism and being able to play God that makes this film so entertaining to watch, especially in the modern, surveillance-heavy society in which we live today (of which Person of Interest does an excellent job of exposing).Set in one of those rare historical moments right before the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Lives of Others hinges on the superb performance of Ulrich Mühe as the audience is never quite sure what he's going to do with the information he gleans from the individuals living beneath his surveillance station. There are vibes of Rear Window (1954) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) in The Lives of Others. The former speaks to the voyeurism and what one can do if they see or hear something that shouldn't be seen or heard. The latter dives into revolution and how entangled romantic and artistic lives can become with it.Aside from some fantastic and almost heartwarming plot twists, the suspense in this film is palpable. This suspense is only heightened by the incredible soundtrack that amps up the intensity when the audience knows what the people under surveillance do not. In the end, though, stories like this help emphasize the importance of individuals who see what's wrong with a regime and comply with the rulers...up to a point. Like Schindler's List (1993) before it, some of the true heroes of revolutions are those who are employed by the enemy and make it a point to be a force for good.An expertly filmed exposé on state-mandated voyeurism, I give The Lives of Others 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

reasons to be Human,"One of the living thinking minds i most admire is George Steiner. He is a man of great intelligence in the way he knows why knowledge is meaningful, and why it is important to Know. Among the many issues that have been a constant concern in his thinking life, one has been with me all the way since Steiner showed it to me: the brutal contradiction between human actions, or how he would put it; how can someone cry over night deeply moved by a Schubert Sonata, and in the next morning coldly order the killing of thousands of people.This fundamental issue was vivid in my mind all the way, throughout this happily depressing film. There even is a direct reference to this question in it. So the theme here is how the meanings of art, or the simple reference to it can influence a mind trained to not be influenced and mechanically not behave humanly. Minds trained to trust what they're taught.The way this is put together is with one of the most subtle cinematic constructions i have (ever?) seen. The focus is on the artists, repressed artists, subjugated by a repressive regime. In the world framed in this film everything moves around them. Those artists are watched, constantly. We watch them, and in that watching we have the company of someone whose job is literally to watch. He starts with cold inhumanity (the first scene establishes that), obsessive watching, which that regime would probably consider simply 'professional'.In the way he gets involved with the subject of his watching (artistically modeled lives). Several things underline this: Art bends his mind to the point in which he plays double and starts writing an invented story to protect the real story the play writer is writing; He steals a book from the subject he's watching, and secretly reads it at home; he asks a prostitute to stay with him longer than the deal would require, basically to be more than sex. Ultimately, he rewrites the ending of the whole story by hiding a forbidden object (a typewriter!) and thus secretly entering and changing the life of the artist.This is a perfect expression of the dangerous of true commitment to true art, the art which embraces ideas that matter.The camera is subtle, it moves most of the time, its movement doesn't call attention, but always add up to the tension, mostly with subtle travelings. And watch the use of space. See how the interior of the apartment is used, how the cinematography carefully captures all the nuances and how they enlarge and diminish the inner space, in accordance with what the characters feel. Than notice how the humanity of that coloured environment is contrasted with the attic where the watcher stands, and even how he abstractly recreates the space below, from the sound of it.Ulrich Mühe really had a deeply moving and intelligent performance. Very sad that he left us so early, here he really is something to look at, and performs fully in the field that most impresses me: that of subtlety, that kind of acting of great expression out of imperceptible moves. Most of it is in his face, so many times carefully framed.The aftermath of the thing is when the artist writes a book, supposedly about the story we just saw. As if the film we had just seen was in fact made from the book. I was lucky to watch such a film. what a privilege.Most of the times, i appreciate a film for its qualities as a vehicle for new/interesting ways to pass a story, or for how its visual quality/presentations gives me themes to dream about. This one works on the both previous aspects, but does it in a theme that matters. That's so rare.My opinion: 5/5, watch it if you want to feel more human.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the best foreign films in recent memory,"The Lives of Others is a German film that tells the story of two artists living in East Germany during the height of the Cold War. The Ministry for State Security, or Stasi, knows no limits to its surveillance power and has taken a special interest in the artistic community. Despite their unwavering faith to each other, we play witness as these two lives become further and further intertwined with the State Security. The Lives of Others will leave your heart pounding and mind racing as you become engrossed in a world of deceit and passion. The plot is methodically revealed to you in such a way that you're aware of where you're headed, but shocked when you get there. It draws you in and leaves you feeling as though you have truly peered into – the lives of others.Georg (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who walks the line between obedience to the Party and his moral compass. He frequently surrounds himself with intellectuals with more fervor than he, but manages to stay on the Party's good side. Change is a constant theme throughout the film and Georg's life is no exception. As he slowly sees his world crumbling before him he becomes more and more impassioned. A dear friend hanging himself is the catalyst for a shift in Georg's writing style. After such a traumatizing event his close friends no longer seem so radical.Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is Georg's girlfriend and actress in several of his plays. Their romance grows as the film progresses and leaves them both feeling as though nothing else matters. However, her flourishing acting career has garnered her some attention from the Stasi. She too is forced to choose between allegiance to the State and her moral well-being. Throughout the film her choices have the most impact on others. Although unreliable at times, we feel inexplicably drawn to her. Her presence on-screen is intoxicating, which is perhaps why we see events unfold as they do. Despite all evidence to the contrary we choose to trust where she takes us.Weisler (Ulrich Mühe) is a veteran of the Stasi and prisoner interrogation. A slave to his own stoicism, he leads a simple, calculated lifestyle that revolves around his allegiance to the State. He is well-versed in taking people to their breaking point and his latest assignment is to surveil Georg and Christa-Maria. As he immerses himself in their lives he begins to question everything around him and everything he's ever known. He travels deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole until he's completely lost his sense of up and down, and right from wrong. If Christa-Maria is the catalyst for change then Weisler's transformation creates the largest explosion.The Lives of Others leads you through a tangled web of interactions and leaves you feeling as though you yourself have been ensnared. Ulrich Mühe delivers a captivating performance, perhaps the best of his illustrious career. Overall the film was one of the best foreign films in recent memory, and was recognized as such. It won Best Foreign Film in 2006 after narrowly edging out another of the great foreign films in recent memory – Pans Labyrinth. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brilliantly commands the pace of the film through the lens of the camera, the claustrophobia inducing sets, and the haunting score. This film is definitely a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
don't believe the hype.,"i sat in the theatre for the entirety of the film waiting for that moment when i would be impressed, moved, shocked, or even just interested.......it never came. once about 30 to 40 minutes in to it is when i first said to myself ""this is supposded to be a brilliant and exciting film, and im utterly bored"". although subtitles can be blamed for taking some people out of the dramatic or even comedic films i have to date not been affected by subtitles, laughing out loud at ""boss of it all"", ""amelie"", and almost coming to tears during ""dreamlife of angels"". so that was not it. i just found this movie to be un-original, un-inspired, and poorly thought out. which ironicly is what most critics are praising it for. it had all the themes of a normal American thriller; good guys vs bad, government vs artists, big brother listening in, bad guy surprisingly learns lesson from good guy, etc. etc. if keifer sutherland and meg ryan played the lead roles in this with ed harris as the secret agent, this would be blown off by many critics im sure of it. but add some dramatic lighting, foreign launguage requiring subtitles, and set the film a few years back and suddenly all the art houses are flocking to show it. i honestly cant find one redemable quality in this film, one thing that i can say i learned or that they did well or that was new in any way. the plot has been done in different variations before, the actors were horrible (overacting in every scene), and the ending was about as Hollywood as it gets (to go into too much detail would ruin the ending, but basically good guy finds out bad guy, isn't so bad after all). i wish i could end this review by showing some way i share in the perspective of all the other critics who loved this movie, but i just plain cant. i thought it was awful, boring, poorly made, and offensive that so many American theatres are showing and praising it.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The Survival of the Individual Under the Cloud of Totalitarianism,"Das Leben der Anderen (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No freedom from the other side of the Wall, not even people's walls","""Beat your wife regularly, even if you don't know why, she will."" I doubt the Arabs really invented that saying but it seems like every totalitarian system was based on the idea that no one can make you feel guilty without your consent. Stasi didn't spy on potentially guilty people, but people were guilty already of that suspicion.Stasi: a simple whisper of that name was enough to send shivers down the spine of millions of citizens of the German Democratic Republic. It is not even far from reality to say that the population was divided in two: those who were spied and those who spied, some could slip through the net but for how long? The Stasi used spying and intimidating methods that had nothing to envy from the way Gestapo could treat the German population, and the opening of ""The Lives of Others"" sets the tone.Wiesler, a Stasi agent, is giving a course. He explains to his students the virtues of keeping a prisoner awaken for forty hours, the so-called arrogance he displays will inevitably be broken. With a no-nonsense didactic tone, he reveals all these little tricks that allow the police to spot the guilt, an innocent person will shout in rage, a guilty one will weep and beg for mercy, a truth will be formulated in different ways but a lie is always made of the same lines. It is tragic that such methods existed, and even more that they sometimes worked.With cold detachment but impressive competence, Wiesler says more about the Stasi than a one-hour documentary, and from the start, the young director Donnersmarck shows a remarkable attention to small details. Notice the scene when a student questions the humanity of the methods, everyone can see Wiesler putting a cross under his name but it's not in the mark, but in the discreet and smooth way he does it and then immediately answers the question. Notice also the prisoners asked to keep his palms on the chair so that the sweat on the cushion can be used for bloodhounds, this element never serves the film but it conveys one crucial element: the Stasi has an eye for detail, and so should we, if we want to appreciate or understand what happens.This attention to detail says even more: anyone could be submitted to surveillance on the basis of suspicion, something that doesn't feel 'right'. When Wiesler is invited to see a play from writer Dreirman (Frederick Koch), all it takes is a simple look at that handsome long-haired man with an opened shirt, and a lovely woman, actress Christa-Maria (Martyna Gedeck), to suggest an investigation. Dreyman did nothing wrong but he's too well-established to be totally clean and something about his friends doesn't feel Kosher, so the Minister (Thomas Thieme) approves, moved by selfish reasons. His last feat was to forbid acclaimed author Gershka to work, when Dreirman defends his friend, the Minister denies such things happen and invites Dreyman to moderate his words.Yet Gershka is the specter of what awaits Dreyman: losing your job, your contacts and the freedom to leave the country, not that everyone wanted to leave Germany, and the height of irony is that many artists were socialists (and would never be as creative as under the totalitarian regime). The veiled threats of the Minister, the situation of Gershka and the relative comfort bourgeois Dreirman lives in, are so many parameters to take into consideration, it's all about choices that jeopardize your life, it's a choice he has to make, and in the movie, choices are often driven by fear. It is very interesting that the biggest ""thrills"" of the film come from situations where we fear for the protagonists, so we have a taste of what life under this regime was.But what makes the story so unique is that we have two persons who couldn't have been more opposite. Dreyman represents life, conflicts, torments, problems with his work, friends, life, courage or lack of, while Wiesler is a professional agent: he's alone, all dressed in gray, has sex with prostitutes, it is like his existence has been totally dedicated to his job, but by following the daily life of Dreyman, a strange juxtaposition of feelings occurs, he starts to discover a strange one some would call ""empathy"". The film then becomes a character-study about a man who supposed to study people and we witness his slow but progressive coming-to-realization on the tragedy that people live. There's a magnificent scene with a little boy that shows how Wiesler's foundations are being shaken, for the best.Now, what is exactly ""Lives of Others"" about? Some would suggest that it is the intrusions into people's private lives and the lessons for today's generations, why are we so content to share our opinions and private lives on social media while they can backfire at us? And what lessons can the free world give when the threats of aggression from the exterior are always served as excuses to intrude into people's private lives? Recently, my Facebook account was blocked because I used a nickname, I'm supposed to send them an ID card to have my account back, that alone gives me an idea of how deeply attached to my privacy I am. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Stasi is that it is somewhat relevant today, in this post-9/11 world.Or maybe the film is simply about goodness and humanity? About the fact that a malevolent presence can as well become a guardian angel, because it takes to get deeper in people's lives, to feel their flaws and weaknesses to realize the extent of the harm... On many levels, the film is inspirational and no one can't resist to the ending, a magnificent visual epitaph from Ulrich Muhe who sadly passed away one year after the film, but whose performance enriched the lives of the ""others"" that we -movie lovers- are.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best film of 2006...,"2006 was a vintage year for films; you only have to look at the nominations for best picture and best foreign language film - all of them great movies. But, The Lives of Others edges it for me.Parasite has set a precedent for a film in a foreign language winning the major award. I believe if the academy had adopted this policy earlier of including all films for consideration when choosing the top prize, then this would have won the best picture Oscar for 2006.

It's a very well put together film, with great acting, cinematography and cutting.The writing is also incredible, showcasing some very important messages and delving into this time period and its dilemmas in eye-opening ways. It's an important piece to help people remember.As an artistic work of art, it is, as stated above, also very well worth checking out. The director is acclaimed, and I have watched many of his works.

everything wrong with ...,"The Film is loosely based on the life of GDR Author Christoph Hein to which Donnersmark spoken for some hours in 2002. After seeing the movie he was very disapointed of the movie. The GDR was a unjust state and the infamous Stasi is a fact to. But the description of life and work in the 1980 GDR was very different, to that shown in the movie.
I'm German and of cause proud when a fellow countryman wins an Oscar, but not in this case. And now, 2019, knowing the other Donnersmark Movies ""The Tourist"" and ""Werk ohne Autor - Never Look Away"" (based on the life of German Painter Gerhard Richter - who hates the film and took distance), I must say, it went downhill for Donnersmark from there. Americans seem to love this kind of history telling, since ""Never look away"" is an Oscar nominee in 2019.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A gripping tale of surveillance and humanity,"""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others), directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, is a compelling drama set in East Germany during the 1980s. The film delves into the oppressive atmosphere of the GDR, where the Stasi, the secret police, monitor and control the lives of its citizens.The story centers on Captain Gerd Wiesler, portrayed by Ulrich Mühe, a dedicated Stasi officer assigned to spy on a playwright, Georg Dreyman, and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland. As Wiesler becomes increasingly immersed in their lives, he finds his loyalty to the regime tested and begins to question his own beliefs and morals.What makes ""Das Leben der Anderen"" stand out is its meticulous portrayal of surveillance and its impact on human relationships. The film is a slow-burning, thought-provoking examination of power, trust, and redemption. Ulrich Mühe's nuanced performance is particularly noteworthy, capturing Wiesler's transformation with subtlety and depth.The film's somber tone and meticulous attention to historical detail create a hauntingly realistic depiction of life under a repressive regime. While the pacing may be slow for some, the powerful narrative and emotional resonance make ""Das Leben der Anderen"" a profound and memorable viewing experience. It's a film that leaves a lasting impression, reflecting on the complexities of humanity within a system designed to strip it away.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid film that never ascends into greatness,"There are two types of films that typically make it into the IMDb Top 250. Extremely inventive or entertaining films that critics may not love as much, like 'The Usual Suspects'. Then there are films that are unarguably well made and hit all the right points, but aren't very fun to watch. 'The Lives of Others' is the latter. It's smart and it hits all the right notes along the way, but it ultimately feels empty.As you're watching you keep thinking, ahh yes very clever, very clever, that was smart, oh I liked that. But then all you want is the film to knock you over with an impossibly powerful moment, or do something that just takes your breathe away. And it never comes. The film does try to do this actually with a certain scene near the end, but it fell very flat for me.I will say I absolutely loved the final line in the movie. That was well done and as a lasting impression on your audience is probably a reason the film is rated so highly. For me it wasn't enough though. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Malevolent presence,"I had no idea the world of The Lives of Others would fascinate me so much. I don't give much cred to Oscar winners, foreign or otherwise. Yet I was lucky to grow up in a country that just barely escaped the iron grip of communism but at the same time one that existed just outside of that reach, every now and then the Iron Curtain would be lifted and something would filter through, groping violently in a society that is still deeply class divided to this day. I didn't live through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat but I remember Zastavas and Ladas and old beatup Yugos in the streets and Gorbachev in the news, and a few days ago, on the 17th of November, we celebrated the fall of the military junta of '68, a totalitarian regime that existed on the backs of its own type of Stasi and oppression of human rights. This is still fresh and emblematic in our national memory, so this film hits home in ways someone born in America is lucky never to have to deal with even in retrospect.If I like this so much it's because it's something at once familiar and otherworldly, mysterious and horrifying because some of the features are known to me but not the whole, because it takes place in cold empty streets and gray apartment rises all identical to one another that remind me of cold Berlin neighborhoods I visited, characters groping for identity and expression in surroundings that deny them. It's all very crushing because ideology is not the end but the means by which selfish men can pursue selfish goals, because a figurative heaven where things for Georg and Marie would be fine exists in the very same city, just outside a dividing wall, across the street. Streets are empty because something keeps people from venturing out, and I like how that urban desert of fear and suspicion is shown to seep inside living-rooms, behind closed doors a malevolent presence groping blindly and unseen there.The only thing amiss here for me is that The Lives of Others tries to exist in a state of matter-of-factly observation. I would love to see a Zulawski version, character emotions swirling in violent storms, or one made by a New Wave minimalist, where faces are mute and the silence deafening. Von Donnermarck's movie is a little too concerned with going with the flow of established filmmaking, of what is immediately expected and accepted by this type of film. I wanted to see it make breaches with the audience, to be difficult and not give us all that we want. The storytelling is perfect but at the expense of that poetic extension where things are allowed to linger in the mind and be metaphors, enigmas, mysteries haunting and supine.The marvelous thing about it is that it has amazing characters. I like how they not only rise to moral standards in affirmation of the human spirit but also fall from them with the same affirmation. Marie's final betrayal is crushing, she sells both soul and body, and it's tragic because she's damned even before she's allowed that choice. I like how the film doesn't end with the cathartic note, with the bang. We're given the echo, the aftermath. The regime has fallen but the former minister still attends the theater, still wearing an expensive suit. That malevolent presence has seeped out, it always does to fight another day. Former DDR politicians now have lucrative careers as advisers like former KGB officials in Russia are now political barons. But the failings of a political system that cheated people on the base of ideology are shown in chilling detail, and more, the lives behind all that, with their small triumphs and follies, crushed by that system but with that small beacon of humanity, pride or dignity, still intact.",,Anonymous,Mystery
HGW XX/7,"The film delves into the depths of human nature, portraying a story of choice, self-sacrifice, and courage against the backdrop of a ruthless party system and total control. It's a tale of a man who, defying all odds, becomes a protector and guardian, risking his life for a stranger. A man who manages to transcend his own essence and make a choice that was not only forbidden to him but had never even formed in his consciousness.This remarkable film evokes complex and contradictory feelings. For much of its runtime, you feel as if you're in constant tension, afraid to ""say or think something unnecessary."" You catch fleeting glimpses of the emotions gradually emerging in the characters: Wiesler-quietly undergoing a profound transformation, and Gerd-with his subtle tragedy that touches the very soul. It's hard not to think that even machines are capable of feeling.Ulrich Mühe masterfully embodied the character of Gerd, portraying his precision, loyalty to the party, and his slowly awakening humanity. His gaze alone is a phenomenon. Many actors rely on facial expressions to convey emotion, but Ulrich needed only his piercing blue eyes to say it all.Sebastian Koch, in the role of Georg Dreyman, captivates with his sincerity and depth. Every emotion-joy, pain, shock, despair-is vividly expressed in each frame, making his character truly alive. A brilliant performance! Martina Gedeck, who played Christa, may not fit the mold of a classic beauty, but her character combines fatal allure, tender vulnerability, and inner conflict. She portrays her role so naturally that it's impossible to look away.The impeccable direction, editing, and a powerful musical score create incredible tension and keep the audience emotionally engaged throughout the film. One unforgettable scene is when Dreyman learns of Jerska's death and sits down at the piano to play his music. These moments are profoundly moving.The numerous awards, nominations, glowing reviews from critics, audience recognition, and impressive box office success speak for themselves. This is a living, soul-stirring film that is worth seeing. And perhaps revisiting multiple times-because every viewing brings new emotions and leaves a poignant feeling that culminates in the finale, where the film ultimately seizes your heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Despite so much oppression and terror, there is some intellectual life, with plays, music, books and some discreet bohemian life.But the problem is that the secret police is everywhere, and being a freethinker will cause you trouble. The movie is essentially about an efficient police operative, who slowly regains his humanity tries to help a couple that is going to be arrested soon, and he is the one responsible for spying on them.The movie is a piece of fiction (we don't know whether there were cases of good Samaritans among East German police), but it feels almost like a documentary.

The Walls Have Ears,"You enter your room. Everything is fine and where it should be. Your coat is on the rack, your partner in the shower, and your cigarette still smoldering in the ashtray. Behind the walls and under light switches there are microphones and wires running into someone's headphones. You are not alone.Neither are the people of East Germany. In Das Leben der Anderen, we get to hear what goes on and who is doing the listening. Translated, The Lives of Others is exactly what it says: it's about the lives of others, someone's life other than yours.Throughout East Germany in the 70's and 80's, wiretaps and surveillances were placed amongst civilians considered to be a threat to the government. They would interrogate these targets until deemed necessary or when the information they wanted was acquired.Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is a member of the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany. He and his colleagues suspect a local writer Georg Dreyman of conspiring against the government. Georg and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland, an actress in Georg's play, live together in harmony. Behind Georg's back, she has been seeing a high ranking government official to keep her name and her husbands ""hush-hush"" so they may live peacefully. All is heard through Wiesler's headphones.After a 20 minutes sweep of the apartment, all areas of the home are covered. Wiesler's men work swift and efficiently. It is obvious that this is not something new but very routine. In 20 minutes they have managed to find all the necessary locations for their equipment to be placed, work correctly, and be unseen to the untrained eye. Wiesler finds a perfect place for his operations to be located: right above the cozy apartment.Everything is in place, the pieces aligned, and mikes turned on. Operation ""Lazlo"" as it has been dubbed is ready to go. All they need is to hear one mention of treason and they storm the building and take them away. Easier said then done. Wiesler's friends get involved and so does Wiesler. One element wasn't accounted for in the briefing: compassion.There are several moments in the film where you feel bad for the people involved. Wiesler is spying on people who he comes to admire and wants to help them. In the opening of the movie, we see him teaching to a class explaining the proper technique to interrogating a person. His ruthless tactics and harshness towards his comrades make him seem almost inhuman. As the film progresses we see more of a compassionate and touched person than before.Georg and Christa have their own problems and to top it all off, their friends who have been black listed and spied on realize the danger that everyone is in. Their are eyes everywhere and no one knows where, except the only place that is considered a safe haven is Georg's place which ironically is the one being monitored.Technically it is very sound and very well put together. The editing is flawless, going from the attic with Wiesler listening to Georg's apartment and the actions going on inside. What really makes this fantastic story work is the acting. Brilliant performances from Ulrich Mühe (Wiesler), Sebastian Koch (Georg), and Martina Gedeck (Christa) boost the intensity and drama of the story to a new level. Another standout performance comes from Wiesler's friend, coworker, and overseer of the operation Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz played by Ulrich Tukur.The power and energy of The Lives of Others stems from the time period that it takes place in. The people are cautious and aware that they might have some unwanted visitors listening in. What is one to do when they can't leave the country but if they stay they are in danger?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Taut and rather powerful German thriller focusing on the power struggle between a handful of people towards the end of a controlling era.,"The world in which The Lives of Others is set is a grey and frightening one; one that evokes fear, suspicion and tension. It takes place in a world and at a time that really existed; and amongst the vast, vast annuals of history - the period, or 'era', of mid 1980s East Germany is a fairly recent time and place as to which dramatic events should be observed as they play out. We may not be looking at a period in history that shaped how the world would turn out; nor indeed are we focusing on individual events or wars that formed new nations and beliefs - rather, the focus is on a handful of people and how their own lives are shaped by the state. The Lives of Others is more of a minute piece, it has that cold and intimate feel to it; that precise sensation of something being studied and etched out playing out amidst the Soviet controlled nation that was East Germany in the not so long ago late 20th Century.The film is ten times the piece the recent Bourne sequels are. As a film exploring the practise of eavesdropping, spying and espionage; director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck opts for the polar opposite approach by painting a very grim and ominous backdrop of the time and setting via the cinematography, and constructs his film in a slow and very precise manner. Perhaps slow is the wrong word, I'm thinking more along the lines of 'calm' and 'patient', evoking a very visceral sensation for a lot of the time that reflects the action of spying and eavesdropping: a calm and patient approach to a task that takes time.The film is the second of recent times from German film-makers exploring Germany's past and identifying past ideologies and beliefs. The other is Die Welle (The Wave), a film that explored the fanaticism and national interest behind politics and how seemingly easy it was to install a charismatic leader, garner attention and form minority factions amongst everyone else. The Lives of Others is a piece exploring Germany's past Communist driven areas, almost the whole of the East in particular, and how power; paranoia; gradual obsession and seemingly absurd political demands can lead to fear plus the actual eventual demise of people's lives.The film is a series of exchanges between three primary individuals; a game of power play if you will. Sebastian Koch plays Georg Dreyman, a playwright living with a certain Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck) in East Germany, circa 1984. After attending one of his plays and observing the goings-on, Gerd Wiesler (Mühe) is adamant the above writer is suspicious enough to warrant a number of bugs be fitted to his apartment so that spying can be carried out, and observations made. When we are first introduced to Mühe's Wiesler, a lecture he is giving to budding students of the secret police are studying the arts of interrogation; an interrogation which is being revealed in tandem with the speech as the young learners watch on. The following scene sees Wiesler himself as an audience member, watching on from the confines of a balcony as a play gets underway. The notion of watching-on is made aware early on to us, that parallel between students observing a lecture and picking up on things followed by the teacher himself observing a performance and having his suspicions is apparent.Mühe plays Wiesler to an absolute tee. His performance feels detached from the rest of the film, but in the nicest possible way - the manner in which he plays the character gives off an uncanny sense about him, as if he has stumbled in off another production. As everyone else around him performs to whatever degree they see fit, Mühe elevates his character onto another realm; echoing what other actors such as Hopkins and Bardem did in The Silence of the Lambs and No Country for Old Men, respectively. He comes across as colder than everyone else, as if he's been beamed in from another far off place. Wiesler is extremely robotic in his actions and movement, constantly clad in grey and neutral colours and nary giving much away by way of facial expressions. The man is creepy and mechanical in movement and professionalism; he speaks in short and to-the-point sentences and phrases. There's an odd scene in which he is caught asleep during a late eavesdropping session on Dreyman and his partner by the guy on the next shift; after which he gets up, thoroughly embarrassed and somewhat ashamed that he's been caught looking like a human being.The film will branch out into all sorts of bother for the leads, in the sense illegal publications of articles on suicides and unregistered typewriters will be the order of the day. The film touches on themes of honour and guilt as Maria gets involved a little too deeply, and certain revelations cause Wiesler himself to question where his loyalties lie. Drenched in a metallic, stone-cold look and with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar under its belt, The Lives of Others is an interesting and brooding period piece that shines thanks to its impeccable directing, individual acting performances and menacing narrative complimenting its menacing aura.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.""","By 1984, East Germany had been gripped for almost four decades in a Stalinist reign of terror. Since 1971, it was headed by Erich Honecker, the builder of the Berlin Wall. The Wall and its architect were toppled almost simultaneously. Wanted for war crimes, unwelcome even in Yeltsin's Russia, Honecker was extradited from Moscow to a now-unified Germany in 1992. Shortly after the onset of his murder trial, for health reasons, he was released to Chile in 1993. At the time, Chile was still protective of aging, bloody former dictators, whether U.S. or Soviet-sponsored. Like Pinochet, he died in disgrace.In ""Lives,"" beginning in 1984, East German secret police (Stasi) inquisitor Hauptmann (Captain) Gerd Wiesler wrestles with a similar dilemma as did Winston Smith in Orwell's ""1984.""Although this film is a gripping exposition of the corruption, dehumanization and immorality of that actual former totalitarian state, in these times of Ashcroft and Gonzales, Bush and Cheney, it should be cautionary to U.S. residents as well.Pay particular attention to the cast of characters in the ""steam room"" during the announcement of the fall, five years after the movie begins.And mind what you say.

"Brilliant , but you to have been there at the time...","I just watched this film on BBC2 last night, had never heard of it before but was captivated.I never went to the former DDR until last year, but worked in West Germany at exactly the time portrayed here, the mid-1980's, height of the Reagan area. There was a huge feeling of rivalry between West and East Germany, every product which by then was coming over from the ""Ostis"" was derided in West Germany. There are also hints of the former tension between Prussia, and Saxony which was 100% in the East. Certainly any report in ""Der Spiegel"" would have triggered such a fury in the ranks of the East German regime at that time.I met someone who had just come over from the East, working in a factory. He was genuinely scared, like the guard in the canteen, of making jokes about the regime, in my case I made a joke on a tram ride with him about the USSR football team beating Hungary 4-0.To me the weirdest part is the STASI typewriter-expert, who can tell where all the official typewriters are and what makes etc. What happened to this kind of nerd when the Wall came down?All in all a gripping film, well-acted.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Lives of Others,"This isn't so much a thriller as a glaring example of the corrupting power of the state, and of those charged with crafting and implementing it's policies. ""Dreyman"" (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is popular with the communist elite because his works manage to extol the virtues of their people's republic. The minister ""Hempf"" (Thomas Thieme) goes through all the supportive motions with him, but meantime asks the Stasi to keep an eye on him. The very ambitious ""Grubitz"" (Ulrich Tukur) selects his meticulous colleague ""Wiesler"" (Ulrich Mühe) to manage the surveillance and off we go. What dawns on them very quickly is that they are being used by the politician to discredit the writer for an altogether different reason. He has designs on actress ""Christa-Maria"" (Martina Gedeck) who just happens to be the girlfriend of their new quarry. She has very reluctantly agreed to his advances in the past, but on the basis that resistance would be pretty futile as he is not a man to be crossed. If they needed proof of that, they just have to look at the ostracised ""Jerska"" (Volkmar Kleinart) who is now reduced to living in a glorified flat share and who cannot get any work. The hitherto unshakeable loyalty of ""Wiesler"" starts to wobble a bit now. He dislikes being used and as his surveillance continues, he realises that maybe his targets are not the right ones! Gradually, the internecine and political elements close in on all of them and as pressure grows to deliver results, things take a tragic turn for just about everyone. It's quite a potently paced and cleverly written indictment of totalitarian regimes, this. The people live in fear and so conform; the state controls all aspects of the infrastructure of daily life and those who have climbed the greasy red pole soon display all the Orwellian credentials of his ""Napoleon"" from ""Animal Farm"". Plaudits must go to Gedeck who plays well the conflicted character who must juggle her love and her life and to Mühe who shows that as a former master of the indoctrinating arts, ""Wiesler"" too might be capable of change. Of humanity even. There's a fun scene where one of their colleagues is telling a joke about Erich Honecker and is accidentally overheard.

A Terrific Tale,"""The Lives of Others"" won the ""Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film"". That's the reason why most (including me) noticed this film and watched it. Having watched it, the only thing that comes into my mind is the sheer brilliance achieved by this movie in every aspect. Starting from the storyline to casting to direction to the ending that will leave you feeling so sympathetic about the people involved in the film.Cast wise, just brilliant. Obviously, any non-German will find no recognizable face. But what a job each of them delivers. The primary cast is so awesome; making everyone takes notice of their immense talent.The entire atmosphere of the film is very sordid, making the overall feel more realistic considering the theme of the movie. The way the story unfolds is so splendidly captured by the Director, that even at a running time of more than 2 hours, one never stop feeling for the characters. The score perfectly pitches to the sordid atmosphere.Overall, it's a must watch film. It's terrible that such movies need Awards and Recognitions before being noticed. This movie deservingly deserves every award. My Verdict: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
1984 in Real Life -- Possible Spoilers,"Set in East Berlin in the mid-1980's -- ""The Life of Others"" in the version shown in the United States -- this film comes closer to bringing Orwell's terrifying satire to life than any other picture I've seen about life behind the Iron Curtain. A free-thinking but cautious playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), is targeted by the Stasi, the notorious East German secret police, because a powerful minister, Hempf (Thomas Thieme), wants to have the noted actress and Dreyman's live-in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), available to him sexually whenever he wants. A Stasi officer, Gerd Wiesler, (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), the task of wiring Dreyman's apartment and collecting the necessary incriminating evidence. Interplay between Hempf, Grubitz, and Wiesler displays a menacing hierarchical relationship while Dreyman goes about his business believing he is free of suspicion. Meanwhile, Ms. Sieland is under direct pressure from oily Minister Hempf to surrender her body as the price of being allowed to perform her craft. Wiesler's growing sympathy for Ms. Sieland and for Dreyman seems highly improbable and the outcome is melodramatic -- but it is a movie, after all, and improbabilities and melodrama are coin of the realm. The writer and director, Florian Henckel von Donnenmarck, deserves all the honors he won for this film, including a best foreign film Oscar",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As evil is still dominating...,"I just feel a little tired of the flicks telling me that there were good and kind Germans during the cruel times: The Pianist, Sophie Scholl, Rosenstrasse or even ""The Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich"". However kind these good-natured people were, the collective evil of the regimes like the Nazi and communist syndicate can never be evened up. Which side was more powerful, destructively speaking? The emotional switches of HGW were not convincing. Picture that: his country is the fascist East Germany and he is at a fairly important position among the secret police. He knows every tricks and is highly skilled, experienced, well-versed in interrogation. How can that happen? Concealing what he has listened to without reporting it? How dare he? On the contrary, the actress's betrayal is true to its utmost in real life, though.Many shared with me that it is a fantastic work. True, fantastic in acting, music and many others... I am not being cynical or skeptical, or maybe I am too old at heart and too worldly-experienced about human beings that I just cannot believe that could happen in former East Germany. No way. Human atrocity onto its own species still prevails. Let's wake up and read the news about Iraq, the many civil wars or genocide in Africa, tension in Middle East... The globe is still rotating and human beings are still killing and persecuting one another.Anyway, danke schön! It's a good movie. But, ""I would like it gift wrapped as it's not for me.""

The Lives Of Others Will Greatly Affect Yours,"The film writing and directorial debut of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives Of Others) is a German drama set in East Berlin in the last years of Communism in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Telling the tale of an artistic couple being continually watched, recorded and filmed by members of the ""Stasi"", the East German secret police, as he is suspected of creating subversive plays undermining the state and she is lusted after by a highly ranked official. Successfully nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film"", ""The Lives Of Others"" is a highly moral and politically charged film that will demand as much emotion and choice from its audience as it does from its protagonists.While the directorial cinematography is lush and crisp, with ""Donnersmarck"" using subtle tones of greys and greens to emphasis the drab, bleak existence in East Germany it is the characterisation within the film that makes this such an engaging and emotional experience. The cast is led superbly by Ulrich Muhe who delivers a stunning performance as ""Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler"" who is charged with leading the investigation into the alleged deviants. He is backed up exceptionally by Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch as ""Christa-Maria Sieland"" and ""Geog Dreyman"", respectively, who provide the necessary emotional tension to pull entrap the audience. With all three of these performances, each has to deal with and convey different emotions on their moralistic standpoints, in differing fashions when their whole lives are threatened. Muhe finds himself increasingly involved and engrossed by the drama that is the lives of those he is watching, he finds his unwavering dedication to the Stasi to be brought into question when his reasoning is brought into doubt. Through watching and listening to the idealistic principles of the artistic couple beneath him, doubt slowly creeps into his conscious and he must begin to make a decision as to whether he can continue to justify harming the lives of innocent individuals. Sieland and Dreyman, however, must decide whether they can continue to live their lives as lies, will they sacrifice their artistic freedom to avoid persecution and interference from the state. ""The Lives Of Others"" skillfully leads us down their respective paths as we watch with hope, fear and trepidation at the choices they make.What separates ""The Lives Of Others"" from contemporary dramas of the same styling is the subtlety with which the script has been written and the delivery of those underpinning emotions by the actors. The director builds up immense tension from scenes where very little action is taking place, whether it's Muhe simply listening to a telephone conversation through his headphones or Dreyman hiding a typewriter, Donnersmarck ratchets up the heart rate with such delicate ease. Each of the main protagonists delivers their own unique style of performance to enhance the enclosed feel of the investigation. Gedecks' ""Sielands"" fall from grace is a harrowing and heart breaking affair, as the demure and regal persona falls to reveal a fractured and pained woman, desperately fighting to save her acting career. Koch's ""Dreyman"" is almost the reversal of his female counterpart, starting off as somewhat of a shell, kowtowing to his communist masters yet internally yearning to express himself as he would want. His increased risky disposition is taken under the naive belief that the state have not got him under surveillance which of course leaves everything in the confused hands of Wiesler. From cold, hard calculating man who claims ""the best way to establish guilt...is non-stop interrogation"" to having to question himself as a human being, Wiesler's journey is the keystone which holds the rest in place and Muhe's understated motions of raising an eyebrow here to pursing his lips tell so many stories of his internal strife and is an absolute joy to behold.""The Lives Of Others"" is an exceptional film that is not merely worthy of 2007's ""Best Foreign Film"" Academy Award but of claims that it is perhaps not simply the greatest film of that year, but of the decade as a whole. It in itself is an absolute joke that this and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" weren't in the ""Best Picture"" category regardless of their origins, because the skill with which the director and his cast weave their intricate web and have you riveted as an audience, is an art form to never grow tired of. Donnersmarck's debut is a thoroughly engaging affair that highlights not just European cinema, but cinema as a whole. It is a life affirming experience that will warm your heart and bring a tear to your eye, it will have you utterly entranced for its duration and will leave a mark on your character. The tale of others' lives, their strife, their desires, their wants and their dreams is an experience that will greatly affect yours.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.,"You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.The theme of the movie is complex to construe coz it has many layers, its very humane as a theme and brings very gross realities as a human being. Setup in the 1980's Germany where it was still divided and it was in East Germany about an artist couple, a writer and an actress being watched over by the Stasi, by HGW XX/7 the code name of the Policeman who wil note the records of what the couple does all through. This policeman played by Ulrich Muhe is the protagonist of the film. Now, the whole movie drives with his writings, his listenings and what he makes out of them. Truth is kept alive by this man and that is what he lives for, for truth.Now, few movies have a very engrossing screenplay from first frame and this one has it and deservingly is one of the best films in terms of story and screenplay, the direction is so well done that never for a slightest moment did I feel that something was out of place or it is uncalled for, everything went as per the script which is the true hero. There are no aberrations as such as each character is etched out superbly. You cannot write characters as black and white coz there is a flaw in each and that's what is shown.It's one of the few films that is supremely human and music too has it's own place to bring out humanity, like reference of Lenin's quote on Betthoven's symphony.

Political and moral stand-points of view from the movie,"Though it is a time piece, you can extract underlying passages from it, and mentally apply the into modern life, for instance the US government imposing of the ""Patriot Act"" and other kinds of political erratic behavior; not only from the current administration but also by past democrat presidencies as well, which threatens the widely known notion of ""freedom, justice and the American way"" the US preaches. But not only in USA but more currently in amazingly ""1st"" and ""2nd"" world countries also Even though the piece is conceived and viewed form a politically and morally individualistic point of view, there are several implications to the ramifications of the actions of governments (the people)oppress and suppress the its population. Personally I have ambivalent feelings with the opinion of ""Stassiland"" author Anna Funder for whom the point of view of the director is to optimistic and uplifting, ""a superb movie but not very realistic""; the characters portrayed are the same as anyone any where everywhere and anytime; be it (apropiate here or not for some)Nazi German, Ruanda in the mid 90's or Turkey during the 1913; no matter how dark it may seem or different the circumstances, the perpetrators remain the same, they are red-blooded human beings with capacity for both good and for evil as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Undoubtedly, deserved an Oscar","This film is in my favorite five foreign films list. I was not very much familiar with the background of East Germany. I was shocked to see under what enormous pressure a lot of East Germans had to live. In this film, Georg Dreyman is a dramatist and Christa-Maria Sieland is an actress and his girlfriend. As East German politicians were influenced by Russians, it was considered almost criminal to be associated with West German. And, Georg and Christa and their friends are associated with West side. The Minister of Culture becomes interested in Christa, so the secret service agent Wiesler is instructed to observe and sound out the couple.And from here the story becomes complicated. The minister of culture just want to sexually exploit Christa, and on one night he succeeds in doing that, he rapes her. Georg understands that she is being followed by people of Minister. Wiesler, a Secret service agent empathizes with both of them and tries to help them but it is very difficult for Wiesler too, to help them.How, Wiesler sees Georg is a good person and he thinks whatever is done to him is bad. So, he tries to help him. The acting done by everybody is top notch. I have seen Ulrich Mühe before and knew he is a fine actor. Sebastian Koch (Gerog)and Martina Gedeck (Christa)were new to me. I was very impressed with how Sebastian acted. He did a splendid job. And, what can I say about Martina Gedeck, she is drop dead gorgeous even at the age of 45 in this film.But, once again the best performance is delivered by Ulrich Mühe. His expressions are exceptional in this film. I bumped onto this film when I was searching for best films ever made list on IMDb. I'm glad that I had the chance to view this film. I recommend this film to almost everybody irrespective of political knowledge and background of German partition and later their reunification.

One of German movies at its best. Highly Recommended!,"Bought the title on blu-ray 6 months ago because the movie got great rating and reviews, but just now I have finished watching the movie. And I feel very regret why not watching the movie the first the time I bought it.The movie is really amazing and might touch your heart a little, if not very much. The story about a German secret police officer, Wiesler, who brilliantly played by Ulrich Mühe. He is given a surveillance job by his superior to keep an eye and write a report consisting every single detail of the activities of Dreyman, a very famous stage writer and his beautiful girlfriend, Sieland. The Government of East Germany suspect him (Dreyman) of being pro communist. But in the end, Wiesler found out that he is innocent and feel there is an ugly conspiracy behind this surveillance that involves Dreyman, Sieland, and Minister Hempf.This movie is worth-watching and no doubt that this has won many awards because the script is well written and the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who did a magnificent job in his first feature.

Harrowing yet moving...,"I just finished watching a powerful German film which bagged the Best Foreign Film in the Oscars last year. I rarely use that description for a film: but the powerful aspect of ""The Lives of Others"" is its message of realistic optimism and compassion amidst the corruption and exploitation of human rights during the last few years of the Socialist Germany. If one is familiar with ""Goodbye, Lenin!""'s comic approach on the issue of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he will find the treatment of the story of the characters in ""The Lives of Others"" far more intense and frightening yet endearing as the secret agent in charge of spying on an artist and his lover becomes too involved in the couple's secret lives. Being a very vigilant servant of the System, Wiesler, the agent, knows that his risk of saving the artists who are attacking the GDR whom he has served for almost all his life is akin to throwing everything that matters to him. But why does he dare? The very answer to that is the gem that one can unfold upon getting involved in the lives of these characters.The performances were incredibly harrowing yet as moving as a beautifully composed sonata. This masterpiece from the director Von Donnersmarck probably is the best European film of this decade so far.There is a line at the latter part of the film which caught my attention... which probably is true for any country which underwent a major overhauling of its political system.

"Suspenseful, Nuanced Character Study Puts a Spotlight on a Little Known Aspect of the Cold War","Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich Mühe's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called ""Sonata for a Good Man"". It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola's classic surveillance thriller, The Conversation. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, ""Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark"". There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawless,"This is seriously one of the best movie I've ever watched.
Everything, from the original plot, the screenplay, photography, soundtrack and acting, was perfectly conceived and realized. There was no line which I thought was redundant or avoidable.
From the start of the movie, you are directly immersed into the living conditions of the DDR. The way STASI worked makes you realize that there was no thing such as personal space and freedom of thought.
It is then perfectly depicted what it really means being an artist inside this historical context.
I was not bored for one single second during the whole movie, and after having watched it dubbed in Italian, I also tried to watch it in German. Every character was really well portrayed, and the acting was simply superb.
It saddened me to read that Ulrich Mühe died only one year after the movie was released. His interpretation was outstanding, and the last line he pronounces ""Es ist für mich"" is so full of power after everything his character goes through.

I belatedly came to see this movie knowing nothing about the plot. Mesmerizingly acted and strangely moving.,"When my father visited me on a trip, we are obliged to go to the movies.The problem was there are no interesting movies in the month of May. Hollywood productions are slick with the emphasis on visual eye candy (like Spider-Man 3). We opted to see The Lives of Others when it came up on the Yahoo Movies theatre listing, remembering having heard the movie won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.As I have commented on that other nominated movie previously, Pan's Labyrinth lost the Oscar, deservedly because of its repulsive horror content. Contrast a morbid historical fantasy movie emphasizing the evils of Fascism to an evenly paced and tightly plotted movie that sent the genuine shock wave ripple effect to the movie lovers who desperately wanted Mexican director Guellermo del Toro to grab an Academy Award at last. I honestly expected Pan's Labyrinth to win the coveted prize, but I was nonetheless pleased with the outcome even though I never heard of The Lives of Others.I kept missing the movie for a couple months because of busy schedule. Then it disappeared in mid-April. I was dismayed that I would have to wait for video. But when my father came over to visit me, the movie popped up unexpectedly on the theatre listing for the last-chance one-week engagement. I had never heard of a movie *returning * to the theatre nearly a month after the initial run, so I thought it might be a must-see.I refuse to explain what the movie is about. That's not only redundant but for an excellent reason. My father and I came in knowing *nothing* about the basic plot except that it won an Oscar. The lack of pre-screening knowledge contributed to one of the best cinematic experiences my father and I had ever experienced. The screening was nearly packed with older moviegoers and I was surprised to see younger high school and college-age boys and girls. I thought American young people don't even bother to see a foreign language movie with English subtitles because of their natural predisposition to avoid any movie that have English subtitles requiring them to read, much to their irritation. Apocalypto is another movie like that, but The Lives of Others is a heavy drama and I found it very unorthodox that young people would bother to see the movie unless they take German language class for credits.When the ending was concluded on a grand note, it moved the whole audience to lump throat and tears. I had not seen this widely affecting reaction since Titanic. We had misty eyes but resisted tears to drop only because we didn't bring Kleenex. The fact that it's not only well-made in structure, pacing and cinematography but also feature the finest ensemble acting in a long time is a testimony to the artistic expression of cinema that is both entertaining and profound. The Lives of Others is almost neo-realist to an extent that the audience feel empathy for the few characters.Ulrich Mühe, the German equivalent of Kevin Spacey, gave one of the best male performances ever captured on film. This is not a single-minded praise. I have seen very few performances that are astonishingly in-depth in raising the bar of acting to impossible heights. Wonderful examples are Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot and Gangs of New York; Peter Finch as Howard Beale in Network; Russell Crowe in The Insider; Warren Oates in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia; Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs and Peter Sellers in Being There. Ulrich deserves a memorial in cinematic history for the incredible broad range of tight expression in nuanced facial and body language not usually achieved since the Silent era.I highly recommend The Lives of Others; there's no other words to describe the experience I had watching the movie in the screening. It's pure cinema magic that is so rare in philosophically profound movie-going experience one may experience it once every decade.William F. Buckley, Jr, the editor in chief of the right-wing magazine National Review, wrote a column that commend the aesthetic and artistic quality of the movie by stating it's the best movie he had ever seen. Normally I am aversive to radical right-wing ideologues, but this time I agree with William's view.The movie is R rated for nudity and sex scenes, but it's such a profoundly moving picture that I urge my strictly conservative mother, who despise R-rated movies because of vulgar content she find abhorrent, and she agreed to view the movie after the arrival of the video release. I never recommend R-rated movies to my mother with the sole exception of Dancer in the Dark, but The Lives of Others have won my respect enough to recommend to her.**** out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
First German Movie - not disappointed!,"I went into this movie knowing nothing but it's rating. After, my friends and I sat in a near coffee house staring at our expressions of ""Wow!"" The ratings are not lying, this movie is great.Wiesler, played by Ulrich Mühe, is a professor who investigates/interrogates ""enemies of Socialist party of Germany"". Under the request of his superiors, he investigates a play writer, Georg (Sebastian Koch). Georg's apartment is bugged and he is surveillanced 24/7. Wiesler, a systematic tool of the system and lacking a personal touch in life, joins the Socialist party due to unrealistic ideals - this party is strong and helps the German people. While watching Georg, he is touched by how strong and good this play writer is. Lives of Another portrays how the two effect each other (and hopefully the audience).The written detail is impressive. There is a scene where Wiesler reads aloud a passage in a book. My memory took me back to English class where the teacher would point out a poem or tangent the author wrote. While trying to explain the relevancy of this ""tangent"", I always felt the writer added this part for filler or to push the story. But in Lives of Another, these little passages, plays, or conversations had relevancy to the characters and carefully planned. Details such as: how much Georg valued his significant other and why, how powerful art is to change someone, and how someone can sacrifice oneself to be who they are.The ideals and messages are wonderful too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Riveting and stunning film,"Wow, what an incredible experience. This German film is a dazzling document of the end days to a dark chapter in the human experiment. It is intelligent, suspenseful, claustrophobic and above all, profoundly moving in a manner that is devoid of cheap sentimentality and refreshingly understated. The cinematography and dialogue often seem inspired by the film noir of Fritz Lang and others. The performances, all from veteran German actors of film and stage, are convincing and haunting. 1984 East Germany is brilliantly recreated in its architecture, fashions and soundtrack. Not only does the movie convey the incredibly sad and pointless destruction of so many wasted lives under a corrupt totalitarian regime, but at its core, depicts the gradual disillusionment of its central character, a Stasi true believer, as he painfully reclaims his humanity at immense personal cost to his life and career. The ending rings true and is not in the superficially overdone style of too much of what comes out of Hollywood these days. This film left me under its spell for days after I watched it. I look forward to seeing it again and again. Its amazing that this is the director's first film and it richly deserved the foreign film Oscar and other accolades it has won. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best movies ever watched,"This is One of the best movies I ever watched. Comparatively, just as strong as Nikita Mihalkov's ""Burnt By The Sun"" or Mathieu Kassovitz's ""Hate"". Plot is flawless, script is original and written well. Captain Wiesler's character was developed very well, and his relationship to other characters, even though remote, grew to be very personal and intimate. I couldn't help but noticing his resemblance to Kevin Spacey, both physically as well as his expressionless acting style from ""The Usual Suspects"". The movie portrays very well an era just before the fall of the Berlin wall, and how a tough and brutal system affects people's lives. Overall, this is excellent movie, and a must-see for all the non-Hollywood movie lovers. Cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The most atmospheric film since the Third Man,"A truly amazing and insightful movie, especially considering that the director, Henckel Von Donnersmarck, was only 16 in 1989 when the Wall came down. He must have relied on a number of personal witnesses of the era (possibly and probably from his own family), and also have done extensive research in archives of the Stasi.My husband was Czech and escaped his beloved country in March of 1948, when the Communists took over. He left behind his ailing father, who pushed him to leave, knowing that he would never see his son again, which proved true since the 63 year old man died in 1954. Also stayed his older sister and her family of husband and one year old twin girls. His sister and her family started visiting him in France (where he was living at the time) in the early sixties, and then in the eighties in Canada, where we had settled in 1979. Since he had left, his family kept on being persecuted, interrogated, spied on and professionally demoted. When I visited them for the first time in Czechoslovakia in 1987 after my husband died, my sister-in-law whispered in my ear that we had to be very careful of what we were saying, since the superintendent of the building was a police informant who had probably bugged their apartment.The actors, most of them relatively too young to have known the full extent of the abuses of the regime, are all excellent, with the notable exception of the leading lady, who seemed notably emotionless and uninvolved, motivating my not giving a perfect 10 to this seminal movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best movies in recent years... And more than simply a drama about the Stasi secret service...,"In April 2006, a friend of mine asked me if i'd join her to watch ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" at the movies. I didn't quite know what this movie was really about, i only knew it dealt with the Stasi secret service in the former GDR, an historical topic which is still discussed controversial and emotionally in present-day Germany.After the end titles appeared on the screen i realized that i had not only seen that year's best movie, but also IMO one of the best movies in recent years! I watched 4 more times (convincing other friends of mine to join me at the movies) and now it's of my favourite moves ever...I was struck by the atmosphere, the brilliant acting (especially the great (and sadly late) Ulrich Muehe) and the compelling storytelling and directing of Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck (what a name! But one i'll keep on my radar...) and its' message...I felt that this movie was more than simply a ""Stasi movie"" as it is often described. Even more it's a moral play about being human (under inhuman conditions). It shows how a totalitarian system dehumanizes its people - no matter if they are pro or contra the regime. But it also reminds me about how people even in the so-called ""free world"" in the western hemisphere act like opportunists, neglect their freedom of speech and simply follow paroles...Maybe that's the main reason this movie is understood around the world and not only in Germany. It uses the historical situation of the last years of the GDR to explore how humans behave differently to the same circumstances: You oppose, you follow because of idealism, you sell yourself to the regime or you muddle through as an ""inner emigrant""...I think that Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is rooted in Catholicism. He wrote the script for ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" at the Heiligenkreuz Abbey in Austria, which is led by his uncle. And so he shows compassion for the moral struggling by some of his characters - and leaves it to the movie's audience to ask itself how it would have reacted in similar situations. Or how it even behaves today in ""harmless times""... Or knows how to behave like a ""good man""?""Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.""

Trust No One,"Imagine your every move was monitored, and your every word recorded. Imagine your closest friends were really spies and that even your loved ones were not to be trusted.This climate of fear and suspicion was a reality for many artists and political dissidents during the 40 year reign of the socialist German Democratic Republic which ended with the dramatic demolition of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The Lives of Others begins in an aptly chosen 1984 (the allusions to George Orwell's infamous novel are too great not to mention) and follows the lives of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is closely monitored by 'Stasi' surveillance operative Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) on the orders of the philandering Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme) in an abuse of power carefully exacted to destroy the successful couple.Debut director, von Donnersmarck's 'The Lives of Others' offers an emotional and moving tale of contrasts and oppositions: of observations and secrets, of society and individuality, and his stunning screenplay powers steadily towards its cathartic climax with the measured rhythm of an overnight freight train. This study on moral complexity, human nature and political idealism is a perfectly realised cinematic masterwork, adorned with precise performances and crafted with inspired direction. The best film of the year to date, truly deserving of the Oscar and all the international praise it has received.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life in a dictatorship,"Lives of Others - most certainly gives an excellent account of life in East Germany during the more than forty years of a communist dictatorship. It should be noted that the events shown in this film are still prevalent in a number of countries around the world and a similar movie could have been made with reference to Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and many more places. I resided in Venezuela during the iron fisted dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez. Watching this film I kept thinking of the situations I personally witnessed. It was practically impossible to speak to anyone about anything, except maybe the weather forecast. Nothing to taxi drivers - waiters- hair dressers etc.. You even had to be extremely cautious with people you assumed were close friends. Just one word that wasn't acceptable and away you would go to one one the lovely prisons or if a foreigner out of the country on the next plane.

my highest rating,"I used to rate every movie I saw from one to four stars, and I was very strict; four stars was the highest and it meant that: It surprised me more than once (it was not predictable); it had a wonderfully rich story; no plot holes or annoying gimmicks; good acting; no flaws; gripping; held my attention throughout, and I cried at the end, because it moved me so much. With this strictness, you can see that other ""great movies"" would not get 4 stars from me.Well, I am not going to write any spoilers or any reasons why I loved this movie. Let me just say that I don't care that much about rating movies anymore and most of them disappoint me either totally or in part and would get, say, 2 and a half stars even for quite a good movie.But this movie, it shocked me - for once the critics weren't wrong: it is great.It fulfilled my strictest criteria, and I have given it my highest rating.I am especially pleased at the many extras on the DVD which add to the richness of the presentation of this story.Wonderful - wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Beautiful Statement About Humanity Triumphing Over Oppression,"This superb, gripping film tells the story of a celebrated playwright, Georg Dreyman (played subtly by Sebastian Koch) living in the stifling oppression of the German Democratic Republic in the early 1980s, who is put under surveillance by a cabinet minister who loves Dreyman's girlfriend, the ill-fated Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and wants an excuse to ruin Dreyman's life. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe, giving the film's best performance) is assigned surveillance duties, and stakes himself out in the attic of Dreyman's apartment building, listening in on Dreyman's conversations and numerous intimacies. Dreyman is not a subversive, at least not in deed, until a beloved friend in the theatre commits suicide because of a ruined career brought about by the GDR officials. This loss compels Dreyman to action, and he writes a scathing indictment of the GDR which he publishes anonymously in a West German liberal magazine. Wiesler knows that Dreyman is the author, but has become so fascinated by Dreyman and his life, and so doubtful as to the moral motives of the GDR, that instead of turning Dreyman into the authorities, he becomes his secret accomplice.""The Lives of Others"" begins solidly but unremarkably. I enjoyed the first half hour or so of the film, but wasn't heavily involved in it. But it works a kind of intense, gradual spell, and before I realized it, I was engrossed in this story and cared deeply about how it would end. A plot summary makes it sound like a highbrow soap opera, or like something we've seen before, but it's not either of these things. It's a thematically rich film anchored by a strong central character in Wiesler. He's fascinated by Dreyman's life -- his artistic abilities, his circle of friends and the stimulus of freely shared ideas, the love and companionship he shares with an attractive woman -- but it's Wiesler who for us becomes the fascinating character. We see his life juxtaposed to Dreyman's -- coming home to an empty apartment, hiring a prostitute for a fleeting moment of intimacy -- and we understand exactly why he takes the actions he does throughout the film. His life is utterly lacking in any kind of artistic or intellectual freedom, and when he begins to fake reports about the goings on in Dreyman's apartment, making up entire episodes and even giving elaborate details about a fake play he claims Dreyman is writing, we see how just the tiny bit of freedom granted him to create something completely his own becomes the crack in the foundation of his loyalty to his superiors. It's a wonderful statement about the power of free thought to combat oppression, and at the same time a lovely story about simple human kindness. The ending especially is breathtaking in its sweet simplicity.And as I'm a fan of film scores, let me say that this film has a marvelous one, especially the recurring passage of pulsing strings that drives the movie forward and creates all the hair-raising tension of a Hitchcock film.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chilling depiction of life in East Germany before the wall fell,"I saw this film last night at the Denver film festival. The small theater was standing room only-the director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck remained standing in the back throughout the entire film! He introduced the film at the beginning and then took questions afterward. One interesting comment he made was that this film is enjoying success outside of Germany similar to that of ""Run Lola Run,"" but where that film was most enjoyable, ""Lives of Others"" leaves people feeling very sad.""Indeed, this is a ""heavy"" movie and at 137 minutes, it is not for the ""short attention span crowd! The attention to detail is incredible. The director explained how the prop master for the film was extremely careful with accuracy down to the finest detail of life at that time in East Germany. Viewers who stick it out are richly rewarded with a film that, according to Henckel von Donnersmarck, accurately depicts the sort of experience many artists of the time endured when their lives were invaded by ""Stasi"" (Secret Police)spies, hundreds of thousands of shadow characters who did not really live their own lives but in a perverse way, lived vicariously through those of their victims.The acting is excellent. Some may remember Martina Gedeck from her role as ""Martha"" in ""Mostly Martha,"" a German release from a few years ago. She is beautiful in a subtle performance as Christa-Marie, an East German stage actress who performs the lead role in Dreyman's play about a factory worker who has visions. We see her perform near the beginning of the film and soon learn she and Dreyman are lovers. Sebastian Koch is believable as the talented and handsome writer Dreyman who seems to actually be in the favor of the Stasi. Ulrich Muhe at first appears as a Stasi interrogator, cold and unfeeling. He soon comes to learn perhaps more than he wants to know about the actress, the playwright and their circle of friends.The director commented that although Muhe has garnered praise and awards for his characterization of the Stasi spy, he feels that Sebastian Koch also gives a great performance. Another interesting side note explained by von Donnersmarck is the fact that most of the former Stasi Spies have never been held to account for their crimes against the innocent people of the former East Germany. In fact, one of those people defended himself by saying that his volumes of detailed reports were all ""made up"" and now he makes a career as a sort of ""ambulance chasing"" lawyer helping these former spies sue anyone who accuses them of having spied on them! Huge sums of money are even now, being paid in reparations to these ""victims"" instead of to the actual victims of that totalitarian regime-incredible !",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Near perfect,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. It made me an instant fan of Ulrich Mühe, whose performance was convincing, intelligent and moving.In what may be spoilers (avert eyes if you have not seen the film), I will address a point another reviewer made about the point where and why Wiesler turns.Wiesler is a socialist true believer. He draws no distinction between leadership and underlings in the lunchroom. He does he job very well, but he leads a very modest life (e.g. rice and food from a tube). That is why he is able to do such an unctuous job without qualms.That is until he learns of how corrupt his leadership is. He learns that he has been tasked with digging up dirt on Dreyman not because there is any dirt, but because one of the party bigwigs sees the writer as a rival for the carnal attentions of Sieland. He decides that he will not be party to the corruption, and that is where his first act of insurrection begins - alerting Dreyman to the fact that Sieland is being coerced into relations with Minister Hempf. Ever smart, he does this through an act of plausible deniability - making the doorbell ring fortuitously.His subversive activities escalate throughout the film, but the above moment is where it truly begins, and why. He is tested several times throughout the movie. His urge to do as trained conflicts with his urge to do what is right, and he goes with what is right. It certainly helps that he lives such a lonely existence without anything really to live for.Another point that few other reviewers bore noticing. It shows that life post 1989 is not all beer and skittles. Graffiti is omnipresent, Wiesler is reduced to a task that only the most rabid Ayn Rand fanatic could get excited about - delivering junk mail, and foreigners are colonizing Germany. Perhaps there was some good in the GDR after all. Subtle, but the point was made.This movie also serves to highlight that if those in power want to watch you, you will be watched, and you won't be able to detect it (especially with 20 years technology more than the GDR ever had). I hope that if you are worthy of this honor, you will someone as kind as HGW looking out for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movies like this one are all too rare..,"I was fortunate enough to see ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" in April last year in Berlin when it was on general German cinematic release. As I find the historical topic of the Stasi and the former country, the DDR (GDR) in general of much interest and fascination, I visited many of the sites mentioned in the film, most notably the former Stasi prison, Neuenschönhausen, now been converted to a museum. I believe the sheer amount of cruelty and brutality the Stasi expelled on its prisoners to be comparable to that of Nazi Germany. The fact of the matter is that today, German people do not talk about the former east block country, in fact, they'd rather regard it more as a joke, laughing about ""Trabant"" cars or Spreewaldgurken, rather than taking it seriously. This film sparked a breath of fresh air and brought back the publicity and respect former East German political prisoners deserve, rather than being laughed at and humoured by the general media as they have done in the past.To date I've watched this spectacular film five times and have recommended it to dozens of people, it is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest works to come out of German cinema so far in the twenty first century, if not cinema in general. The films actors and cinematography remind us as how much emotional power the medium itself can have on its audience. This film was so good that when the credits rolled up at the end, not one person out of an audience of 250+ people stirred or made a noise. We were that numbed.I was very pleasantly surprised to see that DLDA is up for Oscar nomination. Perhaps the academy is not as biased towards Hollywood as I previously thought. Many of my American friends will not get the opportunity to see this film as it is only on ""limited"" release over in the US as of this month. In my experience ""limited"" means that only a very small minority of independent theatres in large cities will carry the film. It is a similar matter here in the UK, although movie theatres are not overtly controlled or monopolised by Hollywood studios as they are in the US.Admittedly, I haven't really talked in very much detail about the film in question in the review, however, I urge you to watch it. It is gradually climbing the IMDb Top 100 after all. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of the best films I've seen,"This movie paints the creepy picture of what it is like to live in a state where Big Brother is always watching (or at least listening). It lives off of a very well-written script, characters with a lot of depth and different facets. And it gets along without seeming key ingredients such as action scenes, which seem to make up most of the films we see today.This movie is a textbook example (in the best sense) of how to build up story arcs, tension, and suspense. Despite its runtime (well over two hours) and its virtual non-existence of action, gore and special effects, the film is not boring for a second. While action and gore are absent, the film is not free of violence. The interrogation scene at the beginning where the prisoner is deprived of sleep until he breaks down displays this type of violence most visually. It appears more subtly throughout the movie whenever the Stasi invades Dreyman's privacy and listening to his conversations. However, it never takes any spectacular dimension.""The Lives of the Others"" shows that films don't need spectacle to be spectacular, as long as the other ingredients that drive narration (script and acting, in particular) are as well-crafted as they are in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"How do you say ""Big brother is watching"" in German?","Do you believe in time travel? I didn't for a long time until I visited Berlin in 1989. I was in a youth delegation and at that time, the rapidly diminishing Berlin wall was making headlines everywhere thus, becoming a grossly unattractive tourist attraction.I recall strolling through the affluent, bustling, modern west Berlin and suddenly, I found myself in a city street I only saw at archived pictures. The sidewalks were cracks laden, the houses-charred and the public parks seemed like the headquarters of weed-gone-wild. It was very much like the Berlin immediately after world war two. I know that I didn't have to go to Berlin to see a city which entails neglected areas as well as well maintained ones. Hell, I don't have to go outside the very city I live in (Jerusalem) to see that, but Berlin of 1989 wasn't a city of different economic classes, it was two adjacent cities each located in a different dimensions and one of these dimensions was stagnant.The stagnant dimension east Berlin is the home of Georg Dreymen, a high renowned author/ playwright and also a strong believer of the socialist ideology. his wife, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck in a flawless performance) is one of the most prominent actresses in East Germany. Dreyman and Sieland are articulate, take pride in their country's ideology and also happen to be talented in their craft and boast many powerful friends. One might think they are the last people to pose a threat to the regime. That is unless one works in the Stazi, the secret police of East Germany. The Stazi, ""the shield and sword of the party"" as their motto exclaimed, were the embodiment of Orwell's vision of ""1984"". The ""Big brother"" in a thick, German accent. One of the Stazi's employees, a bureaucrat called Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe in a wonderful performance) takes charge of the couple's surveillance, waiting to see if the golden boy of the regime plots against it.Surely enough, Wiesler, the well seasoned Stazi agent, finds out that his instincts were right and that Dreymen is willing to risk his stature in order to reveal the real story of the country that stifles any shred of independent thought and prosecutes its intellectuals to isolation, frustration and, in many cases, to ""self inflicted murders"" as the regime defines it.Wiesler knows that this information can guarantee him a lifetime of privileges most East-Germans can only dream of but as he continues his surveillance, a peculiar transformation occurs, Wiesler can no longer see Dreyman and his wife as subjects, or targets to neutralize. he finds himself enchanted by the couple's mutual love and spirit and decides to give precedence to their silent struggle rather than to the interests of the organization he was once so proud of. What happens next is for you to find out and for me to be mesmerized by.Today it seems way too easy to mock the Communist regimes but what many seem to forget is that Communism (and I am saying this as a capitalist) is probably the most well intentioned ruling system conceived by man. The society of no classes, where everyone gets to live a respectable life is a noble notion. No hidden sarcasm here, I truly mean that. Communism failed not because of the Stazi's ruthlessness or because of Stalin's atrocities (although none of those helped), it failed because of the human nature. Mankind always fought first and foremost, for egotistical purposes. It may not be flattering but it's true all the same. In East Germany, the monetary system was not the universal reward for one's abilities so influence, information and terror became the hard currency. You can consider the methodical diligence and thoroughness of the Stazi as evil but in reality, all Weisler did, at least at first, was just derived of human nature.Humanity is the corner stone of the film and the director (I would have written his name but I have a thousand words limit...) propels the film with the humanity of the characters. The dialogs are not only credible but also vivid. The lively world of those who chose not to stifle their creativity is masterfully accentuated against the Grey buildings of East Germany and the portrayal of Wiesler, the former emotionally crippled agent. It's that contrast between the human spirit and the Government interests that brought the demise of East-Germany. I could go on and on about the masterful direction, the perfect script or the superb acting (Ulrich Muhe's performance of Wiesler is nothing short of captivating. His recent death is a gigantic loss to the Cinematic world, no doubt) but the truth is that this movie leaves such an impression for a different reason altogether. That reason is the perfect blend of talent, passion and diligent film making. Every scene is crucial for the plot or to accentuate the state of mind of the protagonists; Every shot masterfully designed to build up towards the inevitable climax. The two hours of this film are so engrossing that every single viewer transforms to the dreaded East-German citizen, frozen by his own thoughts and the possibility that someone might be aware of them.10 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.P.S. This film is set to be ""Hollywoodized"". An English language remake is scheduled for 2010. I know some might have trouble with the German language but I also know this: The odds that the hypothetical (as of 2007) remake will achieve the impact of this film is slim to none. I would hate to see this film reduced to a pale, English speaking copy simply because some people can't get used to sub-titles.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And the falsity that is socialism -- the control and management of peoples' lives by bureaucrats -- is revealed to be such a ridiculous system, as bureaucrats are no smarter or competent or honest or ethical or principled or incorruptible as anyone else, if not much less. It is amazing to me that the fall of socialism/communism happened so recently, and films like this tell a very compelling story of socialism/communism's horrendous flaws, but still the concept lives on. Amazing... And it will all be repeated. Right here in the USA. As it is already going that way. The spying, the informing, ""Say something if you see something""... Will we never learn?

It's for me...,"Not too many films get full marks from me but The Lives of Others does. Its one of those rare films that lives up to and exceeds the hype, creating fascinating characters you will always remember and has moments of great power and beauty.The Lives of Others is set in communist-ruled, Stasi controlled East Germany. A powerful politician wants to bring down a popular 40-year old writer who is respected by his peers and recognised and accepted by the intolerant State apparatus. The politicians motive is a woman who he lusts after and who loves the writer. The film is a fascinating insight into the way the Stasi operates - the wiretapping, secret camera, phone-tapping etc. that fascist regimes used against their own citizens. The sober nature of the subject matter, the authentic look of East Germany created by the director and the excellent cast were enough to make this a very good film and well-deserved Oscar winner. But what makes this a classic is the end. I won't reveal it and I know its drawn criticism from some IMDb users, but I found it to be very intelligent and subtle in the way the film closes.

Never Mind the Subtitles; Just Go See It; It's Solid Entertainment,"""The Lives of Others"" is one of those movies that is so good, if you are a movie lover, you just want to grab people and tell them to go see it.I was hesitant to go. I don't like subtitles. I'm not really attracted to grim films about spying in the former East Germany.But, hey. ""Lives of Others"" is really excellent, engaging, poignant, thought provoking, unforgettable, with earned moments of beauty and soul. And I laughed several times, too.Sure, it's set in East Germany, but the characters on screen are so real and so known to you -- I guarantee you've met people like them -- that you'll forget about the foreign setting and just fall into the story.And it will reward you for doing so.I can't give it a ten because of its handling of gender. I can't say more or I'd give away plot points. But check out, for example, Vera Wollenberger. Women's role in what lead up to 1989 has been underwritten in post-communist histories. But. That a movie could drop the ball so badly vis-a-vis women and still earn a nine out of ten is testimony to how good the movie is, otherwise.Really. Go see it.One last note -- what did the Germans do right that America so often gets wrong? Americans try to make serious films and we end up with self-important, inaccessible confusions like ""Syriana."" The makers of ""Syriana"" could have learned a thing or two by watching ""The Lives of Others.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Praise,"What an auspicious, overwhelmingly impressive directorial debut this film is. It's difficult to think of any American director, even our finest, who made a true milestone during their first time in the director's chair. The Lives of Others is seamless. The pace of the film is intense, steady, fixated, allowing smaller things, technical situations, difficult to imagine on film, to become riveting moments integrated into the film as a whole. The drama of the movie's story is sternly realized with an almost cold perspective that allows realism that is impartial, though the film's stance is very obvious and clear. The historical detail of the look and feel of East Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall in the 1980s is very bleak and clearly portrayed as such by the impeccable camera. According to a friend who saw this movie with me, who was studying abroad at one point in East Berlin during the time it takes place, the realization of setting and time period is perfectly realistic.Something about the film that I am personally drawn to is the involvement in the subject matter of intricate plots, intrigue, elaborate schemes, and overall sneakiness, all of which are present in very fulfilling form and perfectly organized within the plot, which still allows great emotion and cinematic voice.Ulrich Muhe, an actor I've seen in a few of Michael Haneke's films, may seem to many American viewers to be overly stoic and hardly dramatic, but his portrayal of an externally cold, stand-offish introvert of very few words is brilliant. His performance is actually quite a dramatic challenge. The self-control required to play the role with the gradual intensity that he does is a joy to watch, as are the performances of varying degrees of animation, tone, and persona by the rest of the cast, mainly Gedeck, Koch, Tukur, and Thieme.The Lives of Others is possibly the greatest German film I've seen so far in my life. It is wonderful, surely even for those who aren't familiar with the political matter of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An unheralded gem,"This movie is getting very little press, but it is a remarkable and compelling film with outstanding performances and excellent direction. It takes place just before the end of the cold war, when the Berlin wall came down and East Germany was no longer isolated and terrorized by the Stasi--the secret police. The main character is a Stasi agent and a professor of a class for incoming agents. He teaches his students to be suspicious of everyone and outlines techniques for breaking down a suspect, such as months of sensory deprivation. He couldn't appear to be much more of a cold-hearted drone.Politics of the most venal kind shape the plot, wherein the head of the Stasi wants to get rid of the boyfriend/playwright of an actress whom he (and nearly every character in the movie) finds captivating so that he can have her to himself. He orders that the couple's apartment be wired in hopes that the boyfriend will reveal himself as an enemy of the state. Our agent/professor takes 12-hour night shifts in the attic in front of a bank of recording devices and a front-door video feed, listening in on everything that goes on between the actress and the playwright.Sound dreary? It isn't. The playwright and his friends are alive--real people. You see what goes on in the apartment, and in the rendezvous of the playwright and his friends, and his now-blacklisted director. You come to understand how much is at stake for an artist who loses state sanction. You see the love and respect that the playwright and the actress have for one another. You see the politicking behind this attempt to find some evidence of subversiveness that would knock the playwright out of commission. And you see glimmerings of humanity begin to develop in our drone-like agent/professor.I'll say no more of the plot, other than that the tone of the movie is consistent and the acting is impeccable throughout. The plot advances at its own pace, and the director avoids the heavy-handed or sappy ending that most directors would have been tempted to employ.This is without question one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind subtitles or a leisurely pace.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A powerful depiction of what it means to be human,"German filmmakers, in contrast to their frank portrayals of Nazi horrors, have mostly dealt with the misdeeds of the Communist system by poking fun at the bumbling apparatchiks of the GDR in comedies such as Good Bye Lenin. Interestingly, 56% of the German people believe it is inappropriate to even discuss the Communist's wrongdoing and a rehabilitation campaign is now being waged by former Secret Police (Stasi) operatives who claim that East Germany was not a criminal state but only one that ""served the people and obeyed the laws that were the laws of that time."" A different point of view is offered, however, in the brilliant The Lives of Others written and directed by 33-year old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who grew up in West Berlin.Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and countless Lolas at the National German Film Awards, the film is a haunting look at the paranoia of the East German security apparatus in the year 1984, a paranoia that ended only with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in November, 1989 and the eventual reunification of East and West. The film shows the Stasi using intimidation and disorientation as tools in operating a ruthless system of control and surveillance directed at artists and intellectuals suspected of opposing the GDR. While fictional, the film displays the totalitarian mentality in a way that transcends particular circumstances and is relevant in our country today with its so-called Patriot Act that threatens liberty in the name of state security.Set in East Berlin five years before glasnost, von Donnersmarck and photographer Hagen Bogdanski capture the grey atmosphere of an authoritarian state showing in muted sepia tones its drably furnished apartments, bare offices, and empty streets. As the film begins, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, masterfully performed by Ulrich Muehe, uses videotape to educate recruits about Stasi interrogation methods. In the tape, a man is shown being reduced to tears after fifty hours of relentless questioning, finally breaking down and revealing the identity of his accomplice. Later, during an evening at the theater, Wielser expresses suspicion about the true loyalties of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, the popular stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), even though both are known to be loyal to the Socialist state.At the behest of colleagues, Lt. Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), head of the Cultural Department and Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), the Minister of Culture who has his own reasons for ordering the surveillance, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment wired from top to bottom. As Wiesler, identified only as HGW XX/7, sits in his dark office plugged into his headsets and tape recorder, he observes Dreyman and Christa going about their lives and it is not a comfortable experience for him. The gradual exposure of the expressionless bureaucrat to a different way of life that includes music, literature, and freedom of expression leads him to look at his life in a new way, a way that makes clear the arrogance of his superiors. It is the catalyst for a surprising plot that has numerous twists and turns and ends up as a powerful depiction of what it means to be human.The Lives of Others succeeds not only by its broad strokes but by its attention to detail. An example is the revealing scene when Wiesler rides in an elevator with a naive young boy clutching his football. When the young boy tells him that his father hates the Stasi, Wiesler begins to ask him the name of his father, then stops in mid sentence, and inserts the word football for father. As Wiesler's loyalty becomes shaky and Dreyman mourns the suicide of an old friend, stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert), the story takes on an added dimension, slowly building momentum until it reaches a staggering conclusion that is so moving, yet so understated that tears didn't come until I reached home.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Doesn't leave quite the impact you wanted, but still an excellent film that deserves to be seen","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn East Germany, 1984, an era of socialism is in swing and the oppressive government tries to spy on and control the people. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is one of the Stasi's best soldiers and is told to spy on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend. But as he spots their beautiful freedom and love, his own heart becomes melted and he becomes softened against the harsh regeime he serves. But when a close friend of Georg's commits suicide, he writes a subversive article on why the government has been listing suicides as 'self murders' for many years which manages to get published. Wiesler then becomes torn between his duties to his government and his newfound love for this pair.Foreign films, or 'arthouse' films, of course have never received the same kind of publicity and promotion as your average brainless, popcorn munching Hollywood blockbuster. So it was that my first introduction to the existence of The Lives of Others was a glowing review in the DVD section of Empire Magazine (Empire Magazine have said it's brilliant...it must be great!) With all the praise heaped on it, and all the five stars handed out by various other critics/magazines, it's a wonder the film never got it's own billboard in Times Squaire! Well, now I've managed to seek it out and see it for myself, and while it's not a film that's changed my life in any way, I can still say it's an excellent film that deserves to be seen and which you may well want to see again.The film lifts the lid on just how intrusive, controlling and oppressive the East German government was in the early 80s, showing a mentality that hadn't changed much since the days of the Nazis (the stasis just sounding like a fancy new word, really.) But in this environment of oppression and bottled misery, we see a beautiful light shine in the shape of Dreyman's love for his actress girlfriend, which of course the oppressor's want to control right away and which turns into a slow burning tale, that feels a bit boring to start with but if you stick with it and pay attention, soon becomes quite gripping and will have you hooked to the emotionally devastating ending.The performances are spot on, too. Muhe is excellent as the no nonsense, disciplined loyal soldier, not even cracking a smile when his colleagues around him are, whose impossibly cold heart is finally melted when he sees a life he couldn't even have thought of before and Dreyman shines as the creative artist, who still manages to keep his spirit alive even in a world of control and limits, which pays off horribly in the end.Florian Hencknel von Donnersmarck has crafted a film that will not be forgotten quickly. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Do the Westerners really, truly understand what they are looking at?","Let me start by expressing awe and admiration for the creators of this movie. My hat off to them. Whether the message they are attempting to convey is really heard by the Western audience as it was obviously intended by the creators is however debatable, at least for me.Along the lines of my doubt, I was amused by one of the otherwise knowledgeable and coherent commentators' line who apparently sincerely believes that ""The most recalcitrant"" were being ""(can be) kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship, like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann."" My God: I lived in a very similar system and my dream, all my friends' dream was to be ""kicked out"". They would not do it because they would have been left with very few people on their hands. Man, do you comprehend that these people were living in a prison? Yes a very large prison but well walled in. That's what the Berlin wall was: a prison wall, with guards and towers and all. Wolf Bierman like a very few others were exceptions and this is not the place to explain why.It is however the place to express a certain doubt about the possibility of the ""humane"" Stasi so convincingly portrayed. Although I admit the necessity of the character for the drama to make it as captivating as it is, I cannot help knowing that people who were reaching the very important position of bugging such a key character as this great and popular playwright, were thoroughly tested, completely brain washed individuals, convinced to the bottom of their being that what they were doing was right, progressive, for the good of their people and their country, that they were part of the elite called upon to lead back to the right path those who had not yet seen the light that they have seen. His job was particularly important because he was supervising the very creators of the all-important brain washing, called euphemistically, ""socialist education of the masses"".This is the terrifying thing about the entire system: it drags in intelligent, nay, brilliant people who become the blind tools of oppression. Most of those who have grown up in a free country are convinced that they are not going to be, cannot be victims of such a huge scale scam. To quote no other than the great Friedrich Hayek, what a ""fatal conceit""!! He used it in a slightly different context but it is perfectly applicable here. Just read the comments of those who think that anti-terror surveillance and totalitarian oppression are comparable or even identical. These people are the ones who are most prone to become Stazis, the human material from which they were being recruited. Let's hope that they never get their way.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece in monochrome,"A superb and gripping film which begins in a scarily detached, unemotional way and finished with tears running down my face at the final frame.

We are shown the limits of freedom and what happens to those who want to express it but we are presented with a moving and powerful portrayal of awakening human spirit despite the powers that would crush them into conformity.Others have expressed the details more elegantly than I, but I have to say that when I thought it ended superbly, it continued to build its message until the wonderful, touching and incredibly moving final seconds. I sobbed into the credits, but it's not for that mawkish heart-string pulling stuff, this is a perfect ending with a deep emotional resonance that perfectly rounds off a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Long live tragedy!,"When everybody calls a movie ""the movie of the year"", ""an instant classic"", etc., you suspect hype. This time it's not hype. It's heartening to see people respond so strongly to a film that's simply deep and true and doesn't sugar-coat its message. I think audiences are responding to something we don't get enough of at the movies: tragedy.The debased word ""tragedy"" gets attached these days to anything sad -- in newspaper headlines about teenagers killed in drunk driving accidents, for example. As a result it's easy to forget that tragedy is really a way of seeing, of apprehending the deepest, most painful truths about ourselves, especially when this self-knowledge comes too late to save us. Oedipus, King Lear, Hedda Gabler...through suffering they see the truth about their lives, and take us on a journey that makes us question ours.Every once in a while a character in a movie takes us on that journey and reaches this kind of tragic self-awareness. Bogart at the end of ""High Sierra"". Kevin Spacey's character at the end of ""American Beauty"". More than one character in ""The Lives of Others"" attains this sort of tragic vision, and the amazing thing about this superb film is how quietly it happens -- since all of the characters are under surveillance, can't talk to each other except in code, can't show any outward signs. This is a triumph of narrative and of acting.It's about the East German experience and you probably couldn't find a better way to understand that experience (if you don't know anyone who was there) than seeing this film. (""Goodbye Lenin"" got the cultural trappings but couldn't make up its mind whether to be a satirical farce or a sentimental drama and subsequently failed as both.) But the totalitarian setting really serves to throw into sharp relief the film's deeper concerns, about the consequences of our betrayals (of ourselves and of others); and about how human empathy and decency can find a way to operate in our lives, no matter what system we have to operate within.There's no CGI, no jumbled chronology, no easy dichotomy of good and bad. Just an intricate, absorbing and absolutely true story (in the sense that ""fiction is a lie that tells the truth""). Just excellent acting and directing, not a word or movement wasted. And hard-won, quiet redemption that because of the system's restraints comes too late to avert tragedy. The way redemption happens in real life, not in bathetic spectacles like ""Crash"". Deep down, audiences are responding to truth, which is something we're all starved for.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In 1984 I was a 20 year old in the West (UK and Canada) and we were aware of the Eastern bloc. But did we really understand or even care about the horror of this police state that operated in the DDR. It is on par with the Nazis state, probably further because after 40 years it was so entrenched. The sophistication of the Stasi in setting up the operation.

Ulrich Mühe, who plays a Stasi agent, does a very good job at showing how a character, who might be a one-dimensional villain in other movies, thinks and feels. But the whole cast is excellent.

An intelligent German Socialist drama loses morality to emotional blunder but regains it by the same emotional quotient.,"The Lives Of Others (2006) :
Brief Review -An intelligent German Socialist drama loses morality to emotional blunder but regains it by the same emotional quotient. When i see a spy film i expect an intelligent film if not intellectual and there shouldn't be any emotional blunders to take away all the moral elements of the film. The Lives Of Others begins as an intelligent spy film set in German Democratic Republic when agents and secret police are ruling the country. As expected there are several depraved officers and then there's one Intelligent and honest guy who forgets morals of his life and falls for emotional blunder during high class mission. I kept asking myself that, is the film seem like trapped in it's own theory of being intelligent and then spoiling everything for the sake of human emotions? Suddenly the love story and blackmail things made me think more about disarming the content then i don't know how but film regain the Classic status in last 10 minutes by using the same emotional blunder. Wow. I was pleased. See, in Intelligent film the emotional drafts drawn by the lead character are not acceptable at all especially when it isn't clear that what is he upto? But then big victory of socialism and defeat of ugly politics & depraved rulers makes everything look positive. Director Donnersmarck delivers a fine piece of filmmaking on human emotions and political propaganda. Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch were in top form throughout the film whereas Martina Gedeck was quite attractive and effective. This film has little vulgarity but it was needed for the content, at least i don't mind that. The Best Foreign Language Film at Oscars, Golden Globes and BAAFTA has to be a Classic and so is The Lives Of Others.

The gloomy atmosphere is compounded by the dreaded surveillance by the STASI, of which we meet rising operative star Gerd.Thanks to his friendship with a higher ranking official, Gerd gets the prestigious job of spying on playwright Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Sieland.

A movie about redemption,"The movie is set in East Berlin in the year 1984. Back when Germany was a totalitarian state. The Stasi was in charge of spying on its citizens and that's exactly where the movie starts. The protagonist, Mr. Wiesler, is a seasoned Stasi agent who has had an illustrious career. So much so that he's even instructing upcoming agents in the practices of interrogation techniques. Another important task that Stasi agents were known for; their ""interrogation"" methods.
Early on in the movie the protagonist gets assigned to a special ""public figure"". He himself wanted to get the assignment but as we later find out there were ulterior motives at play. Motives that concern his superiors.Mr. Wiesler takes great pride in his job because he's really good at it.
But as the movie progresses he has to reconcile with the fact that his current assignment is morally unjustified. Even though the protagonist is clearly meant to be the ""bad guy"" we are constantly witnessing the moments when his humanity shines through; to the point where we're able to empathize with him. He's a flawed character just like everybody else. Which makes the movie so believable.Dreyman on the other hand is a good person but too many bad things keep happening to him. All of these bad turns of events eventually force him to step out of his ""zone of complacency"", to make a hard decision. With unforeseen consequences.This movie is so powerful. It evokes so many emotions that it literally covers the entire emotional spectrum: anger, contempt, suspicion, deceit, humor, compassion, sadness, grief,...It's ultimately a really sad movie though, with a lot of character development. The protagonist keeps indulging in the lives of the people who he's supposed to spy on. And by doing so he becomes a better person.The ending was extremely satisfying to watch. Arguably one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything came full circle, so poetically. I was not prepared for this. This is exactly what good filmmaking is all about. It's the full package.
Even the setting is flawless; watching the movie feels like travelling back in time. That's how immersive it was.Final verdict: supremely recommended (you're not going to regret it)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"8.0/10 - Them Changes (also, a well written 1984-esque film)","""No matter how often you say it in your plays, people do not change!""Well, this film was not at all what I expected, in terms of plot. Looking at the IMDb top 100 poster, the art for this film made me think that it's gonna be some sort of a romance film about to people who fall in love through music or something. Can't say that it's even close to that, really. XDThe Lives of Others is a German film from 2006, which takes place in the German Democratic (""democratic"") Republic, 1984. It tells the story of a Stasi captain named Weisler who's assigned to follow Georg Dreyman, an author who deals with many internal conflicts as of late. As he listens to Georg, he gets more and more attached and affected by Georg's life, and that's the spoiler-free plot, basically.I think that The Lives of Others is the kind of film that's good overall, and has a lot of great highlights throughout it, though the quality isn't consistently great, if you get what I'm talking about. Especially on a technical level - the camerawork and the cinematography in general, for instance, are fine most of the time, fitting overall to this 1984-esque, cold vibe, but they don't have a huge impact on me. However, like I said, there are some highlights - the first scene in Hempf's car, or the emotional shifts on the control room.Well, to point out something that's consistently very good here, I think that the dialogue is great. This film is quite well written, and there are many, many moments with great writing in my eyes.I also think that the writers did a really good job with the motifs on this film. The film emphasizes them cleverly and in a variety of ways. It wraps the whole plot together in a very nice, tight way, and I like it a lot.I don't have much to complain about here. This isn't the type of film to take flight and create immersive worlds with groundbreaking cinematography. It's just well made, well written, and it delievers an interesting story as well as it can. I will say, though, that Georg's actor just doesn't seem to show as much emotion as he needs, from time to time. There's the phone call (again, if you've seen it you know it), and I really can't say that I felt like it impacted him as much as it should've. Not because the of the character (Georg verbally expressed it), but just cause the actor does not convey enough emotion there. But again, the writing of his character, the story and the other main characters (Christa and Weisler) make me fairly emotionally invested here.I feel like this review came out a little messy, but I'll sum it up that way - The Lives of Others is a well made film, which delievers its story very well. It has some highlights and the writing is very good here, so I'd say it's worthy of your time, but don't expect a masterpiece or your mind to be blown. I'm feeling an 8.0/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Das Wunderbar,"This movie probably doesn't need another favorable review but I don't think that will stop me from writing one anyway! What a starkly realistic piece about life, particularly artistic life, in the GDR prior to Glasnost. We in the West take our liberties so much for granted that a movie such as this gives us a well deserved shock to our systems. The film, collectively, and its characterizations, individually, poignantly and meticulously dissects the thoroughly vain, corrupt and nihilistic political system in power during that time. From the thoroughly disgusting Minister Hempf at the power top to the ""victim"" writer/playwright Dreyman, the entire cast excels in a powerfully moving, yet unrushed production. Of particular note is Ulrich Muhe's performance as the stoic (initially!) Stasi captain assigned to snoop on Dreyman. Will we, in fact, see a metamorphosis in this character as the plot evolves? I'll not be a spoiler!Only one regret: Since I viewed the English subtitled version, I have to assume I missed a lot of the more subtle nuances of the dialogue that usually get lost in even the most ambitious translations.Rather than recap what other astute reviewers have already noted, I will say that the sequences of events that lead to a most subtle, yet decidedly satisfying conclusion were masterfully executed in an intelligent and artistic fashion.

This film represents successfully the European Cinema.,"I don't have many things to mention about this film, since I really enjoyed it and it lacks of flaws.I really appreciated the fact that the director had valid knowledge over the events with Stasi, and yet he presented a great, realistic story that had a connection with the main theme.At first, he presents inhumanity along with the violation of privacy. Many people, back then, took part to this type of actions and felt no guilt. On the other hand, we can see the humanity and the need for help, because the criminals were Stasi people and not the innocent people, who were trying to make Germany a better place to live in.Ulrich Mühe, was a proven great actor, and did a good job here. His character's actions really touched me. You could see the change from the beginning of the film, until the last scene. From a ruthless person, he became more sensitive, and started to care about Sebastian Koch's character, who was a very kind man, along with his girlfriend.Sebastian Koch's character was my favourite though. I really liked the fact that he was fighting for a better living. Even his attitude towards his girlfriend was non-humanly good. I loved his revolutionary spirit!Martina Gedeck's character had me feel very depressed. Not in a bad way. I mean that I could definitely feel her emotions and all of her sadness. And had me in tears the tragic misunderstanding. Another example of a great actress!I really want to mention that all of the actors who took part in the film were great and very convincing. I think that they made a great casting.The last scene literally had me in tears. It was one of the best endings in the film history. I wish many Films could be like this one. It contains a powerful story, which based on true events and contains a very beautiful soundtrack as well.The reason I don't rate it 10/10, is because I would have wanted it to have a little smaller duration. In my opinion, some scenes were very big without reason. Of course, this ""flaw"" can not reach the quality of the film.This is a wonderful German film. Highly recommended it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chilling tale of paranoia,"This film perfectly encapsulates the dull, grey existence of life in East Germany, not just physically but also the spiritual paranoia that comes with totalitarian rule. The intelligence agency Stasi is terrifying in this film not just because of the reach of its surveillance, but the way it dictates everyone's lives - travel permits, career promotions, educational graduation and so on. The end result for the protagonist is a paranoid life punctuated by constantly watching every word and scrutinising every companion for potential betrayal. The direction and cinematography complement this with oppressive and inhuman looking imagery to deny any warmth in the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Touches The Heart,"This is a heartbreaking story of life in a police state. Told with authenticity and artfulness, ""The Lives of Others"" is about artists who are kept under constant surveillance by those who seek to control every aspect of life behind the iron curtain. It also addresses the corruption that pervades a system where a few control the lives of others, and how it attracts those who find personal pleasure in power and sadism.Sebastian Koch plays the role of writer Georg Dreyman, who is involved with an actress, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Within the constraints of his well-regulated life, he tries to live a rewarding life, which means loving and expressing himself freely. He believes he has achieved a semblance of freedom, surrounding himself with like-minded friends and his girlfriend.The other central character is Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, played by Ulrich Muhe. Weisler is a cog in the state machinery, who eavesdrops through microphones placed in the homes of artists and others who must be controlled. His pragmatic dedication to the cause develops cracks when he finds himself becoming interested in the lives of some he monitors daily. In a state where artistic messages are controlled, he finds real drama and emotional connection in the lives of Georg and Christa-Maria, and his humanity is resurrected.One can argue against political systems that sacrifice the freedoms of individuals to the state, but art has a way of delivering that message very effectively. This film is a good example of that. Its story is well-written and the actors deliver nuanced performances. It takes the viewer on an emotional journey to the dystopia of East Berlin that might fall into the horror genre if it were not fact-based.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Looking at ""the life of the others"" makes him aware of the hollowness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude.

Moment,". This painting is an emotional gift, for a very sensitive viewer. I do not know which kind of people this movie will suit. He evokes empathy in me, although empathy comes when you see your life in the frames, or moments from your life. Most likely, I would have done the same, so I empathize.The film shows the ""European"" trait that is inherent in the countries of this continent. A small percentage of art house (very weak). It's hard to make a movie in Europe, with a small budget, without a small share of art house. And the directors of this area see cinema quite differently than Americans.Despite the picture about surveillance, which means it is connected with the ""spies"" of that time. The film came out quiet and calm. Trying to focus not only on the problems of the structure of the state of Germany, those times. The director showed other things as well. We see unhappy love, we see a cruel person who changes. Probably the basis of this film lies in the fact that we all change.What the painting really gives is an emotional outburst. Only the director prepared it towards the end. At first you are neutral, then a little interest wakes up in you, then emotions manifest themselves, then, bang, a splash.In addition to the splash, an interesting climax, it turned out to be very unexpected. In the end, there will be something you don't expect, a completely different turn of events than in an ordinary, calm movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The impact of surveillance and control,"This is an excellent film. Based, no doubt, on the lived realities of thousands Germans on the other side of the Iron Curtain up until 1989.Difficult to write about this one without spoilers - so I will keep it about the film.What would it be like to live in a place where you know that control and surveillance, with consequences, are part of normal life? What would it be like to be one of those conducting the surveillance? The Lives of Others shows us what this place is like. We know that this place is real too - or at least was real up until 30 years ago. This film opens the door and shows us the impact this has on both sides; those watched and those watching. It isn't pretty.The narrative arc of the story feeds our interest throughout. Symbolically - it is 1984 the year of Orwell's seminal novel of a dystopian regime; ""The Party"". In The Lives of Others we see how the notorious East German secret police ""Stasi"" go about their business. It is unpleasant. We watch Stasi Captain Weisler interogate and take apart one of his suspects and we watch him glorying in teaching trainees these brutal techniques. This is Orwell's world of 1984 made real.Members of the (East Berlin) artistic community know they have to conform. If they don't they are blacklisted and ruined. This is clearly seen in the fall of theatrical director Albert Jeska. The paranoia of the state is so profound that even wholly loyal people are suspected simply because their loyality is seen to be too pure and perfect to be true. This is the case for Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) - a playright and close friend of the fallen Jeska. Partly because of his associates, Dreyman is detailed for deep surveillance - but he has no idea at all that he is being watched and listened to day and night.Meanwhile, Captain Weisler and his team bug Dreyman's appartment and begin the operation. He writes and files his reports under his codename; HGW XX/7. However, as the story unfolds we find that there is more to Weisler than first meets the eye.... No spoilers!There is a darkness that powers this movie. We perceive it and are uncomfortable knowing that this can and has happened in real-life. We see the damage. There is almost no light. We feel the awful effects through Dreyman's partner Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is controlled and manipulated horribly. It's deeply unpleasant.The story builds to a crescendo. We know that we are just as powerless as Dreyman and Sieland and there is an inevitability to how this will play out.No spoilers!!!

All the credits are impeccable from Writing, Directing down to the smallest 'extra' and it is wonderful to see Martina Gedeck, so great as Bella Martha, and Sebastian Koch, equally good in Black Book, once more but excellent as both are they are outshone by Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi official charged with monitoring their lives. Weighing in at a little over two hours and with no sex or violence to speak of the film nevertheless rivets the attention by - if not in spite of - the very grayness which informs it with Muhe, himself a victim of Stasi surveillance, outstanding as he mutates from automaton to human being but totally from WITHIN (no dramatic histrionics here to symbolize his volte-face, just acting of the most subtle kind).

Wonderful,"Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong.

Let's stop beating around the bush and just admit that the USA and USSR were the same.,"Even with all the recognition that ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (called ""The Lives of Others"" in English) has received, I would say that it deserves even more. The movie depicts the spy network in East Germany and how it targets a group of people including a state-approved playwright. One issue that the movie brings up is whether or not the events portrayed could happen in any other country...including our own. If so, then it wouldn't be a surprise, as the United States and Soviet Union were basically the same sorts of societies. What the USA did in Latin America, the USSR did in Eastern Europe. They claimed to be enemies, but it was all for show; they just wanted to build empires and spy on dissidents within their own borders.But anyway, this is a very well done movie, and I recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a strikingly human suspense-drama about the changes that can come in good people,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has here one of the better debut features I've seen in recent years, and until the last ten minutes has on his hands a tough, powerful gem out of Germany. His film brings memories of films like the Conversation, where a surveillance man got changed into a paranoid, The Trial, where the stark, bleak, disparaging mood strikes a chord in every facet of life, and even to a lesser degree the Pianist, where there can be some spark of goodness reached at men in the dead mess of bureaucracy through the power of art, and human expression. So much that we see the East German socialists do, the ones in the highest ranks of over-dominant power, is to make sure everyone is in check by means of fear and tactics of interrogation and surveillance, in The Lives of Others concerns why certain basic freedoms are important, especially in the arts, and that change is not only possible, but paramount for people in bad circumstances.Such is the case for Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gerdeck), who get put under suspicion for possible co-horting with undesirables (i.e. those of the 'West', and conspirators against the state, not always thinking in the party-lines in short), and get put under constant audio surveillance by the State, specifically agent Weiseler (Ulrich Muhe), who is so detached that he doesn't even have a grin at a joke at the expense of the head of state made by an underling. But as he listens more and more to these people, and their own personal struggles (Christa's unfortunate liaisons with a slob of a minister played by Thomas Thieme), and to how they react to a good friend's suicide- by playing a touching Beethoven tune on the piano- he starts to question what he's doing. Can a man who really listens to this music be good, is asked rhetorically by Georg after playing it. This, plus the whole aspect of change, which is mentioned early in the film, becomes the emotional and suspenseful core of the picture; Georg gets help in smuggling an article about suicide he's written- for which he can't put his own name- and Wiesler becomes an accomplice, but to him for what are the right reasons.So what starts out as a tale with possible intonations of espionage or whatever turns into a morality story, and where the personal and political meet at different levels but with similar significance. Can one's duty to one's country's methods and ideals be as crucial as expression in art, music, acting, writing? Donnersmarck's thesis is that, more than anything, change, and the choice to change, is a part of this as well, not just for Wiesler, but for Georg, who decides to go out on a very dangerous limb and not only write the article on an illegal typewriter but to send it out with his friends to the West, but Christa as well with her priorities for 'getting by' in this world. She might be a popular actress, but the price she pays is just as dear as he does, and as Georg witnesses a fellow writer go over the edge as part of the 'statistics', it becomes too much. It's a very potent point about the nature of people in this part of the world at that time that being an individual gains much more to the human spirit than rigidly following a set of rules. Whether or not this is based on a true story or not is irrelevant, because, usually, Donnersmarck gets truthful performances from his actors (especially the subtle Muhe) and is true to how it plays out in sort of a triangle fashion.Now, to say 'usually' because his film isn't completely flawless. The last ten or so minutes, a denouement where everything is made tidy and neatly put together in a sort of contrived way, goes too long and feels out of place with the rest of the picture. Maybe there's much to say about what ambiguity can do, but that would have been more appropriate for what preceded it than the sweet ending that comes out where bittersweet would have done just fine (i.e. ending it right when the Berlin wall falls). Yet, the catharsis, while not totally satisfying, doesn't make things completely cheapened for the experience, which overall is gripping and touching in the ways that matter. One feels for all of the characters, save for those in the high ranks of power like the Minister and Grubitz, especially when Wiesler reaches out for saving just a small piece of humanity in such an oppressive and hopeless civilization. In short, Donnersmarck is definitely a new filmmaker to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The actors pronounce every chosen line as carefully as on stage, which adds to the painful artificiality of the whole.

A MUST SEE movie; an instant classic,"At the time of my writing this, there were slightly over 8,100 people voting and 87% of those gave it either a 10, 9, or 8.After seeing ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I thought it was robbed when the BFF Oscar was awarded to ""Lives of Others.""But I saw LoO last night and my judgment is that, while they're both great movies (although of different types), ""Lives of Others"" was justly honored.IMO, many of the characters in LoO were more nuanced, developed and changed over time; -- there were believable maturational developments of several characters in it; -- it accurately captured psychological conflicts and reactions; -- it captured the historical quality of that era of the GDR more accurately than PL did for an era 6 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War; and -- it has many haunting parallels with today's issues (interrogations, rendition, domestic surveillance, the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the slighting of ideals for public good for private gain all the while maintaining the drumbeat of patriotism).The plot's twists and turns kept me in suspense but were always reasonable. (And I'm a retired therapist and displeased by unlikely reactions.)ALL the actors were excellent with the central character, Wieser, the brightest star among many.As a summary review in ""The New Yorker"" said, you leave this movie feeling surprisingly uplifted.After seeing this movie, I suggest you visit the IMDb Message Board threads where you'll find many Q&As, discussions about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The film take place in East Germany, in the middle of eighties. The main topic is hidden struggle with the communist regime. Somebody can say that this movie it's too long and it's make it boring. But I think that Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, director of this film, made everything correct. Love, hope, struggle, suffering, compassion - everything are in ""The life of others"".

Slow yet intense...Minimalist yet full of emotions,"Das Leben der Anderen (aka the Lives of Others) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck delves the audience in the atmosphere of East Germany at a time when the word Freedom was defined by the Communist Party.Mainly shot in the old Stasi Headquarter the film manages to provide as much for the protagonist as for the audience the coldness of both the feeling and decorum.Through ""Das Leben der Anderen"" Mr. von Donnersmarck represents a new generation of German filmmakers who try the ""reconquista"" of their own History, proposing a reflection on the long separation of the two Germanys. The story takes place in the early eighties in East Germany where the successful auteur George Dreyman and his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland are considered to be part of the intellectual elite even though they don't share the communism ideal.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a slow movie but never a boring one it builds up tension while developing multitude of thematic.

Ulrich Mühe knows how to express feeling with minimal words but an expressive visage, Sebastian Koch understands the term ""character embodiment"" and the very sexy Martina Gedeck makes herself desirable and so profoundly human.Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck manages to describe a dark period in a non Manichean way.

"Yet another masterpiece of European Cinema!  Humanism, Socialism, Music, Realism...","I watched this film quite a while after its release in the Glasgow Film Festival 2007. I had already heard too much about it amounting to an increase of already high expectations. Not only did it live up to them, but it achieved to startle me as much as no other movie, at least this year (possible exception being ""El Laberinto del Fauno"". The film is certainly one of the best (if not the best) film(s) of 2006 and possibly ever. It is an insightful approach to the period of divided Germany. Whereas ""Goodbye Lenin"" gave a nostalgic, emotional and touching view, ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" gives a realist approach not failing to convey the deepest feelings possible and through its excellent performances, its skillful and artful story and directing it assured its position as a unique piece of art. The blending of Brechtian theater, Beethoven's music(& musical critical appreciation) and psycho-politico-social realism achieves a wonderful balance between the Sophoclean tragic determinism and social humanism that will never fail to provoke the deepest thoughts, emotions and idealism. If there are any negative elements at all these would be that it uses (however if any, just a few) some cliché elements and makes some seriously strong claims, the latter of which, however, I think, more than sufficiently supports (I will not go into these for avoidance of spoilers). German contemporary cinema has yet again proved its value and quality to European and international audiences who should in turn return their gratitude.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Inside Totalitarianism,"This is totalitarianism. Finally a German young director understood and exposed the machinery of tyranny. This work resulted in the masterpiece of 2006: ""The Lives of the Others"". While the totalitarian system of DDR (the former Communist regime of East Germany) is the main character in the first half of the film, human characters emerge during the story. This is precisely the meaning of all this work: the individual rebellion of common people against an oppressive and collective society. This rebellion is embodied by a secret agent of political police (Stasi), one of the most loyal and respected social role in the former regime. His task: seek the enemies of the State. And destroy the personal enemies of ""Vips"" (oligarchs and ministers) in the ruling élite. To discover the ""enemies"", he has to enter their lives: no problem for a loyal agent. The problem begins when he discovers the humanity and the dept of his ""enemies"", when he has to spy the lives of two renowned artists: a theater comedian and his lover, a famous actress. And then he has to face a major change in his own life. But here stops the review, because I don't wanna make spoilers. Against all the ""ostalgia"" (nostalgia of DDR), this movie explain with clear and plain language that: there is no possible compromise between a totalitarian regime and a human life. ""If Lenin did listen the Beethoven's Sonata for a Good Man he couldn't make the revolution"" tells the main character in one crucial dialog. The regime imposed by Lenin's heirs encouraged all the worst traits of human character: fear, envy, lust for power, forced prostitution (intellectual and physical prostitution). In that context, the individual resistance was the only possible way to pursue the virtues of man.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Review: ""The Lives of Others","I went into this one with high hopes, and the 2007 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film does not disappoint. Normally, the winners in the Best Foreign Film category do not excite me as much as this one did, but the fact that it beat out El Laberinto del Fauno (or, Pan's Labyrinth), which I would place in my top twenty-five films of all time, that particular year, I figured this German piece had to be good. The acting all-around is phenomenal, from Thieme's small role as the person you could consider the villain to Mühe, the agent who completely changes his own livelihood as a result of listening in on this writer and his life. Now, I don't want to say too much for fear of giving away the whole point of the story, but it really is a beautiful piece and the screenplay is fantastic. I empathized so much with certain characters that it would have been impossible to tear me away from the screen. What really makes this film, however, is the absence of any real resolution until the final scene. It keeps the viewer with a wide range of jumbled emotions concerning the events that have taken place, but the very last scene of the film makes it all worth it. It even brought a tear to my eye.

the lives of others,"Reminds me, both in story and mood, of Francis Ford Coppola's 1975 film, ""The Conversation"", only not quite as good. As previous reviewer boblipton noted it's too long, about thirty minutes so in my opinion. You don't need the coda that deals with the characters' fates in a newly freed East Germany. And the two chief Stasi bad guys are a bit too cartoonishly evil, sort of successors to the comic, evil Nazis played by Walter Slezak and Conrad Veidt in 1940s cinema. And as long as I'm airing out the film's few pieces of soiled linen, I could have done without the heavy handed, ""meaningful"" dialogues between the conscience wracked playwright and his equally tortured actress/girlfriend, exchanges which smack of Abby Mann on a bad day.Where this movie achieves greatness is in its subtle depiction of an awakening political consciousness, a transformation that is embodied in the character of Wiesler, a Stasi spook tasked with surveiling a ""suspect"" couple and who slowly comes to sympathize and then empathize with these ""enemies of the state"". There is no scene where the lightbulb of freedom suddenly shines for Wiesler as there would have been if this had been a Stanley Kramer or OIiver Stone movie. Instead, we get the sense that to this lonely apparitichik who must hire hefty hookers the happy conjugal life of Georg Dreyman and Christa Sieland is what first attracts them to him and works its way into his being so that his purloining of a forbidden book by Brecht, his first overt act of rebellion, feels natural rather than clunky. And, of course, the magnificent performance of Ulrich Muhe, with his ability to express pain, regret, interest and contempt with a twitch of the lip or eye, aids enormously in making his political and moral journey a credible one.

Incredible study of corrosive effect of eavesdropping,"This film won the Oscar for best foreign film in 2007 and from my point-of-view is quite deserving of the Oscar. I hear Pan's Labyrinth was fantastic and I heard also that ""Water"" was very good. That said, I do not think it would be a pox on the judgment of the Academy in the future that Das Leben was awarded the Oscar because I imagine it compares favorably, or at least is in the same class, as two of those other films, and probably the other nominees as well. The film covers the lives and activities of those on both sides of the Stasi (East German secret police) from 1984 over a period of several years and then tracks the fallout from this activity through the period around the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the early 1990s. The premise for the film is intriguing and unlike anything I have ever seen before. It follows one East German Stasi agent named Wiesler (a very controlled and seething and fantastic Ulrich Muehe) as he eavesdrops on the wiretapped apartment of a prominent playwright, Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who the Secret Police wants to oversee because of concerns about his loyalty to the state. The do not have more specific suspicions than that, but the Stasi is feeling more pressured to uphold the image of Communism in East Germany and so they are cracking down on supposed heterodoxy in whatever form it takes.As time goes on however, Wiesler becomes increasingly disenchanted with the surveillance which he is implementing for the Stasi and questioning of its purpose. He starts to wonder whether the surveillance of Dreyman and his girlfriend Christa Marie (Martina Gedeck) an artist who may or may not be as committed to resisting the pressures of the Stasi as he is Dreyman becomes increasingly involved in revealing a health problem in East Germany. This health problem is not widely known in the West. It is a complex and riveting movie about the changing loyalties and devotion of people to differing points-of-view. It is a film not to be missed about the development and changes of people. The direction by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is fantastic. The subtle shift in change of attitude for Wiesler, becoming more personally sympathetic while covering his tracks and prohibiting his advancement minded boss, the slithery Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur in a fantastically precise performance), in the hands of the wrong director, could easily change the tone of the film to the point that his opposition became obvious and the Stasi took obvious, punitive, humiliating retaliation against him. But von Donnersmarck is more interested in the subtle change of attitudes over time. Wiesler changes so subtly, that it is some time before the Stasi recognizes it and precisely because if his change of attitude happened very quickly he would have been eliminated instantaneously.The film is an interesting study of the effects of surveillance not only on its targets and how their lives change, but also on those who do the surveilling. It is a reflection that surveilling exposes the agents to supposedly revolutionary beliefs and there is the chance that they will be changed by the people and beliefs that they are attempting to surveille.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Multifaceted spy drama,"With The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen), debuting director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafts a simultaneously gripping and intelligent political drama about an agent for East Germany's secret police. Just as a Stasi agent finds himself irrevocably drawn into the lives of the couple he's spying on, so does Donnersmarck compel his viewers into an oh-so meticulously crafted piece set in pre-unified Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall's crumbling. Capt. Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Mühe with an eerie adeptness, is assigned to conduct a covert surveillance on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler initially carries out his task with such calculated efficiency, but gradually finds himself pulled into an emotional web that slowly peels away his impassive facade. In the same way, Donnersmarck lets The Lives of Others unfold into a beautifully structured story that's powerfully told and populated with richly defined characters. It's at once a chilling reminiscence of a recent part in German history and a touching portrait of the human social network.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What was depicted seemed to be inching into unbearable territory. If you react in the same way, continue on, the director does not slip into sadism, and, if you leave, you will have missed one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not that it inspires, or amazes, or dazzles with new ideas or incredible vistas, but, rather, it's because it makes East Germany and the Stasi (their secret police) accessible to us Western xenophobes in a way that even we will understand. And that's important, because there's no doubt in my mind, that is probably the direction this country is moving.The story is about surveillance before the fall of the Berlin Wall of a talented and charismatic playwright and author, and his beautiful actress, girlfriend. Every scene is believable, and all the actors are superb. And the subject matter though dark is engrossing and quite relevant given our infatuation with Homeland Security. I loved the economy of the film. I can't think of a single scene I'd want to cut though the film is more than 2 hours long. It's a very, very rewarding 2 hours.This movie was made with loving care and an abundance of talent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the most critical of moviegoers.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who cares about art. Henkel Von Donnersmarck just finished directing The Tourist; I'm excited to see what he does with it. If it's even a fraction as good as The Lives of Others, it will be another masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent and truly Oscar worthy,"Yes it is better than Pan's Labyrinth True (?) story about an East German Stasi agent who is so good at interrogation and observation that he's brought in to observe a well known writer and director, who is in theory above suspicion. As he begins to listen to the daily life of the writer and his girlfriend he finds that his life isn't what he thought it was.At times cold and clinical this is movie is at once the type of movie that draws you in and keeps you at a distance. You're drawn in because you want to see whats going on, you're kept at a distance because our central figure is, at first very icy. All that changes as things go on as we, and he gets to know not only the people he's watching, but also because we, and he learns that the reasons for his watching the couple are something less than political. This is a movie that sucks you up and takes you along for the ride. If there is a flaw, its that the film, even when it warms up, still remains oddly detached.I honestly can't argue with the win for best Foreign Language film at this years Oscars.A potential word of warning- this is a talky film at times. The result is that the subtitling can be a bit of a battle as too many words go by too fast. It happens three or four times in the film, as part of wordy exchanges. Its nothing damaging but you may want to wait for DVD where you an back it up and play the line again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nasty atmosphere to live in.,"Das Leben der Anderen (or The Lives of Others for the English title) won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and it's deserved. The story is sometimes a bit repetitive but it worked to create that nasty feeling the East Germans had in those days, where they had the feeling or just knew they were constantly watched and observed by the Stasi. I'm sure I would have ended up in prison there. Nice cinematography, and a bunch of good actors, although I didn't know most of them, like Ulrich Mühe for example, that did a great job by the way. Sebastian Koch on the other hand is known by everybody, especially if you watch German movies every now and then, as it seems he plays in all of them, at least the ones I watched. The story is most enjoyable to follow, makes you realize we are lucky we didn't have to live in that horrible atmosphere. Bringing down that awful wall was one of the best things that happened and I'm glad I did participate in that when I was still young. Das Leben der Anderen is certainly worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Starts out very slow so be patient, after 30 minutes it comes to a slow boil and then becomes RIVETING","You do have to be patient with this excellent movie -- the setting-up of the situations and characters is very slow and languorous and the film takes its sweet time to do so. Around 25-minutes in I was considering jumping ship.But I'm SO glad I stuck with it, and what is more that I paid attention to the set-up, because the film snowballs slowly and effortlessly into a tense and indeed life-threatening suspense on many levels, involving many people.That's really about all you have to know about the film. After the critical shift (on the part of the unexpected protagonist), nothing is ever the same again and things will either blow up in someone's face, or miraculously turn out for the best. We never know which, even up till the very end.EXCELLENT, informative, moving, and even inspiring movie, that should appeal to any moviegoer, so long as they are patient with the set-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Remarkable period piece,"As someone who grew up in the East German era depicted in this film I have of course two advantages - the language and the personal experience. The Lives of Others deals with a topic that had infiltrated East German lives to a still unknown degree and it is to the credit of the film makers that they have tackled this in a remarkable way. The story centres around a Stasi officer who is put on the trail of a writer and his intellectual friends. With time he becomes gradually absorbed with their lives eventually turning from interrogator to protector. The script is tight, the atmosphere both bleak and electric, the acting superb and the sets full of accurate details that give this film an air of real authenticity. That there is dramatic over-expression of certain aspects of Stasi working is inevitable but does make the film a little unbelievable at times. It is worth remembering that the director is West German and presumably had no personal experience of living in East Germany hence the film sometimes feels like expressing how West Germans imagined life in East Germany. However, this is perhaps not a bad thing as it makes the film more accessible to Western audiences and I have no doubts that the Oscar was well deserved. It is worth watching for the insights into both East German state and intellectual thinking of the 1980s and the story itself is gripping enough for two hours of good cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfect,"This is one of the finest films ever made. It has the depth and the emotional intensity usually only found in great literature. To the best of my knowledge it captures the hapless idealism and the cynical thuggishness of East Germany's ""really existing socialism"" in a perfectly contained story resolved in a perfectly human way. After I saw it, a friend asked me how I would compare it to other films I had seen, and I honestly could not think about any other films. I could remember titles of course, but my mind was filled by this one. It is a masterpiece of understatement and rewards the attentive viewer completely.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gripping!! Great both for the realism and story,"This film is just brilliant. It gives an instructive and frightening representation of life in the former eastern bloc. If you are interested in history and especially the cold war you will find The Lives of Others is fantastic. Very providing of fact about how things were in those times. It really captures the tone and gives an amazingly realistic descriptions of the totalitarian rule of East Germany. They want to show you how it worked back there, this film is definitely not any anticommunist propaganda. So well done it feels like it really was made back then. But the film doesn't just succeed in the presentation of the atmosphere and factual representation. It also provides a great story with gripping characters. The acting is absolutely brilliant, Ulrich Mühe is amazing in the lead. The story is one which really builds up the longer it goes. Not meaning that it starts slow absolutely not, it starts out great and just keeps getting better and better. The story keeps going up never tripping over, makes it brilliantly all the way to the end. A rare story that manages to hold up all the way. The plot is so good and well executed. You are never sure where it's heading and you always sit on the edge longing to find out what will happen next. The films tone and pace is very sad, cheerless and slow moving. This works nothing less than perfect. Still it happens things of importance almost all the time so it is a film which requires you to pay attention to keep up with what is happening. However it won't be a problem to maintain concentration at a film so fantastic as this one. The Lives of Others is just as much entertainment as an experience. What they show you really makes one think. Might call it somewhat of an eye opener if you are not well into the subject. Thought-provoking and relevant even today. Something you really ought to see. Brilliant 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the best recent German films,"The DDR has become a topic as common for German drama movies as the Vietnam War for Hollywood. After the critically acclaimed ""Good Bye Lenin!"" and ""Sonnenallee"", Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings us this look at the bugging operations of the STASI.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a fairy tale for the most part, which was bugging me at the beginning (no pun intended!). The actions of the movies' ""heroes"" are noble, but would anybody act that way in real life? Hardly. Then I realized that that was probably not the main point of the story. The authentic depiction of reality wasn't the focus of the movie - although everyday life in Eastern Berlin during the mid 80's is depicted very truthfully. Still, the important message is the plea for moral courage. To show that even in times when human rights aren't granted adherence, one single will can still make a difference.The movie is set up nicely and Sebastian Koch, Ulrich Tukur and the late Ulrich Mühe (who tragically passed away months after the film has been released) hand in fantastic performances. The only weak point is the editing which is a bit irritating at times, but doesn't weigh the movie down too much.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is an honest attempt at coming to terms with the past, and one of the best recent German movies that rightfully got international attention.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An eye-opening movie!,"This is the best movie I have ever seen about life in socialism. It manages to keep the viewer in suspense all the way through, it can give hope or make the viewer feel fear for the characters' lives, and it certainly breaks all stereotypes, showing that even the people working in the National Security Services had humanity within them.What I found most interesting about it was the manner in which it portrayed its characters - they were capable of inhumane sacrifices, of unthinkable trust and love, going to the point of risking their own lives for the others. Totally opposite to them, there were also characters who would go to any extreme to self-satisfy themselves and to make sure that their desires are fulfilled. It is surely a movie about extreme altruism and extreme egoism...It is definitely worth seeing!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thoroughgoing Tale Of Surveillance Inspiring Awe Through Flip-Flop Action. ♦ 84%,"I was in denial before I decided to watch. The title was intriguing. The experience brought out to be terrific. Dissolved in the stealthy modus operandi of surveillance in old Easy Germany, serious amorous relationship and the impact of the whole setup on a single man is what this talks about. And, well, it talks well.Pure layout, gorgeous writing and an even fine cinematography. Being a debut art by Donnersmarck, the adaptation of a serious thriller is very generic. The dialogs (subtitles) were quite good. The expressions by Ulrich Muhe & Martina Gedeck are exceptional. Sebastian Koch stays being genuine with me (after his Die Hard 5 performance). The overall filmmaking style is good. And the best part about the experience was the music, tingling at right times throughout the suspenseful storyline. No wonder, the Oscar.But, yes it goes haywire towards the midway which is why I term it as the flip-flop action. Not monotonous, but faintly flat, yes! a humble 8.41/0.BOTTOM LINE: A must watch for people who love suspense thrillers based on relationships and Germany.

A strange kind of comradeship,"Perhaps the most sinister feature of the communist states of eastern Europe was the way they made a reality of George Orwell's thought police, with networks of informers so extensive that no-one could ever trust their ""comrade"", a hollow term indeed when you are considered an enemy of the state if you would not betray your friend to it. There are obvious parallels in McCarthyism; but the difference is one of scale. 'The Lives of Others' tells an entertaining, and ultimately moving, story set in East Germany's secret police. What I liked about the film is that it accepts the notion that everyone is compromised (and compromising) in some way in any society; compromise is what we do to survive. Again, the difference is in the degree, and this can change over time. What is less strong is the characterisation; it's not awful, and the lead protagonists do what is necessary to drive the plot, but I've seen deeper movies. Also, there is a lengthy epilogue after the film's emotional climax which seems to exist primarily to provide (unnecessary) feel-good vibes for the audience (structurally, there's a similarity to the ending of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in the way that this works). It's still a good film, both thought-provoking and enjoyable to watch; if the idea of collaboration interests you further, I recommend Kieslowski's early movies, particularly 'No End'.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Finally, a great film involving Germany that doesn't even mention World War II","Life in Germany during the Berlin wall tends to get overshadowed cinematically by that war during the 30s and 40s. While countless films recall a plethora of WWII stories, few, and certainly none in recent memory recall the 1980s. ""The Lives of Others"" takes us to this critical time in history and really strikes at the global relevance of what was going on.The film is German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's first simultaneously written and directed project and it recalls the days of the Statsi in East Berlin, who made it their business to know everything about anyone that might be disloyal to the socialist state of East Germany. A high profile couple of a writer and an actress become of interest and Wiesler, the main character, is in charge of listening in on their lives. Wiesler becomes attached to the couple and when their appears to be some anti-German Democratic Republic activity going on, Wiesler has a moral crisis on his conscience.The film is not as much a moral dive into the voyeuristic tendencies of human beings, but it certainly calls on those elements as an entry point into the minds of the characters being spied on as well as Wiesler. It's more about identifying what ""doing the right thing"" really is. The concept is certainly not abstract or foreign (no pun intended) to film, but in the fresh historical context of Germany in 80s, it sheds a different light on the subject.Donnersmarck handles this film with grace. He has some really powerful images and great edits (the opening sequence is flawless in alternating past and present clips) and in general tells a very quiet, basic story without any intense drama in a way that keeps you interested in what's going on or what will/will not happen to the characters. That's really something and I'm sure this film won't be the last he sees of the Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great film on it's own -- even better (sadder) when you consider today's current parallels,"There are too many reviews already praising this film in-depth. I just had to add that having been to Berlin a few years ago and visiting the Checkpoint Charlie museum, seeing the few remaining feet of ""the Wall"" and reading about the history of the city during WWII and after - I was incredibly interested in how citizens of East Germany lived during those times. (I regretted then and now DEEPLY regret not finding time to visit the Stasi archives/ museum!)That would have been enough for a great film, but the painful reality of our current government taking away our civil rights and warrantless wiretapping it's citizens makes this resonate much more personally.And I didn't even make the connection to the fact that the film starts in 1984 (surely a nod to Orwell) until I read some other comments.The film does have a few minor flaws, but it has so much resonance that it becomes a great film.p.s.

An uplifting and important film,"When this film won the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, it had pulled off one of the few shocks of that night, beating the much loved and highly favoured Pan's Labyrinth. Here, in Britain, there was a degree of disbelief, as Guillermo del Toro's fantasy epic was a much loved and much admired film. Within a few months, critics could only agree that the competition was very close, with many concurring with the Academy's decision.This reaction is entirely deserved because The Lives of Others is a magnificent film. It is touching, intelligent and an impressive debut film. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck can only be praised. His script is tight, intelligent and honest. His direction is inventive. All in all, although the film has a few faults, essentially because it could use some cutting, his work is exceptional.The film is ostensibly a simple drama and it is taken on by the cast with aplomb and they manage to stress the complexity of the film without making it impenetrable. Every member of the ensemble is outstanding. Sebastian Koch, who plays the playwright Dreyman, is brilliant. He is sympathetic and intelligent and makes his character, who really doesn't come into his own until late on into the film, thoroughly interesting. Then there is Martina Gedeck, as the embattled Christa-Maria, who creates great pathos in a tough part. But the standout is undoubtedly Ulrich Mühe who, as the tragic Stasi man Wiesler, is pitch perfect. He makes his character not only believable but thoroughly interesting. It is heartbreaking that Mühe died shortly after this film became so successful, as he was on the verge of the stardom that he still deserves.Historically, the film is important. It is poignant as a depiction of unrestricted surveillance. Ulrich Mühe himself was monitored by the Stasi and you can see that this is a highly personal project. It provides a chilling vision of a totalitarian state, whilst remaining a human story.The film is moving and uplifting, with a series of exceptional performances and a promising debut from its director. It acts not only as a compelling thriller but also as an intelligent examination of a truly unpleasant time that needs to be remembered. As surveillance becomes more of an issue, this film becomes more and more important. But the film will ultimately be remembered as a superior piece of art and a thoroughly wonderful piece of work.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No stunning VFX, uncanny camera angles, exotic locations, big sets or stunts. No! This is straight forward story telling at its best.Performances by all actors, especially by Ulrich Muhe are very good. The color theme, gives a very cold feel and sets a very apt mood.

I did meet someone in relation to my job who told me what it was like to live in these days and this situation. He was from Hungary, if you've seen the film you might appreciate what Hungary must have been like in comparison to East Germany. Well yes in the final analysis it's a feel good movie but thanks to the clever direction it receives and takes. I appreciated so much the way the end is handled. I recently started to do something different with my visit to IMDb before ""putting my 5 cents"" I read the default setting comments that is best first. Then I change the filter to ""Hated it"" Because it's interesting to read why some people don't like a mostly popular movie. I did not tick their comments as helpful, yet in someway they were but I don't think they put their comments to win a popularity contest and I have little knowledge about the subject to take side, yet I can imagine the difficulty one would have to appreciate a work that portrays something quite different to what one believes to know very well.

a quiet triumph,"The Lives of Others is a quietly mesmerising film that makes you think. Don't expect fireworks or high drama- just a thoughtful exploration of the human spirit.I won't dwell long on the plot- in East Germany in 1985, a Stasi agent (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned to undertake surveillance on a popular playwright (Sebastian Koch)- purely because an important official wishes to steal his girlfriend, a leading actress (Martina Gedech). As the state security machinery swings into action, each of the main characters makes decisions which have devastating effects.The drabness of 1980s GDR is wonderfully created and sustained, and there are two exceptional central performances from Muhe and Koch. Muhe expresses so much doing very little as the loyal Stasi agent who comes to realise that as his bosses care less for the state than their careers and love lives, the artist he is spying on is willing to sacrifice all for his beliefs.The film is not perfect- Martina Gedech overacts in the female role, and I found her role in the denouement unsatisfactory. In fact, women fare particularly badly in the film altogether. And like anything created by 'artists', the film lingers a little too long on the 'woe is me' difficulty of being an 'artist'. However, I found The Lives Of Others an excellent movie with, for me, a satisfying conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the Best Political Thrillers Ever Made,"¨The state office for statistics on Hans-Beimler street counts everything; knows everything: how many pairs of shoes I buy a year: 2.3, how many books I read a year: 3.2 and how many students graduate with perfect marks: 6,347. But there's one statistic that isn't collected there, perhaps because such numbers cause even paper-pushers pain: and that is the suicide rate.¨ German director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, directed and wrote one of the best German films I've seen to date: Das Leben Der Anderen (The Lives of Others). This is just a remarkable movie which will stay with you for a long time. The director grabs your attention from the very opening scene and shocks you with this excellent thriller. After watching this, it comes as no surprise that this movie won the Oscar in 2007 for best foreign picture because it is really well made, the script is gripping, and the performances are great. There is nothing negative to say about this movie because it is just one of those films that sticks with you and shows you the dangers of a socialist government when freedom of expression is dismissed. After seeing this political thriller, you will never feel the same way about freedom and privacy. This is not one of those boring political movies, it actually has a great script and the story unfolds at a good pace. The movie actually ranks at 55 in the top 250 movies of all time according to IMDb so it is amongst good company. This is one film you will not want to miss and it exposes everything that is wrong with an authoritarian government.The story takes place in East Germany in 1984 when the Berlin Wall still divided the country. Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) worked as a spy for East Germany's secret police. The socialist government was banning several artists who were right winged, and Wiesler was handed the task of spying a play writer named Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who lived with his actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Georg is one of the few writers who hasn't been banned yet, although he has received some threats from Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), so he knows he has to be very careful with how he expresses himself in his writing. The Minister also seems to have an eye for Christa and will do what he can to be with her. Georg hangs around a lot with one of his friends who happens to be a right winged director named Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert). Albert is very unhappy with the government controls and is always protesting. One day he commits suicide and this opens Georg's eyes on how the authoritarian regime is killing individual freedoms. The suicide rate is growing at an alarming rate and Georg wants to write about it although he fears the government. Wiesler is convinced that he is doing the best for his socialist country and works proudly for his government. He is a very lonely man and is dedicated fully to his job, but as he spies on Georg and his relationship with Christa he becomes more and more involved with their life and discovers some revealing information. The plot begins to thicken from this point and the movie completely hooks your attention.The Lives of Others is probably one of the best political thrillers I've seen in a long time and it is the best German film I have seen to date. The script was nicely written, the performances were great; Ulrich Muhe, Sebastian Koch, and Martina Gedeck all gave terrific performances, and the soundtrack was also great. There is one scene where Georg is playing a sonata in the piano while Wiesler is listening and you can see how his face actually lights up when he hears the music. I think that the audience had a similar response to that of Wiesler, or at least I did because it was just a terrific scene. If you haven't seen this movie then don't waste any more time and go see it because it is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time. It is one of those few movies that are more than entertaining and actually leave you more enlightened. A very well made movie, definitely worth checking out! http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

view from India,"Lives of otherswell for me i have following comments to offer1. Beautiful acting , good cinematography. we could make a similar movie in India though i doubt any regime in India ever went to this length. 2.To me very strong was the notion that perfectly normal people can be hooked to a system so bad. All of them seem to have a noble goal in mind to keep fascism at bay. They think that they should go for socialism as capitalism will ultimately lead to fascism. But in order to achieve this bigger goal they compromise on every small step and become enemies of their own citizen.3. I believe that this is what is bound to happen in India. Hindu nationalists have a laudable final goal to save India from Islamic tyranny but in this quest they may damage Indian psyche also.4. Once again one sees power of art in this movie. I think despite all shortcomings our race has one distinct feature which makes our lives worth living i.e. pursuit of art forms. Artists in this movie like in real life are motivated to take risk and make society as they see in their dreams.5. Corrupt minister who would have once started as an idealist but now is a cogwheel in system.6. Rival officer of protagonist who is equally efficient and helps system on the plea of being honest to his job. I think this is very much relevant to my generation today when we shrug off our questionable role in perpetuating many wrong things by simply saying that we are just doing our job maybe we also need to witness lives of other to arouse that humane inside us.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie and his role as Hauptmann Wiesler made Ulrich Mühe immortal.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Powerful and emotional. Brilliant script,"Das Leben der Anderen is an incredibly emotional movie that portrays the live behind iron curtain in the Federal Republic of Germany.We discover a life of a couple that is being watched by the East German secret police and how struggle for basic human freedom prevails for some, but fails for others. There are no real protagonists in the story, just the characters whose lives interconnect and people that watch them. So in effect, it is the story of people that strive and those that watch them do so. The storyline and script the movie is based on are very powerful. The music adds to the mood and overall presentation is amazing and will keep you hooked until the end. This along with other German movie, Der Untergang are by the far the best masterpieces of cinematography that came out of Germany in a long time. There are however certain things I was left not 100% satisfied with such as somewhat amateur camera work and certain scenes that were poorly edited, but they can really be ignored when looking at the movie as a whole. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Wall of Monsiuer Hire,"The performances in this film are perfectly tuned. The set design is incredible, the cinematography stunning, the lighting as it should be, the script fine, the music perfectly chosen, and the morality of the tale unquestionable. The first half hour of the film seemed a little over the top (unintended word play, think The Wall), mainly due to the monotonal quality of Ulrich Muhe's character, but that performance is reasonable in the context of the whole. The secondary slow development problem is related to the historicity of the piece, which gets a little newsreely in tone early on. BUT, and that is a big but, the film as a whole works superbly. The M. Hire in the headline summary is because of the similarity of character, in major part, to that of Michel Blanc in the brilliant French film of that title based on a Simenon novel. It, too is about deception and betrayal and integrity. Sebastian Koch who gives a very fine performance, bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Canadian American television journalist, Peter Jennings, and his style reminded me of a Scandinavian actor in a rather cultish philosophical group whose name eludes me, in particular a film about a rich man's retirement party he gives in praise of himself. It could be purely physiognomy (the son of the retiring monster) but it did occur to me while watching. Touching for the pure human aspect of the film, the heroic humanity of some characters, the subtle and visible transformation of the true believer (Muhe), the cumulative power of all of the aspects of the film is very strong. If there is any better framed and art designed film in the past year I did not see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better late than never!,"In view of the fact that almost two decades have passed since the fall of the wall, we have had precious few mainstream films on the subject of the Communist regime in the eastern block, while we have been virtually submerged in a flood of American films about CIA surveillance of suspicious US citizens, as if free speech exists only for self-recriminatory purposes. The Americans, more than any other nation in the world, have propagated the view that the American society and political machinery is rotten to the core. How delicious, then, finally to see a German film revealing the full horrors of the Socialist regime in DDR, and even better that it is well-acted and well-written. Based, presumably, on the idea of German writer Heinrich Böll's ""Die ungezählte Geliebte"", (the uncounted sweetheart) about an invalid who is hired by the establishment to count the people passing over a bridge, but who refuses to count the girl he has come to love from afar, ""The Lives of the Others"" is the story of the Stasi officer who suddenly finds that he has a heart and that he can no longer carry out the orders of a brutal system. Ulrich Mühe, the Stasi man Wiesler, or HGW, is particularly admirable in his poker face performance. The film's only drawback is the necessary leaps in time which detracts from the intensity of the story. But, above all, we should welcome more films of this kind, before we are cinematically mesmerized into believing that all the crooks in the world are Americans. Let's maintain a healthy balance.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A look into fascism,"It is rare to see a movie about how a police state immerses itself into the lives of its citizens, recording every detail of their existence. Many such films show a hero who takes on the establishment, or an villainous officer who moves up in the ranks by destroying people. But ""The Lives of Others"" tells a very human story from the viewpoint of a Staci officer.Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is surprisingly loyal to the state. Yet his loyalty arouses the suspicion of two Stasi officers, and they accuse him of conspiracy and subversion. So the Stasi assigns Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) to spy on Dreyman and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). The Stasi bugged the apartments and tapped the phone lines of the couple and their friends, and tried to turn one of their friends against them. Wiesler preceded to listen to every conversation they had over the course of five months. Complicating matters is Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who wants to have Georg arrested so he can have Christa to himself.But as he listens to the intricate details of the couple's life together, Weisler grows to envy, respect, even like Georg and Christa. His character evolves from a cold robotic bureaucrat to emotional human. Mühe's performance as the Stasi captain is nothing short of brilliant. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, in his directorial debut, overlooks no detail as he puts his audience in 1984 GDR.Far from nostalgic, ""The Lives of Others"" examines the power of the Stasi and its impact on the people of the GDR.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Revisiting socialist reality,"If memories of the realities of Marxist rule in Eastern Europe were as well preserved as its victims deserve, this film wouldn't be as absolutely necessary as it is gripping. It stands as a poignant reminder of much that the political left would rather we forgot.The plot: A writer, his professional accomplices and his mistress all fall under the watch of the Stasi -- East Germany's secret police. His very existence is in the hands of an unknown case manager.What follows over the next two hours of superb cinema is a story familiar to all who lived through that era. In the end, the moral corruption of a bankrupt system lies bare for all to see.Witness this celluloid gem with the reverence it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"For the many unsung heroes  who resisted the Communist regime,","An absolutely brilliant film by writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His first feature film was more than deserving of the awards it receives, especially last year's Oscar.Ulrich Mühe totally captivated me by his performance as the Stassi agent trying to please his boss, who was trying to get a promotion by helping a Minister get a lover, the incredibly beautiful and talented Martina Gedeck (The Good Shepard). The fact that government officials would use their office for carnal purposes would not surprise anyone but the most naive, but the pervasiveness of the State into the lives of the East Germans was something that was incredible to believe.The fact that good people are forced into doing something that is opposed to their nature by constant forces was a major theme, but the most important thing shown by Captain Wiesler(Mühe) was that even the most evil can find some good in them and sacrifice themselves for others. It was inspiring and captivating to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
