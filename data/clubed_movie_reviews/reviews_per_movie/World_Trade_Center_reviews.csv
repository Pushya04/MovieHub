Good intentions and some powerful moments but overall a disappointment,"I honestly didn't think it was very good at all, though I respect the intentions of the filmmakers. Whatever one wants to say about Oliver Stone, he showed a commitment to faithfully telling the story of these two Port Authority cops trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center and their worried wives.I liked a lot of the scenes in the beginning, the little mundane details like when Michael Pena's character is going about his everyday street beat. But the scenes at the WTC itself are really awkward, especially the cross-cutting between real footage and the actors. They just don't match, neither the film stocks nor the actors' reactions. A couple of moments with Pena standing there on the concourse were effective in creating a sense of horrific surrealism, and the moments right before the collapse were sudden and chilling...but overall it was not as powerful as I was expecting. For a film called World Trade Center, I guess I was expecting a little more context and not something focused so narrowly on these two Port Authority cops and an ex-Marine from Connecticut (as the only person outside these two cops' families whose story is told in the film, the focus on him reeks of jingoism in a GI Joe/Rambo vein).I know it's a little unfair to compare this to United 93, but I need to in order to illustrate the point. U93 told a specific story (the experience of the passengers on the plane) and placed it within a context (what was happening with air traffic control and the military). The lessons that are demonstrated in the actions of the passengers are enhanced by contrasting them with the helplessness of the ""professionals"" responsible for their safety. It's telling a dramatically powerful story, conveying a theme , AND providing a larger historical context of what happened that day. Oliver Stone, by comparison, has failed to effectively tie the experiences of these two trapped cops with the larger events of the day, and his film suffers as a result. And in the end the film largely shortchanges the stories of the 2749 families who didn't get good news that day.OK, so the film focuses on a narrow story of these two trapped cops and their families (and the gung ho marine, but he has limited screen time). Was their story well told? The scenes amidst the wreckage were compelling, but the back-and-forth with their wives became annoyingly schmaltzy. Yes, Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance as the pregnant wife and a lot of the moments with her family (esp the brief scene with the Colombian mother-in-law praying) were emotionally poignant, but so much of the family stuff was lame melodrama. And to be honest, even Maggie's performance was a little generic. I understand that these characters are all closely based on real life, but it still felt very Lifetime movie of the week. As for Maria Bello in the role of the other wife, I loved her in A History of Violence, but she was bland in this. The kid actors playing her children were mostly awful, and the film dragged whenever their story was on the screen. The resolution is mostly handled well, I really like what Oliver Stone is trying to convey about these small gestures of heroic goodness in the face of such desolation. But the power of these scenes is undermined by his tendency to pour on the sappiness while largely ignoring the greater horror of the day. It feels like a soap opera set against the greatest tragedy of our age, and that just doesn't work for me.In short...not intense enough, not enough context, too much melodrama, not enough of a sense of reverence for what happened, highly impressive job of recreating the debris field, a charismatic performance from Maggie, overall a mediocre film.",5.0,Anonymous,History
National tragedy as formula storytelling,"Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" - I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass' ""United 93."" Greengrass' film was lean, stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply, it told what happened that horrible day on the plane - though he used some license - and didn't wallow in needless sentimentality.Stone, on the other hand and rather surprisingly, seems to have gone out of his way to make something that would be so palatable and inoffensive that it would turn out rather bland, above anything else.The 45 minutes of ""World Trade Center"" are terrific. After offering us quick glimpses into the lives of Port Authority cops John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), Andrea Berloff's script gets us right into the attacks on the Twin Towers.The crumbling of the towers, which still is incredibly difficult to watch, let alone fathom, is handled with taste, but also is awfully gripping. We get a real sense of the terror and panic and then Stone gets the claustrophobic atmosphere right. With close-ups of Pena and Cage amidst the ruins, he gets us so close, we can almost taste the rubble and concrete dust.But that's the last time we really see or feel any sense of genuine, gripping storytelling in this film. I realize criticizing a film about 9/11, especially one that displays its American stars and stripes so blatantly, is tantamount to treason these days. After all, as this administration and its minions love to point out, if you disagree with them, you're not only unpatriotic, but also an appeaser of the villains. It's poppycock, of course. Dissent is undoubtedly American, but these chaps so love draping themselves in the flag that jingoism overwhelms all reason. Why bother with rational thought when you can scare people?What struck me while watching the film is realizing how much goodwill was channeled toward the United States after the attacks and what's ultimately sad is how this president took all that goodwill and squandered it by launching an utterly pointless war in Iraq. We could have done so much good in the world, instead of now being one of the most hated nations in the world. And Bush has now turned 9/11 into a political slogan for political (and personal) gain.The problem with Stone's film isn't so much the story, but how Berloff chose to tell it. According to Berloff, cops, rescue workers, even family members tend to enjoy speaking in exposition. There are moments that surely someone of Stone's calibre should have realized needed to be rewritten because the dialogue seems mediocre at best.Where the film suffers is when the story cuts between the two trapped men and their families, especially their wives. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and the always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno never get much to do with their sorely underwritten roles. It's a true testament to Gyllenhaal's talent that she turns a rather sour role into a passionate, moving performance. Poor Bello, on the other hand, isn't that fortunate. She's relegated to spending more time than she should weeping.The trouble with these scenes is not that Berloff tries to wring some emotion out of them, but that they come off as unabashedly sentimental. And the emotions are entirely unearned.Pena proves, just as he did in ""Crash"" (2005), that he's able to be something special on screen. His character is far more engaging than Cage's; Pena's emotions come off without any artifice.I can't help but feel that ""World Trade Center"" could have been the gut-wrenching experience Stone intended it to be had he and Berloff approached the story much in the way Greengrass did ""United 93."" Stone's movie is far from lean. It's padded with needless sentimentality and moments that just try so hard to earn some emotion, any emotion, that they come off as utterly false. And that's unfair to the people whose story is being chronicled here.Watching Cage and Pena trapped should be gripping stuff. But even their dialogue is reduced to exposition. And when Berloff finally leaves the two men and their families, we get Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man so moved by what he saw that he came down to the Twin Towers and proved to be McLoughlin and Jimeno's miracle. We all know Karnes is a real person, but I very much doubt that he speaks in bumper stickers. But that's exactly what Berloff has him do.The first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing. The rest is rather tepid. And unbelievably forced. Who knew that Oliver Stone, of all people, would resort to formulaic storytelling. Perhaps he's been so stung by conspiracy accusations and was so keen on appeasing his critics and forgetting the execrable ""Alexander"" (2004) that he opted to make the kind of movie Ron Howard would make. That's not a compliment.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A surprisingly good film,"I went into this film without expectations. I saw Flight 93 and enjoyed it and I am very interested in all events surrounding September 11th, so this film appealed to me. Now, I must say that I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however, upon hearing this movie was nothing like an Oliver Stone film I decided to check it out.The storyline for the film, as stated, was based on the stories of a few Port Authority police who survived the collapse of the building while being trapped for hours in the rubble. At the beginning we are introduced to each of the characters and their families. It's enough to get us involved with each of them but leaves enough room to elaborate as the film unfolds. The film moves rather nicely without going too fast or slow. The vast amount of the film takes place after the towers collapse while the men are trapped in the rubble. The story is told through the trapped police officers current situation as well as what their families are going through at the same time.I felt this story to be very natural and not Hollywood-ized, something I had been worried would happen. All the events seemed plausible, they didn't throw anything in for added drama. All of the characters were completely believable and you ended up loving all of them by the end. I will caution you though, there are some intense scenes in this movie so if you are unable to deal with some of the events from that day you may not want to see the film.The cinematography and sound really aided this film. All of the filming was crisp and clean, the special effects were great and you could hardly tell this had been filmed after the towers were gone (the shots containing the towers that is). There were some great scenes from life in new york; shots of the skyline and the subway as well as some breathtaking aerials. The sound was spot on, you could feel the building collapse as the scenes unfolded on the screen. It was a great job all around.Overall I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was, it lived up to Flight 93, although it has an entirely different feel to it. This film is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Drama,"I saw an advanced screening of World Trade Center last night, and I was very impressed. I went into it unbiased, deciding that I would indeed like to hear the story of what happened to the two officers this movie is about, and I would take it for what it is, regardless of whether or not people think it's still too soon.This is a very moving and intense look at the story of the officers' ordeal as well as what their families had to go through. Of course, the viewer is reminded of a lot that happened on that day, and it is disturbing, sad, and angering just as the real events were. However, the movie makes no attempt at all to explain what happened or give some great message to the world about terrorism, government, or war. It's more of a character study and simply a look at a terrible event from several perspectives.The acting is superb, and I have more respect for Nicholas Cage after this movie than I did going into it. There are some very intense moments, and moments that, as I've said, are angering and disturbing, but not to make the viewer want to walk away, but simply to be angry that these events had to occur in the first place.Thankfully, there are several moments of humor throughout the movie, to give the viewer a break perhaps, but they work well.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because the writing at times was not all that it could have been, especially some of the dialogue. Overall, the acting is great and the characters feel real, but in some scenes you may feel like the sentimentality is being forced and doesn't feel genuine.I will recommend this movie to people who are not dead set against it, or someone who is just looking for exactly what it is: a movie made for entertainment and as a tribute to those that died.",7.0,Anonymous,History
well-made movie,"I was afraid this movie would be over Hollywoodized like Pearl Harbor was. However, the movie was made in good taste and was very emotional. It was the first time i had ever teared up at a movie. It captured that period very well and it brought back a lot of memories of that day for me and the days that had followed. The acting was pretty good, especially Michael Pena, who seemed to actually be living the experience instead of acting it out in a movie. When the movie ended the audience was silent(pre screening)and didn't clap, not because they didn't like it but out of respect. I felt really in-touch with the characters and while i teared up in some parts I also smiled and even laughed at some parts as the characters tried to cheer each other up. Expect it to win some awards.",,Anonymous,History
Drawn out,This film is a mostly compelling story of the 9/11 attacks but the problem is that it's too drawn out. There is a lot of the time when nothing much is really happening. It tries to focus on the lives of particular individuals who are portrayed as heroes but this also means that there is not much material to work with.,6.0,Anonymous,History
A classless play on emotions,"I know that many people who don't like this movie say so just because they thought it was made at an inappropriate time. Personally, I hated this movie on its own merit as poor film-making. It seems that Oliver Stone just decided he wanted to make a movie, any movie, about 9/11, and didn't care about the content of the movie. The end result was a movie of such pitiful quality that one could go though the script and replace the term ""police officer"" with ""miner"" and ""World Trade Center"" with ""a coal mine"" and the entire script would work perfectly as a cave-in disaster movie. It's that generic. Stone tries to carry the movie just by showing how sad the families were and how scared the policemen were, meanwhile allowing the audience no interesting plot points to hold on to, nor any significance to the tragedy. In the end, I have to conclude that Oliver Stone just wanted to get some cheap emotional reactions from the crowd, because at one point the movie says that it is about the potential for good in humanity and how strong we can be in the face of adversity. Stone quickly forgets this, because only about 15% of the movie even shows people coming together to help one another. The other 85% of the movie is spent watching the families argue or seeing flashbacks to their happy memories, which is a good way to get audience reaction but hardly lends any significance or depth to the plot. I don't in any way want to belittle the pain that these families had to endure, which is why I am disappointed that that pain was exploited to make a bad movie. September 11 was the most important and tragic event in my lifetime, and I think it deserves more respect than to be made into a generic, poorly-written disaster movie less than five years after it happened.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Stone Salutes,"Oliver Stone salutes the ordinary heroes of this extraordinary circumstances. He puts himself way behind their stories, so far behind in fact that he is almost imperceptible. In Italy, the academics, snobs and other fauna dismissed it as rhetoric and banal. I have the words of the laid back ""opinionist"" Barbara Pallombelli accusing Stone of ""inventing"" How silly really. The ignorance between the cultures seems insurmountable sometimes. The story was told by the two men under the rubble and their families. They were working people, not professional ""opinionists"". They will hum the theme from Startsky and Hutch to keep themselves alive. I wonder what pseudo intellectual would have done.The film is a gripping depiction centered mostly on two men and their families. The event caused a catastrophe that is still growing, based mostly in personal interest and massive inter cultural ignorance. The film is not about that. The film is about the tiniest enormity of the domestic drama. I wept and longed for a private happy ending. The rest, well the rest is still part of our daily existence. Most of the detractors accuse World Trade Center of not being an Oliver Stone film, if he had done a classic Oliver Stone film he would have been accused of that. Stone will be controversial even for standing still. My hat to you Mr Stone, please keep going your own way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
When Kindness and Sympathy Supersedes Evilness,"On September, 11th 2001, after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center, the building collapses over the rescue team from the Port Authority Police Department. Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) and his sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) are found alive trapped under the wreckage while the rescue teams fight to save them.""World Trade Center"" is based on the accounts of the people evolved in the aftermath of this tragedy and tells the story of two of the survivors. The dramatic narrative is careful in details, and gives scary statistics inclusive that only twenty people were rescued alive from the debris, and Jimeno and McLoughlin were the eighteenth and the nineteenth survivors. This apolitical movie gives a message of hope and love and I particularly liked the conclusion two years later, when the optimistic John McLoughlin sees the kindness and sympathy of his people superseding the evilness of the murderers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""As Torres Gêmeas"" (""The Twin Towers"")",7.0,Anonymous,History
A reminder of that fateful day.,"This is an excellent film on a very touchy subject. World Trade Center makes an excellent companion piece to United 93. The films have different styles and they present diverse perspectives of a day that has limitless faces. Both are thoughtful, intelligent, and emotionally potent. They provoke and challenge, asking us not only to face our memories but to question our future. By being less political than he has ever been, Stone offers a movie that can be embraced by movie-goers who sit on the left side of the theater, in the center, or on the right. It's an achievement, and it makes one hope that future feature films about 9/11 will exhibit the same mix of dramatic force and tasteful restraint.",,Anonymous,History
Good enough,"I totally agree with the first review of the film on some issues but we will have to remember, that the film is made because it wants to tell the story of two brave men. We all know that many people lost their lives that day and we all know how they were lost.............what we do not know is how these two men managed to do their job under such difficult conditions. Many other firemen worked that day but here we get the story of two of them. When you see the movie, keep all the hearts and souls that America lost on September 11th, 2001 in mind and then you can enjoy a truly good film. Hollywood certainly makes awful movies from time to time but this one is not bad at all, disaster or not!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Puzzled about the movie,"I just came back from the movie and found myself being very angry. While it was a very good movie, I don't understand it's purpose. If the reason Oliver Stone made this movie is so that proceeds can go to the victims of 9/11, that I can stand behind. If they are going in his pocket that is not right. Normally I don't think like that. I don't see the benefit of it other than to open old and in some cases still raw wounds for people. Does anyone know if money is going to the victims family, or if this movie helped victims and there families in some way? If I knew there response it would help me understand the reason for this movie to have been made.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Taseful And Poignant Story from the Perspective of Two Police Officers and their Families,"For some, it may still be too soon to go to the movies to watch a tale of 9/11. For those who are ready, World Trade Center is worth watching. The film is tastefully made, casts minimal attention to the more sensational aspects of the fateful day, and devotes the lion's share of the picture telling a gripping, true-life, story of two port authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble. There is no discussion of how or why this tragedy occurred. The film is simply a tribute to the chaos on the ground as the day unfolded, and the heroism of the police, firefighter, and others, who literally risked their lives to rescue others. Although the story is set in and around the World Trade Center complex on September 11, 2001, it could just as easily have been set in the Sago Coal Mine, or some other place where people are trapped below ground in a dangerous setting. The real story here is about the camaraderie of the two stars as they struggle to survive, and the emotional difficulties endured by their families and friends and events unfold. As the attack on the World Trade Center becomes more of a part of history, and less a part of the current news, more sensational movies about the events of that day are likely to be made. It will be interesting to see how this movie holds up.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This was awful,"This is the first movie I've ever got up during the showing at a theatre and walked out. Yeah I know some people are going to panic and whine that I'm a horrible person for not liking the World Trade Center movie, but this was just annoying. The previews show a bright, outdoors thing with lots of police and firefighters and such, when in reality most of the film is just two guys trapped in the dark, in the rubble, talking in strained voices about their family, while their family acts upset at home. Don't get me wrong, I respect the event, but the importance of a historical event doesn't mean everyone should go see a poorly done movie about it. So in conclusion, the film is very repetitive, constant poor lighting and typically unchanging scenery make it unpleasant to watch for a long time, and it was very hard to connect with the characters.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"The events are unbeatable, but after an hour the movie falls into boring clichés","World Trade Center (2006)You can't argue with the story line--it's based on the facts--and you can't help but shiver and even cry over some of the imagery, burning buildings and rescued policemen.So how well put together is it? As a movie, as a two hour plus story?Very well, with some slow spots, and eventually a feeling that the story lines are in place early on and don't waver or turn as the movie goes. (In fact, if you haven't seen the movie but know the history, you might guess what happens even now, before you start.) It's obviously a movie about survival, about ordinary people doing what they can to help each other, and individuals rediscovering what really matters in their lives.For me, all of these elements are a given, and were maybe unavoidable in an Oliver Stone film (he's a director who embraces Hollywood's emotional ability to sway and move a viewer with sights and sounds). What was most chilling and worthwhile were the recreations of the falling buildings, both from the inside and the outside. This also is one of Hollywood's strengths, creating illusions. And I'm going to guess they had to make it far less dramatic and horrifying than it really was.Nicolas Cage is good, and his fellow cops, including the other lead, Conner Paolo, are fine, but I'm not sure anyone really raises the movie up by their performances. The events are the point, and the retelling of what actually happened from one small, poignant point of view. It's frankly slow and repetitive by the end, but the first half hour or so has some moments that are worth seeing if you are willing to relive that day.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Total and big disappointment! Non-American viewers, beware!","First, I vote 1 for this dreadful piece of celluloid just because IMDb hadn't provided negative votes yet. Absolutely big disappointment coming from one of the finest directors of all time - Oliver Stone. Having in mind that he directed such masterpieces as JFK and Naturally born killers, I have no excuse for him making such blatant propaganda movie except for the paycheck. Every single cliché you name it, you have it here. Patriotism is flowing from every possible hole, the opposite of smart Bush showing like a cockroaches from every frame. Yes, for sure, Americans do deserve to have such idiotic film made for such tragic event, so let them have it. A apropos, when do we have movie about more than half million innocent civilians killed in Iraq by Americans? For all those women and children cold-heartedly slaughtered and maimed by American soldiers and not even statistically put as collateral damages? A movie about how the US invasion of Iraq provoked and increased the uniting of the world terrorism in that poor country? Where is THAT movie, mister Stone?",1.0,Anonymous,History
A life-affirming movie about courage,"It's a little known story from a day we know all too well. ""World Trade Center"" tells the gripping true story of two of the last men pulled out of the rubble of Ground Zero alive.Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena play Port Authority Police officers. In the film's heart- pounding opening minutes, we watch the attack unfold through the eyes of these first responders. As the routine morning becomes anything but routine, the officers glimpse news reports (we are thankfully spared any images of the plane striking the towers) and get bits of information from cellphone calls to family members as they race downtown. But what's most striking is how little the men know about what's really happening. As the officers prepare to the climb the North Tower, they are unaware the South Tower has even been hit. Communications gear is failing, and there is confusion all around.Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects, director Oliver Stone and his film-making team recreate these hectic moments in all-too-realistic detail. You're right there, on the street, looking up and watching the chaos unfold in 35mm and THX surround sound. If you didn't know any better, you'd think Stone had a crew shooting in Lower Manhattan that day. You have to struggle to remind yourself everything you're seeing was recreated on a sound stage on inside a computer.Screenwriter Andrea Berloff further enhances the realism with believable dialog. She not only effectively captures the ""cop talk"" (half the time, there's so much lingo being bantered back and forth, you don't understand what the heck the characters are saying -- as it should be), she also delivers a truth and honesty to the conversations and interactions. The words never feel contrived.The quality cast does the script justice. It's remarkable how well Cage, a major movie star, disappears behind the mustache and hunched shoulders of Sgt. John McLoughlin. Pena (last seen as the locksmith in ""Crash"") is instantly likable as Ofc. Jimeno. Their performances are even more noteworthy considering they spend the majority of the movie flat on their backs. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives, who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands.Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. He mercifully ditches the frenetic editing style he's employed in films like Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.***Not Political***When one hears that Oliver Stone, director of such politically charged films as JFK and Born on the Fourth Of July, is making a movie about 9/11, your first tendency is to say, ""uh oh."" But this may be the least political movie Stone has ever made, one both red states and blue states can agree on. It's not about the roots of terror, or who's to blame for what. It's not about villains. It's about heroes. Though set during one of America's darkest hours, it tells a life-affirming story of courage, love and the strength people can summon inside. The movie reminds us how we all felt that day, how we all came together. Some say it is too soon for a movie like this. But as our nation sits so sharply divided, it's not a minute too soon to remember the unity of purpose we all had on 9/11 and ponder whether we can ever get it back.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Stone Cold,"Stone cold, that's what I call the new Oliver Stone film, World Trade Center. Taking the story of two Port Authority Police who survived, Stone manages to make the singular event of the last decade a boring made-for-TV story of two cops buried and waiting rescue, by the Marines no less. There are marks of an auteur to be sure such as the set design, just as authentic looking as when I visited ground zero after the attack. But the mark of the real Stone, one that carries the heft of his personal opinion about an event (Platoon) or his off-center look at history (JFK), is absent.Let's face it: Two cops, John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), buried beneath rubble with small talk to keep themselves alive is neither great drama nor riveting suspense when you know ahead of time they are 2 of the 20 to be saved and their dialog doesn't come close to the bite of WWII film foxhole repartee. Cutting as often as he can to the dull families in New Jersey waiting for word about their lost loved ones, Stone still fails to make even this horrific event interesting.As a matter of fact, he fails to put the event into its larger context of a world crisis that changes the way we live forever. It's a challenge to do so if you choose only a small part of the event, but a great director should be able to as Stone did, for instance, with Wall Street, where the shenanigans of one broker clearly represented a corrupt generation of self-centered consumers.It's as if Oliver Stone promised Hollywood after his disastrous Alexander (which I liked) that he'd be a good boy and not editorialize about 9/11. Heck, point of view is Stone: Remember the conspiracy theory of JFK? Google ""Loose Change"" to get an introduction to 9/11 conspiracy theory and wonder why Oliver Stone couldn't have gone there rather than the straight way. Or at least part of the way.""While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware: Awake, awake!""

straight telling of smaller 9/11 story,"It's a normal New York morning on September 11, 2001.

Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez), and McLoughlin manage to escape into the elevator shaft.It's got some compelling iconic 9/11 moments although Oliver Stone doesn't actually show the planes crashing into the buildings. He's staying mainly close to these characters. He does a straight telling. He's not doing anything too risky. It is a bit long and the tension doesn't stay high.

"A different perspective, one of suffering most of us thank God will never have to know.","What's with all the griping .... A perspective from beneath depicting a suffering we pray we never face. And likely we won't. But I'm surprised that as many reviewers none of whom stated any firsthand experience would be as intolerant as to condemn what attempted a vantage point that wasn't pulled from thin air. I can only imagine the depth of research that had to go into conveying what these few men experienced; then down to the last 2 neither of whom Oliver Stone chose nor did they--even attempting such closeness, the intimacy required is amazing to me. Too dramatic? Exaggerated? Jesus the whole event went well over what I ever saw happening, and to capture even a glance of a horrendous reality is in my mind a success. Stone left politics out of it so I'll try, sort of. Only to say we Americans are strong. Even when an inept grifter wanders into our democracy to destroy it on a platform of divide and conquer and phony patriotism, we survive.

More innocent Afghanis were slaughtered by an act of blind vengeance than the total number of innocent victims of September 11th.As another person commented on this site, you'd think that the two NY cops buried in this film were the only victims...

Sad way of money making,"This movie brings nothing new. The only reason why people are going to watch disaster-movie nr 911 is because it stars the twin towers.It's a sad way of making some dough out of this (film-wise) uninteresting event.A couple of thousand people dieing is (how sad as it may be on a personal level) no unique happening; how many people die in Dafur, Ethiopia every month? Yet, I see no movie about that! There is probably more money to make with Americans dieing than with Africans starving.More interesting would have been a movie that deals with the ""why?"" question... Why does the US draw so-much aggression? If you are looking for answers to that question you will have to look elsewhere; not to be found in this movie.Mr. Stone misses a golden opportunity here.

Lassie Come Home type movie!  Happy Ending!,"I honestly like this movie, but it is a typically happy ending movie that is justified. Because I waited to buy the DVD I have had the chance to hear all the commentary that accompanies the film itself. I must say that the DVD is worth owning as I believe some scenes are a bit different in the commentary section than in the original movie.I had not wanted to see this movie believing it to be too soon after the tragedy to fully not just feel sorry for myself. I was right in one way and wrong in another. The movie does make me feel sorry for everyone who had been a victim on that day, but I do realize that it is an effective means of facing the trauma and getting over it too.While it is a narrow focus on only two men who are very important to the proceedings of the day, I believe it a well written script, well acted, and certainly, well directed. I loved this movie. It made me feel a whole lot better about the entire event! In time, I believe that it will be liked more and more. It is a beautifully made film.

"Gripping and Powerful, but no masterpiece","Gripping. Powerful. Masterpiece.These are just three of the words that have appeared in various print reviews for the new September 11th themed movie World Trade Centre.Directed by Oliver Stone (Platoon, Nixon) and starring Nicholas Cage (Matchstick Men), the movie chronicles the hours of two Port Authority Police Officers that were trapped in the rubble of the fallen World Trade Centre after the terrorist attacks on that fateful morning in 2001.The film's opening is quiet. It starts quietly at 3:59AM on September 11th, 2001. There is no rousing or exasperated musical score as Stone discretely takes us through Manhattan as we see people on their way to work as the two towers stand tall in the backdrop. In just five minutes we are reminded of the beauty of the buildings. The majestic presence they had over the New York skyline, and the horrors that were just hours away.As we meet the families of John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) we can anticipate the hardship and emotional tear jerking that will ensue. John is a father of four young children while Will has a wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is five month pregnant with their baby daughter.These two unknowing heroes gear up for work as if it were another day and are called soon after to the Towers to help with the evacuations. As they prepare emergency supplies and head for the elevator, we hear the crackling and buckling of concrete and metal that snaps in Dolby around the theatre. We know what is going to happen, but the audience was still on the edge of its seat until the inevitable occurs.To Stone's credit, he does not show the two towers crumbling down except for on the televisions in many background shots. Instead, he gives us a first hand impression as to what it must have been like for these two police officers who were in the lobby and running towards the elevator shaft for safety.The next hour and forty five minutes are split between listening to the two trapped men try and struggle to stay awake and alive while their families cope with not knowing their ultimate fate.World Trade Centre comes on the cusp of the five year anniversary of the event. Some media types claim that America may not yet be ready to relive the experiences of the day that will live in infamy. But World Trade Centre is a movie of hope. Of American's working together to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble. It is the American spirit lived through the world's eyes on that fateful summers day.It is Stone that should get the most credit here. He has constructed a movie that on paper doesn't seem that deep. Two men are trapped nearly the whole movie and cannot move while other rescue workers go about their jobs to find survivors. Without the backdrop of the event, the movie would never have been made as having Nicholas Cage's face being the only thing that can be seen on screen for ¾ of the film would be considered a waste of talent otherwise.But Stone casually brings the actual and/or inspired events of the two men gracefully to the screen while still projecting a sense of urgency and fear for those sitting at home awaiting word about their loved ones.Call me insensitive, but World Trade Centre and United 93 would make a great double bill. Both are based on real accounts of the day and both show the chaos of the situation and how normal men rose to the occasion to become heroes.Gripping? Yes. Powerful? Certainly. But a Masterpiece? No. World Trade Centre does have its flaws and in the Stone filmography, it ranks behind both Platoon and JFK. But the movie is above average. It will have you relive moments that are still as clear as the day they occurred. And you will watch again one more time in fear for the lives of those lost that day.www.robertsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
A view from below.,"I had the privilege of viewing this film pre-release. Neither having seen any previews, nor even realizing this film was in the works, I can honestly say I had no preconceived ideas about the film.This film basically takes the perspective of two port authority police officers who, during the course of their duty, become trapped in the World Trade Center collapse. The film is much less about the events themselves and much more about the perspective of the two trapped officers and their loved ones. That being said, there is not a whole lot of action. However, the flow of the movie is based on the suspense involving the officers and their families. Will they be discovered? Will they be rescued? Unfortunately this can make the two-hour movie seem to move a bit slow.The only negative thing I can think of at this time is that there could have been more focus on the efforts of rescue workers trying to free those trapped and find those who did not make it. However, this was evidently not Stone's intention.The camera work is great, the script writing regarding the main characters and the plot was good.There are some who think that Stone is simply trying to exploit the incident for a profit. I do not think this is the case. Five years post incident, Stone is trying to tell the stories of the two officers who were trapped as a tribute to all who gave their lives.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not What you expected,"When I went to go see World Trade Center, I was expecting to see a general layout of the events of 9/11. Instead you have these two port authority officers who are trapped under rubbel talking about their wives the whole time. The beginning started off very good in how they showed that it was a normal day in the lives of all the port authority officers. I believe that If He had made this movie a little bit more graphic it would have been nice because I was expecting to see a tear Jerker and I almost fell asleep. Of course, it was nice to see that the two men came out and survived but I think Oliver stone, the director could have upped this film a notch and it would have been perfect.

The only thing that I fell with this movie was boredom. OK, yes... I'm from Argentina and I don't lived with my own flesh and blood the S-11, so I can't know how it feels for the Americans. I totally agree. And there's where the film fails! Oliver Stone directed the film for Americans, not for outsiders. There's no great FXs, and the script and the history it's completely boring for those who not live on the US. (Honestly, I don't know where'd go all those millions that cost this movie.)The characters -and specially the marine- are crude imitations: They don't make you feel the pain, the despair, the fury, the hopeless and the grief that America lived in S-11 (unless, obviously, that you lived it).And in my humble opinion, all the fault falls down on Oliver Stone.

It is a movie that will remind you of that day, however, it is a movie about heroes, friendships and triumphs. Yes, there are points in the movie that you will tear up and even cry, yet there is also laughter at some points and there is a lot of positive throughout the movie even though it is was a time of crisis and horror surrounding the situation. The horror of that day does exist in the movie, however it isn't overplayed or too dramatic to watch.... Also, that is not the main part of the movie.

WTC--Emotional,"I had the privilege of attending a pre-screening of World Trade Center. I took my girlfriend with me to see it. I knew the actual guys survived the disaster but she did not so it gave us two different perspectives to the movie. This movie made me cry earlier in a movie than any other movie I've seen. The music and the emotional parts were very key and in the right places. World Trade Center did not keep one sad the entire movie, but was done well enough to be emotional when it needed to be. I was wondering how they were going to be found and when. My girlfriend was just hoping they would be found so it made it much more taxing on her emotions than it did mine. World Trade Center is a good movie to learn about some survivors of the tragedy. Also, it was good that it wasn't too political. I was happy about that.

But a boom microphone appears at the top of the screen some dozen times during the film.

"As emotionally disturbing it was to watch, it ended up being an incredible surprise of a great film","When I first heard of this movie being made, I had so many debates about this film, I almost hated Oliver Stone, after all, we just had only the 5 year anniversary of 9/11. I thought he was going to make some action movie of a horrifying and nightmarish event that is still fresh in most of our memories. So, I refused to see this film, but a girl at my work told me that it wasn't like what we both expected at all and that it was a great film. So, my friend and I decided to see it, I have to say that it was beautifully done and showed great respect for that horrible day.Gratefully and I must thank Oliver Stone, he didn't reenact or computerize the planes crashing into the towers, this movie just focused mainly on the policemen and firemen who gave their lives that day and to two strong and brave policemen who ended up in the most brutal and hellish nightmare, being trapped and buried alive under tons and tons of what was a 110 story building. Their struggle was so brutal to watch, but it kept your hopes and strength alive. 95% of the world only witnessed what happened on the outside, finally, this movie showed us what it was like to be in New York and what the firemen and policemen went through, along with their families.I have to say that it was so mentally disturbing though to see the towers in the beginning of the film, I actually started sobbing, because it's still to this day unbelievable that they're just not there. But still, it was pictured perfectly and beautifully done, I loved that they showed how much of a normal day it was for all of us before the plane hit the first tower.It's a beautifully acted and hopeful film that will make you remember that that day not only showed the worst evil in people, but it brought out some of the best and heroic acts anyone has ever witnessed. RIP to those 2800 people who lost their lives that day, you will never be forgotten. And on a special note, thank you to the firemen and policemen who fought, survived, and died on that tragic day, you may have done your job, but it was the most heroic thing anyone could have done, they saved more lives than we realized. Let's not forget.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
A narrow focus vs. a wider horizon...,"Some will call it the strength of the film--the fact that it deals almost exclusively with two of the trapped police officers beneath the 9/11 rubble rather than giving us a broader view of the tragic event. Others will lament the fact that it never widens its horizons to show us a more complete picture.Whatever, Oliver Stone has done a commendable job with what he has chosen to show--but leaving me with the feeling that I, personally, would have preferred a wider horizon of events. Instead he has chosen to tell the story while the men are trapped by going back and forth from the rescue scene to their worried families. It must be said that all of the dialog for these family scenes is completely natural and never seems forced or over sentimentalized.He has chosen not to show the actual footage of planes hitting the building at the start of the film--except for a background shot of TV footage--and the only time we are even reminded that planes did this damage is when we see a shadow of a plane against a skyscraper shortly before the first tower is hit. I think it's a mistake not to have shown this important footage as a prelude to his story.Of course, the dialog (which shows how much better communication should have been between police officers), does mention planes from time to time, so it's hard to understand just why Stone chose to blunt the visual impact this would have had at the opening of his film.Instead, he confines all of his coverage to the rescue efforts of two very heroic survivors who manage to keep each other alert under perilous circumstances. Since the two men are played in a totally real and sympathetic manner by NICOLAS CAGE and MICHAEL PENA, it is especially hard to witness their struggle to stay alive as even more dangerous rubble falls around them, making them even more vulnerable and helplessly trapped amid new explosions.All of the technical factors are excellent with regard to the realism of the war zone damage (before it was called a war), but strangely missing from the ground damage is the white ash that covered so many who ran from the huge clouds of smoke and debris. Only huge amounts of paper are strewn about, as though the ash never existed. This is the one technical blunder I found almost unforgivable.The women are competent, nothing more, as played by MARIA BELLO (as Cage's wife) and MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL as Pena's pregnant spouse. The emotional investment in the story depends entirely on the performances of Cage and Pena and they don't disappoint. Both are extremely real and affecting in difficult roles that limit their physicality due to being caught beneath the tower's rubble.Perhaps it's time for this to be seen for what it really is--a good reminder of the enemy we faced that day and still do--without politicizing the event the way we might expect Stone to do. And since most Americans seem to have short memories, it's a good thing Stone made this film when he did, memorializing the start of a new kind of war that began five years ago on 9/11.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Not just members of the police or fire departments.Every one of us that was in NYC on 9/11 are ""heros"" in one way or another. Not just firemen, policemen and emergency service personnel. I witness so many acts of compassion form everyday people that it gave me a new perspective of the human race.

Pretty good despite being flawed in some ways and also getting a head start emotionally as a drama due to the subject matter,"The morning of 11th September 2001 started just like any other for the police officers on duty in the Port Authority. However when a plane flies into one of the World Trade Centre towers, the majority of units are mobilised to respond. Sergeant McLoughlin and a small group of men go into the tower to try and rescue survivors from the floor above. Still at the foot of the towers when the first building collapses, McLoughlin's men are swamped and soon it is only him and rookie Jimeno left alive trapped in a small cavern below the rubble.Hard film to really review and judge this one. On one hand I was clearly moved and engaged by parts of it to the point where I did have to wipe away tears, but on the other hand, witnessing the death of thousands on live television and reliving those thoughts and feelings will hopefully always draw that reaction from me  not just for the deaths on the day but for the world we have lived in and the countless deaths that arguably happened as a result of this day. And that is pretty much how it was with this because I did find it hard to disconnect the wider topic from the story of the two men trapped. Perhaps this was the intension of Stone, to avoid replaying the footage we have all seen but instead make it a human story. If so then he succeeded but in doing so he didn't achieve the (perhaps impossible) task of making me treat this as just the story I was being told.This I found some of the flashbacks to be dull and quite unnecessary, filling in the lives of characters who really I already cared about  not as individuals perhaps but as receptacles holding a lot of other souls within them, while some of the family sequences were perhaps a bit too heavy and long for their own good. The film is at its best when it is depicting the scale of the losses while also highlighting the humanity of the response (well, initial response) from people from everywhere. It is unavoidably sentimental at times but mostly I was impressive by how it generally avoided mawkishness and really pushing buttons. I was worried for other reasons when I learned Stone was making the film  because of his track record of how he approaches subjects  but in the end the film is directly really well, handling the subject sensitively without reducing its impact and working well with the darkness and close-ups of the trapped men.The cast are mostly good and I do think that the same material delivered by lesser actors could easily have seen it plummeting to the level of daytime TV melodrama but you can see the effort the majority put into making this as genuine as they can. Cage gives a good performance and, these days, that should be sufficient praise. OK he is pinned and limited but he does what is asked of him. Peña I liked more as he had more expression and screen to work with. Shannon was effective and tough as Dave Karnes  and the film is kind enough to not explore his instant thoughts of war and revenge for fear it would leave a sour taste now that we are neck deep in Iraq; equally Dorff and Whaley give good ""heroic ordinary guy"" late in the film. Being in the families was a tougher job for the cast as this is the side that could have been soapy. Casting Gyllenhaal and Bello seems like the best way of countering that and indeed that is just what they do, making real their characters.Not a perfect film by any means then, because it does drift into soap opera and it does rather feel that we never get into the focused story within the bigger one, no matter how tightly it pulls the narrative around it. Still good and better than it easily could have been, but the real events do help by providing the emotion and shock already built in to the audience.",,Anonymous,History
"For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight.","For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight. It focused not on the forest but on the trees; specifically, a select sampling of the lives of those directly affected by the crash. It is an unabashed display of what it is to be human: how you can choose to give up or keep on fighting.I have a confession to make: I didn't care about 9/11 the way the world did when it happened five years ago; I was too busy tending to my own personal 9/11 and was pretty much numb to everything else around me. World Trade Center isn't the sort of movie I would actively like to see; I'd rather see something lighter or more entertaining, but it has been a while since my own personal hell, so I decided it was time to care and start feeling again.Seeing the grief, uncertainty and helplessness painfully unraveled on screen was therapeutic; some things happen beyond your control, no matter how well intentioned you may be. Some things you think would last forever, like the formidable looking Twin Towers, could crumble in an instant after all. When you think you have a big problem, the person next to you could be experiencing something much worse, and your pain pales in comparison.Michael Peña's character Will quotes from, of all movies, G.I. Jane, ""Pain is good; it means that you are alive."" At the time, his Sgt. John (Nicolas Cage), who was crushed by debris worse than he was, could barely chuckle at this, but he had to be strong for his underling; their lives depended on it.The movie works because it makes you FEEL. I'm glad that I finally got to soak it all in. After all, pain is something anyone can relate to; yes, even those that cause it will feel it some time, too.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stone Offers Both a Moving Personal Account and a Safe Perspective of 9/11,"Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like ""United 93"", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since ""Adaptation"", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Peña, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative ""Crash"" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The massacre of the innocents,"Oliver Stone carefully avoided to make of this movie a political pamphlet. It's only a sample story of how a mad and criminal act (supposedly committed in the name of a good cause) may affect the lives of a lot of innocent people and their families in a terrible tragic and dramatic way. But it's also a story of solidarity and of how people can put themselves at the service of others in moments of danger even at the risk of their own lives. The attack to the WTC that was supposed to hit USA as a global political and military target ended by killing, maiming and wounding thousands of peaceful citizens of several countries and also American civilians of several origins (Afro, Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish and others). That's the main message the movie conveys to us. Besides that we also can see how sometimes the psychological strain felt by the families of the victims can make family ties to become stronger and even enhance love between man and wife. The way the story is told and shown has no flaws or unlikelihood scenes and the visual narration is sufficiently pathetic. The acting or the performers is also good enough.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A   Pile of Rubble,"Awful ""docudrama"" concerning 2 cops who get buried under tons of rubble on 9-11. How dare Oliver Stone- who was quoted as saying America had it coming- make a movie to exploit this tragedy. Has America become so desensitized to the violence of the real world that we make films to exploit tragedies for the sake of entertainment? This and the earlier Flight 93 were the first- and hopefully the last films to capitalize on this tragedy. They died early deaths at the box office and it is easy to see why. As far as WTC is concerned, it does feature an average performance from Cage, and the rest of the no-name cast simply functions as a prop to support the paper thin screenplay. Needless to say, it is chock full of errors and anachronisms, but it is an Oliver Stone film, right?

It's a great story about courage with the focus, not so much on 9/11, but on the story of 2 policemen and their families.The problem I had was that if you are going to make a film about 9/11, then tell the story of 9/11. What made that day special was how people joined together to help out in any way possible. Fire departments, police departments and volunteers came from all over the country to offer their services and support.Oliver Stone's film doesn't touch on any of that for most of the movie. There are no firemen mentioned (don't know if that was a legal issue or not) and really not many characters. Then, for some reason, Stone decided to toss in all of these rescue workers, marines, EMT's, some firemen, etc... for the last 15 minutes of the movie.A lot of people gave their lives that day, and if, as a filmmaker, you are going to use a title like World Trade Center, then you should pay tribute to those people.On the plus side, Stone did a good job of recreating that day and giving us insight as to how it must have been for families who had loved ones in the WTC.Overall, I really wanted to like the film, and if you take the characters, put them in another collapsed building, change the title, and made it a stand-alone film, I would've liked it more. But instead, I felt like Stone was just using the World Trade Center name to attract attention and boost the box office numbers.",6.0,Anonymous,History
terrible,"Extremely slow movie. Never really takes off. Absolutely no suspense. No emotions. B-class acting for all actors, inclusive Cage, whom in fact,was buried 90% of the movie, and could not really act.... The buried scenes are simply awful, empty. In fact a movie to be buried. Technically the views, shots and also sound did not appear to be of the quality I expected such a movie to be. It appeared to me that this movie was made fast, with a tight budget. Really sad how Stone and Cage can produce such a low quality. At a certain point I thought about leaving the theatre since I knew what was going to happen anyway. Probably my expectations have been too high, taking into consideration Cage & Stone reputation.",1.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade Center - An Experience,"Many of us remember that morning so vividly. September 11th, 2001. I had the opportunity to see the film from Paramount Pictures and directed by Oliver Stone last night with about 50 firefighters from the Tucson Area as well as a handful of law enforcement officers.I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see the film. I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.I am so glad I went to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with Strong acting from a huge cast including Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena.Totally recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those that lost loved ones in the buildings.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"We will NEVER FORGET; Stone's inspiring, beautiful tale of true human spirit, Pena and Bello are perfect","***1/2 Nicholas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello, Jy Hernandez, Morgan Flynn.

Two Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimena (Pena, a shot for Best Supporting Actor) who get trapped in the rubble when the towers collapse. Also taking on the lives of their wives, (Bello, excellent performance Best Supp Actress worthy). The true story of these men is inspiring, touching and near tear jerking.

Not the Movie Oliver Stone SHOULD Have Made,"This is not the 9/11 film that Oliver Stone - director of JFK - SHOULD have made. Just as Fahrenheit 9/11 was Michael Moore's journalistic failure, World Trade Center was Stone's sellout.Instead of another 9/11 movie that attempts to give the American public an easy hero or two, why not just make a movie that examines what REALLY happened on that day? Why not just take a risk as a filmmaker and human being to bring forth the truth about 9/11 rather than subscribe to the flag-waving? Loving your country means accepting that it's not always going to be on the side of right and having the courage to help change it anyway you can. To some people, the extent of their cultural influence is their measly vote. In Oliver Stone's case, he reaches millions of eyes with his movies, yet he chooses to make pandering pieces of feces like this.Go back to making movies about dead rock stars if this is the best you can do, Oliver.",1.0,Anonymous,History
not a heroic film,"I was expecting the movie to depict the actual tragic events, not the lives of two men trapped in rubble. So maybe I didn't like it because my expectations were different. However, am I alone in saying that the film didn't really put into perspective the events of sept. 11th? The lives that were highlighted were those of cops who hadn't even saved anyone. They were gathering equipment, and they were in the concourse between the two buildings, not even in the towers. I also thought that the film came a little early , it's so fresh in everyone's mind and I don't think it really showed the heartache and despair that America went through. Like I said, I expected something different, but I thought it could have been a lot different.",,Anonymous,History
"Uneven, but has lots of powerful moments","some wonderfully poignant moments, especially when both police officers are stuck under the rubble. acting is generally uneven, especially from the less important roles. Nicholas Cage gives one of his best performances when he's dying underneath the rubble.i'm not sure if the flashback structure was enough to familiarize us with the officer's family lives and their importance to them. they probably should have had less flashbacks and spent more time in the beginning of the film with the families.the Jesus flashback should have been cut and the last flashback between cage and his wife is poorly written and not very well-acted. they should have cut this too.but, overall, its strong moments are so good, that you still feel as if you've seen a worthwhile film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Evoked strong Emotions,"I found myself transported emotionally back to 9-11-01 when the WTC was hit. I felt all the same feelings as well as the same intense fear...that our Nation was under attack. I thought that there was bit too much focus on the PAPD and not enough on all the first responders. What was happening while the men were trapped? Nothing was shown about how the Dispatch center was unable to handle the radio/telephone calls that were coming in. There was only the one death of the trapped PA policeman who died. Again, I felt the strong emotions, but did not feel as though the actual day was portrayed accurately. It was a horrific day in America, yet if one is to tell the story, then it needs to be told. Too much emphasis on the families and the wives having make-up on while the tragedy was unfolding. How difficult it would be to re-create that horrible day in just over 2 hours. It still conveyed powerful emotions and tears at times. God Bless America.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A terrific movie chronicling a pivotal, horrific day in our history","I usually go into an Oliver Stone movie expecting wild camera shots of an almost trippy nature, conspiracy theories and the usual Stone directing style. He was a completely different director in this movie. He refrained from the conspiracies and dizzying film work and told a very emotional, heroic story of that horrible day. If you didn't know Stone directed this movie upon viewing you would never know. All of the actors are at their best, as in most Stone movies. Even Nic Cage shows more acting chops than usual. Stone may be a gonzo director but he can get the best acting out of almost anyone. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that can watch a movie about this day and not get too upset over personal reasons. Even those people, people that may have lost a loved one, might be riveted by this film. It is very well done all around and shows you the heroics of ordinary men enduring extraordinary circumstances. So don't go into this thinking you won't like it if you dislike Stone's directing style. you won't see it here. Just a well directed, emotionally charged movie that chronicles the story of 2 port authority officers in a very respectful and gut wrenching manor.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cringeworthy,"Sentimental, self righteous and dull. It failed to address any of the myriad issues that could have been explored. Instead, we get cheesy apparitions of Christ and macho chest bangers who dissolve quickly to tears, all driven by an overload of emotion. It was clichéd beyond belief and a sadly missed opportunity. Ultimately, it did a disservice to the heroes of that horrendous event. Some of the early morning city-scape scenes were interesting. The special effects were unnoticeable, the way it should be. This presentation of reality gave the film the authenticity it was looking for. Nick Cage was underwhelming in World Trade Center. Among his many excellent works: Weatherman, Lord of War, Matchstick Men, Adaptation, this must be low point for him as it was for this Cage fan. The supporting actors were a partial salvation to the generally awful film-making. I think Oliver Stone is gradually revealing himself to be overrated. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, particularly if you're an American; For a start, it insults your intelligence and your sensitivity but, more significantly, it makes a mockery of your identity and your history. I'd be offended. Miss it now.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Straightforward Approach Works for Stone,"There will of course inevitably be films made about 9-11 and they will no doubt take many different approaches in telling their stories. This film, the second major effort at depicting the 9-11 attacks, approaches the story head-on, literally from Ground Zero, from the viewpoint of some of those most directly involved in the incident: Rescue Workers. The fact that this film was directed by Oliver Stone was/is a surprise. The film is benign in the sense that it does not postulate about what happened that day and why, which is not your typical Stone movie. Instead, it takes its time telling an intimate story about a group of Rescue Workers caught up in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and their battle to survive/escape an unimaginable hell.The film works because Stone takes the time to flush out his characters; we genuinely care about these people and feel their emotions as things turned from bad to worse that day. Cage, Bello, Pena, et.al. play their roles effectively, making us aware that 9-11 affected ""ordinary people"" and caused them to perform in an extraordinary way.All in all, an excellent film. While it is big-budgeted and full of big names, it simply tells one of MANY stories to be told on that day effectively and faithfully. As with United 93, I would recommend bringing Kleenex.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good but stalled at spots,"first of all - did Sgt. Thomas, the marine who was black ever get any credits or acknowledgment in the credits??? Not that it was a documentary, but whoever is doing the research could have done a better job. It may seem so petty or insignificant but it's a huge blunder to portray everyone else as accurately as possible, yet assume the marine was white. Anyway, a decent movie which could have been cut down as it stalled several times, as I guess the producers were trying to evoke some type of emotion. Nevertheless, I would recommend this film merely to showcase a different perspective of what happened during this time. The casting was pretty good and provided a more realistic perspective of what the families, as well as the men went through.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't waste your time or money,"This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. What happened to Oliver Stone? Did he get put on the Bush administration's payroll? Okay it was horrible what those 2 men went through, but it was horrible for everyone, especially those who were here in Manhattan that day and all those who were affected by the events of 9/11. Those 2 men were brave in the sense that they got hurt doing their jobs, but they didn't even know what was happening when they got trapped in the debris. The heroes are the people that KNOWINGLY went in to save them and others trapped in the debris. Also the script supervisor should have been fired. They must have driven from the port authority to the trade center 5 times that morning, if one pays even the slightest bit of attention to the bus windows on the ride down to ground zero. The story was not compelling in the slightest and technically the movie was AWFUL. What is up with Maria Bello's eyes? Granted she (I assume) was playing a character with blue eyes, but you'd think that with Stone's budget they could have some how gotten better contacts or fixed it in post. She doesn't shed one tear in the film probably b/c her contacts would have come flying out. The whole movie was republican/ right wing propaganda. How could a director, especially one like Stone, actually tell such a boring and unemotional story with a subject matter like that of 9/11? Save your money and your time!!",1.0,Anonymous,History

This is one of the best films I have seen since the ear 2000.I wanted to go see World Trade Center today, I had been looking forward to seeing it for a couple months now and I was pretty dam excited about it...then I found out my mom wanted to go see it too...Well, I don't ever go to the movies with my mom...ever...I think I did once when I was 6 to see the Lion King...but you get the point....so well, I didn't wanna not go. I knew she knew I want to go so, I went with her. So I went in the movie, looking around me , feeling so lame being at the movies with my mom. I sat down, still kinda hiding from anyone that might see me, G-d forbid I get caught with my mom at the movies, right? Well the movie started, and I forgot about that. I got lost in the movie, It was definitely dramatic and suspenseful...and above all...real. You see everything. What everyone went through...and how they went through it...it was terrible yet very inspiring. When the ending credits were starting, 2and a half hours later, and they were saying how many people dies and all that, I didn't even care that I was OH NO! at the movies with my mom. You know, the movie shows how much I take for granted, we all do really. I was sitting there thinking, ""Thank G-d I'm sitting here with my mom watching this movie, truly thank G-d"" Its definitely a truly great film and I want everybody to see it. The acting is brilliant, the special effects scarily real, and the message between the lines, and the story it boldly tells, priceless. Definitely the movie of the year.

Good if a somewhat narrow minded tale,"I don't think it was really a good idea to make a movie on this topic when it's still so fresh in everyone's mind but it is very sensitively made as there are no shots of the plane hitting the towers and no carnage or bodies to speak of which is a good idea in the circumstances.This is a good movie but does drag during the playing time which isn't particularly long. In a terrible disaster such as this where over 2,700 people died I found it strange that the tale was only about two Police officers trapped in the rubble which is basically the film from start to finish. The acting was on par and the set design gets a special mention as the re-creation of ground zero was spot on but I will find this hard to recommend due to slow pace and very narrow story telling. I did find in some (Although rare) instances my mind wandering during some of the scenes. One aspect of the film I can't fault was the way the film made you think of all the people who lost there life's and the grief the family members must of felt (and still feel) as I did feel genuinely moved in some instances.I read another comment on this site that mention's the fact that this could of been a film about a couple of miners trapped in a coal mine and you wouldn't of noticed the difference which is a fair comment to be fair as no other avenue's are ever explored.All together a good, well made film but very slow in places.

Don't Sleep; Don't Sleep; Almost did,"I was looking forward to this movie early in the summer, then I stared watching most of the movies that were expected to be good and I was let down so I stopped looking forward to this believing it was to be a let down, I was right. I really disliked this movie for many reasons.First of all, the casting was bad. I dislike who they chose to be police men, wives, firefighters; everyone. And the people who they chose were bad actors. Throughout the movie I couldn't feel any emotion from them, any pain, any happiness; nothing. Even Nicholas Cage was disappointing.But there is a lot more. There is no character development. No stories really to the people that are trapped or dieing. I didn't feel sorry for them or felt any emotion. You see a little bit of their family but you don't see how much they love them before hand then you see them suffering because they might not see them again. I felt like they didn't care that they wouldn't see their family again.I'm not a cop, or firefighter or anything like that but wouldn't they be more cautious walking around all that rubble. Or even in the building, why would they keep so many people inside the burning trade center; wouldn't they move them out of there? Maybe not; if you disagree with this point maybe I could this part wrong.It was overall boring as well. All it was is people talking; more people talking; more; more; more, nothing else besides talking. I was really bored after they got trapped because nothing happened; at all. Even when they were looking for them it wasn't interesting.The only reason I give this a 2 is because it looked cool at times, yes call me evil or what ever but it looked cool at times.

Lest we forget...,"I remember watching this movie back in 2006, and I wasn't particularly impressed back then. Why? Well, I had sort of an aversion towards Nicolas Cage back then (which I have gotten past since).

I will say that this movie is actually rather intense and nicely played by the actors and actresses.They had a great cast ensemble in the movie, with lots of familiar faces on the cast list. I had actually forgotten that the movie also had the likes of Michael Peña, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jon Bernthal on the cast list. So it was a nice move to return to watch it a second time.The storyline in the movie, while this is definitely something that most of us still vividly remember, was nicely portrayed and told, taking into consideration the tragic events that unfolded that day. And director Oliver Stone managed to direct and deliver a movie that wasn't slushed in pro-American coating. It is a movie that delivers more of a character focus on the fire fighters than on the actual tragedy itself, and that is something that speaks well in favor of the overall feel of the movie.

By doing this, it allows us to experience the event through the eyes of the responders who had no idea what had just happened.The film spends around 45 minuets diving into the backstory of these two officer's lives.

Oliver Stone gives up controversy and takes off any personality from  World Trade Center,"Will Jimeno, rookie cop of the Port Authority of New York, and his sergeant, John McLoughlin, were survivals number 18 and 19 to be extracted from the rubbles of the World Trade Center, in September 11 of 2001. After them, only one more victim would be found alive. 20 people saved, against 2 749 fatal victims. That is the kind of statistics that suggests predestination and heroism that leads to, in a appropriated scale, a story with a high tone ending. Exactly the masterpiece, at last, that could interest a large studio dedicated into making a film that doesn't dishonor the facts, and that yet the public still wants to see. The most curious thing is that a project like this ended up in the hands of a director like Oliver Stone, known for his excesses, his conspiracy theories and his explosives political inclinations. But in World Trade Center (2006), the director does whatever possible to brake himself. Shows the two cops leaving their houses while their wives and kids are still sleeping. Follow them from start to what appears to be a normal day and, after, in the confusion of the emergence call. Bury them in great style and follow them in their mutual effort to stay alive, as well as their families, that are unaware of their destiny. Result: of two so specific stories such as of Jimeno and McLoughin (respectivelly Michael Penã and Nicolas Cage) it is made a narrative so absolutely generic - a sort of Apollo 13 on Ground Zero.This confusion between respect and dull-ness (that former director Paul Greengrass skillfully avoided in United 93) is what makes World Trade Center so unsatisfactory. Fearfull of being accused of sensationalism, Stone suppressed all and any shots of the towers themselves. either of the impact of the airplanes, either of the collapse. Alleges that these images have nothing more to offer - and that is saying a lot more of his fear that he has today of his instincts to controversy then of the emotional spirit of the audience regarding the tragedy. In several interviews to the press and critics, the director said that his intentions were to portray the moment before the politicalization of the attacks, when the world was still on the same side of the Americans. It is highly doubtful that, considering the scenes of commemoration in arab countries immediately after the fact, that he believes what he is saying. The most likely is that he is trying to re-invent himself as a non-political being.

A little bit disappointed with this movie,"9/11. We all know the horrible tragedy that showed up on our TV screens. We all felt, even if we didn't lose anybody, like a part of ourselves had been ripped out. The traumatic effects of 9/11 left us all emotionally scarred, but we move on. And sometimes we remember. Our favorite way of remembering something is through a movie. So here we have World Trade Center: giving us the story of 2 men who get caught in the rubble of the Twin Towers, fighting with every breath for their own lives.Unfortunately, the movie is not as good as I have already made it sound. It's not because we got Nicholas Cage in the film, as everybody complains. As a matter of fact, I think he did OK with such a delicate part. And the other guy buried in the rubble with him was phenomenal. It's the writing and timing that completely wrecked the film.The movie opens with these 2 guys regular lives, and fifteen minutes, the Twin Towers have been hit. A little too soon; we needed to know our characters a little better. Anyway, the guys walk in to the building LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. I repeat, the men walked around LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. There in a building full of panicked, bleeding people, and they actually make a couple of jokes AS THEY WALK through the building. I was so stunned by the fact that these men did not run through the building trying to help. This goes on for a frustrating ten minutes. The towers collapse.At this point, I would like to let you know that I thought my father died. My father did not work in WTC, but he still worked in Manhattan, and he still hadn't called us, and we couldn't get through. I felt a burning sensation in my heart, and I remember crying my eyeballs dry, thinking my father was dead. That was so emotional for me.So like I said, the towers collapsed. The two men spend about an hour and a half of film time under the rubble. We also have clips of their families panicking. One of the families, I can't remember which, was frustrating beyond words. I was really hoping that that idiot kid would drive to Manhattan and die in the rubble, because all he did was scream at his mother. There is also an over-the-top military man who finally saves these two men. We see them in the hospital, and what you see is a bit intense. Then the movie ends about 3 minutes later.The only part that kept my jaw dropped was everything that happened before the men entered the WTC. After that, the emotional effects of 9/11 that I had felt that day rubbed off. The movie ended, with the only positive thing coming out after that point was the phenomenal actor.Part of remembering traumatic events like this is to put the pain back in people, the fear, and the loss. Although it is a horrible thing to think about, we do it. Obviously the writer did not think of how he felt after 17 minutes. 5.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
The second of two excellent 9/11 films,"Normally, I am not a fan of Oliver Stone, having only slightly liked a few of his films. I also know about his penchant for conspiracy-spouting in his films, and I took that with me into the film. What I saw, however, was a truly inspirational, realistic, and gritty film that left me in awe of the two brave men depicted in the film, and how the extraordinary events of a day that will forever be in our memories affected even the most normal of people. I have also seen United 93, which was an incredibly realistic and powerful film. Thankfully for myself and every other viewer of World Trade Center, Mr. Stone left his conspiracy soapbox at home, and presented another film about 9/11 in the same vein as that earlier film. It doesn't present anyone as a hero--just a bunch of ordinary people caught up in one of the worst losses of life in our nation's history. However, by the end of the film, you learn that there is a hero in all people, and that when called upon by circumstances, everyday people can become truer superheroes than any comic book character ever was. I highly recommend this film to everyone, though its more graphic sequences may be unsuitable for younger viewers (under 13). In fact, I think both this and United 93 should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand why this--like Pearl Harbor for my grandparents and JFK's assassination for my parents--is the day my generation will remember exactly where each one of them was when it happened.

That's right, the genius behind Platoon, The Doors, Natural Born Killers, JFK, Born On the Fourth of July, Midnight Express, and Scarface, the ""Emperor of Excess,"" who got to where he is with his fearless edge. World Trade Center has no edge. If I'd not known it was directed by Stone, I would've actually said something like, ""Stone would be aggravated if he saw this."" Maybe he is, but the difference is that it actually is directed by him. Its problem is that it has the spirit of your average corny patriotic fluff. The dialogue, the characters, the plot itself, the slow-motion shots of melodrama...they're all on par with the work of some studio director-for-hire.The film starts off very well. It begins with the quiet atmosphere of early morning in New York City. It has a growing suspense. There's an effectively disturbing minimalist depiction of the attack on the Towers. After that, the movie takes the Pearl Harbor route and inflates with stale dialogue and token worried-wives-sitting-at-home characters and aggravating clichés such as those. yes, it's a true story, but the fluffy treatment of it is what takes it down.Perhaps Stone just wanted a surefire way to bring himself back up to the top after his long absence punctuated by the box office disaster of the underrated Alexander. A movie about 9/11 is both controversial and intriguing enough, and with his name attached, everyone knows they're in for a slashing perspective, but for whatever reason, he took the safest route through the story. Maybe he had to, because JFK and Platoon were made decades after Kennedy's assassination and the Vietnam War. Perhaps not enough time has passed for the masses to really be ready for such a harsh blunt-eye view of the September 11 attacks. I know I am, though.Hopefully Stone will get back on track. He's been off of it for way too long.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Standard Rescue Drama,"This starts out like it is going to be a fresh and exciting take on the World Trade Center attack, but then gets bogged down and becomes a standard rescue drama. Two cops find themselves stuck under the rubble of the collapsed WTC - will they be rescued in time? Their families are very worried. Cage and Pena provide solid performances, and the images of the wreckage are intense. Based on true story.",5.0,Anonymous,History
WTC:  Police Rescue,"I was disappointed with the movie. I expected it to cover many aspects/angles of 9/11 with the title ""World Trade Center"" however after viewing it with my sister, I think the title should have been something along the lines of ""WTC: Police Rescue."" There were not very many common people involved in the movie...it was all about cops and other rescue personnel. Don't get me wrong...I support these people. My dad lived most of his life as an EMT here in Kentucky. It's just that with a title and with a topic so broad, all should have be incorporated into the film. Outside of a few theatrical glitches, it was an okay movie. I still recommend that all Americans view the film seeing as it is about an event that affected our country.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Terrifying and moving account of the day we'll never forget,"I didn't want to see this movie. It seemed too self-serious and ""important"" in its marketing. It made it look like a movie where the men go off and do brave things, and get put in mortal peril, and then they cut away to the wives at home grieving. I had forgotten that this was based on a true story, and when the film had finished, I remembered the news story about it.So, since it is a true story and reminds you of such before the film starts, you'll find yourself giving leeway to it's sometimes melodramatic moments. There's something in knowing this was based on completely true events that lends the capital ""A"" acting more license. And that's the triumph of this movie. The acting is, almost entirely, beyond most of its cast. There's moments where only knowing that this actually happened makes it believable. Nicolas Cage is probably at his worst, while this is something of a triumph for Michael Pena. However, you buy into their world so thoroughly, and that is mostly due to the remarkable and terrifying ""hell on earth"" that falls upon them. Cutting back to the grieving wives is surprisingly poignant, and the film does this often. Maria Bello is particularly compelling, though it may be she had a more interesting role to play than Maggie Gyllenhal.You'll ask yourself if this movie trivializes the events of 9/11. You'll be tempted to, but you won't, because all of a sudden you'll remember how you felt on that day, and there's a reliving it all over again.Oliver Stone is famous for his conspiracy theories (or at least he is in the common press.) World Trade Center presents a thoughtful and compelling conspiracy theory all it's own...Common human decency was the undercurrent of 9/11, not insurmountable evil. You remember after the dust settled and the shock wore off, you appreciated your public servant's a lot more. You'll remember why there were wreaths placed by strangers at the NYPD and FDNY. These men exceeded their training and their orders to do something they knew was right. These weren't superheroes, just the embodiment of what lies in each of us, even those of us who are many times selfish and cruel. Stone's theory is that despite all the misery, murder and mayhem of 9/11, common human decency won out. It's a tender reminder from a brutal scar on our common history that we can be as fierce and violent as we can be heroic and kind. Any film that makes you feel that good after you remember how bad you once felt is doing something right.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Missing the spirit of 9/11,"When I was watching the film, I was affected and touched by what is depicted on the screen. It's visually stunning, and the images felt real. However, once I had time to reflect on it, I realized the real substance is missing from the film, and my grade has dropped accordingly. What's the point the film tries to convey? We saw two people who were just walking, hadn't helped anybody to escape before getting stuck under the rubble, and they spent the next couple of hours talking to each other to keep themselves alive, and they got rescued. They are survivors, not heroes, and that shouldn't be the spirit of a 9/11 film. When I think of 9/11, I thought about heroism, chaos, and people who were killed on that day. United 93 touched on all, while World Trade Center showed very little. The story Oliver Stone told could very well be about two mine workers who got stuck and rescued after a random mining accident instead. The approach and end-result dilute the significance of the event.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Made for Money and Nothing Else,"I can't say that I am an Oliver Stone fan (he's way to political for my tastes)...but, I am fair minded and I gave this film an objective look at an advanced screening. I liked some of his movies in the past that had some bite and were a bit cutting edge, but here, in this disappointment, Stone morphs into a $ellout.This movie was made to tug at our heart strings and appeal to our sorrowful sides of what each one of us experienced watching this horrific event unfold in 2001. The bottom line is that they wanted to cash in on America's most devastating tragedy.Don't think for a minute that the producers and Stone were not thinking of anything else, but to exploit and ""money grab"" on an opportunity to benefit and capitalize. To me, that's just plain wrong.Does the film succeed? I say no. It's too much manipulation and after a while you will not be able to stand all the nagging melodramatic music which is way over the top. The movie tries too hard to be a crowd pleaser. Period.$tone used to be a good story teller...even when he was working as a paranoid rabble rousing conspiracy freak, but here he goes for the exploitive sentiment of bravery.September 11, 2001 was a seminal moment in American history. On that day the world saw horror and evil. Oliver $tone and his producers saw dollar $ign$ and ""possibilities"".The filmmakers didn't see evil that day... they saw the ""opportunity"" to make a lot of money and they should be ashamed of themselves for exploiting one of the greatest tragedies in American history.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Good story about bravery, duty, and humanity...but that's what we already knew about 9/11.","Given the poignant content of this film, it is difficult to be critically tough on it. However, bravery, duty,and most of all, humanity, is what we already knew and understood about 9/11, and quite bluntly...that's all this movie is, and not one tiny dimension more. It is about 4 people essentially; the 2 Port Authority cops who are trapped in the rubble of the disaster, keeping each other alive,and their wives who must deal with the agonizing uncertainty of what is happening, and what is going to happen to their families. All other characters are awarded non-distinct roles. Stephen Dorff; I was surprised to find out later that you were there. That is what is hugely missing here; a big picture look at at how this monumentally shocking and mind-numbing piece of history affected us all. It's as if this situation struck these four people directly, and the other characters felt sorry for them. Speculation was that Oliver (Stone)was going to make a bombastic statement here, but quite drastically opposite is the conspicuous void that leaves us wondering about how this offensive affected us beyond just poor John and Willy. OK, so maybe this was a meant to be a personal micro-look at how this horrific event shook a few individuals and their families, such that we can identify with, and relive the experience, as if we were personally and directly involved as they were. Bravo...mission accomplished here. But, a great movie is supposed to take our imaginations further and fill in gaps that we never imagined. This story should have plenty of that. Imagine the horror of being trapped in the stairwell of a doomed building...and having your last words with your loved ones on cell phone.... before the world caves in on your head. Sorry...I shouldn't have gone there, but maybe the movie should have....",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not that great for the subject matter...,"9/11 is a very easy subject to make a great film out of. This movie was alright but not great, and it should have been a whole lot better based on the subject. It does not seem that hard to make a really good movie about the terrorists attacks in NYC. This movie is also plagued with bad acting and poor directing. In fact, Cage seems to be the only person keeping the movie in the box office. In my opinion it certainly does not deserve a 7.2. If you are looking for a 7.2 then i suggest you stay home. I went into the theater expecting to leave a different person, but that was not the case. Go see something else, because this certainly was not worth the $2.00 I paid to see it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Not exactly a great film, but important none-the-less","I think any film that is made about 9/11 is going to be met with high scrutiny and often with a lot of people who'll just turn their noses up at it; claiming that it's just a shameful attempt to cash in on a tragedy to make a profit. To those arrogant, self-indulgent and brainless people who like to judge films before having actually seen them I only have one thing to say; shut up. This film and Paul Greengrass' amazing United 93 serve a bigger, more important purpose than money or profit. These films are meant to inspire, encourage and act as an important reminder of the power and bond that all Americans have to one another in great times of grief and tragedy. Where United 93 was about a group of strangers banding together to fight a common enemy, World Trade Center is about the courage and strength of men who put their lives on the line to help save others. This isn't a film about death and evil and destruction, it's about life, hope, strength, love and the courage to act, and rise up in a time when you are most needed. Any tears that you cry during this film are more likely to be tears of joy.World Trade Center is an Oliver Stone film, that's oddly enough not an Oliver Stone film; there's no political commentary or message, and no conspiracy theories. I don't think America is quite ready for those films, but I don't doubt that at some point they will get made, eventually, but as for now filmmakers seem to be sticking to the reality of what happened on that day and not making up wild stuff and passing it off as the truth. Oliver Stone's usual style of intense editing, use of black & white film and historical stock footage isn't present in World Trade Center. It doesn't look, sound or move like your typical Oliver Stone film; this is probably the most straightforward film in his career, and it works well because of it.This film is based on the incredible true story of two Port Authority Police Officers, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), who were buried in between the twin towers, below twenty feet of rubble. This is just one story of many on the events of that unforgettable day, but this is their story. John and Will were only two of twenty people that were rescued out of the wreckage of the twin towers. Their story won't just grab your throat, but also touch your heart; it's not in the slightest way depressing, it's downright inspiring. I think this is a film that you don't WANT to see, but you HAVE to see. It's a reminder to live life to the fullest, and to not take it for granted, because you never know what tomorrow may bring.The film balances back and forth from being stuck in the rubble; fighting to stay alive, and showing us what the families of the trapped men go through during the day. The wives want to remain hopefully, but the tension of not knowing what's going on and what's happening are shaking them to their core. And if you think these guys survived the collapse and are safe, and just waited to be rescued, you'd be dead wrong. The danger is very much present the whole time and at any minute they could have been killed. The performances are pretty good, especially Michael Pena as Will Jimeno. Mark my words; this guy's got an Oscar coming to him in his future. Heck, even Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff offer solid and respectable performances. Oliver Stone must have done something extraordinary, right? Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello also deliver durable performances. Although I must say that those bright blue contacts that Maria wore really distracted from her performance. They looked great in Underworld, but here they just look really bad. World Trade Center isn't a great film, and not quite at the same kind of masterful level as United 93 was, but this film is a respectable and important reminder of that tragic day, and it's done with class, emotion and most of all respect.Some people have said that it's too soon for films to be made about the events of 9/11. I think that's bullshit. There have been plenty of books, documentaries (mostly with political agendas) and TV movies made on 9/11, but most of those things have focused on the darkness and death of that day. What's wrong with taking two hours out of your busy day to be reminded of what good that can come out of it? I think we owe at least that much to them. You have to take the good with the bad, and to remember that day as nothing but bad would be a real tragedy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
....wow.....what a piece of crap......,"I'd like to talk to you all about a movie. A movie that I saw recently called World Trade Center. What's it about, you might ask if you're an idiot. But, if you don't know, it's about the September 11th attack on the Twin Towers, and about two Port Authority officers that went inside one of the crumbling buildings and got trapped under the rubble. Now, a movie with this kind of story and the fact that it's based on a sad story will tell you one thing: You might have to bring along a few boxes of Kleenex into the theater. I thought that I was gonna need a little of the tissue when I saw this. But bruh, let me tell youthe only tissue I needed was the tissue for my ass after I s*** myself because of how crappy this movie was. Not kidding.Now, of course, the movie's story is pretty damn good. The attacks were pretty harsh and sad, and you'd expect that if a movie was made about those horrible events, you'd feel like you got roundhouse kicked in the face so hard that you just have to cry. NOPE. How can a movie with such a powerful story not be sad and touching? With my bad-ass wisdom, I'll tell you how: The movie is so damn pretentious and it tries so damn hard to make you cry that it fails. Even though I'm so ridiculously manly, I like watching a movie that brings on a few tears from time to time, and I expected my eyes to have horrible, water-diarrhea. The exact opposite, bruh, the exact opposite happened. First off, the trailer was more touching than the movie. It was more powerful. The movie itself was close to two and a half hours of nothing. When a character died, even though it's upsetting because it actually happened, you don't feel anything when you're watching it. The movie makes almost no effort to add subtlety to any moments that would normally make you cry. Instead, it's so damn pretentious that it almost forces you to disregard the crappy movie-making and crappy script and just accept what's going on and shed a few tears. Oliver Stone might as well have just walked on-camera, and asked us to cry. Sorry, bruh, but I like my tears to come out naturally, not to be forced out.It's almost like people feel obligated to act like they're moved by this movie. They watch it, and when they walk out they praise it just for the sake of praising it. They say to themselves, ""Wow. What a tour de force, guys."" They like it before they even see it. The story of these two officers is pretty moving, but this movie just doesn't make you feel anything other than complete ri-godd**n-diculous boredom. I mean, when you're watching a movie about such a horrible tragedy, and you're not moved or crying, you know they did something wrong.Of course, people are gonna make comparisons to United 93. I haven't seen that, but I do know that it's an insanely sad movie, and that it isn't full of itself. It might be on a tiny budget, but that's what separates it from this pile. Another thing about this movie was that the cast was too recognizable, whereas in United 93, everyone was an unknown. Now, these actors were cool and everything, but when you're watching this and saying to yourself, ""Damn, isn't that cop the bad guy from Blade?"", you know something's a little amiss. It takes you completely out of the movie. Any other movie is fine, but with such a true story it's not cool to have big name stars that are easily recognizable.Now, I know I'm one of the few people that hated this movie. Of course, morons are gonna read this and say, ""Ha, well, I guess you have no respect for America or for all those people that died on that day! Why don't you just praise the terrorists?!"" Nope. Not true, bruh. I have the most respect for the people that died. What I don't like is crappy movies made off of those stories that fail to be moving, touching, or tear-inducing, which they very well should be. That's what I hate, bruh, that's what I hate.Score: 4.Let me summarize how I felt about this movie: This movie is like when you're about to go to sleep at night after a hard day's work. You think, ""Damn, bruh, this is gonna be a good ass sleep."" Let me remind you, sleep is the movie right now. You go to sleep, and then you wake up in the middle of the night with a gut-wrenching stomach ache because you have to take a massive, colossal crap. Boom. The great sleep you thought you were gonna have is now crap. That's how I felt about this movie. I thought I was gonna experience something great and moving, but instead, it got derailed by, yes, you guessed it, bruh, CRAP. You all know what I'm talking about.",4.0,Anonymous,History
cynical and insincere movie experience,"Set against the backdrop of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States comes this dramatization of the true account of two N.Y.C. police officers—both stable family men—who lead a courageous rescue to try and save the remaining survivors inside the World Trade Center, that is until a secondary accident leaves them trapped beneath the wreckage. Well-crafted film is acted with strength and conviction, but the dramatic aspect of the story fails to convince or generate any real, genuine emotion, and the conclusion is gratuitously patriotic. You'd expect a lot more substance from director Stone, but what wants to be a triumphant, heartfelt tale of heroism and survival instead comes off as a hollow and ponderous movie trying to cash in on a sad chapter in American history. **",,Anonymous,History

The World Trade Center,"September the 11th is now a day of remembrance, to remember the thousands who died in the two building's.Yes, an important time but how many movies do they have to make? It seems like this terrible incident turned into a Hollywood money-maker! I first saw Flight 93 on TV. It was a very good movie yet it left out very important parts. Then I saw United 93 and I thought I was watching Flight 93 again! They might as well have taken Flight 93 off TV, put it into the theaters and change the ""Flight"" to ""United"". But then the World Trade Center movie came out...The day started as John McLoughlin (played by Nicolas Cage) went off to work as a police officer. He is a great veteran cop who was put in-charge to direct his unit through the runes of the tower. The second plane soon hit, leaving John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (played by Michael Peña) trapped in the rubble. A big part of this movie is about survival, and it showed how these officers had the strength to continue. I think Oliver Stone (the director) also wanted to show the audience how September the 11th didn't only effect the victim's in the towers, but also all of America.Half the movie the camera was on Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña's character, but the other half was on their family's and how they were effected. The whole family got together and sat by the TV listening for updates. Each family had their own unique story which touched the audience. Oliver Stone did a good job.I didn't understand why the camera didn't show the airplanes running into the towers though... you see the house shake, or a shadow of the plane on a building... but you never see it hit the World Trade Center. Were they too lazy to add more CGI? Also this movie was supposed to show how hundreds of officers went into the buildings to save all those lives even though they knew they might perish in the wreck. But when John McLoughlin asked his unit who will be joining him for the rescue, only 3 people stepped forward. If you are making a movie about the courage of the police then you should show it! Good movie overall. See it!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worst movie I've Seen in a Long Time,"The first 20 minutes were ok. But Oliver Stone chose to leave out what we saw that day.

Truly offended. The Negative Reviews De-Bunked very quickly,"First, this isn't a political film, this is a character-driven film. I hate I have to even touch on the politics. The trade centers went down. Fact. Because of terrorists, fact. THey killed 3,000 people in 3 hours. Fact.The film doesn't show the towers falling down. The film doesn't mention anything about why, who, or what motivated anyone. It focuses on a small group of men, risking their lives to save others in the light of tragedy, and in the process, creates onE of the best dramatic duo performances of the decade.Cage and Pena are truly incredible here! Undoubtedly the best performance from Pena and Probably the second best performance or even equal to Leaving Las Vegas for Cage. Tour-De-Force acting. Surprised Michael didn't get an Oscar nom here.I can see why anti-American's would hate this film. It shows everything that is great about Americans and New Yorkers in 2 Hours.It's quite simply the best 6.0 film on IMDb, and more deserving of 8/10 imo. 81/100 is where I'm scoring it. It's not the best film I've ever seen but it's a very strong film, and easily top 10 for the year it was released. The film is about the moment, not any motivation or reaction. Period. Get a life people.Watch this movie if you haven't. Strike every 1-2 star rating as American-hate - No movie with these types of performances should even sniff those low-scores... the movie doesn't have an agenda but anyone who would score it a 1-2, with this quality, most assuredly does(you can take that to the bank). 1 or 2?

World Trade Center- who said it was a bad movie?,"The movie was very emotional. Once I saw the movie, I cried but other people are sticking to their agreement that the movie sucked. Well I personally rated the movie a six because the acting was beautiful and it really touched my heart. I would have liked to see more on the World Trade Center and how it changed our lives, HOWEVER the story told a excellent thing. That we should be grateful for what we have and who we are today because really all jaws dropped when we saw the news flash that the world trade center came down. I loved the movie, I loved the acting but I really think that there should be more of the world trade center falling down because 9/11 really is nine one one and I guess the maker decided to quote that in a movie rather than just a presenter. I'm sure that the two firefighters that the movie was based on- (the real people) saw the movie and knew ""wow the movie is based on me. I didn't think people would cry at that"" I appreciate all the work that was put into the movie and I appreciate that people gave up their lives to save people. It was very moving and it did in fact show how America can share one but once war starts, America will give back to the fighters and pull them out of the rubble alive. That just goes to show you that 9/11 was not just a tragedy but it was a lesson we have learned since the lesson on Titanic in 1914. It was a nice film and I look forward to see others dedicated to the firefighters,army leaders,police team and just day to day people who saved others knowing their lives could go any second. There is one thing I would like to point out.... Five years does not change America. It only just changes the people inside it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
We Can All Be Heroes.,"Hot on the heels of ""United 93"" (arguably the best film of 2006), comes Oliver Stone's 9/11 drama ""World Trade Center"". Two New York City port authority police officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) get trapped as the first tower crumbles to the ground and we get a human drama that transcends time and the overall tragedy of that fateful day. The two men think about their lives and loves as their wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the very real possibilities that their husbands will not ever come home again. Stone's picture lacks the intensity and nervous feelings generated by ""United 93"", but the human interest is right on key. Stone, a noted conspiracy theorist who always has his ear to the pavement, decides to go the opposite route here and focus on the way that we joined together and raised up as one as buildings fell to the ground and changed the world forever. Sometimes difficult to watch and flawed, ""World Trade Center"" is still a memorable and important picture that will have significant historical and personal value as the years pass. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
Should have been a great movie instead of a merely good one,"I realize that certain people, especially in national tragedies, need special attention, but I wanted to see a lot more events that took place on 9/11, than just what these two officers and their families went through?

Or how people across the country are affected by it?

Not What It Should Have Been,"I knew what to expect. I read the reviews before buying this, but it's Cage, so it goes in the collection, regardless. I have to say that this was not what it should have been.While this is a fantastic dramatization of what happens with four rescuers, it fails to tell anything about the actual event itself. Many movie goers were looking for an Oliver Stone's JFK-stylized World Trade Center type drama, and instead we got a look through the microscope rather than a look at the larger picture, as told by the evidence. I think that's what disappointed most audience members with this work.But it's not bad for what it is. It's well written, tense, and triumphant.

Substitute cynical nit-pickings for the harrowingly immersed experience,"Although there have been at least a dozen movies made about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Oliver Stone's massive take was the first one to cross that line between quiet, humble documenting to loud, unabashed movie-making when it came to presenting his perspective on the unforgettable day. Frustrated with what many saw as a total lack of that very perspective (coming from the conspiracy ridden, anti-government lens of Stone) many found World Trade Center to be nothing but a cinematic slushee, a predictable yarn to patriotism, some cinephiles even suggesting as an overt attempt to mend broken fences with many viewers after the epic financial failure that was Alexander. While this film for the most part does not display any of the traits we have come to know Mr. Stone for adhering to in the past, we are still given an uncompromising film in it's patriotic induced fervor placing, instead of paranoid theories, two fact-based accounts told straight from the officers and wives who went through some of the harshest ordeals during the attack.The real life events, as shown through NYC port officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, usher the viewer through an unparalleled view in and underneath all the vast chaos that had kept the world captivated to their television sets days on end. Played by Nic Cage and Michael Pena, these beat cops are given a loving tribute as the microcosm to the thousands of good city workers who fought through this disaster, and the few who unflinchingly ran into the heart of darkness, as if only driven by instinct to protect a fellow human despite the surmounting odds against their favor. Basically it is this emotional sentiment which, lingering in all the haunting imagery captured for this film, overrides any overt exploitation or apathetic conflict that more cynical viewers have complained about. There are moments in the film that I would imagine would be entirely too hard for many people directly associated with September 11th to watch; Stone wastes no time carving out the cinematic vision he saw taking place for these two officer's lives that day. While there are numerous examples of how he might have gone too far and dramatized the reality of that day in a way that would be insensitive or uncomfortable to the relatives of any victims involved, this overall cathartic triumph of human spirit ultimately wins out, in turn prompting some of Stone's most focused direction in many moons.I've never had the urge to rag on Nicolas Cage, it has been a pleasure seeing him evolve his craft over the years, but where that evolution ended seems to be apparent, replacing genuine character acting with the wide-eyed, over-eager line delivery he has indulged in so much lately. Here, although playing most of the time as low key and subdued as anything he has ever attempted, I still only saw this character as Mr. Cage with a uniform on top, unlike the lesser known Pena, who perhaps due to that very obscurity, gets away with playing a cop more authentically. For this genuine love letter to NYC and the American soul that the movie aspires to be, it was a tad disheartening to see this main role outsourced for star power, rather then playing it more realistically low-key in the spirit of all of these average-joe city workers, of which the eccentric star actor has a difficult time even pretending to be. Only distraught housewife Maggie Gyllenhaal, in all of her beautiful flights of insanity, justified the star recognition for her perceptive performance. Despite the many small factors that prevented the film from becoming the definitive classic that it may have been striving for, WTC details the twin tower's collapse more passionately then anything we will probably see for quite some time, making it the definitive 9/11 film experience for less ashamed moviegoers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"reinforces the Biggest Lie of the last five years, - that in Iraq, we are fighting those who attacked our country.","Ruth Rosen said it best:When World Trade Center ended, I left the theater tense, my muscles aching. The superb directing and acting, coupled with still hardly imaginable scenes of death and destruction, had sent painful muscle spasms up my back, evoked tears, and left me, yet again, with searing and indelible images of that hellish morning.I felt disoriented in the bright sunlight of a Northern Californian afternoon. As my mind regained its critical faculties, however, another kind of shock set in. I suddenly realized that Oliver Stone's movie reinforces the Big Lie - endlessly repeated by Dick Cheney, echoed and amplified by the right-wing media - that 9/11 was somehow linked to Iraq or supported by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.It might surprise you that this Oliver Stone film is neither ideological, nor conspiratorial, which in my view is just as it should be. Instead, it is a portrayal of what the men who braved hell and the families who anguished over their survival experienced.World Trade Center gives 9/11 a distinctly human face by following two Port Authority policemen and their families. We watch the men muster their courage to help evacuate people in one of the towers; we gasp as they are buried alive; we wince as heavy slabs of cement crush their bodies; and we hold our breath as they struggle to keep each other going in the face of imminent death.Expert editing brings us the anguish suffered by their wives, children, and relatives. Some are in denial, others in shock. Some have faith; others are resigned to the men's deaths. They live in their own hell and we empathize with their wrenching agony.Meanwhile, Stone introduces us to one ex-Marine who feels called by God to help rescue those buried alive. He gets his hair cut short, puts on his old uniform, and with all the authority of a former staff sergeant, does what he knows best - uses his military skills to save people's lives. Determined and angry, he insists that we must avenge this horrendous attack.And yet, in none of these profoundly moving scenes is there even a mention of who might have committed this atrocity. Neither the name AL-Qaeda, nor Osama Bin Laden, is so much as whispered.Despite the near flood of documentaries on the terrorist attacks heading toward the small screen this September, Stone's film, for many Americans, may end up being the definitive cinematic record of what it felt like to be inside the hellish cyclone known simply by the numbers 9/11.To offer a faithful recreation of that historical catastrophe, however, Stone owed viewers the whole truth, not merely a brilliant, graphic portrayal of what happened and how it affected the lives of some of those involved.As it ends, a written postscript appears that describes what happened to the buried Port Authority policemen, their families, and the ex-Marine who helped rescue them (whose last line is: ""We're going to need some good men out there to revenge this""). We learn that the two men survived an unbearable number of surgeries and are living with their families. Next we read that the ex-Marine re-upped and later did two tours of duty in Iraq. At that moment, I wanted to shout out, ""Don't you mean Afghanistan?""That evening, I wrote the words that should have appeared in the postscript: ""Government officials later confirmed that the organization which plotted the destruction of the World Trade Center was AL-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian, and Ayman AL-Zawahiri, an Egyptian. Nineteen men executed the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Fifteen of them came from Saudi Arabia; the remaining four from Egypt, The United Arab Emirates, and Lebanon. None of them came from Iraq.""This is the tragic failure of Stone's World Trade Center. It undercuts the historical value of the film and reinforces the Biggest Lie of the last five years, still believed by far too many Americans - that in Iraq, we are fighting those who attacked our country.--------",2.0,Anonymous,History
Stone makes a true story feel fictional,"You'd expect an Oliver Stone film about the attacks on the Twin Towers to be a paranoid conspiracy film, but the director of JFK has confounded expectations by coming up with a drama about two cops trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center after the towers collapsed.The movie focuses so narrowly on the fate of the officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) and their waiting wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) that we miss the bigger picture, and it might as well be a tale of miners stranded underground.Stone's film celebrates heroism; but by restraining his usual flamboyance in favour of following the Hollywood formbook he's succeeded in making a true story feel fictional.",,Anonymous,History
"As the world watches on in awe and disbelief, certain men stuck under the debris of the World Trade Centre frighteningly form their own perspective of said day's events.","World Trade Centre tells the terrifying true story of a handful of very specific kinds of policemen, namely Port Authority officers, caught up in the cataclysmic New York-based events of the eleventh of September in 2001. It is a rather harrowing retelling of certain events involving a group of men buried alive under an entire skyscraper that has fallen at the wayside, as their loved ones back home in the form of friends and family watch on in terror at the attacks unfolding on television, all the time looking on in sheer anxiety at how badly those they know are caught up in it. The piece is a somewhat gruelling two-hour plus experience about a pretty gruelling, rather harrowing scenario brought to life on the screen by American director Oliver Stone; the observing a fleeting chance at life several men have which is tense and involving. It's one of Stone's more toned down features, not overly aggressive nor confrontational despite finding room for political thematics, but most certainly warming and dramatic regardless.At the centre of it is the dry, husky and worn tone of Nicolas Cage portraying John McLoughlin, amply flanked by two others in the form of Jay Hernandez's Dominick Pezzulo and Michael Peña's Will Jimeno; the three of them trapped under a whole heap of rubble following the deliberate crashing of two jet airliners into the World Trade Centre in 2001. For these men, like everybody else, what appeared to be another usual day beginning at dawn turned into a nightmare scenario. Stone opens the film in a melancholic fashion, some sharp angles looking directly upwards at the sky and the tall buildings to some angelic music feeling like a fleeting, final glance at what once was. When we're on the road with McLoughlin, there are some glancing shots of police officers on duty with another wide shot capturing a busy highway leading into the city, in what is a broader emphasis on those of whom were more affected than others that day; specifically in emergency service personnel and commuters only. There is little in the way of character establishment up to this point and the camera keeps its distance from most figures on screen at these points, be they workers in their cars or officers on the beat, so as to get across a broader and more archetypal sense of who'll come to be affected. The feeling of all New Yorkers being linked together as one feels prominent.When the time comes for a bus load of the authorities to ship out to the scene of World Trade Plaza, McLoughlin is asked as to what's to be done but states that there ""is no plan"" since such a situation has never previously been processed nor preordained. The feeling of disillusion and disorientation felt at the time in the lack of a plan as well as the magnitude of the task at hand in that they're going in blind is here effectively emphasised. A range of men occupy the bus as they all head in, that collective sense of everybody being involved and in the situation 'as one' as before effectively put across by way of the Hispanic; African-American and Caucasian Port Authority officers riding on into the danger zone capturing a broad scope linked to the fact everyone is in it together. Upon arrival, the actors are given the final task before heading in of gazing upwards at the proverbial burning towers and recalling whatever emotions or reactions conjured on the day when it happened; here being the point that any audience member whom was an outsider looking in that day, regardless of nationality or where one was, are now to be taken inside so as to experience the true tale of a group of men first hand at how it all unfolded from within.The interior lobby reveals innocents on the way out looking beaten and bloody, anxious to get away from the very location we're heading into. McLoughlin and his team look dirty; worn; scared and marked as it is, the venturing into the torrid unknown resonating with what prior knowledge we have of what'll transpire settling in and gearing us up for what will be a terrifying procession of events. Stone handles the men being trapped underground rather well, the characters exchanging information based on one another; rousing each other not to give up and to stay awake at all costs as they lay there in an elevator shaft having had dozens of storeys collapse on top of them. Back home, the wives of those involved in John's wife Donna (Bello) and their four children as well as Jimeno's in the form of Allison (Gyllenhaal) can only watch on via the television with bated breath as action is taken on what is now ground level.Michael Shannon's Dave Karnes appears to run his own operation in trying to save anybody still trapped. A religious ex-SEAL, Karnes decks himself out in army clothing and ventures out into the rubbled remains of World Trade Plaza with an angry attitude of wanting to get out there as soon as possible and react so as to sort everything out. Karnes is a character that might be read into as being representative of America's attitudes post-attack, the verbal establishment of America now being ""at war"" with somebody with Karnes' attire and attitude to do what he does is political allegory disguised as acts of bravery. Stone captures a somewhat perfect overall tone to the film, respectful and knowledgeable of bravery without ever being too sentimental or mawkish. He doesn't overplay the achievement of what these men did at a fateful time; and certainly doesn't go down a route similar to that of John Sturges, whose adaptation of the men trapped at Stalag Luft III camp in The Great Escape was given a bright and breezy lift. Stone's film is smart and taut, an involving watch based on the stories of those at the forefront.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Touching effort, respectful, but as much as it hurts to say it, WTC is melodramatic","Let's be honest, Oliver Stone making a movie about 9/11/2001 was to be expected. He is, after all, one of the most outspoken celebrities in the world when it comes to politics and history. He rarely pulls his punches. This is one of those rare times. Stone puts his political commentary aside to make World Trade Center, a film that respectfully and powerfully tells the story of New York Port Authority Police Officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno and their struggle to stay alive after becoming trapped beneath the collapsing towers. The story is also seen through the eyes of each man's family.Another point that should be realized, whether we admit it or not, prior to viewing this, United 93 (The Oscar nominated theatrical release), and Flight 93 (The TV version), we all had some sort of predisposition about the film, and in this case, its director. Screenwriter Andrea Berloff, Stone, and the actors take the story and tell it with the intention of overpowering the audience with emotion, which is absolutely unnecessary. This is the film's biggest flaw. You have to admire their dedication and approach, but she didn't realize something Paul Greengrass did, which is this. We, the audience, are already running with our emotions high, no matter how we feel, our feelings are already high. No matter what, the reminder of what happened will transport us back to how we felt that day. To put it simple, I felt like I was actually watching the event take place in United 93, while I never mistook WTC for reality (even though the events did happen). Another reason I say this is because of the cast.Don't get me wrong, Nicolas Cage was brilliant. In fact, it was probably his best since Adaptation. His portrayal of McLoughlin was very real and he shines specifically towards the end...However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not stop thinking ""this is Nicolas Cage, and his star power is sort of distracting me from the purpose of the movie"". Michael Pena delivers a similar performance to that of his own in Crash...very emotional, likable, and all around good. While our two leading men hold their own, it is two of our supporters who really shine. Jay Hernandez, of 'Hostel' fame, definitely surprised me in limited screen time as he gives us a great character that we get to know even though we see so little of him. His performance makes me wonder what the real Dominick Pezzulo was like. Another great performance is from the often forgotten, but unforgettable Michael Shannon. Shannon's character is a true hero, and I'm glad to know that this man actually exists and that there are people like him. Shannon gives us an impactful and important performance. Now, these are the actors involved with the building perspective of the film, while Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the wives of Cage and Pena respectively. I have to say, Bello added a little to the overdramatics, but after thinking of the position her character is in, I have to say that I was wrong and both she and Gyllenhaal deliver winning performances.Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is a respectful film that does its job of telling us one particular story from 9/11. Stone could not have directed with more restrain than he did, but strangely, it works. There are a few factual errors, like the race of a secondary character being incorrect, but I didn't notice them during the film. Stone doesn't show us the horrifying images of the planes colliding with the buildings, which was a relief. The sets are incredibly real, especially the ruined towers Cage and Pena must deal with for most of the film.7/10 --spy",7.0,Anonymous,History

Arrogant propaganda,"I am going to be totally honest with all of you! Anyone who likes this film and is not a hardcore/patriotic American jimbo should at least try to shoothemselves in the head with a high powered rifle! Sure, it was a tragedy, many people lost, i respect that. The thing is that finally when we are all starting to forget and get over those attacks the American government rubs it all back into our faces, and guess what they even make money out of it! This film makes it seem like American tragedies are the only real tragedies in the world, and that only the Americans truly suffer. This film also points out that America has the right to seek revenge over whomever did this, and they point out that ""we're gonna need a lot of good people to revenge this"", as if good people seek revenge.The film is absolutely biased, and I have a feeling that there were far too many government officials present at the shoot making sure that this was a pathetic propaganda.Did I also mention that this film is actually racist! None of the main characters are black, the only real black character we see is the woman in the police station that picks up the phones! Oooh where is the political correctness Stone? I actually heard that the marine guy was black in real life, but in the film he was changed to a white Jesus-lovin' son of a gun!The film is also extremely boring, and full of clichés and totally fake emotions that are meant to really ""touch"" us.

Hollywood Deals With 9/11 On Realistic And Human Terms,"It is unlikely that any film, documentary or otherwise, can depict the horrors of September 11, 2001 with the same kind of accuracy as those who were direct witness to the nightmare. But this year, Hollywood has shown a willingness to tackle 9/11 from a deeply human perspective, first through the TV film FLIGHT 93, then Paul Greengrass' excellent feature film UNITED 93, and now through director Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER.Stone, a native New Yorker, but also a polarizing figure of the cinema via his dark and controversial explorations of recent U.S. history and politics (PLATOON; JFK, etc.), has sought to focus on the true meaning of heroism by focusing in on Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, who, along with their fellow Port Authority and NYC fire and police personnel, went into the World Trade Center towers to evacuate as many people as possible from there after the two jets were rammed into the buildings. The two men, however, nearly became a part of history right then and there when the towers crumbled. For twenty hours, both men were trapped under twenty thousand tons of steel and concrete, some twenty feet deep. They were the only Port Authority personnel who survived the destruction of the towers, and among only twenty people in all who got out in the end. Nearly 2,700 others weren't as lucky in the WTC puzzle of 9/11.McLoughlin and Jimeno are portrayed superbly in WORLD TRADE CENTER by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who accurately depict the professional blue-collar ethic of the Big Apple's finest and bravest. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello, respectively, portray Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno, their wives who were on edge during the entire time of this apocalyptic crisis, wondering whether their husbands were going to make it out of there. Their stories, though individual, serve as a microcosm for the thousands of others there that day, both the dead and the survivors. This last point is something that Stone makes very clear: the kind of humanity in the face of so much inhumanity that day. It is something that has gotten lost in the intervening five years, in which opportunistic politicians have used 9/11 as a weapon to whip up false patriotism, scare tactics, and a bloody war in Iraq that had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks on America. Stone, however, stays away from the kind of political critique that was a hallmark of JFK and several of his other films, and shows us the kind of true heroism that the far-right has often accused Hollywood of deliberately avoiding, but which they themselves couldn't possibly manufacture even on their best day.Along with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER proves that Hollywood is ready to respond with a clear, realistic, and human look at one of this nation's darkest days. So too is the American public, and the world at large. The question now is: Are our politicians willing to do so without resorting to name-calling, pointless propaganda, and macho warmongering? That in and of itself will tell us a lot, and WORLD TRADE CENTER should add to the pressure to force that issue.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Highly Overrated and Too Tame...,"I'm surprised by the excellent reviews this movie is getting. It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't merit the steller acclaim. It's not all that well written, directed, shot, or edited. The performances are good, I suppose.I think people are just afraid to criticize a movie about Septemeber 11th. Bottom line is that this movie is cheesy and pandors to the audience. If Stone still had some balls he would have set the entire movie in the rubble. The movie would have been much better if the first half hour had shown the normal routine of the cops. Show us what life was like on September 10th and then build to the moment. Establish the characters. Don't make us care for them just because they're September 11th cops. That's just annoying because it doesn't show any real writing ability. It's like saying, okay, people will like them even if they don't know who they are.This movie is far too tame and it's a shame it came out because there can definitely be a better movie that handles the exact same subject matter, but it can't come out without being deemed a copy. It should have been R and there should have been more cursing and more violence to adequately reflect reality. Ultimately, Sept. 11th just isn't great movie material. Like Pearl Harbor, historically tragic events just don't usually work on screen because there is no way to adequately recreate what happened...and the question needs to be asked...why should we recreate it in such a way. The documentary on Sept. 11th is far more powerful and well-executed and captures the day and the feeling of the day much better.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Its just alright,"World Trade Center is OK. I didn't find it particularly great. I thought the scenes inside the rubble were nicely done, but that was about it. In fact, the movie fell flat with me every time it cut away from the 2 main characters.I thought the scenes with their families as they were trapped felt plastic. they were schlocky, truth be told. it felt really over the top Hollywood dramatic, and i kind of wish they had been cut. to me, the real story was in the rubble, and should have stayed there.i liked the part of the marine, and i think that it is even more inspiring because its true. however, the way he was filmed, and the scenes they gave him translated into a very wooden, almost unreal/unbelievable feeling. i read in the trivia that people thought he was made up by the screenwriter. and with the way he was shown in the film, its not hard to believe why.all and all, its just alright. there were a few sad parts, sure. however, these sad parts relied more on swelling music and screenplay clichés than anything else. rent it.",,Anonymous,History
sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.,"Steeped in controversy over whether it is too soon, amongst other things, comes Oliver Stone's take on the events of September 11th 2001. Focusing on two port authority police officers who having no game plan for an event of this magnitude enter into tower one only to be trapped when it literally comes down on their heads. For all Stones usual bluster this is told in a very subtle and poignant way. Opening with various members of the forces getting up ready to travel to work for what they believe a normal day we see one man walking out onto the deck of the Staten Island Ferry into glorious sunshine and as the camera pans round there is the New York skyline complete with the twin towers in full domination. It is like seeing a ghost and this scene wouldn't be the only time that the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up during the movie. Thankfully Stone never really shows the impacts of the planes mostly because from the point of view of the officers on the ground they didn't see or know what had hit the towers and so instead Stone shows big looming shadows blocking out the sun on the faces of street traders looking up or on surrounding buildings and using the same technique used in United 93 the rest is just shown on televisions in the background. It is one thing knowing what happens in a true story but still when Stone brings down the first tower it is still incredibly powerful, the sound is so intense, the atmosphere is so confusing it is like you are there with the officers. Trapped under tons of rubble the survivors shout to each other and you begin to feel the silence and the claustrophobia creep in but not for long as Stone shocks you back into the situation when the second tower falls. Once the initial chaos subsides the film becomes more a character study, how people cope and deal with situations. The officers under the mess their wives at home following the unfolding events on the news and having no idea if their husbands were even there, never mind alive or dead, if they were. So a mention has to go out to both Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal who play the roles of the confused wives. One of the things I was worried about was that the film would be all American gung-ho and over sentimental and in a few places it is but not enough to really matter. In the end Stone has played down his usual directorial theatrics and delivered a film that not only captures the horror of that day but also shows us what the human spirit is capable of, yes evil but also hope. Not an easy watch and not amazing but a good effort handled well and a film that should be seen and remembered by everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Okay but fails to capture the gravity of 9/11.,"Unexpectedly the biggest problem with World Trade Center is how mild it is. Most of the dramatic moments are weak and quite predictable (though not by any means bad) compared to the power and resonance they could have had. It's as if the filmmaker's decided that the only way to make a movie about 9/11 without offending too many people was to soften it's impact and focus on story lines that don't tread too far from what's already been done countless times before. What's the point of making a film about 9/11 if it doesn't explore any of the things that made 9/11 unique?I think it may have been a bad idea to cast relatively well known actors in the main roles. Part of the horror of 9/11 was that it could have happened to anyone and once we see famous actors, we know they're going to be the stars of most of the scenes. United 93 was wise enough to use unfamiliar faces and present a fairly objective glimpse of each of their characters.In most technical areas, World Trade Center is pretty good. The acting's strong, the script does its job, the directing doesn't get in the way but it just doesn't seem to amount to much. By steering away from what made 9/11 the tragedy it is, the film loses almost all of it's potential power. For me, the most powerful part was the statistics shown at the end of the film (this doesn't spoil anything). So reading some text with some nice music was the most powerful moment in the film. Not a good sign.Furthermore, it is not incredibly entertaining. There's basically no humour nor are there many subplots or back stories. Vague details are given but not enough to be fulfilling. Still, it's by no means bad and perhaps worth seeing just to better understand what some of the people involved went through (and for the generally good music). But if only Oliver Stone had had the courage to dive into the subject matter head on it could have been a great and very powerful film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Stone is definitely back....,"Oliver Stone's newest endeavor, World Trade Center, has turned out to be a success. Although there was no controversy in this film, as there is surrounding the events of September 11th, Stone does portray the event with immeasurable authenticity. Oliver Stone can make a conventional film as he clearly depicts the events of September 11th sans his overused guerrilla style. The film cuts back and forth between Nicolas Cage, stuck in a copious amount of debris, and his family. Although Cage does not move for almost 80% of the film, he turns in one of his most genuine performances. The film was extremely heartfelt and very difficult to view for a native new yorker. There is a certain attachment to the emotional volcano that erupts several times throughout the film, that new yorkers have. Strangely enough, during the screening i was in, there were some youngsters talking on there cell phones. Someone complained and after a short confrontation the children were removed by police. As the children were escorted out of the theater a loud applaud could be heard from the theater guests. Not only did September 11th bring new yorkers together more than ever before, but the film recalling its events brought together the audience. I sincerely hope that this film revisits, and opens peoples eyes up to the fact that everyone can be friendly in a time of emergency. I just hope that one day we can all be friendly even when its not an emergency.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a sanitized yet emotional depiction of true events.,"The film follows the true story of two PAPD officers and their families. Nicolas Cage gave a stoic depiction of Sgt John McLoughlin who tries to stay calm and collected in order to lead, do his duty, and help. He later fights against his pain and exhaustion in a bid to survive. Will Jemino was portrayed by Michael Pena who exemplified those who selflessly volunteered to enter the towers in order to help people inside.The supporting cast of the families do a brilliant job of demonstrating the emotional toll the disaster took on the entire city. While having reasonable childacting is rare and commendable, the real stars of the supporting cast were Mario Bello & Maggie Gyllenhaal who depicted the significant others of the lead PAPD officers. Both give an intense emotional performance showing the grief and anxiety that thousands were feeling at the time.Michael Shannon's character was a notable inclusion to the story as he told the story of SSgt Dave Karnes who despite being in a different state, felt it was his duty to go to NY and help the search and rescue efforts. This represents the feeling that millions had post 9/11 who wanted to help in some way or enlist in the armed forces and find those responsible.The film portrays the level of chaos and confusion that existed in the hours after the attacks, where at first many thought it could have been an accident, the unclear reporting on the second tower being hit, the incorrect message being sent that McLoughlin 'walked out'.Regarding themes, the movie sanitizes the events somewhat, it is reluctant to show the scale of the disaster and shows a very limited amount of blood/injury etc. The film also shies away from the true horrors of the disaster (jumpers, several thousand dead etc), and instead focuses on the silver linings in the survivors story, and the city coming together to help. In my opinion this film could have done both but chose not to due to the sensitivity of the subject in 2006. The film is also contained unnecessary Christian themes, which were pooly edited and felt forced, and in my opinion did not add anything other than trying to appeal to the Christian, islamaphobic audience. The film was also fiercely patriotic and this is clear throughout, but never more so than when Shannon's character elludes to the country being 'at war'.The film is reasonably well directed with notable moments such as the shadow of the plane, but generally the challenge was the limitations of directing a portrayal of being stuck in the rubble, this segment is mainly shown in close ups of the PAPD officers faces, or shots from their point of view.The soundtrack to the film was not particularly notable.The production of the film was commendable, particularly shots of the rubble and ash. And although it was not well known at the time of filming, the film showed the severe amount of ash and eluded to it's effect on the health of anyone nearby.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Moving, but uneven, experience","I was surprised by the intimacy of this film about the September 11th terrorist attacks. It takes a tragedy that shook the world and chooses to focus on just a few characters. There are a few scenes that place the event in the larger global context, but most of the disaster is viewed from limited, first person viewpoints. This heightens the viewer's fear and anxiety and makes for an effective experience.The movie follows two port authority cops as they try to evacuate the World Trade Center. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) is the veteran cop who has became an authority on the WTC after the '93 attack and helped create evacuation strategies. (This situation, however, catches him off guard. No one anticipated a disaster originating on the upper levels of the towers.) William Jimeno (Michael Pena) is the rookie cop who volunteers to jump into the fray when many of his fellow cops hesitate.The movie also tells the story of the cops' wives who anxiously wait for word on their husbands. The consistently excellent Maggie Gyllenhaal does an excellent job as the pregnant wife of rookie Jimeno. If the Fall doesn't produce many best actress contenders, Gyllenhaal could net a nomination. Mario Bello also turns in a fine performance as Mrs. McLoughlin struggling to keep her family calm and trying not to believe the worst.The movie, though, is not a triumph as I was hoping. Our two main characters spend much of the movie inert and these scenes, unfortunately, become a little tedious. Maybe it's because I knew of the ultimate outcome of the story--it's based on actual accounts--that these moments became tiresome for me. After the harrowing arrival at the disaster site and the horrifying, but amazingly filmed destruction of the towers, the cops' experience slowly becomes less compelling.Much has been made about the fact that Oliver Stone has made a largely apolitical film. But pay attention to the character of Marine Dave Karnes. This guy's a wild card and seems, at points, to be clashing with the film's ultimately uplifting message.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Poor Movie,"OK, So the movie starts out with just a normal day in New York, until the terror strikes. This is the true story of Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin, two Port Authority police officers who rushed into the burning World Trade Center on 9/11 to help rescue people but became trapped themselves when the tower collapsed.The film is sad, but I wouldn't call it compelling. I find it sad that Oliver Stone, (A well respected director) would put fourth such little effort as I have seen in this film. The Special effects are OK is some parts, and in others are borderline awful.I think the story of 9/11 deserved a better film than this. Go and see this film ONLY if you have nothing better to do. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History
A Solid Tribute to the Heroes of September 11,"Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" is a well-acted and emotionally satisfying tribute to those who gave their all when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001. Unlike many of Stone's previous films, he mostly ignores the politics of the era and instead focuses on developing a touching, human story about ordinary people in an impossible situation. ""World Trade Center"" lacks the same dramatic punch that defined ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" and ""JFK,"" and the pacing is too slow - especially in the second act. I also wish that Stone had done more to establish the main characters in the first act, which would've hightened my interest in the overall story. But by the end of the movie I was hooked into the lives of the real-life first responders and their families, all of whom are portrayed beautifully by the film's cast. In particular I was impressed by Michael Shannon and Michael Peña, who carry every scene they're in. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines as a woman agonized with worry over her husband, and even Nicholas Cage gives a restrained and sympathetic performance. Stone, a native New Yorker, uses his strong cast and compelling visuals to recreate the horror of 9/11 and salute those who sacrificed so much on that darkest of days. I watched this movie on September 11, 2019 to commemorate the tragedy that happened 18 years ago. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but could be better","I really did like this movie. But in comparison to some of the other films related to th 9/11 issue this one wasn't the best! For example United 93 showed how people felt when they saw what happened whereas World Trade Center mainly centers around the firefighters and more specifically only a few families that were struck by the horror of 9/11. The movie was definitely emotional, it just lacked something. The actors were great and definitely showed emotion, this was just not OLiver Stone's best, but it will probably become a classic. But overall not that bad of a film, and it does definitely show the ultimate triumph of the human spirit as a theme!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Nice,"Nice, but like many, bit disappointed. I don't know what but it doesn't sound like an Oliver Stone movie. This is or there are some kind of missing elements here. Like : the acting is OK, but just OK. Knowing how she suffers, Jimino's wife reaction is nearly annoying during the entire movie. Nic is OK as usual (but nothing will beat Leaving Las Vegas). The scene of our 2 cops trapped are brilliant. And the scene of Jesus, his Sacred Eart, appearing to Jimino while he is near to die are profound and moving, above all if you are a Christian. The whole scenes of the towers collapsing are also effective. But on over whole it seems or sounds very commercial, very superficial.

"see, thats why I don't gamble!","Just when Vegas broke the house with odds that no auteur could upstage Shyamalan's Lady in the Water in the ""biggest disappointment of the season!"" category in drops Oliver Stone with this ABC-Family weeknight movie (well, it could have been straight-to-TV had it not been so schmaltzy). Stone, the man Colin Farrell quoted as being ""the last ****ing hero in Hollywood"" offers a film so relentlessly and indecently maudlin it would make Hallmark blush and 80's teen movies turn to salt. Stone, too shell-shocked by Alexander's fantastic failure to dare add any style, comment or individuality to this work, instead ops to handle the embarrassingly flawed narrative with cozy woolen kid gloves. What's left is a perfunctory pastiche with an exposed ultimate sin - an unapologetic screenplay that sweetens daunting insincerity with the pungence of forced sentimentality. From its mache art direction to its plucky-at-best cast, the story is the only thing it could not dare to have been  content. It is content to be eccentric instead of intriguing and the ensemble is content to be respectful instead of enthusiastic. The end product runs as a reflexive tip-of-the-hat to positions of public servitude that needed no such insincere, limply-rousing thanks. Rent United 93 in September.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Bit disappointing BUT everyone needs to see this,"First things first... when 9/11 happened 5+ years back i was probably too young to understand what really happened and how it affected people. I am not American and i live in asia so things are viewed slightly differently. While i have seen the news and heard about happened i could not empathise with what the new yorkers felt till i saw this.Some parts of this movie are much scarier than what any horror movie can ever be. The feeling of your world coming down around you is just so scary. The scenes with the tower were done tastefully but i still think u needed to combine the scenes with the trapped people with more scenes of the towers disintegrating. No scenes with people in the offices... no scenes with people on the stairs climbing down while rescue workers are going up.PLUS why only focus on the survivors.... one tends to forget about the 2749 other people that died. The audience should be trusted to take the bad with the good. at least maybe show more on the other people that were rescued from the wreckage.Dialogue was mediocre and the acting was good especially pena... whose emotions did not seem forced although he would have been better served with some good dialogue. Cage was surprisingly wooden and the dialogue did not help. kudos to stephen dorff for a hard hitting but small role towards the end. Maria bello did not have much to do while maggie gyllenhall did good with her role.Not what i expected from oliver stone at all.... i expected him to let go at the audience and let them feel the devastation and the destruction but in the end it was almost a clichéd Hollywood movie... he took the soft option. Maybe studios felt that the American people were not ready for a movie on this but i think they would have appreciated it. Plus thru a movie, an even bigger audience could have been reached and touched by the braveRy and fortitude shown by the people after such an attack.I feel there are many other 9/11 stories that need to be told.... and probably told in a more visceral way but i still think that people need to see this movie and understand what happened.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A giant step backward for movie race relations.,"How could they misrepresent an African American Marine and hero, by having a White actor play his role? It's just another insult to non-white Americans. They didn't even bother to put black-face make-up on him. At least in the bad old days of American movies, white men attempted to at least look like the minorities whose heritage they were misrepresenting.I hate that I participated in this fraud. Too many African Americans have been denied their rightful place in American history. Oliver Stone should have never allowed this insult to happen. He is known for his supposed sensitivity to historical truth. It is ironic that at the most crucial time were the truth should have been told, he contributed to perpetuating the one of the biggest lies of all time.The greatest crime against African America is not slavery. It is the theft of their positive identity and cultural contributions. This movie is a tragic representation of that crime. What a disappointment!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very important and excellent film.,"I have always admired Oliver Stone. Platoon is still one of my all time favorite movies - EVER! Though i generally dislike Conpiracy theories, i did like Stone's ""JFK"". Bu because of ""JFK"", i did fear that Stone would put in conspiracy theories about 9-11 in this film, theories that some Jewish-neo-con-conspiracy that was masterminded to destroy the World Trade Center (WTC), and blame it on the Arabs, so that the weapon-industry could make money. But i was relieved when i finally watched this amazing picture. It is so true a story - with no reel patriotism or conspiracy theories. Just about brave men, knowing what to do in the face of the unthinkable.This is a VERY important movie to finally bury all these dumb conspiracy theories once and for all. Because Oliver Stone is more or less the king of Conspiracy theories (JFK anyone??). He is a liberal, a Bush-hater and a pacifist. When a man like that, a man VERY open to conspiracy theories, tells you that there weren't no conspiracies 9-11, don't you think, little conspiracy theorist, that it is time to give up??? IT IS!! Conspiracy theorists: face it - you have lost the battle of 9-11. Some conspiracy theories will still not give up after this movie, they claim that Illuminati has paid off Stone to make this movie, whitewashing 9-11 as some uneducated conspiracy theorist-blogger claimed. But haven't it occurred to these conspiracy theorists that Oliver Stone is a multi millionaire already?? He is, after all the films, and DVD-sales of his movies. Once again, the conspiracy theorists have lost. Also that the most excellent movie ""United 93"" really is a good thing, so that all the conspiracy theorists will have problems posting their lies.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It does a great job of showing how people were able to come together and work as one to recover from this disaster.

World Trade Center made me fall asleep!,"i cannot understand how this movie received 4 stars in the newspapers. we all know what happened to many, many police and fire officers on 911, when the towers went down. of course their wives and families were terrified! but the perpetual nagging (to one another) of the two trapped together to not fall asleep and hold on went on for way too long. this movie would have been far better if it were about a number of characters trapped instead of just two. it would have been great if it showed people that were dying after coming out of the towers, and those watching, running in the streets. this movie is glib and utterly boring. really, it would have been best if it were about all the people that were inside of the offices when the planes tore through the towers, as well as the confusion of the authorities over the event. it would be great to see how firemen and police officers and port authorities had no plan to work together. i just wish i had not spent money on seeing it!",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Should have been called ""Rescue 9-1-1""","Should have been called ""Rescue 9-1-1""Seriously Its title sounds fairly imposing. However, rather than making a grand statement on a catastrophic American event or coloring the issue with politics, ""World Trade Center"" smartly maintains a narrow focus in subject by concentrating on the lives and experiences of its 2 main characters and their families. It's really a film about survival and love with 9/11 as the backdrop. Not a bad hand from Director Oliver Stone who can also be known for the eccentric.

"Movie a 3, special features a 6","Just to get the full disclosure out of the way, I cannot think of one Nicolas Cage performance that I can stand. For whatever reason, everything he does is counter to what I enjoy seeing. Whether or not that has an impact on my rating of this film, I'm really not sure. Just wanted to get that out of the way for honesty's sake.Now on to the movie itself! The beginning seemed to hold promise for a few minutes, but there's just something unpleasant about the way it was filmed that makes watching it a painful experience. And for me, it wasn't painful in a sympathetic or patriotic way, just painful in a ""wow this movie isn't any good"" kind of way. It has very few redeeming points to it for me. The acting wasn't awful (Cage being the exception, but refer to my opening disclaimer for that one), the script was passable enough, the camera work was mediocre, it just left me with an overall feeling of ""meh.""If there's anything good that I can say for the movie, I did enjoy how it focused on the interaction of these two men and how they managed to survive rather than focusing on the source of their predicament. In many ways it can be called more of a personal drama film than a film about September eleventh.However, I strongly suggest watching the movie with the commentary on. One of those who narrates through it is Will Jimeno and it was really an enriching and touching experience to hear all that he had to say about his experiences. The special features are significantly more valuable than the movie itself.",6.0,Anonymous,History
White washing in Hollywood,"Some of you may already know about the controversy in regards to the true identity of one of the heroes portrayed in the Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center (2006) The portrayal Mr. Thomas as a white individual was a disservice. I truly believe that Paramount had to have been aware that he is African American. I consider this to be another example of Hollywood white washing! At the very least, the men he rescued knew he was black, the other marine knew that he was black. Plus I am pretty certain that that information was relayed to the movie makers. For this reason I am boycotting the film. Even if they could not reach Mr. Thomas while making the movie, I strongly believe that they were certain of one fact; Mr. Thomas is a Black man. Now before some of you send a little heat my way I will say this I come from a mixed home, my intention has nothing to do with playing any kind of ""race card"" I just feel that a film claiming to be ""accurate"" in detail should be held accountable. This isn't a case where they casted people to play the part regardless of race. They intentionally set out to hire a white actor. Unfortunately, America's views of what a hero should look like has never been what I would consider racially unbiased. Would you or wouldn't you agree that there are many qualified black actors that would probably have been elated to have had that part? Just look at the ""Production Notes"" for this film, quite a lot of detail is given to things like the accurate colors of things and shadows and the like. So how could Mr. Thomas's ethnicity simply have been overlooked? It would only make common sense that attention to the color of a man's skin would be accurate too? The fact Paramount and Producer Michael Shamberg did wrong is history, it's in the past. What can be done now to redeem it? To ""remake"" the movie at this time is not practical and they likely won't do that. What they CAN DO is add Mr. Jason Thomas' name AND PICTURE to the credits. And assure that any future remakes of the film will have a black actor for accurate portrayal. I urge some of you who feel as passionate about the situation as I do to find an address and or email, contact these people and tell them to set things straight!!! I, a Native New Yorker, watched as my friends fell apart after losing loved ones during 9/11. I felt the loss through them but could do nothing to cure their pain. I understand that this movie is an emotional one. I am in no way trying to dishonor what so many have suffered through.

Oliver Stone: Hollywood Conformist,"I would definitely say that I am a fan of Oliver Stone's work, but the sad truth is that he hasn't really made anything particularly exceptional in the last decade. Alexander was considered a huge failure (though I thought it was good), and ever since its negative response and poor box office performance, Stone seems desperately eager to please. First, he makes a ""director's cut"" of Alexander, cutting out anything too ""gay,"" and now he has made World Trade Center. His clear intention is to go against every expectation an audience would have when they hear Oliver Stone has directed a film about 9/11. There is no political agenda, it is more about emotion and character, but it just plainly and simply is not good, and drags on way too long.It isn't completely bad, the first act was actually very good. I had a feeling that it would get even better after the tower collapse scene, and I was more than ready to commit myself emotionally to these characters. However, it did not get better; it gradually became pretty bad, resorting to shameless emotional manipulation complete with an over-abundance of flashbacks to back when the two men were happy in their lives with their families, and the ""for your consideration"" speeches from the wives.What really just pisses me off about this movie is that even though it's a true story (and a great, happy, positive one!), it barely takes into account the fact that thousands of people lost their lives that day. It's a sappy, sugar-coated tale that treats the audience like infants, assuming that a movie about a family of the officers that didn't survive and how they have to deal with it just wouldn't sell enough tickets. The message we're left with at the end of the film is unbelievably moronic: apparently, in times of need, people will do what's right, and help other people, and shucks, you know what- that's good in my book. Give me a break. This movie is insulting to peoples' intelligence, their emotions, and it's also insulting to anyone who lost someone they loved on that terrible day.World Trade Center really is everything you could hope that a 9/11 movie wouldn't be. This is something you'd expect from Michael Bay. What's worse is that it's even getting Oscar buzz, which I feel it is unworthy of. The profoundly superior 9/11 film is United 93, which is blunt, frank, and treats the audience and the 9/11 victims with a courageous respect that we just don't see enough of in films based on true tragedies. I left World Trade Center feeling angry and frustrated for many, many reasons. It is one of the year's most disappointing and unnecessary films.My rating: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty Good but isn't Terrific,"'World Trade Center' is about two men who devoted their lives to saving others during 9/11 and end up getting caught under the ruble of the buildings destruction.Emotion runs high in this film. It will most definitely tug at your heartstrings but it wasn't the greatest. Naturally you'd think a movie about 9/11 to be a masterpiece and this most definitely was not. The acting was good and so was the plot but the film sort of dragged on with the men talking about their families in just about every scene. The movie was longer than it needed to be because truly it all could have been wrapped up in about one hour.Though this wasn't the best film ever and I would never watch it again, I'd definitely recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it yet and has a lot of patience.",6.0,Anonymous,History

not so wide screen; engineering responses,"The movie is okay, though it does play fast and loose with the facts in the name of ""drama""; since Stone was just the hired hand on this one, I guess he wasn't motivated enough to worry about the accuracy of the script.But the DVD is a bit of a let-down. Originally shot in 1.85:1 ratio, the DVD (commemorative edition, so-called) actually projects at about 1.66:1. Some of this is undoubtedly an overscan problem, but by no means all. What it means is that, on each shot, we are missing information on the sides, that is, it's been reformatted to look optimal on an HD monitor, without much regard for the actual aspect ratio. Too bad.Oh yeah, there's also a little too much in the movie with the guys in the hole saying goodbye to their lives. I would have preferred more on the actual rescue itself, since in McLoughlin's case, it took something like 8-10 hours to actually get him out. Once again, however, and in spite of the huge audiences that TV shows about engineering get, the Hollywood producers have decided to dumb down the process, so that the average 11-year old will ""get it.""

Shards of hope amidst the bleakness,"""World Trade Center"" is different from the usual Oliver Stone film in that it's an article with a hushed apolitical tone. Here, Stone removes the usual sappiness of movies depicting heroism, pushes mawkishness to the sides, and tells a definitive story of two individuals who were among the victims of that fateful day.Whereas ""United 93"" (the other 9/11 film released this year) featured mostly unknown actors, ""World Trade Center"" stars Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as Port Authority cops John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, respectively. Called in to the World Trade Center without knowing what the emergency was, McLoghlin and Jimeno soon find themselves trapped when the Twin Towers eventually collapses. Both actors, coupled by the script by Andrea Berloff, successfully underplay the sensationalism while still maintaining the realistic urgency and heroism of the big picture.Stone is so determined to show the humanity of McLoughlin and Jimeno that his trademark themes take a backseat to the unfolding drama on the screen. Still it isn't without a few minor problems. Firstly, some parts slow down with a little too many narrative flashbacks. I'm not familiar with how much of these were real and how much were part of cinematic liberties, and indeed some of them are necessary for the characterizations of the leads but not all of it. But that's about it as far as quibbles are concerned.This is simply an intelligent solid film, a little loose with the details of the actual events but overall true to what its subject is all about.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Oliver Stone abdicates to put his vision in the facts and even ignoring the consequences of the attack to prioritize a completely melodramatic plot that not work everytime,"Oliver Stone's subject in ""World Trade Center"" is, oddly enough, not 9/11. But yes, again, the search for the ""ordinary American hero"". Now, however, he is not a soldier or a veteran of the Vietnam War, nor a man who single-handedly decides to investigate Kennedy's death. This ""mythical"" character embodies the skin of a tough policeman (Nicholas Cage) who discovers he is human when he ends up under the rubble of the World Trade Center, in an attempt to rescue victims of the attack. The truth is that few people approved of the overly sentimental tone. And, for those who see the political issue involved in the events of that day as its most important aspect -that is, almost the entire planet-, ""World Trade Center"" is a disappointment. After all, nothing, absolutely nothing is said or implied about terrorism, bin Laden, anti-imperialism, etc.Written by Andrea Berloff based on real events, the film begins on the morning of September 11, 2001, when we follow the awakening of police officer John McLoughlin (Cage) and his preparation for another day of work. As New York becomes busier as the hours pass, we witness trivial conversations about baseball, the drowsiness of people on the subway and the hectic lifestyle of a metropolis that does not even imagine how its reality is about to be altered. Finally, after several minutes, we see the Manhattan skyline and the towering presence of the World Trade Center's twin towers - which, like an image from the distant past, immediately reminds us of a less cynical and far less hateful era than ours. Which we currently live.The entire setting and reconstruction of that 9/11 is conducted very effectively by Stone, focusing on scenes that show the characters following their routines normally, such as going to work and having unpretentious conversations with colleagues. Another good strategy used is the presentation of some setting plans with World Trade Center still intact, one of the postcards of the city until then and which brings a certain nostalgia to those who watch it. Finally, the director still inserts several archive images and lines from the television news of the time, resulting in a realism in the work that captures the public instantly. Stone evokes strong sensations just by knowing how to lead the scenes until the moment when he reveals ground zero of the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The filmmaker, incidentally, also demonstrates his immense talent by recreating what happens next: in a matter of minutes, the world transforms for McLoughlin (for Americans, in general) and his subordinate Will Jimeno (Peña), who, after receiving a call to assist in the removal of injured people from the World Trade Center, they are plunged into a situation that unfolds with dizzying speed. In a second, everyone is shocked by the chaos caused by the collision of the planes with the towers; in another, they are covered by tons of rubble.The arrival of the characters at the site of the attacks, it should be said, is staged in an exemplary way by the director: initially, we see the image that has become a symbol of that day, with smoke coming out of the WTC, but, soon after, Stone presents us with a new perspective through the debris falling on the police, the burning cars next to the entrances to the buildings and, of course, the tremors and explosions observed by people in the halls of the towers. Bewildered by conflicting information and the chaos of a situation they had never dealt with, the characters commit serious errors of judgment, such as, for example, caring for the injured while still inside the WTC, instead of taking them to a place safer. However, at that moment, it becomes obvious that no one expected the buildings to collapse - and when this happens, Stone stages the tragedy from the point of view of those inside the towers, in an impressive, realistic and impactful scene.If until then the feature offered an intense portrayal of those first hours of September 11, 2001, from then on it becomes yet another story of survival - and, in this respect, it is no different (in fact, it is clearly inferior) to several other stories. Productions of the genre - inspired or not by real facts - such as Das Boot, Apollo 13, The Towering Inferno and so on. As if that were not enough, McLoughlin and Jimeno cease to be individuals and become symbols of hope in a society devastated by such a violent attack - and, as I mentioned before, Oliver Stone is not the best director to reverse this situation and convert him. Them again into three-dimensional characters. From the second act, the pace of the work drops sharply. All the adrenaline imposed at the beginning is abandoned and the plot falls into melodrama, where the concern of the police officers' families with their efforts to stay alive is interspersed, therefore, the plot remains a long time without going anywhere.The filmmaker even tries, it's true; however, their initiatives are clumsy and bring even worse results, as evidenced by the various flashbacks that never fit organically into the narrative and that only serve to make the film with an even more irregular rhythm. And if the script succeeds in illustrating the emotional dimension assumed by common objects left behind by the characters (such as McLoughlin's carpentry tools), it stumbles again by including scenes that bring John's delusions with his wife, when the feature reaches waste a few long minutes focusing on an imaginary and terribly repetitive conversation between the couple.Likewise, the visual strategy adopted by Stone and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey is sadly primary: while Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña are always framed in extreme close-ups and immersed in shadow, the flashbacks appear overexposed and with an almost dreamlike atmosphere. And if comparing the removal of the police from the rubble to an almost literal return of the dead results in an interesting plan (turning the ruins into the walls of a tomb), there is no denying that the idea is also obvious in its allegory. As if that were not enough, Stone completely messes up by including several Christian religious icons (the ""visions"" related to Jesus are pathetic), which, to make matters worse, still ends up looking like an ideological/religious counterpoint to the Islamic origin of those responsible for the attack - an oversight that, while unintentional (Oliver Stone wouldn't do it), is dangerous and offensive.Another huge challenge belonged to the duo of protagonists, needing to create good compositions without using any body movement other than their facial expressions for more than half of the film, due to the limitations imposed on their characters. That said, Nicolas Cage and Michael Penã manage to convey the intensity of their characters' physical pain and the psychological struggle they face to stay awake in the face of so much pain. Their wives, played by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal, convey their concern for their husbands, but the script does not give them the opportunity to develop something else. On the other hand, even this imminence of death becomes artificial and ineffective precisely because we know, in advance, how the story will end: under normal conditions, it would be distressing to follow the characters' families while they wait for some news, but, in this case, the delay becomes just tedious, as we are aware that the long-awaited phone call will eventually happen. This is the high price that World Trade Center ends up paying for opting for the exception rather than the rule: it would be much more effective, from a dramatic and narrative point of view, to focus on one of the many other families that never experienced the happiness of reuniting with their victimized relatives. For the attacks - or, at least, to receive a definitive position on them (the number of victims of September 11 who never had their remains recovered reaches almost 1,200).Without focusing on the political aspects of the attacks or their consequences (at least, intentionally), World Trade Center is not a film about terrorism, revenge or the Bush administration; it is, first and foremost, a story about solidarity and the will to live - and this, in itself, would not be something discrediting if the feature had something new, interesting or relevant to say about the theme (and it does not). Of course, as it is an Oliver Stone project, a certain disappointment with the inoffensive, innocuous tone of the narrative is inevitable, which makes obvious the controversial filmmaker's fear of expressing his opinions on the subject. In any case, for those who know the paranoid side of the director, the two quick mentions of the fact that the fall of the WTC looked like a premeditated implosion will certainly serve as the basis for several crazy conspiracy theories about the role of the US government in the tragedy.Still, it takes a great deal of effort to find, in World Trade Center, a slightly more complex subtext - and even if we do, the fact remains that the film fails so grossly in its emotional and narrative aspects. Despite never being able to regain the extreme efficiency achieved at the beginning of the work, from the third act the feature resumes its pace, due to the expectation of following the reaction of the families when they discover that McLoughlin and Jimeno are alive, in addition to accompanying the difficulty to remove them from tons of rubble. The ending still invests in a pleasant optimism, conveying a message of charity and love that leaves a good feeling in the face of memories of such a terrifying fact. But it is always necessary to reinforce that Oliver Stone is completely without daring here, abdicating to put his vision in the facts and even ignoring the consequences of the attack to prioritize a completely melodramatic plot, which is even efficient for a few moments, but results in a movie totally forgettable in the director's career.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A reactionary horror,"Oliver Stone and Paramount have gone under cover of the 'based on real events' shield in order to create one of the most shockingly propagandist blockbusters of the last twenty years.The film offends on a number of levels, not least because of its exploitative and unnecessary depiction of the suffering of those who were trapped in the World Trade Center on September 11 2001. Stone must be congratulated for suddenly becoming one of the most important men in American politics; this film is his calling to become, after a rocky road, best buds with his fellow Yale attendees the President and Vice President of the United States.For consistency in a seemingly chaotic world, we can hope the Bush Administration as well as the box office rewards Mr. Stone for this very special (in the way one might refer to a child who's a little slow and worryingly destructive) contribution to the Patriot Act and War on Terror. Of course, stability of this sort would be small comfort, as 'Patriotism' has been for people residing in the States. World Trade Center is an ultra conservative movie which has as its central recommendation the unsettling amusement that $60 million was spent on creating this kitsch, facile house of cards. Those who were directly affected by the events which destroyed the World Trade Center and those who are currently experiencing the devastating human and political consequences of 'post- 9/11', deserve far better than this dire and noxious formula.",1.0,Anonymous,History
With reference to Oliver Stone - rather mediocre,"Of course, the topic is difficult, painful and most of viewers remember this or can revive the live events via Youtube or similar channels... But female characters (performed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello) are over-dramatized; families and friends of those who work within rescue, military, and police should be - and usually are - always prepared for the worst as those jobs are dangerous everywhere. And the women having children with them must be strong and realistic, not panicking around and letting off steam on relatives.Nicholas Cage could have obtained more screen time, so the real stars for me are 2 Michaels: Pena and Shannon (though the part of the latter is relatively small).Pre-rescue scenes under ground are too long, dull and hard to watch due to darkness. Tensions are not highly maintained throughout the over 2 hours... As a whole, the movie is too lengthy - not surprisingly, Mr Stone is known for long and epic works - but still I think that World Trade Center is one of the weakest movies Stone has directed.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"If this doesn't win best picture, they should stop giving the award","Let me start by saying that while I often enjoy Oliver Stone movies, I could not disagree with him more when it comes to politics. When I first heard about this movie, I feared Stone would concentrate on conspiracy theories as he did in JFK or take the film as an opportunity to show that terrorists are people too as Spielberg did in Munich. Now I am glad to report that this movie was as apolitical as can be. The whole movie is shown from the perspective of the victims as they experienced it, with Stone embracing none of the benefits of hindsight. The movie simply follows the characters through that day as the horror and wonder unfold before them. As a result, this film, particularly in its first 20 minutes, is a true deja vu experience, and is sure to make every viewer relive that day in his own mind. The film primarily follows a few first responders as they move through that day, and all one can think of while watching it is how heroic these men are, how difficult it must have been to stare that horror in the face and choose to walk right into it when everyone else was running away. This movie should be considered required viewing of the caliber of Schindler's List.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nowhere near being the bold film that it should be,"Even thinking about it days later, World Trade Center is a terrible disappointment. I was not feeling overly excited to watch the film in the first place, but the obvious idea of the subject matter is captivating. September 11, 2001 was a day that everyone can remember, and no one will forget. So having been the second film in less than six months about the subject, it had big shoes to fill. Sadly, it is not up to the task.The film, directed by controversial Oscar-winner Oliver Stone, focuses around two PAPD officers trapped under the wreckage of the World Trade Center following its collapse. Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) has a wife, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a child with another on the way. John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage), is an expert on the towers, and has a wife Donna (Maria Bello), and four children. The film goes back and fourth between these four characters, simultaneously showing the pain that Jimeno and McLoughlin are being forced to face, and their wives, hoping and waiting to hear that their husbands are alive.The storyline is very simple, and I think this is where the film finds itself in trouble. When it starts out, it paints itself to be about the towers. Many blatant scenery shots of the New York City skyline have them both emblazed in the background almost like a huge target. They are totally in your face, and even if you have no idea where to look for them in really far shots, you can still find them right away. When the planes hit, we do not actually see the impact, but the chaos taking place on the ground does feel authentic, and well done. I liked the shadow of the plane on the huge skyscraper moments before it hit, but was less impressed by the unrealistic CGI shot of the burning building. Likewise, when the police crew watches a person tumble to their death, the poignancy and meaning to this person's ultimate death is so contrived that it almost looks like we should laugh at as a CGI effect, it looks awful. As well, out of a just over two hour film, the trade center only appears in less than the first thirty minutes.Another thing I disliked was how the movie was based entirely around the two characters, with little to nothing being actually about the trade centers, other than the event that causes their problem. If the movie is going to be called, World Trade Center, you would assume the film would be about the event a whole lot more. Yes, there are the media coverage scenes, and the very well captured early moments of on-the-street chaos. But as the film goes on, there is really nothing to distinguish that the film is about the trade centers at all. It is almost as if it could be about any other disaster, maybe even a fictional one. It just feels half there, and half not. United 93 was actually about that plane and the people on it. The World Trade Center does make a small appearance in the film, but after that, is not really what the film is about anymore. I understand the poignancy and the human emotion the film wanted to evoke, but it could have been called something much different since it is about something much different.Where United 93 excelled at its fast-paced editing and its heart-racing thrills, Center just fails. Its opening is fairly fast, and almost as fast as you can snap your fingers, the trade center comes down. From there, it just kind of drags on. The characters are bland, and really have a lack of definition among them. The men want to get out, and the women want to ensure the men are alive. Okay, you can only convey that so many ways on screen before it becomes repetitive. I know they were going for some authenticity, but just having the actors do the same thing over and over again becomes tedious and loses the emotional focus at the heart of the film. We, as the audience, know the ultimate outcome of the situation, and need to have something interesting going on while the film progresses to hold our attention.United 93 shifted focus from the effect the media had on everyone watching the news footage, to the knowledge that terrorists were holding the plane hostage. We know what is coming, but director Paul Greengrass draws us in, and makes the events seem fresh and not drilled into memory. Here, Stone just wants to tell the story, and does not bother looking back or even caring whether the audience is paying attention or not. No subtext, no shift in focus, no good editing, it just stays the same and drags itself out.The acting is okay at best. Cage has seen far better days, and has put a whole lot more effort into other performances. Bello looks and feels subdued. She is clearly being held back, and her role suffers as a result. Pena is excellent, but only to a point. I really enjoyed Gyllenhaal, but like Bello, she feels like she is being held back, and not giving the role everything she has. Supporting turns from Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff are well done, but are barely shown. And despite his character actually being a real person, Michael Shannon takes his role far too extreme and becomes too propagandist for his own good. His over-the-top character is a real low point in the film, and had I not found out he was real, I would have assumed he was put in on purpose by Stone.On the whole, the film is just a disappointment. It has an okay storyline and a good message, but is just not the powerful film that it should have been. You are better off sticking with the far superior United 93.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"A story of how buried under the economic landmark was a tale of love, courage, hope, faith, teamwork, perseverance and sacrifice.","""A curtain God made to shield us from 'what we are not ready to see'""a rescue personnel described this of the billows of smoke envaginating the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Centre towers. However, this comment becomes ironic when the movie World Trade Centre proceeds to show how buried under the economic landmark was a tale of love, courage, hope, faith, teamwork, perseverance and sacrifice.Directed by Oliver Stone at a cost of US$65 million, the story is about five Port Authority personnel who ventured into World Trade Centre Tower 1, which was about to crumple, in hope of rescuing people out of the building. When the core of the tower finally gave way, the survival of the rescuers were unfortunately threatened.The backdrop of the disaster helped bring out many of the themes shown in the film. Only when danger and unpredictability looms does humanity become all the more important to survival itself. Without the love from and of their wives, without their lion-heartedness and perseverance to endure pain and thirst, without the hope of being rescued, without the faith of God and without the sacrifice and teamwork of the rescue team, the Port Authority personnel would probably have had a highly reduced chance of survival.Ultimately, the movie does not promise you a total understanding of humanity, neither does it promise excitement and action, but it would probably provide an afternoon of inspiration and a small glimpse into the lesser-seen side of humans.",7.0,Anonymous,History
true story,"First i would like to say that i'm very surprised to see Nicolas Cage in this type of movie, and i give him credit for tackling this role it must not have been very easy to accept a role like this.

The movie itself is simply a (long) longing for heroic spirit: every single character is as pure and un-nuanced as the most unimaginative American mind could possibly make them. It is a hymn to the ever-yearned-for triumph of the human spirit, marriage and, apparently, to Christianity, as only Jesus, a wife, and at least two children appear to be worth living for in this world.

Go to the movie's Web site before seeing,"Before seeing a preview in my movie class this past week, I went to the official Web site, clicked on ""In Their Own Words"" and viewed interviews with the real people who are depicted in the film. I strongly suggest that you do that before seeing this movie. They give insight about the making of the film and their part in it as well as some fascinating behind-the-scenes anecdotes.Three of us who went to the preview had very different opinions. I was the only one who had gone to the Web site and I liked it the best. One other thought it was okay, the third thought it was ""too Hollywood,"" which the other two of us disagreed with. Our class as a whole seemed to give it a big thumbs up.New Yorkers will probably have a different take on this movie from everyone else because we were there and we have lived with it every day since. I think it would be tough for anyone to watch, knowing what really happened that day, but I think everyone should see it if they want to get more of a personal view of what happened that day from the point of view of the people who risked their lives to enter the buildings. ""World Trade Center"" deliberately doesn't show the most sensational footage of the towers going down or the second plane hitting the building; it is about and from the perspective of the two Port Authority policemen who went in to evacuate people and got trapped, not knowing that the buildings had collapsed. And what was going on with their families as they awaited word of their fate.The two producers of the film, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher, spoke to us after the film. One memorable thing they said was that when they were creating the replica of the pancakes buildings through which they had to crawl and weave, the rescuers (the real ones) commented that it was not tight enough, that it was too open. The director and production people were astonished. When they made the openings much narrower, defying human capability to penetrate, the rescuers demonstrated how they got to the two trapped men, wriggling and curving their way down almost like snakes. That led to the real rescuers being asked to play themselves rather than actors. Knowing that made watching the film a richer experience. I credit Oliver Stone with trying to make every detail as true to life as possible.The four main characters who played the trapped men and their wives -- Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal -- did their real-live counterparts proud. I don't want to get into the controversy of whether this movie is too early, too late, or whether it should have been made at all. The one thing I know from living in New York and hearing on virtually a daily basis since 9/11 about the diverse and contentious opinions of the 9/11 families is that people will weigh in passionately. The whole post-9/11 experience in New York brought out the best in people -- we bonded like never before and helped each other in every way for months afterward. This film gives a glimpse of the heart that New Yorkers really do have.There will be more movies about that day -- I think this is a responsible, substantive, insightful first one.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I have seen some remarks that this movie was too focused on these two policemen, and missed out on the big tragedy that was happening and all the thousands of people involved.... I must say, I'm glad Oliver Stone didn't get too ambitious on this point! This is not supposed to be a documentary, and it is not supposed to tell everyones story. The movie also gains my respect for not being political at all! 9/11 was a terrible day, not only for America, but for the whole world...

An uneven film which is still very much worth seeing,"World Trade Center is at it's best an incredible film. Featuring fantastic performances from Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, along with some of the best scenes of the year, the formula for success is definitely present here. Unfortunately, poor pacing really stops it from achieving what it could have. World Trade Center is worth seeing. But it could have been so much more.Nicholas Cage does an absolutely fantastic job playing Sergeant McLoughlin. He's entirely believable as a man who just wants to get home to his family. The same can be said for Michael Pena, a young cop with a young daughter and another on the way. The majority of the film takes place with these two buried in the rubble of the World Trade Center. This makes their performances all the more exceptional, as they're just laying on their backs and talking. But when these two were on the screen, I couldn't look away.The same quality does not always carry over into the sub plots of the film. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance, which combined with her equally impressive turns in Sherrybaby and Stranger Than Fiction make this a fantastic year for her. But the other people in her story line just don't do that good a job. I didn't really feel the sense of panic that I remember from that day, which would be magnified for the loved ones I would imagine. I got that from Maggie and from the main two, but not from the others involved. Maria Bello's story line was worse though, as Maria was just sub par here. I don't know why, she's a fantastic actress. I thought she gave quite possibly the performance of the year last year in A History of Violence. But here, she just didn't feel real to me. I just didn't find her believable. The story of the marine who went to the towers to help likewise, just didn't feel quite right, though the performance is good.When you're watching the two main characters, this movie is phenomenal. But the rest of the time, it just feels off. I recommend watching it, but you could almost fast forward through the sub plots and miss nothing.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"It's not United 93, but it's not bad.","Movies about September 11th, 2001, are not easy to watch, nor are they easy to review. On a lesser scale, they are this generation's equivalent of Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation watching World War II films. I remember my grandpa discussing ""Saving Private Ryan"", and he was always hesitantly uncomfortable, acknowledging that it was a well done, but he didn't enjoy it much. In a like vein, the fact that its viewers lived through the described day both abets and ails ""World Trade Center"", Oliver Stone's emotional story about two emergency workers trapped in the rubble of the twin towers.Speaking of ""Ryan"", ""WTC"" also faces the same quandary as ""A Thin Red Line"", in that it follows a similarly themed movie that might be the year's best film, ""United 93"". Like ""Line"", ""WTC"" differs widely from its chronological predecessor even though the general subject material is the same. Though set at Guadalcanal, ""Line"" wasn't really about war, while ""Ryan"" was precisely about the horrors of war. ""United 93"" told a story from a primarily objective standpoint, allowing the audience's own genuine emotions to affect their viewing experience. Differently, WTC is about specific experiences on 9/11, looking to share the feelings of a the trapped officers and their left-in-limbo families. Those people certainly have their moments of primal emotion that can only stem from situations of life and death. The most touching ones spring from the family members left on the outside, forced to wait and wonder. For whatever reason, imagining the loss or endangerment of loved ones is more potent than imagining one's own physical danger, and the portrayal of that blistering boredom cuts to the quick of anybody with a heart.As soul-wrenching as these events are, and despite the fact that they are true, they still feel like movie moments. Strong and good movie moments, yes, but even the best of those cannot match someone's personal feelings from that day, feelings created by actually being there. Make no mistake, the movie is very well made. Although Oliver Stone did direct it, none of his trademarks are present here. There is no kinetic editing (""JFK""); there are no flashy visuals (""Any Given Sunday""); there is no agenda of any kind (""Platoon""). Were his direction not so publicized, one would have no idea of his involvement. He wisely lets the story tell itself, using a straightforward story-telling method that gently weaves together the disparate experiences of the two men and their families.Perhaps I erred in seeing this on September 11th, after a day spent reliving my own emotions and those of actual people who were there on that day. ""World Trade Center"" is a good movie that contains raw human emotion more powerful than most put on screen. But even that drama simply cannot match what we personally experienced when living through that day, regardless of the dire circumstances. That makes the movie less compelling than it should be.Bottom Line: Better drama than most, but missing an extra dose of passion to push it to the next level. 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I am disgusted,As a retired firefighter who lost 343 brothers on that terrible day I think it is disgusting that these people have chosen to profit from that tragedy. More than 13% of the victims of the Twin Towers were not even in the buildings when they were hit. Many of the heroes that escaped from the first collapse chose to enter the second one knowing full well that it was likely to happen again. Oliver Stone is just living up to what I have come to expect from him but Nicolas Cage and everyone else on this project have proved themselves to be nothing more than low class prostitutes. No supposedly altruistic motive to tell the stories of these heroic men can justify anyone profiting from the tragedy. Unless every single person and every company involved with this film makes the decision to donate 100% of all profits to all the families that lost loved ones on that day I will never again see any project that they are connected with.

world trade center,"this is most most disgracefull movie ever made. i am appoled that the American studios think this is the right way to commemorate the September 11 disaster, by getting nicholas cage to put on a fake moustache and pretend hes some kind of hero when the only reason he is in this film is to make a bit of money. Shall i tell you the truth , this is American shite and proof that America what these disasters to happen so they came make millions on the so called heart breaking films about them. if you are American and think you have to see this movie, think again, if you go to see this you are as well spitting on the graves of those who died that day because this movie is not ""a tale of courage"" its a tale of thousands dieing because of the war, which America is to blame for. its just sickening to watch this, not because it breaks your heart but because you know oliver stone is sitting at home fluffing his pillows and smoking cigar's with the money you give him to make a movie that laughs in the faces of the terrorists saying "" you giving destroy anything we have and well still make money out of it "" so don't fear viewers because as soon as they do it again nicholas cage will be round the corner to save the day with another Hollywood blockbuster. god bless American",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Powerful Movie,"I had the honor of seeing advance screening of World Trade Center in NYC on Auguest 2nd.There are no running subplots, no distracting romances and few ""Hollywood inventions"" in the film. There are no complicated plot twists, subliminal messages, or indictments. The film never shows the planes impacting the twin towers, nor does it focus on those behind the attacks. Footage of political figures is kept to a brief minimum - President Bush and Rudy Giuliani make only brief appearances.I must say that Oliver Stone did a very good job of staying clear of his left wing thoughts as far as bringing personal thoughts into the movie. I have not cried since 9/11... but this movie sure did turn on the tears. It's powerful. Being that I saw this in NYC, I felt it was OK to cry, I was sitting in a room with people who lost those close and dear.Stone presents a deeply personal narrative of two real-life Port Authority police officers trapped in the rubble of the North Tower, simple and sweet.When you ask yourself do I want to see this movie or not, bring your heart into the movie and know that it was not made to anger you, it was made to honor those who died on that day.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Two 9/11s,"As a New Yorker trying to come to grips with all of these new 9/11-themed movies, I have come to the conclusion that there were two very different 9/11s here in America.The first 9/11 is the national tragedy which shocked all Americans, from Seattle to Miami. The second, more personal 9/11, is the one that New Yorkers witnessed with their own eyes.I stood on the roof of my Brooklyn apartment building and watched the towers fall. I remember saying ""oh no oh no oh no"" about a thousand times. I was in shock, pure and simple. I thought the death toll would be in the tens of thousands, as I was very aware of how many people could have been in/around the towers. I cried.I don't want to ramble on here, and I'm not claiming that my reaction to the tragedy is any more valid than anyone else's, even if they were in California during the attacks and only saw them on television.What I AM saying, however, is that I think New Yorkers in particular could have used a little more time before movies of this nature started coming-out. It's just still too fresh in our collective memory... too raw.I understand that others, who were not there, may want to feel a little closer to this national tragedy... to remind themselves of just how scared we all were that day. As a New Yorker and an eye witness, however, I need no reminders. To me, and to many other New Yorkers with whom I have discussed this very topic, these movies seem to be shamelessly capitalizing on our pain, turning our personal tragedy into a money-making venture, and it sickens me.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A travesty,"There is no doubt some great technical work in the film, but that is where the genius stops, and the Hollywood begins. This film doesn't try and tell an original story, but rather tries to recreate the horrible insecure feeling of doubt and horror we all felt during 9/11 and then the unity we all felt thereafter...and fails horribly. Not only does it fail to focus on the main events during the characters real story, but it creates the most annoying and offensive character to ever grace a screen in the generic Christian Marine who comes and saves the day. Stone looses his ability to tell a controversial story effectively and thus creates a film that seems inspired by the writers at hallmark, and not the pride and courage created out of everyday men like the two in this film.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Best Picture of the Year,"Arguably the best movie of the year. Yes I said it, this film will win Best Picture of the year, not just because it's a recurring event in our life, but because it brings something more to the screen. Nicholas Cage was excellent in this role, as he struggles to find out who he really is. Michael Pena is definitely my pick for Best Supporting Actor, at least a nomination. His role was quite definitive in this whole movie, I was always wondering what he was going to bring next. In a time where they were dealing with death, these two officers kept each other alive with lifted spirits. They believed in one another when fate was just around the corner. I tip my hat off for this movie because they avoid the politics that most of us are tired of, and focuses on the lives of the real heroes in this movie. What these two men went through must've been the most traumatic experiences in one's life. I do think that this one movie is one that no person has a reason to criticize because we weren't the ones under that rubble. How a person can judge how a movie like this as mediocre is wrong. This is a moment that defines our whole generation and definitely changed the world as we know it. I also hope that people can look away from the fact that it was produced in Hollywood because then they are just contradicting themselves (What about Pearl Harbour, Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, etc. These were terrible events and yet they proved to be something more). So to those out there who can look past that you will definitely enjoy this movie. It was kind, warm-hearted, and courageous of Mr. Stone to bring it to the table.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Unbelievably Boring & Predictable,"I actually nodded off within the first 1/2 hour after waiting with anticipation for months to see this insipid movie (I refuse to call it a film.) While the actors and directors tried desperately to be evocative, they merely came across as cliché and wooden. I was actually muttering what the characters would say before they said it. Thankfully, there was no one sitting very close as the theater was 3/4 empty and this was Friday (8/11) night. I would recommend waiting for the video, but only if you get to see it for free. This movie paid tribute to 9/11 the same way ""Crash"" explored racism...very superficially. If you want to see an inspiring movie about September 11th watch 911 by the Naudet Brothers. Much more stirring and you feel all the same feelings you felt that day...rage, anger, sadness and fear.

"Sentimental, emotionally meretricious, over inflated crud.","Sentimental, emotionally meretricious, over inflated crud. ""Green Berets"" rather than ""Apocalypse Now"". This is how Leni Riefenstahl would have made the film of the Battle of Stalingrad. Having seen other Stone movies and been impressed - at least by ""JFK"" - I would have expected a film that demanded a more complex emotional response from its audience. Instead, we have what feels like a ""Let's make a film about 9/11 while it's still fashionable and we can make some big bucks"" movie - ""Towering Inferno"" meets ""Titanic"" meets ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".

"good if you're looking for a memorial of heroism and courage, though short of really affecting","Maybe part of my reaction to Oliver Stone's latest directorial effort, World Trade Center, is not totally the film's fault, or maybe it is, I still can't decide. Months ago I saw what I thought was the ultimate take on the pain, horror and bottomless grief that came from 9/11 with United 93, which took a full-on documentary approach with one particular story from that day and without a known cast or really well-known director made an incredibly emotional film. With World Trade Center, this time we get one of the chief directors working today with melodrama and heightened emotions, who more often than not does make it work for his goals. It also has a cast of known Hollywood actors, such as Nicholas Cage (as the star), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, and Jay Hernandez among others. That matched with a story that has no real villains aside from the elements around them (i.e. a mountain of rubble), and given a more old-fashioned approach to the devastation, puts the film at more of a distance for the viewer. This is a respectable, well-made dramatization of the events of these two un-questionably brave policemen. If it isn't better than it could've been, it's because of its ambitions as a simply respecting, and sentimental detailing.This is not to say that Stone and first-time writer Andrea Berloff don't put up some very effective scenes. It's just that they often have to share time with material that, while probably not far from the truth, are too typical or diverting from what is compelling. For example, the early scenes as the chaos first comes up with the first plane hitting the tower, and the officers going in, is just the right pacing for this set-up material. When officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jemeno (Michael Pena) are under the rubble, which is very well constructed by Stone's designers for full authenticity, their scenes together are close to touching. Even a moment when Jesus comes into the picture via Stone's use of symbolism isn't lost on me. But it's in the cutting back to the families of the men where I started to feel the disconnect. I understand the purpose of showing the worrying, sorrowful wives and kids in this situation, but it becomes almost like filling up the running time, especially in the most unnecessary scenes of the film in the flashbacks showing both men before the incidents.This added with Stone's hit or miss tactic of visual melodrama makes the film lesser than it could be. But this is all personal gripes, and what I did expect from the film I did get. There are more than enough scenes that hit the buttons that should be met about the bravery and heroism of those who responded to the towers collapse. And Stone is tactful enough not to go all Michael Bay on us with his style (and, at the least, keep a kind of restraint that seems to be a good rebound after Alexander). He keeps his actors in a state of mind that fits the subject matter, and even in the moments that do border on being in a TV-movie (though in the end a stroke above a TV-movie), they're never un-true to what their characters need to be for the material. World Trade Center is meant to hit the mainstream movie-going audience, unlike the more independent-minded and un-restricted United 93, and for a mass audience it's just the right touch of pathos that's not too soon five years later.",5.0,Anonymous,History

First and foremost there should be the carnage, the horror, and the immediacy of it all. Instead of one man jumping to his death, show dozens raining down. Tell it!!! The air was PINK!!! All we see are a few reaction shots. We see minor injuries instead of a ""Gone with the Wind"" devastation of acres of screaming men, one of the highest impact shots in movie history. If you're going to tell the story of World Trade or Rwanda, you don't pull punches just so kids can see it.There should also be dozens of heroes saying ""I'm going in!"" as a hundred others rush forward behind them. There should more than one or two comments about getting ""them."" When Kennedy was killed we were instantly ready to quit college and jobs to fix bayonets and get ""them.""

mixed feelings,"i was really looking forward to this movie.the way i see it there are two main reasons to make this movie. first is to draw some grand conclusions about the experience. what did it all mean. the other is to show us what we couldn't see on TV. what cinema only can show. i wanted to see the planes crash in the buildings. what was it like to be on the floor where the plane pushed in. what did it look like close up. and more over ..one of the true dramas of the tragedy ....what happened up there. what did kind of hell and internal debate did the people up there go through: should i jump or would i burn alive if i didn't. this movie didn't do either. the big revelation was that one should try to stay alive and that people are capable of good deeds. but that's something i already knew after watching program after program on TV. as to what happened in those towers ... cnn showed more .... in this movie we only see a shadow of the plane. we never see them hit the buildings. i'm not sure if it was a budgetary issue...but hey ...i saw the planes hit the towers on the today show. how come not in the movie ?the movie did show me what it might have been like when that building came down on you. that 30 second sequence showed me something i hadn't seen a million times on the TV news. the movie did show what it would have been under that rubble. i had no idea there were those weird spacey sounds. like a sinking ship almost. thank you for that. i had no idea.the biggest single problem i had with this film was that it was a too sentimental for my taste and it felt a little like a made for TV film. it would have played better without the violins underscoring every emotion. the subject is so powerful, the emotions so strong and raw, i don't need to be manipulated to feel them. less would have been more.but the truth is i did get misty eyed a couple of times. i did want the couples to reunite. i did want the guys to live. i maybe would have rooted even more for them if they'd been less cartoony though. after two hours i have no idea what party any of the people would have voted for. i have no idea what would have made them laugh. i have no idea what they thought of any of the many issues that get the country riled up. i have no idea who these people were.i'm one of those people who likes oliver stone. there are many places in this film where you know you're watching a great film maker ...but honestly this is not one of his best and maybe have waited a couple of more years before tackling this subject ....",5.0,Anonymous,History
Jesus had a bottled water,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a bit of NASCAR appeal to Oliver Stone movies. With the car races, there is always a certain segment of viewers who kind of hope for a massive pile-up featuring fire balls. With Stone's movies, many can't wait to see his political agenda or twisting of facts to ""prove"" the newest conspiracy theory. It is with both relief and dismay that I report ""WTC"" is a right down the fairway presentation of one sub-plot of the tragic 9/11 events.Port Authority Police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno were two of the twenty people rescued from the tower rubble after the collapses. Knowing that much going in prevents any real dramatic suspense from being generated. That said, watching human pain and suffering is never easy and with excellent directing and acting, it can still be fascinating to behold. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena are effective as McLoughlin and Jimeno. The dynamic of their near hopeless state is staged very well. However, the real story here is the families endurance and dealings with the not knowing the status of their loved ones. Playing the buried officer's wives are the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. Both bring as much heart and emotion to these women's actions as possible. Yes, it borders on heavy-handed melodrama at times, but don't forget these are tragically real events.As with most Stone films, the supporting cast is very good. Included are Nicky Katt, Stephen Dorff, Frank Whaley, Jay Hernandez, Patti D'Arbanville and Harmonica Sunshine (playing a hooker, but I just love that name!). Don't miss the cameos by the real life McLoughlin and Jimeno and brace yourself for the entire sequence of the disaster and shock of those in the middle of it. This is no Michael Bay schlock action movie, this is a combination of amazing sets that we are all too familiar with.The little human story of this horrible time in our history can provide hope to all in regards to the strength of the soul and spirit of so many.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Terrible Movie,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so boring, I left half way through the movie. It was like Ladder 49, except with no funny parts, no suspense, no likable characters, and extremely boring. The families of the missing officers were so annoying, that it was hard to feel bad for them. The documentaries I've seen about the world trade center were 100 times more interesting than the movie was. I would have thought that the trade center going down would have been a huge scene in the middle of the movie, but the biggest suspense was a water cooler inside an office shaking. There was not even a visual of the plane hitting, just a shadow of it coming. I understand that some people think its too painful to watch the attack in such detail, but you know what, if you don't want to watch it, DON'T. Overall, for an event with so much emotion and sadness, I don't understand how someone could have made a movie out of it that I had absolutely no feeling for.

And it all comes tumbling down,"Anyone who lives in the US is aware that Americans are extremely good at ripping off their own; from the White House to the local gas station, they're all out to screw you with deception, misleading commercials, inflated prices, etc. Why? Because the American way of life revolves around one thing and one thing only: MONEY. If you have it, you're OK, if not, you're nothing and no-one. This is often called the ""American Dream"". Americans don't care who they harm or hurt in pursuit of the ""mighty dollar"". Watch any US cable TV for examples. US movies are not exempt from this practice and this movie, WORLD TRADE CENTER, in particular, is a prime example of yet another great rip-off, i.e. dwelling on the public's still-raw emotions of 9/11 and cobbling together a generic disaster movie, knowing full well that it WILL make it at the box office simply because of the title! Every American will probably see this movie eventually. Had this movie been entitled anything else such as ""Buried Alive!"" or ""Three Days in Hell"", it would flop en route to the box office. WTC, directed by Oliver Stone (who really should know better and rise above cheap box office money tricks) is actually NOT about the 9/11 attacks and events at all, but merely about a few select individuals who happened to be involved in the attacks, as were TENS OF THOUSANDS of other people. This should have been a gripping, riveting movie that kept us glued to our seats for two hours and which wracked us with a gamut emotions. Instead, it's another generic mish-mosh of some 9/11 scenes and a ""Day-In-The-Life of..."" humdrum disaster flick script. Remember the 'Airport' movies and 'Earthquake'? Same thing, different color. Remove Nicholas Cage from the movie and you've got . . . squat. For such a powerful theme, i.e. 9/11, this flick sure does disappoint and I found myself bored to tears through most it as it was so predictable with all the schmaltzy script and cheesy acting. I guess Oliver Stone too has fallen prey to the 'buck', forsaking content, information and entertainment value; the entire POINT of a movie. Any movie. I sincerely hope that one day a good movie IS made about the events of 9/11, even if it is 4 hours long. This one sure ain't it. I suspect that anyone who DID lose someone in the attacks will not be impressed that their loved ones are given the briefest mention in this two-hour 'infomentary'. This flick could have taken place anywhere in the world, in any building at any time. Picking the 'Twin Towers' as the 'theme' was simply deceptive. My condolences to the victims of 9/11, I wish this movie had offered an explanation or perhaps closure for some. I have a 14-month old daughter.

The commanding officer deals out the orders for the day and the briefing is done. Then the news comes that a plane has crashed into one of the two towers and the action starts rolling.The bulk of the film plays as two separate stories: the two officers laying in the debris, and their family and rescuers trying to get to them and finding out what happened. It plays on emotion, becomes overly sentimental and tries to put up some ""real"" heroes.And just that is the point where it fails miserably. At least for me.

Greengrass V.S Stone,"(The winner is Greengrass).This film to me just didn't work overall it didn't really give to much emotion through the movie and to much of the movie was about the family worrying and the people trying to find the two men. But when it came to the men below the rubble it seemed like no more then 10 minutes was used there.And when the men were under the rubble their was no character development amongst them, but rather flashbacks of their family and the two men talking about their family. And i have the utmost respect to all of the firemen,police and paramedics that were there that day and to all the victims that died that day but when the men were under the rubble and being rescued i just did not have to much emotion going on. And i think what the problem could have been was the PG 13 rating so much was toned down and i think that was a major flaw because what happened on September the 11th was rated R many people died and the things the rescuers saw was not PG 13 things and the dialog between the rescuers would not of been ""fricken"" but the other word and it just sounded un natural, if you think you should see a film about 9/11 i think Flight 93 was much better (which was rated R). Also i don't think this is an Oliver Stone film this just isn't his line of work he is a brilliant filmmaker and one of the best but this is more Spielberg or Ridley Scott. In Greengrass's film he portrayed so much more emotion i knew the outcome at the end of Flight 93 as i did in World Trade Center one i was biting my nails and shed a tear or two and the other i watched as a regular movie,Greengrass gave it a true tone World Trade Center just seemed like a movie.

It's NOT too soon!  A short review.,"I like many, don't think about 9/11 every day. As time goes on, we seem to forget what happened. And with our nation in it's current state, we can't let ourselves forget.This film touched me on many levels and reminded me of how I felt that day. It hit me even harder after the film ended because that's when, no doubt, everyone will sit around and reminisce about where they were when the got the news, which I did.One thing the film does exceptionally well is it doesn't over dramatize the events. The film is very captivating and gut-wrenching, but at no point does it seem like the drama was exaggerated. It seems REAL.The performances were all great. There's nothing to complain about there. You really feel like you're there. And the portrayal of the fireman is incredibly real and desperate(in a good way).Bottom line is SEE this movie for two reasons - it is a great film with realistic drama, great performances and a strong impact(I felt it the most about 30 minutes after the film's conclusion). And see it to help you remember why we can never forget and take for granted what happened on September 11th.***On one final note.

It started off fairly well, portraying the confusion that first responders must have come up against, with things happening so fast and them not knowing what to expect. The effects of the building coming down from the inside were also well done. But that's all the good I can muster for this review.After this the movie just took a nose dive. It was confusing and disjointed. The dialogue was terrible, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing. Actually, the dialogue and acting were so bad and the the script suddenly so corny and cliched, I found myself bursting out laughing for most of the rest of the film, well the parts that I didn't full forward past at least. At 2 hours, the film was way too longThere were a ton of random comments which made no sense at all, such as a sequence where John is having an imaginary conversation with his wife while he is trapped, where she tells him ""the kitchen is not ready yet""There was another scene where a gun just starts randomly firing with no explanation and also a scene where the Port Authority workers, heading to the scene, are staring at a man laying on the footpath with paramedics working on him. They all have stunned looks on their faces, but we have no idea what's wrong with the man or if there's any connection to what happened at the WTCIt was actually disrespectful that this movie was so badly made, disrespectful to the real life guys who were portrayed and disrespectful in general to everybody who was killed, injured or lost loved ones on that day.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Why Can't This Movie Just Be About Heroes To You?,"Why can't this movie just be about heroes? The ones that went in not knowing what to expect. I'm talking about the firefighters, police, medics, etc. The regular people who that day had no information to tell them who had screwed up. They had no information to suggest our government was evil. They also had nothing that said this was al-Qaeda or Saddam. All they knew was that people were trapped and needed to get out. And their lives depended on their willingness to help.It's a story of heroes. There are no politics in this film. So drop the politics and let's talk about what it means to be a hero. Cause that's what makes September 11th so great. Sept 11th showed us what people can do in a time of struggle. And if I had to name one reason why I am proud to be an American, I would point to the unity that sprang forth on Sept 11th.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ungood,"Ungood.Rent United 93 instead. This film was so sugar coated and chalk full of syrup I felt like I needed a call girl and shot or Whisky when I got out. Oliver Stone was once a great director, but as of late has made nothing of value. Platoon remains one of my all time favorites for it's gritty realism, however, Disney could have made a more realistic film in this case. The flashbacks and clichés were so numerous and disturbing, I twice began to escape the theater only to sit down so as to have an honest opinion. My opinion is that this film does a disservice to anyone affected by September 11th. Go back to war films, Mr.Stone.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Boring, boring, boring","Can't believe this has been directed by Oliver Stone. Evidently he needed to re-establish himself as a box office director after the US flop of Alexander. So, there we go with this movie made ""to pay the bills"" (for Mr. Stone), full of sentimental and emotional moments that are sure to send you running for handkerchiefs...or maybe not. Think of this as something like Pearl Harbor, 35 minutes interesting & well made, and the rest boring as it can possibly be. The main problem of this is that everything happens to fast, we're just starting to know the characters and, bum all of a sudden they're already under the ruins. I was hoping this would have been a movie on 9/11, it's not. I was hoping this would have been at least a movie on NY finest, it's neither. The all event happens too fast, and you don't really manage to get an understanding of the huge sacrifice of cops, firemen etc..., who went into the towers to save people knowing that they might never get out.

Beautifully executed.,"I must admit, at first I thought, like the majority of people that it was too soon for a movie like this. The pain and loss of this tragic day is all too familiar in the minds of most of the world. It was this day that made me join the U.S. Marines and brought us to where we are in the world today. But after seeing this movie, I cannot emphasize that this movie is coming out at the right time. People need to be reminded that this day changed our lives forever, but also of the heroism that is in each of us.Oliver Stone could not have done better. There is no Hollywood elements in this movie. The only CGI I noticed, were the scenes of Ground Zero and superimposing the towers back into the cityscape. There was no elements of controversy or conspiracy theories, just the story. It is a very rough watch, though. The sounds alone are enough to give you goosebumps. And while you never see the towers hit by the planes, the looks in the actors' eyes are enough to let you know what is going on. The entire cast and crew did superbly in recreating the chaos that followed the first plane hitting. Nothing was overdone or underdone. This is as close to a perfect movie that I've seen in a long time. See it if you are ready to and can handle the raw emotion involved.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Why this sentimentality?,"Oliver Stone's got resources and he has fulfilled all promises in making a movie which will bring in money to the production company. And this is well done due to the premises. Many, many extras and an impressing build-up of the catastrophe area.But what annoys viewers from outside the US anyway, is this eternal handkerchief damaging scenes with the families, always described as the total angels. That's ""Hollywood tradition"" at its worst.This movie would have been stronger if it hadn't concentrated on the fate of these two heroic policemen. Instead there should have been many episodes, including more people. This becomes more of a common action movie than an honest interpretation of what really happened 11th September. Stone can do much better.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Horrible, inappropriate soap opera on par with Pearl Harbor","I'm not going to go off in a rant about how it is insensitive to make a World Trade Center movie a mere 5 years after the atrocity but I will say that it's largely pointless. The images and stories have been covered on TV so many times from so many angles and people that there's really nothing left to learn. When Oliver Stone announced this movie I assume that many of his fans predicted the conspiracy theories and finger pointing he is famous for as well as the highly stylistic and surrealist editing.Well...NONE of that is present here. All we get is pedestrian direction that might as well for a TV movie and a very lame, mawkish soap opera plot that is really dragged-out far too damn long.Nic Cage and Michael Peña play real life 'heroes' who were buried under the WTC rubble for a few days and managed to stay alive by shouting at each other. Each of them have flashbacks to their sweethearts sitting at home pouting and whimpering as their family pat them on the back saying ""It's okay"". Wow, you could cut that tension with a chainsaw, it's electric (the tension, not the chainsaw)! The only impressive thing that WTC really boasts is a brilliant sound design, asides from that there's not much reason to watch the film. Nicolas Cage is hardly given much to do apart from lie on his back, Maggie Gyllenhaal as 'the wife' is given almost nothing to do apart from the quivering lip thing and Maria Bello (didn't she used to have BROWN eyes?) is alarmingly frozen-faced as 'the other wife'. Stone's usually flamboyant and trip-like cinematography has been replaced with framing so bland you'd be forgiven for thinking you're looking at a series of still photographs.I know anyone wishing to defend this film can easily say that sort of film-making technique is not suitable for a story like this. If so, then why the hell would Oliver Stone, of all people choose to make it? A completely pointless film that pussyfoots around tougher issues and makes a triumph out of a loss. And don't give me any of that 'triumph of the human spirit' crap either. There was no reason for this film to be made and everyone involved could have something more worthy with a little extra imagination or balls.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The worst terrorist attack in Hollywood history.,"It seems that Oliver Stone's patriotism is too much for him to objectively helm a story like World Trade Center, which focuses on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers after the September 11th attacks. The problem with the movie is that it is simultaneously trying to be a memorial to those killed in the attacks (and particularly honor the bravery of the firefighters) and still retain some realism. As a memorial it is successful, although pretty cloying at times, but the realism fails completely. If, in fact, there was any intention towards realism at all.In the latter point, it may very well be that Stone was not going for realism. I am no expert on the logistics of collapsing buildings, but I have read extensively on the subject of the attacks, as I imagine most Americans have, and I've seen a lot of pictures as Ground Zero was being cleared of the bottom floors of the towers. In one picture, I remember seeing a messy wall of material that looked as solid as a rock which was about 10-12 feet high, which was described as 15-20 floors compressed together. The idea that two firefighters are caught underneath the 100+ floors of collapsing towers is laughable, and this, my friends, is not a comedy.Then again, I think the focus of the film is on the breed of suffering and heroism involved in the rescue efforts just after the attacks, and the plight of the firefighters' families and their loved husbands and fathers and brothers and sons rushed off into what looked so much like certain death. This is the most heroic thing that many Americans have ever seen, certainly for me. And while the film succeeds at telling these stories and at moving the audience (really, the 9-11 attacks are so engrained in the American mind that it's impossible not to be moved), although it is definitely guilty of trumping up the Hollywood bravado to an almost unbearable degree at times.Because of this, a lot of the movie comes across as contrived, which is too bad, because when you watch something as important to America as this, you don't want to ever feel like you're looking at a sound stage, you don't ever want to feel like you can sense the crew standing just a few feet away from the action on screen, sipping nonfat caramel macchiattoes and flipping through the latest shooting script, wondering if they can squeeze in any more heroic one liners. But you can here. A lot.There has been some talk about the irony of Oliver Stone, not exactly popular with the conservative crowd, making a film that is described by many right-wingers as the most ""pro- American, pro-family, pro-faith, pro-male, flag-waving, God Bless America films you will ever see."" It also mentions a connection between the attacks to the war in Iraq. I had been under the impression that such a connection had long since been discredited, but no matter.It is a difficult situation that the two main characters are trapped and almost completely unable to move for about half the movie, and it's unfortunate that, to keep the action moving, we see some of those deadpan emotional flashbacks of the guys with their wives and kids, which just strikes me as something that should never be in a film like this, if only because it is such weak screen writing. Remember that slow motion scene in Top Gun showing Goose with his wife and kid? They may as well add a subtitle saying he's gonna die soon.There is another film about the 9-11 attacks, United 93, which is vastly superior to this one. It has been criticized for having too little emotion which, interestingly, is exactly what this movie needed. The emotions involved with the September 11th attacks are strong and universal, we don't need a movie to hold our hand and lead us through them. United 93 succeeded because it presented the facts in an almost documentary style, allowing the audience to feel their own emotions. Not this movie, and it's too bad.There is one rather bizarre looking character, Dave Karnes (based on a real man), who saw the attacks on TV and immediately knew that the country was at war. He rushed to Ground Zero and managed to help the two heroes escape from the rubble, and then the film closes with a title card that mentions that he went on to serve two tours of duty in Iraq. Nothing is mentioned about the fact that Iraq was not involved in the attacks, but the focus is on the patriotism, not fighting the right battle.Stone has been justifiably criticized for this connection, similar to the conspiracy theories that he presented in JFK. I'm normally a big fan, but this goes down as one of the great many movies that SHOULD have been a great, important American film, and just isn't.",4.0,Anonymous,History

I am not trying to spoil nor make bad comments about the movie because it was great and long overdue, but if anyone is reprimanded I think it should be the people who did the research. I commend Mr. Thomas and all the others who helped in this tragic time and truly wish that this type of movie did not have to be made or will have to ever be repeated.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nicholas Cage:  Where's the NY Accent?!,"Typically, when actors are portraying a real person, they study mannerisms, get the vocal style down, find the individual ""shine"" in the person (as Philip Seymour Hoffmann did masterfully in ""Capote"")...did Nicholas Cage not work with a dialect coach? Did he meet the real John McLoughlin? He couldn't sustain a NY accent to save his life...it was extremely noticeable. When he did try to speak with an accent, it sounded like a bad New England accent....True, this is a Hollywood film, but since the premise of the movie is the real story of two men's lives, couldn't we get a bit closer to being real? Maybe they should have gotten James Gandolfini! In a film where the majority of personality is emitted via conversation (and flashbacks), perhaps authenticity on one level (vocal) is better than authenticity in another (appearance)...we don't know that John McLoughlin is tall and thin with a mustache--but we DO know he was a 21 year Port Authority vet with a NY accent....",4.0,Anonymous,History
Important movie - for finally bashing the Conspiracy Theorists,"As the headline says, this movie is very important.At first when i heard that Oliver Stone was making a movie about 9/11, i was afraid that he would make it into a conspiracy-picture about the weapon-industry planning 9/11, blaming it on the Arabs, so that they could have a war on terror. As Stone had made with his movie ""JFK"", about a conspiracy to kill US President John F. Kennedy. Planned by the weapon-industry, so that they could have a war in Vietnam.But i was relieved when i finally saw this picture to see that there was no conspiracy theory in it. That was good because basically most conspiracy theories about 9/11 are lies - pure lies.A conspiracy theory is not scientific or logic of nature, it is political of nature. That is why they are so dangerous. Especially when people WANT their leaders to be guilty for everything that has gone wrong. So a conspiracy theory basically is the will of the village idiot. So that the village-idiot can feel important. To take the despair of ones own poor life, and projecting on ones leaders - that is the essence of the conspiracy theory. When a conspiracy theorists makes a theory, he starts with the conclusion, then works his/her way from their. Making the evidence fit, or ignoring it, if it contradicts.It is the same with the 9/11-theories. Because their is a large element of political demography in the western countries that are not that well represented in the elections. And that is the conspiracy theorists, which are far-left-winged village-idiots.1) A claim from the Conspiracy Theorists (CT's) is that the Two towers could not have collapsed the way they did. So they have to be brought down by demolition. Fact: these theories are based on 1 guy working in demolition, who said that the collapse of WTC looked like controlled demolition. the CT's have talked about this ever since. Even though that countless of independent demolition experts have stated that it doesn't look exactly like controlled demolition. Because it could have been so many other reasons. The impact of the Boeing 767 damaged the support columns and steel floor trusses, causing an inwards collapse of perimeter columns, which pulled floors straight down. The CT's then claimed that all these many demolition experts, along with 3 levels of American government, Oliver Stone, Paul Greengras and all the Islamic world is part of this massive conspiracy only to fool the American public.2) The CT's claim that WTC7 was also destroyed by demolition. Fact: the backside, facing WTC was heavily damaged by the collapse of WTC, so much of the front was destroyed. Also the the WTC-collapse made the diesel-generators in the basement of WTC7 spill out much diesel, which burned the WTC7 up from the ground. Their are a couple of pictures which show this, but in their self-selected-ignorance the CT's choose to claim that all of these pictures are faked.... Also it would take weeks for people to set charges with that much explosives, also their would be wires everywhere. But it is easy to claim this when you are a CT's. While sitting in their mothers basement making, during the shifts as sales-clerk at the local mall, the make conspiracy theories - based on much science and engineering-skills which they have no idea of what means, but claim that they do. Most CT's are poor excuses of men of Science. They should not be listened to, but it is very dangerous to let them be ignored - their ignorance can spread, if the CT's is allowed to breed. Therefore the CT's should be taught science, math-skills and so on, on every single occasion we can.3) Some CT's claim that the Bush-administration made the F-15 stand down. Because else the planes would be shot down. Fact: the defense of USA is more aimed at defending USA against Russian Fighters. And if there was a hijacking they could be used to shot down these airplanes as well. But the whole air-liner-defense is based on the internal transponders in EVERY SINGLE jet-airliner. The air-jets have these transponders, so that the air-traffic-crews can see where all the hundreds and hundreds planes are around USA, and can see what the airplanes are. What the terrorists did was simple, they simply turned the transponders off. Then the F-15 couldn't identify the exact airliners. The CT's didn't know this, or rather they choose to ignore it. Because CT's WANTS to believe in these theories, even if they have to lie or ignore the reel facts.Conspiracy theories are becoming a religion for these people - it is scary. CT's will never seize to believe i Conspiracy theories, it is their religion. The attack everyone who doesn't believe in them - saying that they are part of this massive conspiracy. CT's wants to keep their prejudges that all Arabs and Muslims are too poor, dumb and joyful to attack USA 9/11.So prove the CT's wrong, watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Unnecessary,"I saw this movie with a free pass, and I'm glad I didn't pay to go watch it. The entire movie is filled with overwrought emotional scenes and, while I realize that September 11, 2001 was, of course, an extremely emotional time, especially at the time - the continual over-emoting of the American media starts to grate after awhile.The police and firefighters who were there, did their jobs and were very brave in the face of having a tragedy no one understood. However, simply being there did not elevate them all to heroes or saints in my book - it proved them to be good men and women who did their jobs, did them well and faced great danger. But while it was a tragedy, and I may be an insensitive jerk for bringing this up - it needs to be let go just a little. Let the people who were there, and who lost loved ones move on.

"If it wasn't for the Content, People would Understand why this Movie isn't Good,","World Trade Center is a very mediocre movie with a decent storyline that is mostly ruined by an uninspired cast. This movie got pretty favourable reviews when it was first released, but I think that is only because it was made so soon after the September 11 attacks, it was giving people pride in watching a movie like this. Watching it today, however, it is clear that it is not a well made movie, the story tries too hard, too often to be uplifting and the actors don't try hard enough, it definitely would have been better if you had stronger actors than Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who deliver all their lines very poorly and show little emotion. 9/11 was a tragic event, one that will never be forgotten and will always be remembered as an very emotional event for both America and the rest of the world, people no longer felt safe and secure in their own towns, and the many deaths that happened that day are simply terrible, it's upsetting just to think about, which is why I find it very disrespectful that a film about it was even made so soon after the events.

Over few days following the attack.And that's the entire movie. Picket fence apple pie American Dream model-looking housewives crying and two men just stuck. In a movie of such disaster and horrible terror attack.For 2 hours. You don't even see any planes crashing. There's just few glimpses of any towers actually coming down. You won't see much of the insane, heroic rescue operation, rapidly changing policy, public reaction, how city was managed during crisis, basically nothing that would really give some insight and flesh to the entire thing. Just two men spitting dust and two women crying. With number of policemen that actually died in the rubble, it'd make better sense to at least portray *their* families or something.... no. Only slightly interesting piece was an ex-marine going to help people on his own.

It was dangerous, stupid and deceitful for the producers to infer that Iraq was involved in the bombings. Iraq had nothing to do with the bombings.

He understands movie magic because it was like the events were actually happening on the day I saw the film around 4:14pm on August 9th, 2006.

It's really disgusting to watch.They ALL sound like they're literally reading off a script right in front of them, as if they're looking at a sign that says ACT SAD - ACT MAD.If you actually feel emotion from these plastic performances, I'm sorry but you're just as pathetic.It's like a film made by student actors. Seriously. Did they just all have only one acting rehearsal and just use the first take? I don't blame solely on all the actors. The director is mainly responsible. It's BAD directing. It's like the director just asked them to act ""SAD"" or scream. It's a total flat play on human emotions.It is like watching a soap drama; if you're into that then maybe you can tolerate this movie. They show Jesus in the film. Are you serious? They try to make everything so over-the-top, but it's just NONSENSE. TRASH.This is an absolute disgrace and disrespect to the innocent people that died on that day. This film comes off more of a mockery. Even if you were to take away the atrocious acting, the chalkboard-screech-screaming annoyance, it's a disgrace they make a story about *WORLD* Trade Center just about two police officers being trapped. It's like nobody else mattered.And please, I respect all the innocent people who tragically died on that day and I will NEVER forget that day. I don't understand why some people think questioning 9/11 and asking for the actual truth (there are still more questions than answers) shows disrespect, when in fact, people who just eat up lies instead are allowing them to die in vain.That being said, films like this spreading TOTAL PROPAGANDA is a greater disrespect to EVERYONE. I understand some people rather live a lie and can't handle the truth -- don't want to hear anything about 9/11 and the word 'conspiracy' going together.HOWEVER, films like this and United 93 is pure PROPAGANDA (maybe it's not so obvious to some of you like it's watching 'Triumph of the Will' but it's happening in current times). Clearly, the cheesy dialogues and scenarios are FABRICATED for more drama/impact and BRAINWASHING the public. The film United 93 is a propaganda done more in a believable way (the ending of that film is definitely intense), but it is still what it is: Propaganda. It's not the first time the US tried to create a fake heroic image (look up Jessica Lynch) and release a movie about it.You don't take FACTS from Hollywood films. It's the LAST place you learn anything. It's just purely entertainment 99% of the time.Are you going to watch Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor and actually believe THAT is what Pearl Harbor was really about? NO. But there's a lot of lazy Americans who don't take the time to really QUESTION, and just eat up information just because it's coming from our own government/TV. That is why those people are referred to as a Sheep. Of course we all take news from the TV when it first happens, I'm not saying that makes one a sheep, but even after all the years and new questions/answers have come out, and people STILL decide to ignore it, then yes, that does make them one.Ask yourself these questions: There's many surveillance cameras around the Pentagon area. They were all confiscated. Why? They cannot prove it. You'll be surprised how many people are ignorant about a third World Trade Center collapsing that day. Why? Because the media didn't want to focus too much on that. It's a major red flag. Buildings do not collapse like that. That is a FACT. ALL evidences show, United 93 and Flight 77, had hardly any pieces on the ground. Plane crashes do not disintegrate and just leave a small hole. EVERYTHING that happened that day was an unusual phenomenon. Give me a break. When was the last time a commercial plane was actually hijacked? FOUR planes successfully hijacked and allowed to be in the cockpit? Not to mention pulling off unthinkable maneuvers at low altitudes that even the most trained pilot would not be able to replicate (I'm talking about Flight 77). What do you all people think about the Bush Administration? They were very trusting weren't they? It's just a sheer coincidence that the Bush Administration's think tank, PNAC, was hoping for a ""A NEW PEARL HARBOR"" an year before? It should be obvious when you add everything together and it doesn't make sense that we had a war in Iraq. Look who really benefited through all this. Watch the film ""Wag the Dog"" instead of this garbage if you still can't understand. It isn't a first time a President lied to America. Did we all forget how strongly Clinton tried to lie to America about his affair? Nixon? Ignorance is bliss.Isn't it convenient how they allegedly kill off Bin Laden and he doesn't stand a trial or anything. The perfect scapegoat, the Boogeyman, came and went that helped both administrations (previous and current) in office. His body is also washed to the sea. Give me a break. So let's brainwash the public into believing this lie even more by having another movie an year later. We'll soon be getting another wide-release propaganda film called ""Zero Dark Thirty"" about Bin Laden. It's obvious from the trailers, it's just another popcorn drama propaganda flick. I wouldn't be surprised that film will brainwash more people about ""finding Bin Laden"".Please start waking up people.

Oliver Stone does it again!,"I saw this movie after seeing Paul Greengrass's movie 'United 93' that came out earlier this year. I wasn't sure what Oliver Stone was going to do.

The portrayal of real American heroes, and leadership left me moved. This movie also left me proud of my American roots.The post-9/11 timing, I feel, can be very tricky if it comes out too early.

Not as good as United 93... but still pretty good,"The second major American film depicting events of 9/11/01. It's greatest crime is that it's not as good as Paul Greengrass' United 93, which was the first. Otherwise, it's a rather good movie that would have been seen as restrained, had it not been for the utterly restrained, documentary-esquire United 93. Yes, in comparison, it does seem overly melodramatic, but it really isn't. The first 35 minutes or so are about as good as United 93. Nicholas Cage and Michael Peña star as two Port Authority police officers who are sent to the World Trade Center after the first tower has been hit by a plane. By the time they arrive, the second plane has hit, but the cops are completely unaware of what is happening. While attempting to transport equipment from WTC 5 to WTC 1 via an underground tunnel, the second tower collapses, killing many of the officers and trapping the survivors under rubble. After WTC 1 collapses, only Cage and Peña are left alive, but pinned down and unable to move. The film's major problem comes in here. Where it's easy to appreciate the horrors of these guys' situation, the film becomes inert. At this point, the focus shifts over to their suffering wives, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. The role of a cop's wife is always a pretty dull one, so you have to give credit to the two actresses for giving the characters at least some personality. And there are a couple of great parts here, too, like when Gyllenhaal has to run to the pharmacy. On the way back, her brother, who is driving, stops at a red light, and she just jumps out of the car and starts walking home. The movie still does lag during this period. One of the officers (Peña) has a vision of Christ, which I'm sure will bother some. It might have been better of Stone not to depict this literally, but I certainly don't begrudge this real person a religious vision, especially in these circumstances. The film picks up again when the two men are discovered by a couple of Marines. My only problem thereafter was a couple of references to revenge, which seems off the focus of the other themes of the picture, and a possible, though probably not purposeful, connection made between 9/11 and Iraq. The musical score, by Craig Armstrong, is surprisingly subtle for the most part (and excellent). I'm not really sure where the acidic criticism comes from. I saw more than one person claim that Oliver Stone had lost his spine on this one. What did you want him to do? Give time to the multitude of moronic conspiracy theories that exist around 9/11? Some of the conspiracy theories concerning JFK are at least somewhat believable. None of the ones surrounding 9/11 are. If Scorsese had directed this picture, the only difference would have been a lot more cutting. And he would be an even more sure thing for the Oscars. Honestly, while not at the level of United 93, World Trade Center is a worthwhile and quite a powerful movie in its own right.",8.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade whatever..,"One would expect some more thoughtful commentary on the 11/9 terrorist attacks from the director of ""Wall Street"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". Instead what we get is some generic melodrama, replete with slow-motion sequences, along with the usual strings accompaniment.There's not much to comment here, the only barely nice scene was the one that showed the policemen buried, with the camera then moving slowly to the top of the ruins. This kind of stuff might be nice to arouse patriotic feeling, but a good film it doesn't make.

The World Trade Center,"Having had an entire American Express office of co-workers and local ""town"" friends killed during 9/11, I was hesitant to see this movie (did NOT see United 93); However, I bucked up and went to an early afternoon show where there was approximately 50-60 people in the theater(unusual for this time of day); At various points throughout the movie, several people ""left"", only to be heard sobbing at the side by the entrance to the screening area...they all came back eventually and instead of going back to their original seats, sat in the front row instead(where I was sitting as well); I was very surprised to see that Oliver Stone actually handled the making of the movie with uncustomary restraint and respect! It basically follows the day of 2 MTA officers who were on the scene by the time the 2nd plane had crashed; I won't go into anymore detail other then to say that the 2 primary characters were numbers 18 and 19 pulled alive out of 20 total and how their individual families/friends dealt with the goings on throughout the day; I wouldn't be surprised if some Academy Awards are contemplated for what I felt was an unusually ""reverent"" handling of a very touchy subject...I give it 9 out of 10 stars and will see it again!",9.0,Anonymous,History
This film is a tragedy!,"There were hoots of laughter in the auditorium during this film. This movie simply fails to connect the watcher to the terrible events of September 11th. This film is slow, dull, and ultimately a bit vomit-inducing.The movie tries hard to 'humanise' the heroes of the day, so that we can really feel for them as the events unfold. We spend too much time learning about their lives, wives, children, family, pets etc. And for nothing: the cardboard acting ensures we develop no empathy with the fallen heroes.The result is two-and-a-bit hours of mind-numbing boredom, with a few hysterical moments of panic that were never meant to be funny. This should have been as emotionally stirring as Schindler's List: I should have left the auditorium weeping into my popcorn.

"Not made on scope, but on point of view","Based on the experiences of two New York police officers who responded to the attack on the World Trade Center and were subsequently trapped in the rubble as the Twin Towers collapsed. Chance for survival seemed slim as they could barely move, but with the help of hope and will power they somehow made it out alive.Oliver Stone's film's been known for their epic scope. From 'Platoon' to more recently 'Alexander' Stone approached his subjects from many sides. There was certain buzz going on before this film's release that it might be similar to Stone's 'JFK' in that it approached a story that many people cannot agree on for what is true and presented a theory about what happened. Here, Oliver Stone abandons all that and focuses on purely the human aspect. The exact how and why is left for whatever you believe and want to believe and that makes for a pleasant relief. Well maybe pleasant isn't the right word as this movie details some terrifying experiences, but it is all through individual people's eyes on what they saw that day. Sure, there are some blurbs that ""they did it"" and ""we gotta nuke 'em the bastards"" but Stone keeps conspiracy theory largely out and the only instances of it are from the distress that day.Also on an interesting note, Stone largely downplays spectacle here. Everything is shown through human eyes, and not just any human eyes, but of our four principle lead characters - McLoughlin, Jimeno, and their wives. The planes hitting the towers is only heard, the tower collapse is shown just from inside the lobby through the frantic eyes and pumping adrenaline of McLoughlin and Jimeno, and it is that and also the omission of an overly patriotic tone that makes this a good survival story. 8/10Rated PG-13 for intense life/death situations",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beneath Contempt,"Why on God's green earth would anyone feel the need to make a movie about 9/11? While I did see United 93, and thought it was TREMENDOUS because there was not 1 shed of ""sensationalism"" in it - The same cannot be said for World Trade Center. The ""scenes"" of people outside the towers crying, screaming, hugging, etc. was offensive. It denegraded the actual event and its unspeakable horror. I could go on, and on, but I am fearful of being cencored and I do not want to insult anyone who has a more personal link to 9/11 than I do. This movie exploited a very dark day in this country. Only if every single penny of proceeds from this movie went to the families of the victims would I feel different...Otherwise, I was disgusted and outraged and I say SHAME ON EVERYONE involved with making this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Weak apology for 'JFK',"It's dramatic when anyone is trapped somewhere, injured and thirsty, and then rescued from slow death in the nick of time by a determined emergency team.And man, does this film know that.'World Trade Center' is not about 9/11 per se. The terrible events of that fateful day provide merely the backdrop for a buried-alive tale of looming death and serendipitous rescue. But it does so almost half-heartedly, like someone telling you a joke with a punch-line he knows will disappoint.We follow the fortunes in this film of two Port Authority beat cops as they get called to the towers that terrible morning, get confused, and then get buried alive in the twisted wreckage of the collapsed skyscrapers.Bless the two real-life heroes whose true story inspired this film. These dudes put their lives on the line to save others. I just wish their story had found its way into a better movie.Michael Pena and Nicholas Cage authentically play the two buried cops and some of their interplay works. But most of the dialogue throughout the film bores us so utterly it seems to curdle as it leaves the actors' very lips. The plot unfolds like a made-for-TV movie replete with dippy scenes of angst and hand-wringing amongst family-members. We meet them AS they come unglued instead of BEFORE they come unglued and then watch dumbly as the holes are filled in with clunky flashback scenes sopping wet with sentiment.Zzz.In an odd little sub-plot that seems like something right out of a recruitment film, the true story of USMC David Karnes is portrayed. Inspired back to active duty by the terror of that day, Karnes suits up, heads to New York, and finds the buried cops almost single-handedly. And if true, bravo indeed. But in the obligatory epilogue, we learn Karnes proceeds to serve two tours of duty in Iraq. Bless all our fighting men, of course, but whatever your politics, watching an Oliver Stone film in which the connection between 9/11 and Iraq goes completely unexamined was unusual to say the least.In 'World Trade Center,' a director who's had a lot to say about recent history and what his generation called ""the establishment,"" we seem to get a film that smacks of a highly public apology to the American mainstream for dumping so much doubt at its doorstep for so long.As amusing as it is to watch my parents' Boomer generation tacitly apologize to their parents' Greatest generation for being so naughty, this disaffected Gen-Xer would have preferred blowing his 9 bucks on a decent movie.This movie review by Erik Gloor",3.0,Anonymous,History

Misses the Mark,"When Hollywood tries to dramatize important and famous historical events, usually the results are mush. This movie is another example of Hollywood mush. 9/11/01 was a day of tragedy. The attack on the United States stunned, shocked, and appalled the American people and indeed people throughout the world. 9/11/01 turned our world upside down and things have never been the same. To accurately capture the feelings of the people on that sad day is a daunting task for the cinematic artist and in trying to achieve this goal this movie misses the mark by a mile. The results simply are flat. The scope of the movie does not capture the overwhelming feeling of collective horror that engulfed the city, the country and the world. 9/11/01 brought the United States literally to a halt. Everything stopped as people, bewildered and stunned, were forced to deal with a tragedy that directly affected every person on this planet. The events of 9/11/01 speak for themselves and require no further dramatization.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The-story-of-two-cops-stuck-under-a-pile-of-rocks,"The dashes in my summary are there to emphasize that this should have been the movie's title. Well, yes, we see some images from the WTC tragedy but 90% of the movie is only about the two cops and their families.If the movie did not have the title ""World Trade Center"" probably nobody would watch it. You remove a few minutes from the beginning and end of the movie and what you are left with is a below average drama with a happy ending. 9/11 was anything but a happy ending.The movie says nothing about the ""why"".

I'm actually very surprised that no one has come forward and put together a spectacle of a motion picture for 9/11. I'm very disappointed Hollywood.

"Flawed, Very Good, But Gets Better and Better","10 August 2006. World Trade Center ultimately redeems itself almost in full by the end of the movie. It is respectful and insightful in its powerful way the last third of the movie is directed and acted. The problem with this movie is the way it gets there. Immediately even with the beginning shot, the focus from Nicholas Cage to general shots of the City is somewhat off balance. The editing especially in the beginning is choppy as several times one scene suddenly stops and another begins without much transition or explanation like the scene of going into the World Trade Center and then the Port Authority cops becoming suddenly suited up. There is also too much explanatory narrative, having to explain to the audience what is happening. Finally the backstory, there isn't any and the primary characters and their relationships to their families are only discovered as the movie unfolds. And the rescue is also somewhat cut short with the first efforts of getting to the trapped cops. But these flaws eventually become secondary by one of the strongest finishes of the movie in recent years.Maggie Gyllenhaal performance stands out as one of the best supporting acting awards of the year. The concept and the opportunity to put on screen this actual event surrounding the trapping of these men and their ordeal was well presented and ultimately compelling on screen as well.

Bravery and Courage,"Oliver Stone reconstructs another epic, this time the tragedy of the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. Stone focuses on two New York policemen who were trapped beneath the debris from the falling buildings. Nicolas Cage does a nice job depicting one of the policemen. The bravery of those who have a family and who choose to survive until rescue is realistically depicted. Certainly, it would be easy to just give up and shoot yourself as one of the other policemen chooses to do. But, winners never quit, and Nicolas Cage shows himself to be a winner. And, it could be easy for America to just give up in the face of the overwhelming malice of Islamic terrorists. But, perhaps it would be better to never quit. Bravery and persistence in the face of evil is the predominant tone of this movie. Stone does a good job also of depicting the charming families of the policemen trapped under the rubble, as they are driven to fear and hysteria and then hope and triumph as they desperately seek information concerning the fates of their loved ones.In regard to the tragedy itself, it would seem that skyscrapers are inherently vulnerable to terrorist attacks because of inadequate fire protection services. A single source water based sprinkler system is clearly inadequate for such multi-story buildings. Much better would be redundant fire protection systems available for these dangerous buildings. For example, an automatic halon fire protection system for each computer system should be required. And, numerous dry fire extinguishers should be available in readily accessible panels on each floor to allow occupants to fight the fires themselves. It was obvious by the numerous fires in this film that destroyed the iron superstructures on each building that not enough fire protection services were available inside the buildings. And, where were the fire fighting helicopters frequently used in fighting huge fires in California this past summer, for example? In other words, the fire fighting effort was clearly inadequate, both in design and execution.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Disaster day,"On September 11th Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno are sent to the WTC when the first plane crashes. As they try to evacuate people, the Towers collapse and McLoughlin and Jimeno are trapped in the debris whilst their fellow officers are killed instantly or die soon after.I expected World Trade Center to be a rescue film as heroic policemen or more accurately Nicolas Cage goes and try to rescue people from the rubble. Not that they themselves are trapped in the rubble with most of the film taking place in the dark as the rest of the film deals in emotional turmoil of their families cross cutting with the trapped policemen in peril with salvation arriving in the form of a religious, zany and rather on the edge Marine who speaks in slogans. We are told at the end of the film that the marine later did two tours of duty in Iraq (a country which by the way had nothing to do with 9/11 but I am sure the way the character is presented in this film gleefully took vengeance on the Iraqi people!)The films is based on a true story and not a tale I knew about as I came to this film with little knowledge of the plot. Oliver Stone is more restrained in his directing style (keep the camera moving is his motto!) and the film does present challenges for Stone.This ranges from his left wing views that is tempered here, to being respectful to the 9/11 events and this true story of the rescue but also the technical challenge of re-enacting the disaster. Obviously they have created a CGI Twin Towers in the establishing shots of New York and then used archive footage of the aftermath of the incident and the Towers with the plot of the film although not successfully integrated.The film conveys the confusion that occurred on that day but pacing is a problem especially when the police team are literally walking to the disaster area and of course when they are later trapped it is then just two guys talking to keep each other going which of course makes the story drag but its also devoid of tension.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Recommended,"As a New Yorker who remembers that day all too vividly, I am reminded of Spielberg's approach to ""Schindler's List"", using the little girl in the red coat to humanize the incomprehensible masses in the tragedy of the holocaust; we can really only absorb one story at a time to even begin to understand large scale loss of life. In this film, Stone accomplishes the impossible by concentrating on two men and their families--instead of trying to portray the full scale of 2,800 lives lost and a city/country changed forever. By avoiding the obvious (only briefly alluding to a shadow of a plane, never showing the complete collapse from the outside) and concentrating on the points of view of the men inside the tower, Stone enables viewers to fully understand the confusion and fear of those on the front lines.The politics of 9/11 can be left for another film and Stone, rightfully, does not explore the causes or subsequent results of that moment in time. Some critics have unfairly emphasized that there is no sustained tension or suspense because we know the outcome. Well, we knew the outcome of ""All the President's Men""--and virtually every Shakespeare play/film--and the impact on the viewer does not suffer when the direction, script, editing and acting are of such a stellar quality. There are many more stories to be told of 9/11, but few will match the humanity, detail, and spirit of this exemplary film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

They contain real footage, excellent reporting of the facts of each hijacked plane, survivor, and non survivor stories, and detailed expert analysis of the damage to the towers, and Pentagon.

The opening act is quite involving and well done, but once it settles into the two main characters just being trapped under rubble, waiting for rescue, it becomes quite dull. Some of the scenes involving those on the outside attempting the rescue aren't bad. Some of the scenes involving those trapped are.Strange movie overall.

In WORLD TRADE CENTER he seems to have taken the opposite stance: take an historic tragedy that affected the entire world and reduce it sown to the entrapment of two Port Authority Police Officers in the rubble of the midline of the two towers destruction in hopes that the event might become more intimate. He manages to just the opposite - he makes a huge horrific tragedy seem like a family crisis and despite casting some fine actors in the roles of actual people, the film falls short of communicating the bigger picture.The film starts well enough with two of the policemen rising early in the Am to go to routine duty, then the unrecognizable 'bump' sound occurs and quite to everyone's disbelief the events of that terrible day unfold in a manner that does indeed convey the complete surprise of a nation of people unfamiliar with terror happening on home ground. The Port Authority Police enter the impending collapse of the towers to save victims only to become quickly trapped in the rubble, reducing their ranks to two men who hold on for survival that finally comes.Nicholas Cage is the sergeant John McLoughlin who is trapped with Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) while John's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Will's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the news of the day and the discovery that their husbands are trapped in the rubble. The long movie is a back and forth interplay between the trapped men and the terror of the families. Where Stone drops his credibility is in focusing on a retired Marine Staff Sergeant Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) who upon hearing of the disaster gets a marine haircut and travels to the spot looking for survivors at night, eventually discovering John and Will and getting help for them to be rescued. That is all well and good, but the film adds the tag line 'We'll avenge the terrorists who did this' that seems like a credo for the irresponsible governmental attack on Iraq. It just takes away the film's energy and makes it a political PR piece. And that is too bad: the other film UNITED 93 is a far superior work in depicting the personal aspect of a national tragedy.

Disgraces the heroes of 9/11,"I used to live in NYC. Not Manhattan, but Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of NYC. Being only 8 years old, the events of 9/11 left me trying to come up with a movie (thank God I was only 8) about my experience of 9/11. I'm sure many Hollywood directors immediately came up with the idea of putting together a 9/11 to make a large profit. Oliver Stone was obviously one of those people, and he did it. But unfortunately, he didn't do it right.The first 15 minutes, I'll let you know, are fantastic. They beautifully detail the men arriving at the WTC. One of the officers even sees a man falling out of the building. So they head in. And once they do, the movie falls apart like leaves.The guys walk through the Twin Towers (yes, walk), making jokes as if nothing has happened. Blood is all around them yet they walk through as if they have no clear mission. Only when the towers collapse do they realize a building getting hit by a massive plane with so many dead is actually serious, but it's too late for them. The officers are crushed beneath the rubble.Their families watch in horror as the buildings fall atop their loved ones. Of course, both families are annoying and one of them has a bratty, spoiled child yelling at his mother. He claims she doesn't care about her husband because she refuses to drive up to the wasteland of Ground Zero, search through many stories of rubble and find her husband. The kid makes me want to assassinate Oliver Stone for making that child say such rubbish.For the longest time, two of the surviving officers, Nicholas Cage and a Hispanic guy that I've never heard of talk, giving inevitable character development. Nicholas' Cage performance is kind of a bore but he still has his moments. The other officer is excellent; he is the lone highlight of the movie.Eventually, the corniest cornball of military cornballs decides to help search through the rubble, finally shedding light on the two buried officers. It is really painful watching this guy, it's like watching a Power Ranger in 9/11.The only positive note after those first 15 minutes and the Hispanic officer is the lines ""He's coughing up rocks"", which shows that the movie at least has sense of realism. But all in all, these things can't save this awful portrayal of the events of 9/11.4.7/10= You'd be better off without it",4.0,Anonymous,History
I knew how cruel the influence except for actual harm was.,"When I was a high school student, I watched this movie. Then I went to a theater with my friend, had an omrice and talked about many things and took photos before watching. Looking back, I shouldn't watch it for enjoyment. It was very serious story.

Better than I had hoped.,"I delayed seeing this because I wasn't sure I was ready.This movie was beautifully done and the performances were superb. I don't care about little factual errors; it would have been just as good if 9/11 had never happened and this had been fictional.It really made me think, as I watched about how precious every day is and how we need to hold onto everything that is so dear because not matter what the circumstance, tragedies happen to all of us and we're never ready and many times wonder what our last words would have been. Life is too short for anger and misunderstandings and this movie reminded me of this. Did I cry; you bet I did and I won't apologize for it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not What It Could've Been,"In my mind, World Trade Center needed to be good. It was coming out only a few months after United 93 came out and there was no way not to compare the two films. Though World Trade Center was a big hit overseas, you can't say the same for it's success in the US. Nicholas Cage plays John McLoughlin who was one of the police officers who went into one of the towers and tried to help to evacuate the building. As the towers fall, McLoughlin, Will Jimeno (played by Micheal Pena)and Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez)are trapped a good 20 feet under the fallen rubble. Unable to move, they must come together and help each other stay alive. The story also focuses on the families of the men. Mario Bello (Donna McLoughlin) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Allison Jimeno) play the men wives. Both women do an outstanding job in their part, especially Bello.I was disappointed by the film. It was, at times, moving but it really slowed down in some parts. Cage and Pena do all they can with the writing while Bello and Gyllenhaal created their own element. I think the big thing that will ruin this film for people is that you know the outcome of the story. Instead of being on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to the families, you find yourself casually slumped in your chair, already knowing the outcome. Overall, I didn't find the film as inspiring as it could have been and wished I had waited for the DVD release.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Emotional, but down right boring.","Whoa...that was really boring. The most interesting events happen in the first 30 minutes and the last 15 minutes. In between, it seems like it was desperate writing to fill the gap. Saying the same things over and over, repeating themes, no real action. It was all just corny dialogue. The movie just seemed to drag forever with nothing happening. The acting was decent, but the flaw is in the original script. This movie is very forgettable. It's only memorable trait is the fact that it's about 9/11. I like slow movies, but this was a flat out yawner. I had to tap my feet just to stay awake. It has about two emotional scenes, but the rest is just back and forth Hallmark card line. See it if you want, but have a back up movie to sneak into. (^_~)",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Awesome Movie, This story has to been seen","Initial skittishly about this movie because of the director (Oliver Stone) I was pleasantly surprised that is simply a story told from the perspective of the Heroic transit cops. I loved this movie, I cried & laughed. You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It's not political, simple story of two transit cop's, their family and the many people involved in there rescue. In the end it portraits both the worst and best humanity has to offer. Brilliant, By far Oliver Stones best work both for what it is and for what it is not. See this movie, You won't be disappointed.

A Poor Outing,"I recently was in the United States and thus decided to take some time out to watch the World Trade Center movie, before making my way back to the United Kingdom.I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a number of reasons. One due to the fact that I am a budding historian, and enjoy films based around true events, that have shaped our lives. 9/11 has definitely had an impact on the way we live and work today. At the same time, one can in some ways not enjoy this film as you would any other, due to the nature of the events that the movie is based on.After seeing United 93, which I thought was a very thought out movie, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I felt that the start of the film was incredibly rushed, and did not really focus enough on what actually happened on that day. The story seemed to really start from the towers collapsing. It would have been more interesting to see more of the time before the towers actually collapsed. This is really the major thing that let this movie down for me, other than that the movie was alright. Nothing special, but alright.However, the impact on this part missing for me was so big that I could not get back into the movie, and did not enjoy watching it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Wasted opportunity,"Not as good as I thought I would be. It was less about the World Trade Center events of September 11th, rather than a story of the Port Authority cops and two who became trapped in the rubble. Some parts of it were good but other parts were boring, and the boring parts far outweighed the good parts. For anyone directly affected by the events of that day, it will probably have special significance and meaning, but to me it was far short of what this movie could have been. In comparison I felt 'United 93' was a far superior movie and the opportunity this movie could have taken to pay homage to those who perished on that day was wasted. It is difficult to make a great movie about such tragic events, especially when so many of those directly affected are still alive to judge the movie, but this was just a rescue movie based on two or three characters, when it could have so easily been a great tribute to all those who perished, survived, and gave of themselves on that day and the days shortly thereafter. The typical US hero-achieves-against-outstanding-odds-complete-with-stirring-music didn't endear me to the movie either - the opportunity to real make a fitting memorial to all affected was lost, and that saddens me. Five out of 10 because it was still a good story and because Nick Cage is one of my favorite actors, but I wouldn't recommend it, and wouldn't watch it again.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Every single day these fire fighters and police men risk their lives along with doctors and nurses who are on the front lines. It brings you the viewer into that dark place that they were both stuck in and leaves you feeling almost as suffocated and helpless. It makes you impatient with the outcome as the people who were family members waiting for answers when there were none.

A human story that must be told and must be seen,"The only thing that made me hesitate about seeing this movie was the director - whom I love, but I wasn't ready to have any type of political opinions or statements presented to me in this movie - it just would have been so disrespectful. What I witnessed instead was a deeply tragic, gut wrenching yet beautiful human story. I out-loud cried more than once, and the pin drop silence in the theater was only broken by sobs & sniffles throughout. Anyone who loves their country and was remotely saddened on Sept 11, 2001 will find this movie a must see. I hate to admit that I have not forgotten 9/11, but have forgotten the brutality and the horror but mostly the human story of that Tuesday five years ago. Let me tell you this movie brought it back loud and clear. The movie relentlessly depicted the uncommon valor of that special breed of men - the firefighters, police officers, rescue personnel & military who are willing to lay down their lives for their brothers. But it also showed the fear and hesitation of the same men - it was real - as real as it gets. Mixed in with the waiting and frustrated family - who suddenly realized & must have felt guilty that thousands of other families were suffering as they were all at the same time...this was depicted so starkly. It was a deeply personal and private experience to view the movie, even though I was surrounded by dozens & dozens of people.Please see this movie - and thank you, Mr. Stone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Skip this one and see United 93,"First off, let me say I have nothing but admiration for the policeman, fireman, port authority, and civilians who lost their life during this tragic event.However, I do not feel this movie serves them Justice. Maybe Stone was trying to be so cautious not to offend anyone that the movie became watered down.This movie has the same feel of the made for TV movie about the Nothern California earthquake with people trapped under debris.I cant fault the movie for not being ""exciting"" because of the circumstances but it I felt no emotional impact from the movie. It felt fake and staged.My recommendation is to see United 93 which is an extremely powerful and while depressing movie, it is also uplifting in depicting the bravery of the doomed passengers on that flight.I gave this movie a 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A big budget bum of a movie,"Right away, this film is too soon after the event, too sensitive and politically straight-jacketed to be able to give a proper objective take on the subject matter.The first few scenes/minutes of the film seemed incredibly stilted, with the actors not really knowing what they should be doing, let alone portraying characters who didn't know what they were supposed to be doing. Nicholas cage tells everyone to focus, whilst at the same time loading up a large trolley with about 300 kilos of equipment in a building where there are no lifts! There didn't seem to be the environment of emergency when the guys were wandering around the foot of the towers. You could see chaos but it seemed to be a long way away and they seemed detached from it. Maybe this was intentional but it did take away some of the drama of the first 15 minutes of the film. Just as soon as some action started, action that you knew was just around the corner and palpable, the film seemed to come to a standstill.Of course trying to act your arse off whilst lying down, barely visible and covered in tons of material is tough. The acting though I don't think was in question except possibly for Cage's typically American gung ho statements whilst he rallied his half dead troops. It seemed to me that the whole film could have been 40 minutes shorter, a lot of the banter was just painting by numbers: the obvious longing for their partners, visions of times gone by etc. It was all very predictable and offered nothing new on that front.Whilst not quite as saccharine as Pearl Harbour, there was that Americanisation of the subject that painted everyone in some kind of heroic light, from the main characters right down to the children, ready to drive into ground zero and start digging. It was over egged in my opinion.They prayed to God yet did no one consider the possibility that it would have been easier for God to have flipped the terrorists wrist and cause the plane to crash into New York harbour than to see 3000 die and a handful live? Whilst they are constantly praying to the same God to save them. Was God having a huge joke with the Americans that day? Do Americans think they have a Monopoly on Gods actions for the good of their own patriotic humanity? A huge quandary ignored by the scriptwriters.There was much about the event I felt should have been included that would have added more weight, yet avoided schmaltz. Not least a tip of the hat to the many that didn't get a positive outcome that day. The CGI was seamless, it could have been shot on the day it was that realistic. However, I couldn't help but think the whole thing was just missing something and as I said, felt like it was treading on eggshells regarding the real horrors of the events.I couldn't say I enjoyed the movie. Let's let someone else have a proper go when the wounds have healed and the conspiracy theories have died down.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointment,"Unlike other movies from Oliver Stone, this one is a movie which I'd rather forget. Only the fact you make a movie of one of the worst nightmares of America, doesn't mean the movie is good. This movie is too flat. Even the movie is only about two policemen, you never get to know them well. Everything is so predictable and too slow. It doesn't take you by your hart considering it is about 9/11, It shouldn't be to difficult. Carnes is the only person in the movie who gives it a blast. The movie is too soft with no time for showing the real horror which took place in the WTC. Cage had to be under the WTC too soon. You never get any details of the world trade center.

Incorrect information given about Marine who found PAPD,"I believe that once again producers/directors have altered and belittled blacks who have done something exceptional. The Marine, Sergeant Karnes, is a man of color...not a Caucasian as depicted in this movie. Sgt. Karnes was, and is an exceptional man, who went into an extremely dangerous situation because he was a Marine and an American who believed that he was supposed to help...even when he had not been ordered to by his government. He answered to a much higher power, and as a result, two men who might have died are now alive. If this movie is supposed to be an accurate depiction of what happened on September 11, 2000, then the director, Oliver Stone, should have made sure of the facts surrounding the man who located, and was the main reason for the rescue of the two men. And in answer to any question(s) about my ethnicity; I am a woman who is Caucasian and from the deep heart south who believes that a person who shows that much heroism should be portrayed accurately. After all, President Bush managed to get it right...why can't Hollywood's elitist paragons of propaganda get it right?

WTC: A Blockbuster Guilt Trip?,"We all know that the World Trade Center incident was a tragic event. Fortunately, having not lost anyone I cannot truly empathize with anyone and while I am sympathetic toward the message this film intends to portray, I personally believe that the tragic loss of life is not something we need to be reminded of.I understand that this movie does not put emphasis on this, that it does so on the points of courage and freedom, the strength of the human spirit and I appreciate that. However, I feel that this movie, more so than anything else, plays on the emotions of us Americans for success. My fear is that this production will generate revenue based on sympathy, that it will sort of guilt trip us all into seeing it rather than it reeling us in by being a great movie in its own right. I cannot say for certain what the intentions of the cast and crew are, whether the director wanted to make a film to inspire and strengthen us or to play on an emotionally turbulent country to fill his pockets.I do not intend to degrade the meaning of the film. I just do know that its in human nature to be greedy. I'm hoping that this is not the case. I'm just afraid that this movie intends to guilt-trip us into seeing it and turning out to be an over-dramatized hollywoodized film like Pearl Harbor.

When I discovered the story deals with two firemen escapees, my interest goes down because his legendary punch would be gone.Now, watching the movie, my deception is even bigger. The tragedy is lived from two very personal point of view, so the big scope of this tragic day is left behind: you barely see the twin towers, the planes, the falls, the fires, the dust fog and the pain of thousandsWorst, you got a collection of ""holes"", that is the escapees in the darkness unable to move.

Oliver Stone's worst film,"Olivier Stone has outdone himself. I said that Nixon was the worst film he had ever made, but this dull, sloppy, boring mess of a fillm takes the cake as the worst dog of a film he has ever made.

And the script is so bad it reduced the audience I watched this with to unintentional laughter on two occasions. The heroes and memory of the people who died on September 11 deseve a better film than this waste of time. United 93 was a very good analysis of that event, and this film is not in its league at all.

Truly disappointed,"Whatever happened to the critical Oliver Stone? I was expecting a movie that would make people think about what brought this tragedy upon people of the U.S., in the way Platoon or Born on the 4th of July questioned what the US was doing in Vietnam.I also was expecting WTC would give us an opportunity to listen to voices that are not represented in mainstream media.Instead, we got more of the same. It was more like an extended episode of 60 minutes.Also, Stone shows an unusual revengeful facet that unsuccessfully attempts to provide arguments for the tragedies that the US has imposed to the world on the basis of a war against terror.There are indeed traits in this movie that prove once again Stone's craftsmanship, but that is not the main motivation to go see one of his movies.I would think that if it was still not time to present critical views of the 9/11 tragedy, then it was not time for a Stone movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History

A little too long ...,"I have watched true-story disaster survival stories on the Discovery / Nat. Geo. channels and am familiar with many of the amazing acts of heroism surrounding 9/11 event. A wonderful aspect of this movie is about showing America at its best after such a horrible tragedy. This being said however, the movie just didn't work for me.Many of the scenes involving the family seemed unnecessarily stretched out. Horrific as the situations involving the main characters were, their scenes seemed a bit repetitive and again, drawn out. This movie was more 'situational' - not much happened in this movie as far as action. The disaster effects were pretty minimal. I was surprised that the whole movie seemed to have a low-budget feel - a surprise given the talent involved.I did like seeing their reproduction of the ground-level area of one of the WTC buildings. Seeing the shops and modern structures gave me a greater insight / feel of what it was like to actually be there. Also amazing was to see what was going on in the lobby/ground level. It almost seemed like a 'safe zone' for those coming from above. I also liked learning of the determination and 'can-do' attitude of the US Marines character.Overall, I think this movie could have been made much better. It's a tough one though - sensitive subject matter, so perhaps it ended up being what it was due to an over-focus on just one situation at the cost of avoiding everything else.

Stone's best sinc Platoon,"I have to say, Oliver Stone surprised me. Politics were left aside. Grand standing was left aside. This is an incredible delicate and inspiring movie.Stone aptly recaptures many of the moments burned into our minds. The paper filled air and streets. Soot and ash covered survivors and rescue workers. Exhausted rescuers. They are all here and handled with class and dignity.I was worried that Stone would use this movie, this event, for his own political ideals. But instead he has respectfully paid homage to but one of the heroic and inspirational stories that came out of the 9/11 tragedy. All actors, across the board, are to be applauded for their performance. This could have easily become a soap opera.When the movie quietly ended, as the final update to the story flashed on the screen and the names of the port authority's finest that didn't make it home that day scrolled, the theater was deathly silent.

It's not like they don't have millions upon millions of dollars to make movies. I really don't think it will hurt them much to do so.,,Anonymous,History

Very Disappointing,"Not what I expected at all, basically the movie was about 2 guys trapped, their wives not knowing weather they were dead or alive, then they were found under the rubble, wives notified, lived happily ever after. Wont Buy It On DVD Or See It Again. They could have involved more with the time line leading up to the events. More footage of the plane crashes, and involved the Pentagon more. Unless I am mistaken about what the film was suppose to be focused on. I hated it. My partner thought it was good. But if your going to make a movie about the WTC, then it should involved all facts and events that took place on 9/11, Not just 2 police officers and their family's. I am sure there will be more movies released about the WTC in the future. But one needs to be done in a correct manner.",3.0,Anonymous,History
An accurate and wonderful portrayal of courage,"There were many who worried that Oliver Stone was going to weave a twisted tale about 9/11 with this movie, given their view of some of his past work. I can assure you it is anything but that. It is a fitting tribute to the rescue workers who did their job, and risked everything to save innocent lives. It will remind you of how you felt when 9/11 happened. Personally I think this is a valuable service to all of us, but there will be those who do not wish to be reminded, and they should not watch this movie. I do not recommend it for children, as it viscerally portrays death and destruction, and horrific moments. It is not gratuitous though.The movie is mainly about two Port Authority officers who go in attempting to rescue people in the first World Trade tower that was hit, and the families of these officers. A group of Port Authority officers join them to go into the building, but they are killed when the tower they have entered collapses. The movie mainly focuses on what the two officers who survive the collapse, and their families, go through emotionally. The two officers are trapped under a mountain of steel and concrete. They re-evaluate their lives in small and large ways. The way that the movie truly captures how most of us felt that day is it shows the miracle of 9/11. The experience brought us closer together than we ever would have thought. Where our hearts were usually closed off, due to the hubbub of daily life, they were opened to each other.The movie also portrays the good spirit of public servants and citizens who came from across the country to help. It shows police officers from other states, a marine, and a paramedic, who answer their own inner call to duty, coming to the World Trade Center site to help with the clean-up and rescue. It also shows their devotion to family and their willingness to risk it all to save lives. The marine is portrayed as a Christian, and surprisingly Stone does not disparage this, but honors it.I say bravo to Oliver Stone, Nicholas Cage, and the other actors in this movie. You have done a public service. You have honored and respected the work and the memory of those who risked and in many cases paid the ultimate sacrifice to try to save lives.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Feel Good 9/11? I Think Not.,"World Trade Center is the second 9/11 themed movie to be released in the wake of America's worst catastrophe and the first, Paul Greengrass's United 93, set the bar pretty high. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is everything that United 93 is not. A big, polished, Hollywood picture filled with Tinseltown superstars; an emotionally manipulative monster that drags its audience down into the pits of hell and never really brings them back out again. United 93 left viewers angry and resolute; hardened into terrorism fighting steel. Stone's movie abandons its audience to quiet, miserable despair.The film is based on the real life stories of two Port Authority police officers pulled from the buildings' rubble after their collapse. Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and rookie officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) are part of a team of first responders, and bravely they rush into Tower One to do their job. They're in the lobby of the building when millions of tons of steel and concrete comes crashing down on them. McLoughlin somehow has the presence of mind to use the two or three seconds they have left to lead his men through the tornado of falling death toward the building's elevator shaft, knowing it's the center of the building and their best chance to live. The world goes black, and when McLoughlin and Jimeno wake up they're buried under 20 feet of burning rubble. Somehow they've survived, but they're pinned under wreckage. Injured, suffering, and slowly bleeding to death they lay there together hoping for a chance at life.Dave Karnes, this is the man the film should have been based on, that way it would have been a lot more, pleasing.Stone's take on the World Trade Center attack is at first remarkably restrained. He never shows the planes hitting the buildings, only their shadows passing over confused New Yorkers. He doesn't indulge in the spectacle of the towers' collapse, instead he shows them from the inside as they heave onto the heads of doomed rescuers who themselves have no idea what's happened. The best parts of the film are an exercise in extreme claustrophobia, watching two men trapped and struggling to keep awake in the pits of a man made hell.Is this a well made film? Yes. Perhaps more importantly, with a couple of exceptions, it's a respectful one. Yet unless you like feeling lost and hopeless, there's just no good reason to watch World Trade Center.To Sum up, This film is 129 min of pain, it shows two men, under tons amount of rubble for....129 minutes.... Will they survie? I'm sure you know the answer to that. Don't watch this film.",1.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade Center it's a bad title for Survivors of this tragedy,"If the Director wanted give up a Tribute for the survivor of Word Trade Center, He should change the name of the movie.

Just terrible.You know what's coming: A film titled ""World Trade Center"" should be a sensitive, impartial and courageous portrayal of the horrid events of that day. What did we get? A formulaic disaster/rescue script with Hallmark dialog, cheesy acting and (yawn) total predictability. While I wouldn't really expect such maudlin drivel from Stone, I'm not really surprised. There is a big swatch of population all set to open their wallets for such opportunistic sentimentality. Mr. Stone couldn't resist. Maybe he even had orders.So, a missed opportunity. Somebody else is going to have to make the *real* WTC film, but they'll have to call it some other name, else it will get confused with this uninspiring piece of dung. Personally, I think they should leave it alone; I can't think of who we have that might make said film without resorting to said maudlin plot devices. Might be best to just leave it be. But if you haven't seen this garbage yet, then don't bother. If you must, then first inquire as to whether any profits from it went to families bereaved by the disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful drama.,"I don't rush to see Oliver Stone films, but this is a masterpiece. This is a well-directed, well-acted, well-set designed, well-scored, etc, motion picture. Every production element comes together and the first fifteen to twenty minutes are nerve wracking! You know what's about to happen, but yet dread knowing! There is excellent and powerful drama at work here, a must-see! This exceptional film is the anti-""9/11 Farenheit"". Stone should be Oscar-nominated, as well as, the actors, but for Gyllenhaal who just isn't believable ... but you overlook her performance because Bello and the rest of the cast excel. America is a place in everyone's heart, and that the same director of ""JFK"" and the bombastic ""Alexander"" directed this work is a testament to his talent.",,Anonymous,History
A very small part,"This film was a total disappointment. It went in a pretty decent direction at first, and than we have to see 2 guys in a freaking hole the rest of the movie. I am sure the audiences wanted to see a lot of things that happened during the event of 9/11 but you don't get that at all. You basically get a little piece of the big picture. It felt like the film was made to strike into the inner emotions of people to trick them into seeing this dull film with two guys talking about painfully boring stuff. I am not a fan of Oliver Stone and think he is a boring director with no soul, but this is taking to another level of boredom. This felt like a waste of time, when I am pretty sure the audience wanted to see more depth in the incident. Some may like it and cry for it, but most importantly buy this drivel, cause they may think it's the right thing to do. The only thing this film did was it got people emotional since it's a event that a lot of people feel close to. It was in no way a compelling film. I give it a 4 out of 10 since I have seen worst films. Now some over the top patriotic people or rednecks that maybe reading this may bash on me and say stuff along the lines of ""You hate America!"" nope, I feel bad for the victims and respect the people that tried to save lives during the incident, I just hate bad film making. Now I give this film a 4 out of some patriotism cause I personally think the film deserves a lower score.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History
Great and Very Emotional in every second,"With all the controversy surrounding this movie, I figured Id go and see the movie for myself and have my own point of view on what this movie is really like. First things first, this movie is not mostly focused on everything we have seen in the media, and everything that is already stuck in our heads, but instead, this movie brings out a whole new perspective to us, of what two port authority officers went through while being stuck in the debris. You learn new things about the disaster in this movie about things that they really never broadcasted in the media. Overall, I think this movie was absolutely phenomenal, but being from New York, it was a bit difficult for me to watch this movie, the entire theater was in tears, and at times I just couldn't control my emotions.......and I'm a 6'2, 240 lbs guy who never cries during movies. So to straighten up all the commotion with the media, I feel this movie is necessary for the public to see exactly what went on in the eyes of our heroes, however, this movie came out just a little too fast, especially for those who may still have the pain in their hearts, this movie is just a constant reminder.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Terrifying and Beautiful, Stone's Cinematic Tribute is A Bold and Exacting Momument to Heroism...In Every Form","I loved this movie- I have to say, and it wasn't because I wanted to love it. Rather, I went into the theater with very low expectations, thinking Hollywood, thinking exploitation, thinking miscast and misdirected intentions, but still wanting to see how it all turned out. And I was very, very surprised and very, very happy I did, because Mr. Stone has redeemed what has been (of late) an extremely disappointing and dissipating career. With bold cinematic candor and haunting artistic eloquence, Stone reminds us of the evil in our world, and what we can do about fighting it and replacing it with love. By remembering heroes and courage, Stone has crafted what just may be the finest film released this summer. And most importantly, ""World Trade Center"" reminds us how art- especially film- can create lasting testaments to the power of the human spirit to overcome obstacles and ultimately triumph.",,Anonymous,History
OK but not that great,"Having experienced all the events of 911 from the first moment it began, I can say this movie was a great disappointment for me. It did evoke a few emotional memories from that awful day but overall it was not what I expected from Oliver Stone. It was not much better than any other average drama. The special effects were convincing enough and yet there still seemed to be something missing. There wasn't enough detail so as to show that there were other people in the general population that were also affected. It seemed to be a story about two men only.I think Oliver Stone is a great director and has many films to add to his achievements but I don't think this is one of them, in comparison. The cast was too small, given the magnitude of the event and all the peoples affected.",3.0,Anonymous,History
It Has It's Moments...,"Well....not what I expected, to say the least. I expected action, I expected drama, I expected to cry and be moved. I expected to see a film that would touch me, move me, and make me proud to be an American.This film did none of those things.It has potential, no doubt about it. In fact, if a great 9/11 movie is ever made, it could easily be one of the best ever made. This film is definitely not a great film. It focused the entire time on two men trapped under the rubble, trying not to ""go to sleep"" and thereby die. The only other stories it worked on were the reactions of their wives, who seemed quite alright about the whole ordeal. No, the wives performances was not very satisfying at all. Maggie Gyllenhaal touched on what could have been a great performance several times, but it seemed obvious the director didn't like that direction. Never did one of them even break down. They almost got there more than once, but never quite reached it.That's basically the whole film: It touched on greatness, occasionally delivering a good scene. Yet it never seemed to take that angle of mourning and sadness that was obviously needed. And in the end, the whole film ends up being a lot like the wive's performances- just not very satisfying.

But I think that the comic relief was overkill...and many members of my audience laughed a bit too much. This wasn't a comedy! The lighthearted dialogue was intentional, but a bit overkill. Overall I think my biggest gripe was the script...it wasn't the best screenplay, but the story was fine, the dialogue was not. I'd rent it...unless you are really anxious.

They should had make it like Titanic, minute by minute before, at the time and after the collision for all WTC buildings. Hollywood spends money and time making movies with spaceships and aliens with many effects, and can't make a film based on reality? I had spent many hours looking around the internet for witnesses stories and i have found many things, such as: the jet fuel went into the elevator shafts causing explosions on lobby level, many people killed into the elevators because they had installed door restrictors on the elevator doors and the people trapped inside until the towers collapsed, the explosion was so strong and marbles felled down in the concourse level, warden telephones were activated on floors 64,71,73,93,74,(tower 2), the fire alarm system indicated at many floors fire and trouble, and many other details which i believed that they will show them to the movie and they did nothing. If Hollywood use all these witnesses details could make an awesome movie.

Great movie,Every American should see this movie and always remember 9/11/01 and what was done to this country and how our lives have changed forever. It makes you feel like you are at Ground Zero when the attacks happened. Excellent job on portraying what it is like for the first responders and how they go in to help when others are running away. Great job by Cage and all of the actors as well as oliver Stone. Remember how care free we were before? This is a movie that everyone should see and should be shown every year on the anniversary to high school students. It is almost five years and I feel it was the perfect time to release the movie because many of us have forgotten or at least put the day behind us. And the day should always be in the front of our minds. Just go to NY (if you ever were there and saw the towers)and look at the skyline and you feel it deep down inside.

September 11 Receives Small Movie Treatment,"Definitely NOT the definitive movie implied by the title, but a fine movie giving instead a very narrow focus which concentrates on two police officers, their families, friends, co-workers, rescuers.

Not as good as United 93, nonetheless both films are works to be proud of.

Perhaps if they had come at it from another direction/scenario, but to show 2 policemen buried in rubble who we could hardly see and who we knew would be rescued was not exactly riveting. After all the real policemen have done the TV talk show circuit and Oprah.What is also irritating is using so many 'stars' in any one movie. A cast of complete unknowns would have worked better here because frankly I find myself cringing at Nick's mustache or his dye job or his accent or his not even trying to be a character...he's just Nick Cage acting like Nick Cage.The women faired better simply because they could move around and we could actually see their emotions. But again their parts were typical for a TV movie...but wait isn't Maria Bello from A History of Violence and her eyes?...are they really blue? Darn!

Oh wait they're getting rescued.And the one black doctor at the hospital is someone I've seen before and also one of the rescuers is ...my God it's Stephen Dorff with a mustache.Yes this is definitely a heartfelt theme and I'm sure that someday someone will make a good picture about it.

Something We Didn't Need,"Is it even possible, after the suffering, relentless media coverage and two ensuing wars to take a bit of distance and consider 9/11 without all of its symbolisms? If we do, we have a sequence of events. The hijack. the crash. The collapse. the grief... We can try to look at events in a broader context, what triggered them, but then things get politicized at an alarming speed.On 9/11, about 3000 innocent people died. This is a tragedy. as a statistic it pales in comparison to many places on this planet on any given day, yet our media amplified it and created a legend out of it. CNN, FOX and company have milked all the melodrama out of this human tragedy, and now in 2006 we have 2 films to commemorate it. That raises an important question: do these filmmakers think us so stupid as to need a reminder so soon? The only way to make this worthwhile is if the film seeks to understand these events.Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" offered a clinical observation of the hijacking and its emotionless precision made for more effective cinema, delivering raw, humbling reality when television had drowned us in melodrama, hyperbole and crassness. He gave 9/11 a sense of reality and a humanity which it had lost.Oliver Stone, unfortunately, goes to the other extreme. His tale of two firefighters trapped under the debris may be based on reality, it never feels real. Going for a more austere style than he is used to, Stone inter-cuts the plight of these men with the anguish of their wives. It is an attempt to pay tribute, but, given the massive significance of the surrounding events, you can't shake the nasty feeling that said tragedy is being exploited to wring more tears out of you.Stone's worst traits come out in the form of forced foreshadowing and symbolism, particularly an oft-mocked instance where Jesus brings water to a dehydrated fireman. Coming from the man who gave us JFK, Nixon and Bon on the Fourth of July, this is not just disappointing, but downright baffling: given how politically-charged this tragedy was, one might have expected Stone to question the media-version of events, tying American imperialism and the enemy's religious fanaticism to attacks on home soil and the resulting suffering of the innocent... But there's never even a hint of such thought. All we get is more salt in a barely cauterized wound.The symbolic significance of 9/11 crushes the film's characters and story, dooming it to only arouse emotion in those who have lost loved ones, or by playing on the national feeling associated with the event. Neither of these qualifies World Trade Center as a good film.This offensive garbage is everything we didn't need or want from a 9/11-inspired film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

I was expecting myself to be tearing up and not being able to hold back the tears and i really wasn't. It became clear that they also wanted to show something about humanity and how when bad times come people always come together - yes this is right however it really wasn't shown much in the film, at the end yes but not consistent the way through.I will commend the actors; I thought they did it as realistically as they possibly could, which was the only spark to this film along with the music, even though a bit repetitive.I'm next going to watch Flight 93 (i think it's called that) and see if this truly pays credit to 9/11.

Dull story of survival,"This by-the-book TV-style movie (with no swearing or gore) was clearly Oliver Stone's attempt to repair his reputation after the disaster of ""Alexander."" Gone are the kooky camera angles, terrible acting, character assassination, crazy editing, and bizarre music choices from his previous films. This a movie that anyone could have directed. As one reviewer put it, if Stone didn't make this movie, someone else would have. Michael Pena is really the star, not Nicolas Cage. I never saw the appeal of the chubby, unimpressive Pena. I suppose he has an everyman look that gets him cast in movie after movie as a supporting character. The film is dull as Cage and Pena lie trapped under rubble for the majority of the running time. The flashbacks to their life before 9/11 are clichéd and pedestrian. 9/11 is depressing material to make a film out of, so I can't see many people enjoying this. It's not Stone's worst film, but it's not something that I would recommend. 2/5.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Stone's Most Inert Movie, and Maybe That's a Good Thing","I suppose this movie, ""World Trade Center,"" is preferable to the picture I was afraid renowned conspiracy-theorist crank and sometimes great filmmaker Oliver Stone was going to make out of the tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Y'know, something along the lines of ""JFK"" (1991) magical bullets and LBJ and Nixon winking at each other as they oversee the CIA shaking hands with Castro upon a split-payment agreement to the mob, or some such nonsense, but with the oxymoronic ""truthers"" this time. Weird that, as far as I know, it wasn't until Spike Lee's recent HBO series, which I haven't seen, that a mainstream filmmaker included that sort of garbage, reportedly and for which the early-screening backlash resulted in re-editing. When any fool with editing software can make something as atrocious as ""Loose Change"" (2005 and revisions in 2006, 2007, etc., because it's hard to lie consistently and convincingly for one of the most well-documented catastrophes in history), perhaps such an approach loses its appeal.For a Stone movie, then, the results here are even more shocking; he made an utterly conventional picture that reduces an event of global and lasting significance--its consequences being felt to this day, nearly 20 years later--to a personal drama of TV-movie levels of insight and quality, or lack thereof. The closest we're offered of a larger picture is the gung-ho platitudes from Michael Shannon's marine. I read someone else state that the picture could've worked just as well as a narrative about miners stuck in a collapsed mine--it's that generic--and they're right. The mawkish musical score is awful--something one would expect from a Hallmark of Lifetime original. Ditto the placid flashbacks. And, the vision of Jesus with a water bottle is bad enough, but Nicholas Cage's officer arguing over kitchen remodeling with the vision of his wife, as played by Maria Bello, was the last straw. That scene was an emotionally powerful one on its own before that, as a crew is working on getting him out of the rubble, but this delusion brings that dramatic buildup to a screeching halt. What a waste of a talented cast, too, which besides Cage, Bello and Shannon, includes Michael Peña and even Viola Davis in a superfluous bit part. Remember how she stole the show with a likewise small role in ""Doubt"" (2008)? That doesn't happen here. Maggie Gyllenhaal probably does the best, frantically walking about pregnant, but it's hardly enough to make a difference.Even the effects and production values, as with the drama overall, rely heavily upon and are undermatched for what we saw on TV that day. Catching bits of the TV news replayed here was more impactful than anything Stone adds. Sure, maybe some of Stone and company's dramatics affected me, too, but it tends to feel cheap and manipulative by comparison. Too bad, especially because Paul Greengrass had already demonstrated how to approach this sensitive, and at the time still very raw, material, with ""United 93"" (2006), but Stone doesn't do docudrama. Heck, even his idea of a documentary is to allow dictators to lie to him. I suppose we should just count our blessings that Stone played this one straight and despite that even in that he'll take it too far.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Don't miss the point.,"This movie was about 9/11, but much more, it was about people. It never mentioned the deep causes, but it focused on two families. If you saw Shindlers List, one little girl was painted frame by frame to humanize something that can't be totally understand. We don't have any conception of 6 million, but we can relate to one little girl. In this story, almost 3000 never came home. We can't imagine that, but we can understand two men, two families, and the four or five people who represented so many others. How many former military men re-upped that day? How many very competent 911 operators just got it wrong that day? How many Americans just knew they had to go to New York that day? (My son did. He got on a bus and went to do anything.)Did an addict, a former paramedic really help, and change his life?

It shows how terrifying it is to be in the same area during the events and the horrors of it. But the actual plot focus on officer being trapped under the destroyed towers and the family worry about them. It's terrifying to be trapped under the wreckage and hoping that they will survive. As for the family worrying about them, it does shows some emotional with them hoping that they will be found and contains great performances. I felt it focuses too much in the movie and it gets repetitive with them saying the same thing throughout the movie.

There is none of his movies that I don't adore, and I wait his movies like those two heroic cops were waiting to be rescued in the movie. The 9/11 events were a real devastating disaster. I'm not sorry or sad about the buildings or the expenses, but I am truly sorry about those three thousand people died in there. It was really hard and unbearable to kill people massively this way. I really don't believe how would somebody plan to this and then do it.On the other hand, I don't think it was devastating for Americans only, but it was also to the whole world. In the name of the 9/11 events the American administration killed thousands of people and destroyed two countries and there are lots still to come. The film didn't mention anything about who did it or who is responsible - that is a good thing about the film I believe since it didn't politicallize the events. But the film was actually boring, and it was nothing like what you expect from Oliver Stone. The film could be deeper, or at least more moving, if it (the film) spoke of more important things in the events. It's not enough, not enough at all to show those two brave guys in their situation. I think there is much to be said about the 9/11 and of course I'm not asking Mr. Stone to say it all in a film, but I don't think he should picture American establishments as angels and that they have the right to ""revenge"" because they can never revenge anything because of many reasons that we can maybe say in other places, they can only destroy and they can only put their anger on innocent people. Mr. Stone might have meant this film to be a message of love and forgiveness, but it wasn't and I guess all the people saw the film would know why and I also think that Mr. Stone would know why.No doubt that the characters played by Cage and Pena deserve a movie about their braveness and heroism, but not to be done by Oliver Stone, maybe by another director, and if so, he should've done it better - forget the political issues and the questions that 9/11 raised, at least, do it more cleverly, make it a little bit more beautiful and more moving and less boring.After all, I would like to say that Oliver Stone remains for me as the BEST DIRECTOR in the world, and I can say that with confidence although I know Fellini, Tornatore and Goddard and hundreds of names that worked in cinema and made it better. But I still believe that it is Mr. Stone who made cinema different, and that cinema after he started making films was never the same.",3.0,Anonymous,History
It's basically just a telemovie.,"Pretty disappointed that an Oliver Stone film about one of the most memorable events in recent history, can be so plain.Most of the acting is so flat that you'd be forgiven for thinking that the actors were simply rehearsing their lines.If you're looking for something more exciting that covers the events of 9/11, then you should read a newspaper.Honestly, I could go on and on about how basic and formulaic this film is, but I have already wasted two hours of my life by watching it once, and don't have any more time to waste.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Modern Art takes on the tragedy of 9/11,"How do we define the right time to make a motion picture about a recent and terrible tragedy? Was it too early for a cinematic retelling of a real life disaster? Was it in bad taste to recreate the event on celluloid with movie star Nicolas Cage fore fronting it for the box office? Was it an injustice to those who perished on that fateful day of September the 11th, 2001? The real question I asked myself before sitting down to watch the film was; is this just a cynical, manipulative Hollywood heroism feature designed to capitalise on the deaths of thousands of innocent people?The casting of Nicolas Cage in one of the central roles was a foolish move for Oliver Stone, for while he is very good in the part, we cannot forget that this is a real event that is still fresh for many of those who lost someone, and to cast a movie star in the lead is to sell the idea to the public that this was as much about honouring the fallen as it was about ticket sales. This should have been much like ""United 93,"" and cast with relative unknowns. The recognisable faces ultimately takes away from that feeling of reality that Stone brings to much of the horrific visuals recreating, almost unsettlingly, the iconic image of the towers wounded, bleeding and falling. Michael Pena fares much better as his low key, natural performance brings heart and soul to his scenes with Cage, trapped underground in their hellish environment. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello are also brilliant in the roles of the waiting, worrying wives, Gyllenhaal particularly believable as the five month pregnant Allison. Most surprisingly of all is Stephen Dorff playing one of the brave emergency service workers who risked life and limb to save the few who survived amongst the smoke and debris. His performance stands out as the finest in a film overrun with actors thinking that it was the right time for this story to be told.Oliver Stone ditches the conspiracy theories, shockingly doing away with his political ideals in the process and muting any such conjecture surrounding 9/11, although occasionally giving cheeky, yet subtle references to certain inconsistencies of that day, such as the pentagon being hit by a missile, united flight 93 being 'mistaken' for another flight, the way in which the buildings exploded and fell etc. Instead he opts for out and out themes of heroism, courage and the instinct for survival. Even the score for the film is what you would expect, understated melodies that are constantly reaching toward the life affirming.With all of that said, it isn't a bad movie. The second act is where it falls down under the weight of its own melodrama, but the first twenty minutes and last half an hour find some honest moments and moving fragments of life amongst all the dramatic re-enactments. Like two grieving women embracing in an emergency ward, one black, one white, both strangers. The long hospital wall plastered over with the missing posters of loved ones in their thousands. The twisted metal, dusty rubble and rising smoke of ground zero itself. That beautiful bird's eye image of the decimated towers from the air, that grey cloud of smoke and fire reaching into the sky. The sense of unity and empathy so real and powerful between the people of New York is touched upon in the scene where hundreds of emergency service workers form a line over the mountain of rubble to help get these men out, suggesting that the ripple effects from the terrorist attack made them stronger, rather than weaker.It is surprising that in a film by Oliver Stone, although inevitably certain for a film about 9/11, there is a patriotic, flag waving rhetoric disturbingly buried amongst the pieces of shrapnel and concrete along with our two protagonists. The marine who comes back to serve out of a sense that God has asked him to do so doesn't sit well and seems almost designed so he can deliver the uncomfortable line at the end, ""Someone has to avenge what happened here."" Revenge is a less honourable message, and certainly a much less empowering theme than love helps us survive the worst of times, and hope helps bring us together, while disaster turns ordinary people into extraordinary heroes. The religious element is puzzling too. Jesus comes to Michael Pena's character in a hallucinatory dream to offer him water, now are we supposed to buy this as the real deal, or simply a dream? I just found it wholly inappropriate when so many people still ask ""Where was God that Day?"" Apparently he was going around offering water to those who really needed a drink.At bottom World Trade Centre is a well made movie, designed to pull the heart strings. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, it is obvious. It is as you would expect a film so soon after the event to be. But Stone elevates enough moments and points out enough detail for us to find something of worth in the endeavour, at least beyond the immediate cynicism. The true life story sifts through the wreckage to find shreds of humanity and hope for those of us who like to hang on to these glimmers of heroism and find a semblance of good from that fateful day. Commendable for its initial intentions it might possibly be, but if I want to remember 9/11 I will watch the much more heartening, and real life tributes that are shown on TV each year to commemorate the event on its anniversary. Real world tragedy has always inspired art, but I would refuse to accept art masquerading as real life tragedy.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Nothing but commies in this review board,"Looking through the comments on here it looks like a bunch of people went into this movie expecting it to be some sort of documentary exposing George Bush or something lol. Just because Oliver Stone is red-pilled af doesn't mean he can't deliver a powerful and suspenseful drama. Oliver stone even went out of his way to show tower 7 falling, which is more than the entire MSM can manage to do.I went into this movie not expecting much and walked away with one of the most moving films I've ever seen about 9/11. Not only was this movie absolutely beautiful, it was respectful. The movie is about two port authority police officers that get stuck under the rubble of the WTC on 9/11, and what their families go through. This is one of the most powerful performances from two already amazing actors, Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña. Both actors deliver one of the best acting duets I've ever seen on film, really immersing themselves into the characters and bleeding their hearts out onto the film. Yes, this movie is extremely patriotic, it gives huge respect to the people that put their lives on the line for us, and illustrates the soul of American freedom.Sorry you guys didn't get Oliver Stone's take on the controlled demolition, but this isn't that movie. Isn't his other films like Snowden and JFK enough for you? Does he need to make a film about every fkng conspiracy in American history? Are we gonna start crying about Platoon because he doesn't talk about the Gulf of Tonkin incident? Oliver Stone does characters, and he does them better than anyone in the business. The man is a filmmaker, how about let's look at this film and review it for what it is. This movie is brilliantly shot, with a perfect and talented cast. It's a drama, and it's suspenseful! I didn't know how it was going to end, and it hit me right in the feels. The whole last 1/4 of the movie I'm teared up!You didn't like the Marine? Go back to China, commie!
I like the Marine. You know why? He's a damn hero! He's an actual true blue hero, and Michael Shannon does a great job playing that hardass Marine with a heart the size of Texas.Commies gtfo!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Thoroughly normal emotional porn.,"Nothing special - well-wrought piece of emotional pornography. Sure to get the inner patriot going (if you have one) and certainly effective in making us emphasize with the victims. But for all the effective sound effects and insistent focusing on faces and flashbacks of family life, the movie is ultimately empty. There is no great story, no truly interesting characters and no great theme other than a Hallmark comment on how America ""stood together"". The film wants nothing more than to show us how bad it was for these people and probably succeeds in making many Americans revisit the confusion and emotions of the first days after the attack. A great chance to say something about the actual attacks or the reaction has been wasted, the film says nothing and thematises nothing, it just shows the horror. All in all, it feels like a TV movie writ large.",3.0,Anonymous,History
This generations pearl harbor,"September 11th, 2001 was a day that none of us would ever forget. Many were offended by Oliver Stone recreating the events of that infamous day because it was considered too early. Personally whether it's 5 years or 50 years the pain of September 11th will always be there. People are still missing, families are still torn apart, what we can do is to honor these people by remembering them and what happened. The movie doesn't focus on the brutality of what happened but rather the unwaivering bravery of those who chose to put themselves in harms way. Though not overly graphic the story is rather heart wrenching, it follows 2 Port Authority Police Officers whom were one of the first authorities on scene. One is a rookie cop by the name of Will Jimeno and long timer Seargent John Mcloughlin. What these two witnessed is truly unexplainable, being trapped 20+feet below ground zero. The movie constantly cuts back in forth between them and their familes, some may find it rather irritating at times but what I believe Oliver Stone was trying to show us was the damage done that day wasn't merely physical. The emotional damage was just as twisted and crushed as ground zero was. What I found inspirational was some of the emergency rescuers were posed a question about their own safety of being down there and that the structure could come down on them at anytime, without hesitation they answered they were ready to give their life to save anothers. Depsite the first immediate reaction when people hear ""World Trade Center"" it really wasn't about death, but rather life. Overall the movie is amazing, not once did I ever doubt any of these actors. To me Maggie Gyllenhal shines in her role as Mrs. Jimeno. She embodies all the wifes, mothers, sisters, aunts that lost their relatives that day. This a great tribute to those who were lost, but more importantly to celebrate the power of life, love and hope. Watch this movie.10/10and that's the final word.",10.0,Anonymous,History

By the time the movie was over not one eye was left dry or one heart untouched. The casting was good and the actors seemed to fit right into their characters with ease.

This was a horrible horrible horrible idea, imagine one of the victims family members watching this. Or even a witness. I mean a very big group of people who were alive during the event are still on this earth, and I guarantee they haven't forgot a single second of it. Very traumatic to reminisce on. This movie should have not been made. I mean seriously, there were multiple times where I would cringe at the pure idiocy of how completely ignorant this movie is.

"I'm a little stunned, frankly.","I actually generally like Oliver Stone as a filmmaker, or at least give him some begrudging respect for taking on the political moments of our time.

Although the film itself was really quite touching, in the sphere of the tragedy that it touched (i.e. the impact upon first responders, and the successful rescue of two of them), I think it demeaned the entire experience of everyone involved to title it ""World Trade Center,"" and I also think that, because of the title, and the notoriety of the director, that the ""take"" on the tragedy was made needlessly narrow.Basically, Oliver Stone turned one of the tragedies of the ages into a movie of the week.I'm thankful that the story of the men who gave their fortitude and courage was told to the public.But otherwise, I found the basics of the movie lacking in a big way. It was NOT the story of the time, day, period, or otherwise. It gives no insight. It simply tells a story of heroism and rescue. You'd barely even know the context if the movie weren't titled ""World Trade Center,"" and that context doesn't really play into the telling of the rescue story.I was disappointed in a major way.

Codeless s**t,"Now let me make one thing clear before I begin: I'm not bashing the portrayal of a horrible day. We lost Americans that day and 9/11 was a horrible day that affected everyone, and I hope those terrorists got justice by God. Without a doubt. With that being said, what I hate about the movie is the codelessless. Everything about this movie is like a more adult oriented version of ""Flicka."" Maria Bello really ruined the movie. As if that's not bad enough, it also adds a sense of codeless to an already dumb movie. The storyline brings out the worst, as though this was a codeless Ivy League promo movie. This movie combines the worst aspects of Raimi's ""Spiderman"" movies and ""Gladiator"" with Russell Crowe (also codeless). ""United 93"" and UPN's ""9/11"" with Robert De Niro are better 9/11 films, and while the latter is real the French bros who made the movie manage to make the documentary enjoyable in every sense of the word. This was just nonsense. If it had been Lori Loughlin instead I would have seen it. She hits it hard and is an acting queen.

It was very clear where the movie was going and I was not dissatisfied in any way.I for one am glad that they chose to use the point of view that was used and I don't think it was too soon, nor was it in any way incorrect, disrespectful, or boring. I was emotionally affected through most of the movie which doesn't happen often being a young man of 23.For those who were directly touched on 9/11 this may be more than can be handled on the first viewing but I think any viewing after it will be seen as a tribute and a testament to how well we all came together no matter what race, religion, profession, or overall viewpoint on life.I think that for most of the US, people have moved on like nothing happened, and this will help to remember how it actually unfolded.All casts were flawless in my eyes.

The events of that day were so dreadful and appalling not only because of the scale of the attack but because of the ignorance, bigotry and hatred of the perpetrators. That hatred and its fundamental cause, the perversion of religion was not even touched on by this story.

Little Grist For The Milieu,"When most movie-goers think of Oliver Stone, they usually think of cutting edge (Born on the Fourth of July), or visceral film-making (Natural Born Killers), or even historically disturbing cinema (The Doors). But few  if any  would consider Stone schmaltzy or an opportunist. Watching WORLD TRADE CENTER, though, one can't help but feel a touch of the latter and a significant amount of the former.UNITED 93 was similar in that it took the recent horrific events of 9/11 and reintroduced Americans' fears to that awful day. It utilized (for better or worse) those feelings we all have and made money off of it. This isn't as terrible as it sounds, though. Cinema has been doing this for as long as celluloid has been running through projectors, but never has the filming been so close to the actual date of the events (or at least rarely).One can't help but think that Stone must've been desperate for film material or somehow felt closely connected to the events that day. Either way, the script (although based on actual events) was lackluster at best. There are just a few exceptions that we'll cover in a moment.This is the (true) story of the port authority police officers that responded to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11, and is specific to the two men from the port authority who were trapped and later rescued from under the rubble. Nicholas Cage (National Treasure) stars as John McLoughlin, a gruff Sergeant who was around during the first bombings on the trade centers several years earlier. His entrapped fellow officer is rookie Will Jimeno played by Michael Pena (Crash), a family man with a new baby on the way. Both men have to deal with their isolation and near certain demise as they lay pinned and stranded only a few feet from one another. The story jumps between the rubble strewn men, their wives and families, and a retired marine who feels the call of duty after the attacks and risks his life to find survivors in the buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day).It is this ""marine"" that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise. He seemed almost inserted into the story to give some grist to an otherwise empty milieu. His need for ""revenge"" felt hollow amidst so much emotion. And although this may be ""the way it was,"" it didn't translate well to film.Interestingly, Nicholas Cage gives an admirable performance even though he's not jumping into and out of danger, or battling evil-doers with deadly weapons. He's confined as is co-star Pena and their concern for one another is touching, as is their concern for what will happen to their families as they lay thinking/dreaming about them (these were some of the best parts of the screenplay but only a small portion of the whole).The most powerful part of the film was its sound editing. When the buildings collapsed and then later continued to creak and groan, they took on an ominous characteristic that brooded poorly for our two main characters and gave movie-watchers a great sense of dread.But when the sound becomes the most impressive part of a film, there's more problems than applause.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Accurate reproduction,"Although I spent hours watching the actual event on television, this film had a tendency to drag in parts.

I think it could have switched to the other events more often than just voices in the dark. I watched Flight 93 and enjoyed it more if you can say enjoyed. It is a gripping couple of hours and for the most part was close to the actual facts.

"no suspense, not dramatic enough","This story just did not feel dramatic enough to really draw the viewer in. You already know what will happen before hand, but that doesn't make for a bad movie. United 93 was a good movie based on the 9/11 attacks that was good and suspenseful. But this film was no where near as good. The problem is most of the film has the 2 main characters under rubble with not much to do. A lot of scenes show the 2 wives worrying and hoping to get that call that their husbands are OK. There is only so much you can see of that before it starts to get boring. We get the fact that the wives are worried and waiting.

Attended NYC premiere & would like to comment,"I attended the NYC premiere of 'World Trade Center' last night and would just like to say how wonderfully written, directed, produced and acted this movie was. I understand that some people are totally against it and will not go and see it, but for those of you who are thinking about it and wondering whether or not you should see it, please do. Of course the movie is sad and yes there were tears but the ending is uplifting and the entire movie reminds us of the courage and strength of the firefighters, police officers, Port Authority workers, paramedics, military and all others involved in the rescue efforts of that day. The real-life rescue of John & Will and the ordeal that their families go through while waiting for word of their condition is the focus of the movie. As I mentioned, there were tears. But there was also laughter, at just the right moments in the movie. I am in no way a movie critic and I must admit that I have close family ties with John and/or Will, but this is in no way affecting my opinion of the movie. The script was ""written"" (as much as a script for a movie based on a real-life event can be written) extremely well and the acting was superb. Nicolas Cage & Michael Pena delivered incredible performances, conveying the terror that John & Will faced being trapped underneath the rubble. I hope that people will give this movie a chance. If you do, I think you will come away from it with a new perspective of that day. A sense of hope and gratefulness that out of the thousands of people that untimely perished that day and the multitude of heartbreaking stories and memories, there are men & women courageous enough to head in the opposite direction that most of us take when a tragedy occurs, and because of these men & women, John & Will are here today.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing Movie by Stone,"I decided to watch this movie because Oliver Stone is a guarantee of a quality movie.

To be honest, if I hadn't known it, I would never have guessed it was an Oliver Stone movie. The director of many good movies like Talk Radio, JFK, Any Given Sunday and W. usually gives an original and very personal cut to his pictures, but this time he totally fails to give such a touch and instead he winds up being banal and predictable. Plus, the plot is boring and not at all entertaining, with big part of the movie shot in the dark of the debris of the WTC where the two Policemen are trapped.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterpiece from a Passionate Director,"Stone has directed some of the best films of the last 100 years. He, along with Spielberg, understands the power of a good script, a good story, good cinematography, good editing, and most importantly, the ability to connect and make his audience react. ""Word Trade Center"" offers him another opportunity to handle material that cannot be ignored. What is special about this project is how Stone manages to make a flawless and superb film that does exactly what is supposed to do without compromising or disrespecting its audience, as many contemporary films are doing lately. This film doesn't have a bloated running time because it is compact, direct, without an ounce of fat. It also contains a very tight screenplay that does not waste anytime with pontification or over-sentimentality. What we see is enough to breakdown any emotional resistance we could have about the material (as if it that was possible). In addition, we are able to see a story told in a very interesting way, though not in real time, in a series of scenes that are slow, deliberate, and direct.Stone's assured direction keeps the details intimate and personal, yet it provides a connection to the universal emotions that bring out the best in all of us, without ignoring the fact that there are also some negative counterparts. With the help of a very talented production team, the film boasts a perfect blend of technical, old fashioned film making, and smoothly integrated computer effects. It is an impressive piece of work, and it surely deserves to receive as many accolades as possible at the end of the year. It is an important film because of its themes and its execution. This is definitely one of his best works as a director, showing many in Hollywood that it is possible to captivate and relate to an audience, going beyond a concept, an idea, a production meeting by carefully integrating every element of cinema and always respecting the audience and the material.Earlier on, we were witnesses to the talented Streep in two very good films. ""WTC"" has four marvelous performances from actors who have done good work in the past, but now stand out in a year that might not have great films but some very performances. ""WTC"" is an excellent film because the very talented Maria Bello once again shows that she can bring life to a character from very deep inside. She is a tower of strength, besieged by her own crisis, and she conveys her distress with an economy of gestures and words in a lovely and expert performance. Cage does very well in his restricted physical setting by carefully transmitting his emotions with his voice and his eyes. He is excellent, and Pena equally matches Cage's superb work. There is the most conventional work, not less effective acting by Gyllenthal who surpasses anything she and her brother have done in the past, as she portrays the distressed wife, who is unsure of what will be expected of her as the events unfold.""WTC"" is an amazing film and hopefully will be recognized by many for what it is, an example of how powerful good cinema truly is. For those who view Stone as a political headache, watch the film without any preconceptions and just witness what real talent can do.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My respects to these heros,This movie is always get me. The fact that the survivors were part of the process of the movie gives you a view of how they survived and what their families felt during those uncertain times worrying about their loved ones.

Gut Wrenching and Powerful Testament,"I recently watched both Flight 93 and World Trade Center. From the reviews I read, I expected Flight 93 to be the superior of the two but after watching World Trade Center, I came to a far different conclusion.I respectfully disagree with the commenter who thought that the movie dwelled too heavily on the the two Port Authority officers being trapped in the wreckage. Instead, I thought Stone did a superb job in encapsulating the entire 9-11 experience through the eyes of the two families. I lived through 9-11 and didn't need to see a newsreel of the day. The movie hit the right note by focusing on the emotional effect of the disaster on average families - the scene in the hospital between Maria Bello's character and the mother who lost her son in the Towers was particularly well done.For someone who lives on Long Island and knew many who were working in Manhattan that day (but fortunately, no one who was in the Towers), it was tough not to become emotional and I there were several parts of the movie that brought me to tears.All in all, I feel that this was a job well done and should be mandatory viewing by high school students so that they will learn what 9-11 meant to us, a little bit like Schindler's list.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The Year's Best Film, HANDS DOWN.","Sure, Oscar season hasn't hit just yet, but I am confident when I say that ""World Trade Center"" is the year's best movie. I say this as a critic with utter disdain for both Nicolas Cage, and a growing disappointment in Oiver Stone's work ever since ""Natural Born Killers"". Cage shines here, and Stone redeems himself. From that wrenching shot of a giant airplane silhouette snaking down a city street, Stone grabs you and never lets you go. He cuts no corners, showing, graphically and wrenchingly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks effect on the community. Burning papers fly everywhere. Subways, once full of activity, are now empty. Police officers return to the station, drenched in blood and shaken to the core. Although the film examines the world's reaction to the attacks, it's main focus is on Officers Mcgloughin and Jimeno, who were trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center buildings after the attack. Stone wisely chooses to darken the surroundings, train the camera on the men's soot-caked faces, and just let them emote. It's an approach that would have bombed with many actors, but Cage and Michael Pena are up to the challenge, letting their eyes tell the story, trading monosyllabic encouragements as they try to escape the metal and rock pinning them to the floor. A subplot focuses on the wives of the ""First Responders"", and manages to be both wrenching and uplifting at the same time. Magge Gylenhall in particular deserves Oscar attention for her turn as Mrs. Jimeno. This movie is a superb piece of work, and you owe it to yourself to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Oliver Stone redeems himself,"World Trade Center is based on a true story about two port authority police officers trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center and the families that try everything to rescue them. This film is extremely powerful and can traumatize a lot of people who are still affected by the tragic incident or the loved ones they lost. Oliver Stone, director of political films such as JFK, Nixon, and Born on the Fourth of July, uses very little politics in the film and as your watching it, it's hard to tell that its made by him. He's been in kind of a funk lately and I think that in this film, he has broken out of it. The two main leads played by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as the police officers trapped in chaos did very well and it should of made the two real life police officers very proud. Overall, this was a good film that will get more and more appreciated as time goes by. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",8.0,Anonymous,History

To protect America from these horrible people. I am very impressed with how this movie was done & the respect which was given. Since I read the reviews, I knew it would mainly be about the story of two main people & their friends & families. It wasn't too hard with ""The World Saw Evil That Day. Two Men Saw Something Else"" as a tagline. I feel the actors were perfect. I know the survivors who told this story must be very impressed with how they were portrayed. When this movie was first mentioned, a survivor said it best. He said it's not too early. People need to be reminded exactly how that day unfolded & why we need to fight these terrorist before they do it again. If they'd waited 10, 15, 20 years or so, then it wouldn't be told like it happened.So Please people, go see this movie.

The other movie that they made about Flight 93 was good also, but if I had to pick between the two, I would say this one was better. I only saw and heard what went on during 9/11 on the news, but this movie took you there to experience what it was like on that fateful day. I can see Cage being nominated for his role.

Oliver is a good boy after all!,"Director Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from controversy. His Stone Age film career has scrutinized methods that the U.S. Government has invoked in dealing with issues such as: the Vietnam War, JFK Assassination, Watergate, Music Censorship, and the Stock Market to name a few. In his real life, Stone also has been a headliner himself by being arrested for drug possession. I guess Oliver was trying to live up to his last name. However, he brings a disparate directorial approach to the 9/11 film ""World Trade Center"". Stone focuses the narrative on valor and survival. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena star as Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno. They were one the last survivors rescued from the World Trade Center catastrophe. They were stuck in the rubble of the Twin Towers for numerous hours using their perseverance, humor, and encouragement as survival tools under extreme excruciating circumstances. Cage's Sgt. McLoughiln is an emotionless leader who is silently dumbfounded by the unexpected tragedy. Pena's Officer Jimeno is the simpleton humanitarian who has a way of bringing the unadorned aspects of life to life by using as it as a motivating force. Even though McLoughlin and Jimeno are as dissimilar as they come, they both share a common force in being loving family men and devoted law enforcement reps. Their manhole conversations focused on such assorted topics as: the Starsky & Hutch theme song, Jesus with a water bottle, procrastination of a kitchen cabinet project and paternal responsibilities. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the suffering, despondent wives who are out-of-the-loop on their husbands' fate. Cage and Pena were heroic and powerful with their acting contributions. They were the Twin Thespian Towers of ""World Trade Center"". However, my opinion was not proportionate in symmetry fashion with the overacted efforts of Bello and Gyllenhaal. These stellar actresses were not at their prime here and their overplayed grief was the slight terror of the film. Screenwriter Andrea Berlof does stay united and committed to the actual verbal interactions which took place on that dismal day. Auteur Stone also constructs the scenes with mesmerizing realities and acute depictions which will stay in your mind & hearts for days. To some ""World Trade Center"" might be ""too much, too large, and too soon"". However. I do salute Stone for pledging allegiance by providing us this honorary tale. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade Center - The Best Movie of the Summer,"September 11, 2001 is a moment that will forever live in the infamy of American History. Nearly everyone that was old enough to remember the attacks remembers what they were doing when it happened and how it has affected them all these years later. So, as the news for this movie began circling I was immediately and anxiously awaiting the release. In fact, it was the most anticipated movie of my summer.Oliver Stone rarely disappoints when it comes to epic movies. In the past, movies like Alexander and Natural Born Killers have struck a chord in many people and left their mark on society. World Trade Center is set to do the same thing.While there have been complaints that this movie was made too soon it was backed by the families and the men who were affected by this event the most. It was handled beautifully with plenty of emotion and a powerhouse cast of actors that knew just how to make you feel that you were in the middle of it all and that your life was as affected as theirs was.Nicolas Cage heads up the cast playing John McLoughlin, the Sergeant that led a small group of Port Authority police officers into the towers to help rescue people trapped. Cage offers a glimpse of an emotional side showing strength and fear with only his voice as we watch the events unfold with baited breath.Michael Pena, while slightly unknown compared to Cage, is simply a scene-stealer. Pena beautifully portrays William Jimeno, one of the Port Authority officers, who is stuck with Cage's McLoughlin beneath a pile of rubble. Pena moved into the Jimeno house to prepare for the role and the studying definitely helped. His performance was filled with emotion, force, and desperation. It was everything necessary to bring the movie together perfectly.The lead women roles of Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal showed us how the wives of these men held on to memories when the lives of their husbands hung in the balance. We watched the turn of events in their minds and on their faces as life went from normal to unimaginable in a moment's time.A small bit part by Stephen Dorff also added to the strength of the movie. The horror of the events are as evident on his face as the tears in his eyes as he plays Scott Strauss, the man that came in and saved the lives of Jimeno and McLoughlin.People might liken this to be an attempt on Stone's part to make a stir, but they could not be more wrong. McLoughlin and Jimeno both have writing credits on the movie and their input heavily influenced the production. If you are looking for a touching, heart-wrenching story that could have been an action-flick but was unfortunately true, then this movie is for you.If you see one movie this summer see World Trade Center. It is well worth the time and tears you will spend watching it.Originally Published on Thursday, August 24, 2006 Copyright 2006: Ashtyn Evans and Literary Illusions",10.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece so unrecognized!,"I usually watch movies after reading the reviews on this portal and most of the times I find majority of reviews helpful. There have been occasions when some movie reviewed here was not what I found in it, but this time its outrageous! I haven't seen or read more nonsense by so many reviewers, all pushing down with all their weight on this masterpiece.This movie is one of the best I have seen in my life. The film is not about 9/11 as a terrorist attack, its about humans. It shows the good and the bad face of humanity at the same time. I am surprised that so many reviewers missed this simple point! Yes, its true that two cops were not the only sufferers but then we must swallow the fact that its not a documentary.The story starts with a momentum and keeps the pace and thrill maintained till the very last scene. The drama is not exaggerated and there are no artificial looking special effects and still it manages to make me glued to the screen, just by the intensity of emotions flowing around for the entire length. Technically the cinematography is outstanding and for those who like to watch every frame in detail there is enough substance. The screenplay couldn't be better. It could be more dramatic or with more action, but not better.Once again, I am surprised at the nonsense by those reviewers who could not grasp this movie. A masterpiece for me though. After reading all these reviews I had almost abandoned the idea of watching it, but thanks to my curiosity, I watched it and was compelled to write this review.My advice, watch this, as a movie and not as a documentary, which you would anticipate because of its title.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie...,"I didn't think this movie played on the pain of the family as hugodinwitty has stated. This movie is NOT about 9/11 as a whole...and Oliver Stone never wanted it to be a movie about 9/11 as a whole. With everything that happened that day and the amount of tragedy that occurred that day, it would impossible to make a movie about 9/11. This was a movie about two Port Authority guys and their families. If you are looking to get more out of the story...that isn't what the movie is about. It depicts the story of what two survivors experienced when the WTC got hit and when the towers fell. It doesn't even show the actual plane hitting the buildings because once again this is what the two Port Authority guys experienced...not the entire story of 9/11. I think the movie was well done and it made the tragedy even more real for me when you see these guys and their families go through what they do. I actually went to the Port Authority memorial website and saw the rest of the guys who were part of this tragedy who did not survive and you realize that this is more than a just a movie. I truly appreciated how delicately Oliver Stone handled this movie. We will never forget.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fine movie,"Highly underrated movie that follows the will to survive of two Port Authority Policemen after that attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Special affects are amazing. I know the former WTC complex very well and from every angle of this film, it looks just like it did. Its almost laughable about how many idiots pan this movie for various things like one comment about the Jesus figure showing up. Ever consider thats what that policeman saw while going in and out of consciousness? The acting is fine. Like any of the totally stupid action movies that came out this summer are Oscar material. I know I'm getting old when great movies like this get panned, yet crowds head to the theaters for the stupidest movies nowadays. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Give this a look over and judge for yourself. Along with United 93, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer in the shows of the people who were directly impacted that day. It almost didn't feel like a Oliver Stone movie. So if thats a reason your not giving it a chance, you should see it anyway..",9.0,Anonymous,History
For all the Heroes,"As we celebrate today the 14th anniversary of this horrible tragedy, I decided to watch World Trade Center which recall the real stories of John McLaughlin and William Jimeno, two Port Authority police officers caught in the middle of the disaster and survived it after several hours stuck in the rumbles.This movie is really moving and make us proud to be American. Just like this US Marine who decided to fly from Connecticut to help for the search of survivors or this ex paramedic who came to rescue Will and finally save his life.This was an awful day but we saw the best of us coming through getting together as a Nation to rise up from the chaos.Because this is what this movie is about. It's about not giving up, fight for the people we cherish the most despite the horrific situation we have to face. It's simply about life. There are other movies about 9/11 including Flight 93 to make us remember about the awesome bravery of all those people who sacrificed their life to save others. World Trade Center is for all the Heroes from law enforcement and NYFD who went there to rescue people and for some of them lost their life in the process.So to all, thank you for all you did for your sacrifice.

A must see... for those who can,"This is not an easy movie to watch. Much of the movie shows PAPD Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) under the rubble of World Trade Center Two. It is dark and claustrophobic, and you will feel their pain, their anger, and their fear. They literally kept each other alive by talking to each other, knowing that if they fell asleep, odds are they wouldn't wake up, and if one died, the other would, too.But ""World Trade Center"" is not told solely from the point of view of the officers. It also looks at Allison Jimeno and Donna McLaughlin (Maggie Gyllenhall and Maria Bello are perfectly cast), the wives of the hero officers, as well as their families, and the toll the day's events took on their lives.I'm the first to admit that when I heard Oliver Stone was directing ""World Trade Center,"" I worried that it would be a political commentary laden with conspiracy theories. Far from it. Stone and writer Andrea Berloff took great care in leaving politics out of the movie. The dialogue was not only believable, but it was all New York. You can tell that the four stars spent a lot of time with the people they portray.The only thing I would have changed in this movie is to have the time of day in which the scenes took place, just for continuity.If you can watch a movie based on the single worst day in American history, I urge you to see ""World Trade Center.""",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A Kinder, Gentler Oliver Stone","In 'World Trade Center,' a surprisingly even-handed and well-modulated Oliver Stone steps on the brakes and turns down the volume, and puts away his customary histrionics and hysteria long enough to allow a true story about quiet, ordinary, everyday heroes caught in extraordinary circumstances to stand on its own and speak for itself.John McLaughlin--Nicolas Cage--is a sergeant in the NYC Port Authority PD who's called upon to recruit volunteers to travel across town to the title location to help evacuate the towers following the impact of the first plane; Will Jimeno--Michael Pena--is a Port Authority cop, the first to volunteer, albeit somewhat reluctantly. They and their friends and fellow cops don't know the exact nature of the emergency and they're rusty with the breathing equipment and heavy fireman's gear they're given to wear and take with them, but they're aware the situation is grave and that their colleagues from other, nearer city PDs are overwhelmed. They're also aware that the chances that they might die are superb, and more formidable by the inch. With all this information, they're still standing in the WTC lobby trying to figure out what to do when their world crashes in on them. Literally.'World Trade Center' takes a story we thought we knew and uses it to discover new territory; by turning inward and keeping the special effects to an absolute minimum, Stone and screenwriter Andrea Berloff focus their attention to the formidable heroism displayed that day by depicting what amounts to an extended conversation between McLaughlin and Jimeno. In a way, the movie is as intimate as Malle's 'My Dinner with Andre,' except for the fact that the participants are buried alive in rubble, and quite possibly dying before our eyes.And in listening to the nature of the two mens' conversation--the two discuss the most trivial and banal subjects: Demi Moore, 'GI Jane,' their kids--we realize that the mens' words are secondary to the fact that they are literally talking to keep each other conscious, staving off shock, saving each others' lives. They're decent, ordinary men in circumstances more desperate than most of us can imagine, and through their attitudes and the tones of their voices, they need to rescue each other, prop up each others' spirits, and live.Nicolas Cage disappears to far into the character of McLaughlin that he nearly ceases to exist. A trailer for another upcoming Cage film, 'The Wicker Man,' plays before 'WTC,' and you wouldn't recognize the actor from one performance to another if you didn't already know him. Cage takes the less-flashy of the two primary roles--Pena as Jimeno has the use of his arms and is therefore more animated--but each time Cage delivers a line he refocuses, and rivets, our attention back to his tortured face and vocal tones. By underplaying his role he steals the show.And the competition is keen: Pena is superb as Jimeno; Maggie Gyllenhaal is sweetly perfect as Jimeno's pregnant wife, Allison; Maria Bello is strong and authoritative as McLaughlin's wife; Michael Shannon, as a USMC sergeant from the Midwest who travels to NYC to do what he can to help, seems to be working for a director higher than Stone. Shannon has the bearing and the laser attention of Elijah walking out of the wilderness and into the land of the Baal gods. Frank Whaley, a terrific supporting actor who's never quite been handed a breakthrough role, contributes a quiet, dignified performance as a former paramedic pressed back into service. And check out Julie Adams, as the pregnant Allison's grandmother.Craig Armstrongs's cerebral score sounds enough like Adagio for Strings to contribute an adequate gravitas to the film and remind us we're watching important stuff. And the cinematography, by Seamus McGarvey and augmented by archival news footage and NASA satellite photography, is seamless and stunning: When the first tower collapses, hell is unleashed; when the second tower goes, it happens through our ears and inside our heads. Theatre auditoriums equipped with digital sound might need to boost the film's rating from PG13 to R. So let's hear it for the sound department...no pun intended.By sticking to the facts and allowing the drama to unfold at its own pace, Oliver Stone displays a maturity he's hinted at but mostly kept to himself up until now. For too long, Stone's seemed uncomfortably like the lone adult sitting at the kiddie's table at Thanksgiving. The maturity displayed here, and his choice of an ultimately upbeat and life-affirming story, feels somehow like Picasso caught red-handed in Norman Rockwell territory. 'World Trade Center' is like a Ron Howard film, directed by Oliver Stone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie from my stand point,"I took my wife to see the movie the other day, we both loved it! I thought that it truly captured the sense of despair and loss that the victims families felt that day.

I was in fire school during the events of 9/11 learning how to become a firefighter. We all sat in class watching what was going on with the feeling of shock with tears in our eyes, a few of my classmates quit the next day and joined the army. Seeing a film like this gives me mixed emotions. On one hand I feel that it is kind of to soon to put this out, but on the other hand, I feel it is a great way to memorialize 343 of my brothers that gave there lives that day.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Oliver Stone ""WTC"" is respectful and very thoughtful","We all remember that September morning, when all got up and turned on the TV only to see Tower 1 of the WTC on fire and the second plane flying into Tower 2, plus the horror of BOTH towers coming down knowing that there are still thousands of people still inside. ""WTC"" focuses on two men who were INSIDE.""World Trade Center"" follows the story of Officer Sergeant, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Port Authority cop, Will Jimeno (Michael Peña). The morning of September 11th, was no different from any other day on the job till the news of a plane crashing into the North WTC tower comes in and they are immediately dispatched to base of the tower. John and Will, plus two other cops prepare to enter the towers. The cops enter the walkway in between the 2 towers just as the tower 2 starts to collapse. They take shelter into an elevator shaft where both John and Will are pinned under 20 feet of rubble. Will they survive and see there families again or will die underneath the aftermath of one of the most infamous attacks on America in history.This movie was a very emotional and gripping film. I found that Oliver Stone took the event serious and really thought on how he should bring this film to life. One thing that I highly respect is that he does NOT show either plane flying into the buildings. He uses real live news footage to show the towers collapsing. The tag line of this movie is: ""The World Saw Evil That Day. Two Men Saw Something Else"" is the best way to describe this movie in a way I could never imagine. Like when the towers collapse, you see it from the inside; you see the pain that these cops experienced. You also see the effect in has on all those who love them. There are some stupid bratty lines that come from one of the kids, as well as the use of the ""F"" word (once). But I really liked how this film also showed how America united during and after the crisis. Your skin color nor your racial background didn't mean a thing, we treated each other as equals. This movie is worth seeing, if you can stand to relive that dreadful day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Film!,"When I read reviews I sometimes wonder if we were seeing the same movie. I thought this film was fantastic from beginning to end - 2 hours went by so fast I couldn't believe it was over. I was on the edge of my seat and holding on to my husband's arm without even realizing it and he got choked up several times. It has been a long time since I felt like jumping out of my seat and cheering but this movie made me feel that way. Props to Oliver Stone for a very well done film - and to Nic Cage and Michael Pena as well. I liked the way the film focused on the first few hours after the event - when it seemed we were all united by shock, fear and grief. That feeling of unity was all too brief, and while the film also brought back terrible feelings of that awful day it was a story of the triumph of the human spirit as well.

Bravo Mr Stone,"World Trade Center was the most powerful, emotional movie I have seen in ages...while I do not care for the main star of the film, I got past that in this wonderful movie that brought a human perspective to an animalistic deed and day...I cried for most of the movie...remembering what it was like when I heard the news, the disbelief, the horror...what I felt was nothing what these brave men who without thought for themselves went to not only do their jobs but went in knowing that they may not come back to their families and loved ones. The film was tasteful, non political and very, very powerful. It did however reinforce in me the new found hatred for the extreme Muslim movement that wants to gain control of the world. It strengthened my resolve that the battle with terrorism should never end, we should never let our guards down again, we must prevail as john and will did.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Very Painful, But Incredible","Despite the fact that this is an Oliver Stone movie, I was surprised to find that it didn't have any real political connotation (which wasn't a bad thing). Be very aware that this movie dose not try to explore the motivations of why 9/11 occurred, but it shows the experiences of two men and their families after the buildings collapsed.With that being said, the movie finds its strength by focusing on the hope for the two men trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, in lieu of focusing on the despair and hopelessness felt by all of the families who lost a loved one. I felt this was key in keeping the story from being over-dramatic, while still being dramatic on an acceptable and appropriate level.The performances by Michael Pena and Nicholas Cage are quite memorable, as both of the men grippingly convey their incredible pain as they're trapped in the WTC. The audience can especially see the driving motivation of Cage's character, John McLoughlin, as the only thing that manages to keep him alive is the thought of his wife and children. I can see Cage getting a nod for best actor for his performance in World Trade Center.The other aspect of this film was seeing the events of 9/11 through the family members, an aspect that I personally hadn't considered of importance before seeing the movie. I had mixed feelings here. Agreeing with the previous reviewer, Maria Bello (the wife of officer , John McLoughlin) gave a very bland performance, and most of her actions were a tad in-genuine. However, Maggie Gyllenhaal was amazing as the wife of Officer Michael Peña. The viewer felt genuinely terrified for her as she went through the emotions of fearing that her husband was dead.One low point in the film, was the side-story of a Marine that looks for WTC victims. His story should have either been left out all together, or provided more attention. His role in the movie feels more like an after thought than anything else.The production values were, as expected, quite high. The viewpoint from the inside of the towers collapsed was particularly incredible and notable, and realistic at the same moment. This was a technically flawless movie, and instead of using actual footage from the press coverage, most everything about the exterior of the towers was done with computer graphics.This movie isn't for everyone (even though I think everyone should go see it). It's very difficult to watch during certain parts. And if you feel that you couldn't open your mind to the possibility that this movie is about more than just making another Hollywood blockbuster, then don't go and see it. But I do think that the fact that I'm writing this review is a testament to how much I think that others should see it.So open up to something that may provoke some emotion out of you. Be it fear, anger, sadness. That's what good dramas are supposed to do. And if World Trade Center does this for you, then its done its job.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Take your breathe away drama,"I went in the theater expecting something totally different than what Oliver Stone and his remarkable cast did. Taking a very emotional event and making it into an excellent story about courage, and making every person who was involved seem like a hero in their own way. It also helps the viewer appreciate a different side of the powerful event. Most of us were watching 9/11 from a television in our homes or offices, but this film puts you in the shoes of the people who were actually involved and risked their lives saving complete strangers. I never cry when I watch movies, but I think everyone did at least once while watching this film. If you only see one movie this summer, make it this one, it will blow you away and remind you of how amazing our country and its people really are...",9.0,Anonymous,History
This is a must see,"I saw the movie tonight and was so impressed with its sensitivity and realism. It was very emotional to watch but it also brought out some important points. The man who initially found the two officers was prompted by the Spirit to go to New York and help. The two officers had spiritual experiences as they lay buried. It was a gentle reminder to us all that Heavenly Father was there even though many had thought he had deserted them. This was not a usual ""Hollywood"" movie but rather a sharing of a very traumatic experience of real people. We need to appreciate these two men and their families for being willing to share this experience with us. It was touching to see the effect this experience had on some of the rescuers. Although this movie would be very difficult for some to watch, especially those who had lost someone in this terrible tragedy it helped those of us who were not directly involved to better understand the feelings of many who were involved.This was an excellent movie to honor those survivors,rescuers and those who passed away.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful... Very well done!,"You know what I haven't got from most films these past couple of years that I 'did' get from this one? Real emotional involvement. Brought 'into' the story more than from just an observers perspective.That sense of real danger, anticipation, pain, urgency. The feeling of Closter phobia when in a tight space. I 'felt' the soot and gravel in my mouth. Oliver Stone did just that throughout this film and no, not due the subject matter.First off, Oliver and writer Andrea Berloff made an interesting, entertaining and well paced film that was also heartfelt. And adding, some things we just take for granted like... being moved.For instance, the sound was incorporated 'so well' in the film. Not giving away, when the team is in the trade center before it comes down, the sound effects 'really' brought you in to where they were. When the second tower was hit and you hear the boom from the inside... you 'feel' it in your chest 'and' senses. When trapped under rubble after the first tower falls, the second one comes down. You FEEL like your right there.I was impressed also by 'most' of the actors. Not a big Nick Cage fan however once again, he portrayed the character very well. Well enough for me to forget he was Nick.Michael Pena (of 'Crash' fame) did a wonderful job portraying officer Will Jimeno. He'll see his actor stock increase by measure for sure. And his job while trapped, not over done, not contrived, very believable and solid.Maria Bello again solidifies her spot as one 'go to' actor when you need a good performance even from a mild character. She really brought something to this role that helped bring strength yet emotion.However, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance for reasons stuck out negatively for me. I've enjoyed past performances from her however this one seemed more contrived and overplayed from my perspective. The performance seemed to take away from the film far more than it contributed.Overall, with all the hype of it being a film about 9-11, Oliver Stone as director and all else thats been said and mentioned about this film, I'm 'very' glad I went to experience it.They were not gratuitous by trying to play solely on your emotions about 9-11. No, it's about the true story and events surrounding mostly, two men of courage and they're experience on that horrific day, sprinkled just enough with the event that did take place.This film ran us through the emotional coaster on most every facet while entertaining us, educating us and letting us share in other peoples experience while reminding us again of our own.Oliver Stone... no matter what anyone says, you did a justice to this story and very well told in my opinion. Very good job.GO SEE THIS FILM. You'll be moved, entertained and affected for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Taut, straightforward, uplifting, and heartfelt","World Trade Center does an excellent job of allowing us to see and feel the harrowing details over 24 hours of a Port Authority Police First Response team and the subsequent efforts to extricate its survivors. The effects on families and co-workers are also absorbingly realized. The pacing is excellent and music and camera angles keep us focused and are never intrusive. Only backdrop events immediately pertinent to the team and the rescue efforts are shown. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Michael Pena a standout. I am not a huge Nicholas Cage fan, but he was so good that while watching the film, I continually thought of him as Sgt. John McLoughlin and not as Nicholas Cage. For me, that is a high compliment indeed. Gregory Jbarra and Maggie Gyllenhall also deliver memorable performances. The only performance that bothered me slightly was Donna Bello's affectations as Cage's wife, but she probably had one of the film's more difficult roles in trying to balance her persona's natural reserve against the cataclysmic events of the day.Certainly, this is the tightest and least self-indulgent piece of film-making Oliver Stone has ever done. I defy anyone honest to find any indirect (certainly no direct) political statements being made here at all. This film is all about courage and valor in the most trying of circumstances. I recommend highly to all, most especially those who want to put the events of the day behind them as I believe they will find this movie to be a cathartic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A film based on a true story of survival.,"I was truly touched by this film. I was given goosebumps throughout the whole movie, as well as many tears.Moved and touched are probably the two best words to describe my feelings when i was watching the movie, and stunned is probably the best word to describe what I am feeling now (I just watched the movie about an hour ago).Even though the movie is more about the stories of two heroes that made the decision of a lifetime, and less about the actual events, I thought it was the perfect combination of both. If it was anymore about the actual events, I would have felt like I was viewing a documentary.Although Nicolas Cage is a more well-known actor and probably received more headlines and credit as the star of the movie, I truly believe that Michael Pena stood out in his best film yet, and truly put his heart and soul into this movie.At the end, the feeling you may feel is indescribable, and if you listen to what Cage has to say at the end, you can really realize what's important in life.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very Tasteful and Moving,"I was not sure what to expect from a movie that was born from one of the biggest tragedies in American history; however, I was very pleasantly surprise to find that this movie was exceptionally tasteful and very moving. I thought Oliver Stone did an exquisite job of taking the human element of caring for one another and banding together as Americans in times of perilous crisis and making that the main focus of this movie. This was not what I had anticipated. After being 10 minutes into the film, I totally forgot that Nicolas Cage was Nicolas Cage playing a part and not one of PAPD's finest. At the end, I felt compelled to want to meet these two very brave men that nearly died. I found it very interesting how Oliver Stone was able to ""thumb his nose"" at the parties responsible for the devastation by not giving them one once of real credit or validation. I also came out of the movie with a renewed since of respect for him on how he weaved actual pieces of the news related to the attacks into the movie to help tell the story. I cannot find one bad thing to say about this movie and I feel that Oliver Stone definitely did that awful day justice in the making of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Closest thing I've ever come to a tear-jerker,"I don't cry at movies. Never have, and I doubt I ever will. This movie was no different, but you can bet I was on the verge of getting the sniffles. This film doesn't have an omniscient view of the tragedy we all know too well, but rather focuses on individual views, making it seem much more realistic and as if you're actually there. For example, the trapped officers don't even know the buildings have collapsed because, hello, they're been pinned by rubble for hours on end, terrified. The pain on the screen becomes your pain, both when Nicholas Cage is being crushed by several tons of cement but also when his wife bursts into tears while she waits in a nearby hospital. Every American should see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade Center is the best Sept. 11 film in history.,"In the day of Sept. 11, Oliver Stone could be the only director who could display such an astonishing film. No one else could direct a film at this magnitude. If you have not seen this film, go see it. You have to. New York City will never be the same. Or go watch Untied 93. But I recommend WTC. It is so better than Greengrass'es United 93. I liked it. Probably you would to. No one has said to me, yet, that this film was super horrible, or a piece of trash. But no one has told me it was bad either. Even Steven Spielberg would do a terrible job at directing a film like this.

World Trade Centre,"For the first ten minutes of the film, I had goosebumps. That, in itself speaks volumes about this film. I know there have been debates over whether it was too soon to make this film, but is there ever a right time to make a motion picture about such a tragic event? In this day and age of suicide bombings and terror attacks on our world, this film represents a pinnacle of hope in the darkness of terror. I found the film made in a sensitive, thoughtful way that didn't ask for the sympathy of the world and didn't over dramatise the event either. Yes, it focused mainly on the two PAPD officers and their families, but that doesn't mean to say that the audience don't know that there were thousands of people killed and injured. It was their story, their true life telling of the events that happened to them that day. World Trade Centre is a beautiful film that will surely inspire every person who sees it. Anyone who has visited Manhattan, before or since the tragic events, will find something in the film that is personal to them, whether it be a landmark they have visited or a photo they have taken there. Also, the fact that Nicholas Cage gave the money he earnt to charity shows that this film was not made for money, but to show that, even in it's darkest hour, Americans failed to give up. It gives a whole new meaning to the national anthem and a deep poignancy to the line The land of the free and the home of the brave.",10.0,Anonymous,History

beautifully non-exploitative,"I was truly impressed by the film. It was exceptionally tasteful and done on a small scale, it's the story of these two men and their families, and the men who saved them. Not of 9/11 or the attack on America, or terrorism, just what happened to these individuals, told on an individual scale. I understand why some critics said it was slow in places, but I think it needed to be for the sake of being true to the story. You know it felt a lot slower to the two men trapped in that rubble. It was not over-dramatized, there was no tearjerking, no emotional manipulation. It's just a straightforward story of what happened to these individuals.I appreciated the fact that there was no footage of the planes hitting the towers, and no political commentary. We all know what happened on 9/11 on the large scale. It's the individual stories that should be shared, and this movie does just that for two men.And the fact that, unlike the conjecture of United 93, it's entirely true, and the people who survived signed off on everything in the film made it well worth my time.The only problem with it is that as I get older, I get more claustrophobic, and at first I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to keep watching, imagining the sheer panic I would feel in their shoes. I was sick to my stomach for a bit. But I took deep breaths and told myself that these men really survived this, and they deserved to have me hear their story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
good movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it a lot, but it was really sad. I think that it should be seen by all. I gave it an 8 rating because the filming is very dark, and sometimes you cannot see their faces. You can't see where they are located and it seems the they just barely lit the set. You can't tell if the are bleeding or crying. Sometimes you cannot tell what is going on. That is the only thing that I didn't like about the movie, other than that, I really liked it. It is a sad movie, so if you are sad, then don't watch it because you will get even more sad. The acting in the movie was very believable. You cannot even tell that it is staged until you actually think about it. Nicholas Cage was good and so were his co-stars. The graphics were terrific, and it didn't even seem as if it was fake. It seemed very realistic. I liked this movie also because it makes you think about what actually happened on September 11.

Best movie I have seen in a long time,"I didn't see this movie when it first came out. I just saw it for the first time on In-Demand last night. I was expecting something quite different from what it turned out to be. I expected an overly long, confusing, politically bent movie about 911. Instead, I was moved to tears by the end of this film. Oliver should be very proud of his work here, as should be the entire cast and crew. This movie was more like the great works of the past, when movies had a point, when they could keep your attention, and when they made you think.The acting is top notch, the best thing I have seen Cage do in a long time. I was getting tired of the uber violent roles he had been playing. He is an excellent actor when given a great script such as this. The same is true of all the characters in this film. Nice work.The special effects are held to a minimum, because this is a story about survival and heroes. What effects there are though, are mind boggling. The recreation of the towers falling is excellent. The editing is smart and tight.I have read many comments here that say the film was over emotional. That's the whole point of this movie - to portray the wide range of emotions that were created by 911. How many of us cried that day? Or became extremely angry that day? Imagine the pain the families of those that were in the world trade center that day, had to endure, not knowing whether their love ones were alive or dead. At the same time, it felt like the whole world was going mad around them. Too emotional? you have to be kidding, right? To sum it all up, this is now my favorite Oliver Stone film, and one of my favorite movies of the past decade. There are not many keepers coming out of Hollywood these days, but this is proof that they can still make an excellent film when they want to.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"Quite honestly... one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. One should watch it with an open mind and not some artsy Hollywood perspective. The one thing that separates this film from all the others is that it is true. Even the movie industry can not make up a story such as what happened on September 11th. The cinematography really puts everything into perspective and allows all to remember exactly what they were doing that day when the tragic events took place. This movie, in my opinion, was not made for awards or good reviews. This film was made to renew the passion for America that we all had in those days that followed 9/11. The exact events that took place that day may one day become a distant memory, but the feelings we all felt shall always remain the same. Five years have passed since that horrific day and many American's have forgot how they felt after watching plane after plane lay a dent onto our country, not to mention the hundreds of passengers that boarded those planes.

One of the best of the year,"Don't listen to the America-haters here. I despise George Bush and everything about his war. But this film is not about him or his policies. It's about the human spirit. All the bashers of this film fail to see what an amazing recreation of that day this really is. Those who say Stone used stock footage are wrong too. The CGI stuff here looks flawless. I worked at the Trade Center back in the 90s when the first attack took place. Stone and his team did an amazing job of making it all look so real. Details in the mall at the base of the towers, the concourse, and the street scenes all looked so real. Take politics out of your head when you see this and you'll be in awe. Maybe living and working in and around NYC gives you another perspective on this film. Don't forget that this is IMDb,where Scary Movie 3 nearly scores a 6. Listen to the real critics on this one, not to those who can barely write a sentence in intelligible English.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Shame about the title . . .,"Director Oliver Stone could have been a politician: his is the happy knack of saying one thing and doing another. He thinks of himself as a liberal yet seems to endorse right wing values by design or omission. Historical accuracy has never stood in his way of good drama. That, with a semi-documentary style and archival footage, has helped him become one of the great re-programmers of popular memory.It was with some ill-ease that I sat down to watch World Trade Center, knowing that the feelings of millions of Americans could be touched like a raw nerve. Producing a near-definitive account or 9/11 that would satisfy the traumatised emotions of widely differing sections of the public seems a mammoth task - producing an Oliver Stone account could end up worse than pouring petrol on a car crash.To Stone's, he has taken a novel approach - that of finding goodness in stories of courage and self-sacrifice. He avoids the blame-game, the politics fraught with potholes, and the unenviable task of giving an overall view of what happened. He also nearly - if not quite - manages to avoid political bias that could lower the tone of the film one way or the other. He focuses on the experiences and emotional journey of two Port Authority Policemen who are half-buried in the rubble and, most significantly, that of their families. Script is based largely on accounts from real-life counterparts. On that day, those people had no knowledge of who committed the atrocity leading to the collapse of the World Trade Center. They had no knowledge of the almost three thousand people that had been killed (although the statistics are mentioned in the closing credits). The women didn't even know which hospital their husbands would be taken to or if they had got out alive.Scenes of panic, chaos and emotional desperation are skilfully re-enacted. Nicholas Cage, who so often is woefully miscast, here shines at what he is good at - portraying desolation and near-hopelessness. Barely having begun the evacuation attempt, Cage and a volunteer policeman are caught up in the collapse and trapped. Maggie Gyllenhaal, as his colleague's wife, responds with a controlled hysteria that had me reaching for a handkerchief. Then begins the long slog to find dig the two men out.With such a slim story - people buried beneath a collapsed building who have to be burrowed out - Stone does an excellent job of maintaining tension and momentum throughout two hours plus. World Trade Center is a moving story told with an air of realism. So why has the film attracted considerable negative press? The first reason is the title. This film is not about the World Trade Center. It is not even about the terrorist attack that claimed so many lives that day. It is about the personal experience of two families whose husbands are trapped, and 9/11 is merely a backdrop against which the story is set. We see courage and dedication, and the bonds of love that, in different ways, are the most important things in life. Yet the title, coming as it does to herald the first major blockbuster set on that day, raises expectations of a definitive version of events, of the collapse of the World Trade Center, of the thousands killed. Such a title was a little short of lunacy. Stone makes us expect one thing and gives us another. In ten years time, it will be a better film: just now, very few people want to 'feel good' thinking about 9/11. The film goes beyond the horrors of that fateful day to the goodness at the core of individual hearts. But for a nation still in mourning, it hardly replaces a wake.The second problem with it is that if Stone almost managed to remain unpolitical the emphasis is on 'almost'. One of the symptoms of grief is anger. In the midst of the chaos, Bello rails against the desk sergeant who has first told her that her husband has walked out of the wreckage alive - only to correct it later and say he is still buried. We can see it was not the desk sergeant's fault. It is easy to connect that up later to a marine who says, ""We're gonna need some good men out there to avenge this."" Put that with the (later) knowledge that Iraq, for instance, had no part in the terrorist act. The early morning shots of New York, as Cage gets up for work, include a fleeting glimpse the Statue of Liberty, beautiful in the early morning light, and the sound of a radio presenter saying, ""the polls are now open."" More observation than bias, but such musings would have been better left out.As a non-American, I began to appreciate better the outpouring of emotion that has traumatised that nation. It was suddenly easier to see how America rallied around the President (even a bad one), because at times of stress you go with the leader you've got. Watching the wives have their guts ripped out with worry brought tears streaming down my face. I didn't think (as many Americans would) of all the people that 'weren't represented' in the film - I had already accepted that the film was only about these two individuals and their families - but I did imagine how every person in America would have been able to identify in a very traumatic way with the disaster. Telling the story from the women's point of view was a masterstroke.""It is about America in many ways, but ultimately it is a larger story about the human heart and survival that everyone should be able to relate to,"" says Stone. In wanting to bring something good out of the tragedy, it is tragic that he only nearly succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A human drama, not a political one.","Some months ago, I participated in some of the message board discussions of this film without having seen more than clips from it. Some of the boards had rather pointed political opinions, and I took part in some opinionated discussions. I believe that was wrong not because of my stated views, but because this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with the politics of the new millennium's world order.Whatever one's opinions of Oliver Stone's political and militaristic views, or of the Bush administration or our current involvements in Iraq and Afganistan, in all fairness this movie has nothing to do with any of that. The plot of this film could have happened in any fictional setting, or in a million other situations in world history, but it happened to take place on Sept. 11, 2001 in New York City, to two particular individuals and to their families.Yes, there are certain inaccuracies in the details of the events as they unfolded, and there are certain gratuitous sops thrown to Catholicism and to the USMC, but those are not things for which this movie should be derided.""World Trade Center"" is masterful film making. The characters are well developed, completely identifiable, and the situations are true to life.

It is about the human drama of the men and women who where trapped and put in life's jeopardy on that terrible day.This is a wonderfully moving film.

"Not a Great Film, but not meant to be a Great Film.","As a movie I admit it wasn't very entertaining at all. To be a good film, a movie has to have substance. Something that keeps you watching and wanting to watch it again. World Trade Center failed to do that.What it does do is allow you to re-live this horrific moment in history exactly as it happened. September 11 was not in anyway entertaining, just like this film. It also gives you a different view, that at least I didn't see on September 11th. I didn't lose anyone close to me on that day, but as a human, I was very angered and embittered by what had happened. This film brought me into the hearts and minds of the people that did lose someone important to them.Watching Nicholas Cage (John McLoughlin) and Michael Pena (Will Jimeno) reminiscing about their families and who they would miss made me cry. When I watch any film I always wind up relating to the characters in someway. I thought of myself in the same predicament, I thought of my baby brother and I started to cry.It allowed me to understand the pain and anguish these people suffered. Something I knew but was never able to feel. That's where this film succeeds, but I don't know if that makes it a good film. It seemed like a trip through someone's heart and mind.

I was curious to see how he intended on doing that with a movie of this nature. I was surprised but not disappointed when I saw that none of the Stone trademarks were in this movie, sort of how I felt when I saw Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" earlier in the year. The filming the plot and the acting was great and on point. Compare this to ""United 93"" or ""Farrenheit 9/11"" this is nothing you're going to expect. I loved the movie so much, that I saw it two days later....Hats off. Oliver Stone is the man",10.0,Anonymous,History
This is the only 9-11 film we need!!! Thank you Oliver Stone,"""This movie makes a mockery of the attacks on Sept. 11 by squishing them into the most tired, toothless disaster-movie/family-values framework available to mankind. It is not about the attacks in any sense other than that the planes in NY serve as the movie's premise. The movie itself is simply a (long) longing for heroic spirit: every single character is as pure and un-nuanced as the most unimaginative American mind could possibly make them. It is a hymn to the ever-yearned-for triumph of the human spirit, marriage and, apparently, to Christianity, as only Jesus, a wife, and at least two children appear to be worth living for in this world. Oliver Stone is not half, not even a tenth of the man he used to be: this is a shameful, simple-minded work""The person who wrote this in no way represents this movie. Did you realize that it was written based on the ACTUAL PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES? With your disdain for marriage, children etc. I doubt that you would have survived five minutes in their situation.Personally I found the film to be quite touching and a very respectful telling of these people's personal horror. It is NOT a film about September 11th or about the World Trade Center. It is about two Port Authority Police Officers and their families. Best Oliver Stone film since Nixon.",9.0,Anonymous,History
World Trade Center,This is a great movie. Oliver Stone does not waste time having us get to know the characters he rather throws them into the nightmare of 9/11 right away. After this he then goes into the character's past and how that affects their will to survive. He keeps the story very entertaining through out. He never shows the planes hit the buildings nor does he show the buildings collapse. You see the events of 9/11 throw the eyes of the two police men and their family members. I believe that this is a well acted film probably the best that Nick Cage has ever done. It is not a violent as this years earlier 9/11 film United 93 but it still conveys the message of heroism by regular Americans on this day of days. Both this film and United 93 have to be my favorite films this year so far and i believe both can be nominated for best picture. This is a very good film probably Stone's best work yet.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful Film,"I just got back from seeing this and it was a very emotional and powerful film that was well directed, acted, edited, scored, and written. I'm very sad right now though. It was hard to watch at times especially in the beginning. It's really scary and intense. I know some people say it's too soon, and I can understand that. I can also understand those who condemn the film business for making a movie about such a horrible tragedy. However, this movie doesn't turn 9/11 into a Hollywood story. It doesn't make it more than what it really was. I'm not going to say that it was completely realistic and everything about it was true to the story, but it certainly does a great job. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena aren't McLoughlin or Jimeno, but they did portray those emotions those two went through in a way that can give us all a little taste of what those two experienced. And what makes the movie so great is that its only job is to tell the story of these two people. It doesn't try to cover all of the stories of that day. Oliver Stone and the cast made this a personal film that the audience will connect with and feel for. The film was painful, sad, hopeful, scary, and powerful.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done...,"1st watched 3/13/2009  9 out of 10(Dir-Oliver Stone): Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done accounting of the personal perspective of two New York cops during the 9-11 disaster. The story is a personal account directly from these individuals and is not intended to be an exhaustive account of the incident and why it happened etc.. This is a little different type of movie for Oliver Stone but he executes it flawlessly. We see how they got involved, John McLaughlin(played by Nicolas Cage in a wonderful downplayed performance), is a Sargeant in the group that goes to the towers to help evacuate the buildings. Will Jimenez, played by Michael Pena, is one of the crew who volunteers to go with John into the lobby between the towers and assist with the goal further putting himself into danger. They get trapped when one of the buildings go down as they jump into the elevator shaft(since it's supposed one of the strongest parts of the building). The rest of the movie revolves around their survival as they humor and get to know one another despite their horrible circumstances. We then jump to scenes with the rescuers and each of the families. This is a personal story despite the grand scale of the event and is done with integrity by all involved. Oliver Stone proves he doesn't have to create a controversy to make a good movie, and this is exactly what he's done here -- except, I dare say, it's a great movie in my opinion that should have gotten more accolades than it did.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Must See!,"I know Andrea Berloff, friend of the family, and was able to see the sneak peak event for this movie --It was Wonderful a MUST SEE!She did a amazing job writing this and the movie was very emotional and excellent with amazing sound effects and real background noise really got me going!!Acting was very well done with Cage doing a super job and playing his part to the tee. I can see this movie going for several awards and hopefully will Win some! :) maybe ill be there at the table (I wish)Support Andrea and help get her career off the ground!I would say more but just go out and see it!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Oliver Stone Film Ever!,"In the 21 years since I've came to Florida, I Have saw a film that is the most emotional and possibly the best oliver stone film I Have ever seen since Platoon, it's called world trade center, the story as you already know is about the September 11th attacks that has really change the world and turn into darkness, as police officers risk as they can to save others from attacks, Nicolas Cage who was so good in leaving las vegas 11 years ago deserves another Oscar nomination for the role, and the rest is perfect as well, director oliver stone who recovered from such pieces of junk over the years after the film JFK, Succeeds here in this one, this is not only the best film of this year, this is one of the best films I've have ever seen in a long time, in a summer of silly movies, explosions and many other things, this is the best summer movie so far.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome Job,"Besides the obvious interest I went to see this movie for one reason because of Nick Cage and another because of Oliver Stone.I was not disappointed at all. Mr. Stone did a great job bringing the emotion of this country back from some five years ago as if it was really yesterday. Mr. Cage was more believable in his role than I can remember. Although the acting was extremely limited to the confinement of the collapse of the buildings, he did a fine job of showing what had to be a gut wrenching experience for the victim. For that matter the supporting roles played by the wives and rescuers kept me intently involved the full length of the movie.I don't think I've ever seen a movie that affected me like this one. I grieved all over again about 9/11. From the first sign of the walking wounded it tugged deeply at my emotions and just never let go. At the end of the movie as they say the silence was deafening. I literally had to pull myself together before I could walk away.I just kept thinking, this is ""happy ending"" part of this terrible event. If you knew me you would know I don't react this way about much but I got to say if your blood is true blue American in your veins, be prepared to be moved. Oliver stone should be proud of this one, by far.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Clear Depiction of A Bleak Day,"World Trade Center is the best portrayal of that day in September 2001 that no American alive on that day will ever forget. It is a film that will remind every person of the tragedy that befell on us all that day, yet also reminds us of the unity that came from such a horrific experience. Oliver Stone has done an outstanding job showing the world what amazing people we have in this great nation serving us to protect humanity and freedom. This movie tells the story of good battling evil, and depicts the rescue attempts that put the lives of thousands on the line. If you are skeptical of this film, rest assured that is is definitely worth your time and money to see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A View of disaster from within!,"Regardless of what you thought about oliver stones last film, Alexander, you cant deny the man has a passion for history. Just take a look at most of his films, and you can see history through his camera lens unfolding. Weather it be truthful history, or the Hollywood version of history, you cant say that the man doesn't capture the essence of the event.And thats what happens in his latest, World trade center. Stone puts you in the middle of the event as seen through the eyes of 2 PAPD cops on 9/11 and the hell they and there family went through. We witness from within, the collapse of the world trade center towers, although not seen, but felt, from the very center of the collapse. You get a taste of what it was like for these men trapped within the rubble, and get an idea of the living hell they went through.When viewed, its amazing how they managed to survive not only the first collapse, but the 2th towers collapse, then later building number 7. As if that wasn't enough, they had to deal with shifting debris, which threaten to come down on the few inches of room they had, fire that fell right beside them, unbearable pain, exhaustion, and even a gun going off within the rubble due to the bullets overheating. Bad enough they are trapped under god knows how many feet of rubble in pain, but they were almost shot by a freak occurrence! Truly, they were in hell.Overall the film is well done, respectful, and tasteful. I, being a new yorker myself, wasn't at all offended by anything that happened in the film. Of course, to be honest i did not loose anyone i knew or loved in 9/11, so of course, i cant speak for those who did.Overall, a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A great piece of the 9/11 puzzle,"There are thousands of stories that happened on 9/11, this is one of them. The story about two PAPD officers and their families on 9/11 and 9/12. I was at the WTC from 9/11 to 9/18 and feared that the movie would not be able to accurately represent the conditions at Ground Zero, however the movie had amazing detail, and I found very few factual errors. The movie did an excellent job of depicting many facets of NYC on 9/11. The movie also did a commendable job of presenting the horror of the incident without an excess of blood and gore.This movie will probably not be the defining movie of 9/11 but it will most likely be one of the better 9/11 movies. We are approaching the 5 year anniversary of 9/11/01 and movies of one of the major events of our lifetime need to be made.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Honest, Awesome & Vastly Moving Experience","Actually, for me WTC was a deeply moving love story (or series of love stories)between husbands and wives, families and friends. This is not only its strength but its supreme victory, along with its honesty. Just as the horrifying TITANIC - with whom WTC's sobering yet incredible special effects compares favorably - found its strength in its love story, so does WTC in its love stories. Except that WTC's people are actually real, and from what I've read, their stories are not only honest but are told exactly the way the events really unfolded. Nicolas Cage was a revelation, as was this incarnation of Oliver Stone, who's reached a David Lean-level of maturity. My prediction: (easily) the Best Picture of 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,History
best picture of the year,"i first would like to say that oliver stone is one great director, the problem is mainstream people cannot accept the face that he has his own vision, Alexander was a brilliant film, and world trade center was no different, by the way oliver stone was in Vietnam and got a silver star, so everyone who gets all upset about what he thinks politicly well he was there and you were not, he has the right to say his piece because he fought for this country , as for world trade center it was directed perfect, the sound acting and cinematography were amazing, he totally captured what that horrific day was like, through the eyes of those police officers, the movie did not need to show how the planes hit the buildings and all the mayhem outside, we have seen that view a thousand times on the news, the movie was shot from the eyes of the actors cage and pena which was perfect, i could go on and on about this film but stone did an amazing job on how this was directed, even though it was a Hollywood made film, it was not your typical Hollywood film, other directors would have made this a lame action blockbuster, stone made it a real authentic heart felt powerful drama as it should have been, 9 out of 10 stars for me. your the best oliver",9.0,Anonymous,History
A classic for the ages,"I just saw World Trade Center. Oliver Stone redeems any past bungles with this film, which is superb in almost every aspect: directing, editing, sound, script, acting and cinematography. Some of the scenes would seem corny, but then it hits you that this shi_t really went down- and you remember how people we know act in real life situations- and you move on. It would seem a slam-dunk that any fairly well-conceived, big-budget movie to come out on this subject would garner several Academy Award nominations- just for making it to the big screen; but this movie is handled exquisitely in so many ways that it overcomes any lines of thought in that direction. This is the film of the year so far, and right up there with the best of them. My one criticism: Lots of product placement- unnecessary and almost distracting: Office Max, CVS, etc. Do studios really need to make money that way?

World Trade Center-Film that Had to Be Made Succeeds ****,"Outstanding Oliver Stone film dealing with the disaster of all times in the U.S.- September 11, 2001.The film basically deals with 2 police officers who are trapped in the rubble of the Trade Center. It deals with their thoughts as they try to keep each other from falling into a permanent sleep. While this is going on, we witness what their wives and respective families are going through.Nicolas Cage is excellent as the trapped police sergeant.This is far more than the usual disaster film.

Not your typical OS film...,"I am not an Oliver Stone fan. With the exception of Platoon, I feel most of his films seem to be on steroids. World Trade Center is an exception and I would strongly recommend the movie. First, it is very apolitical, no finger pointing blame or contrived controversy. Also, it lacks the typical Oliver Stone hype and glitz, though I suspect some distortions of truth exist that are found in nearly every historical film. A small disappointment to me was there was not more footage inside the WTC before the towers collapsed. The graphic scenes of blood and gore you might imagine are minimal, that's not what this film is about. This film is about family and honor and the struggle to preserve life.",8.0,Anonymous,History
very heart breaking film,this is a real heart breaking film a real tribute to those who died doing their jobs on September eleven two thousand and one. A living tribute to the 343 New York City Firefighters who gave their lives in thew line of duty and to the police and E.M.S. personnel who lost their lives in the line of duty to their country and city. i do not know how any one could bad mouth this movie if they do they have no heart or soul i think the kids ought to be made to see this movie regardless of the distributing nature of the film we as a nation need to never for get the the events of 9/11/01 and the men women and children who were effected by those events.

9/11 Film is Right On!,"""Wow!"" Was all I was thinking as I left the theater after viewing ""World Trade Center"". Many people were thinking it is still too early after the actual events of 9/11 to make a film about it. But I think it is something that needs to be remembered, and to remind many of us why we are at war in the first place. Director Oliver Stone-notorious for many anti-war films-shocked me with his portrayal of the events, not only did he deal with it with sensitivity, but he also didn't take any ""Hollywood liberties"" with the film. Neither did he lean to either political side, if anything he leaned more to a conservative view. What? Oliver Stone?! You left the theater with a feeling of hope and a renewed sense of why we are at war. I applaud you Mr. Stone.""World Trade Center"" centers on real life police officer John McLoughlin and his fellow officers as they enter the buildings to get everyone out after they were hit. But they are caught in the rubble as the buildings collapse, and must await rescue they don't think will come. But an ex-marine feels drawn there by God, and starts a rescue search even when told he couldn't. He later enlists back into the marines as he says, ""Someone needs to avenge this."" He couldn't be more right.The acting is extremely realistic especially by Nicolas Cage as the main character. And for those worried that this film will reopen old wounds, don't fret. Like I said, Mr. Stone treats every aspect of this movie with great respect and sensitivity. He even got consent from every one of the police officers and their families. The film ends with a voice-over that tells the audience that even though the events were horrible, it brought out the best in everyone as they put their lives on the line to rescue others. And that's what needs to be seen. ""World Trade Center"" is rated PG-13 for intense and emotional content, some disturbing images and language.Brian Ledtke, 16, lives in Thomas Township.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Do NOT miss this movie.,"This movie was absolutely amazing.Acting by the two leads Cage and Peña was very believable and tear-jerking. The movie itself was very cleverly made, despite some of the goofs within the film (many have noticed cars and advertisements that were introduced AFTER 9/11) - for example, even at the start police cars have dents in them (looking more realistic) and hardly any special effects were used.A gripping movie that will make you cry (it certainly made me cry and jump right out of my seat in some scenes!). I was 11 when the towers were hit so I didn't really take too much notice, being young. But now I realise what an impact this had upon America. My heart went out to everyone during that film.This is definitely a must-see. But not for the faint-hearted - this movie is very, VERY emotional.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible! Intense! Inspiring!,"I live in NYC. Several people that I know who haven't seen the film express hesitancy in seeing it for concerns about reliving the horrors of that day, especially those that were in Manhattan at the time. I am quick to point out to them that this film, on the contrary, is a story of courage and determination. It is inspiring in that many of us are not personally acquainted with the story of these two Port Authority officers and the heroic Marine who was instrumental in rescuing them. I was riveted by this film.The film was clearly produced with keen attention to sensitivity and reality. I was impressed by the film being shown without previews of other films and without credits in the beginning. Furthermore, it was very respectful of the filmmakers to first list the names of the Port Authority officers who perished on that day, at the end of the film, before the usual credits.I feel fortunate to have seen this excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
